            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>IN thoſe days when Aſtolpho, ſurnamed the Proud, beheld his regal ſway extend over the rich and fertile plains of Lombardy, the name of Roderic the Hardy was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to fame. He had fought the battles of the empire; and an almoſt uninterrupted ſeries of ſucceſs had crowned his arms. He had acquired immortal honour to himſelf, and a vaſt acceſſion of territory to his maſter; but wholly trained in the field of war, and little ſkilled in the cabals of a court, he found, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a life almoſt exhauſtedin the painful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of glory, the ſmiles of the king's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance withrawn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028486_0003_0FD922E0B3EB0FB8"/>
He no ſooner witneſſed the dangerous gloom which began to thicken around him, than he prepared to purſue thoſe ſteps which were moſt likely to conduce to his ſafety, and lead him to an aſylum in which he might, in all probability, find a ſhelter from the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorm. He retired, then, while it was yet ſafe to retire from the capital, and ſought a caſtle of his own near the frontiers of a lately conquered province—a retreat, in which the bolts of Aſtolpho's wrath were but little likely to reach him. To this retirement he ſummoned an only ſon, whom he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in the army, and who, though but a young ſoldier, had already acquired a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fame little inferior to that of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>This ſon, who was called Rhinaldo, had been, during the intervals which occurred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each campaign, much reſident at court and in the palace of Aſtolpho firſt beheld the lady Iſabel, the daughter of the late king, and loved her. It would have been difficult indeed for a young man of the coldeſt heart to behold her without emotion. In her dark eyes were mingled all the fire of genius with all the ſoftneſs of ſenſibility; on her animated countenance ſate blended majeſty and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; on her brow was pictured commanding beauty; in her ſmile the moſt winning ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; her ſhape was faultleſs, and her demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028486_0004_0FD922E394D45238"/>
artleſs and graceful; nor was Iſabel blind to the merits of the young ſoldier—a perſon the very ſtandard of manly beauty—a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, where every virtue of his heart was pourtrayed—a cultivated mind—a high and unſpotted reputation, did not eſcape the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the lady Iſabel. They had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities of converſing, and of thoſe opportunities a mutual paſſion was the reſult.</p>
                     <p>The reſentment of Aſtolpho became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, when he heard of Count Roderic's retreat; and the very day after Rhinaldo had, in obedience to his father's mandates, quitted the army to join him in his retirement, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders arrived at the camp to ſupercede him in his command, and cauſe him to be conveyed cloſe priſoner to the capital.</p>
                     <p>Theſe orders had, indeed, been preceded by a letter from the lady Iſabel, warning Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo of the danger which threatened him;—a letter, rendered not more dear to Rhinaldo by the noble proof it contained, than by the tender vows it breathed, of inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>In the retirement which his father had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, Rhinaldo paſſed many melancholy hours in meditating on his beloved but abſent Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. In vain did Count Roderic endeavour to divert his thoughts from the ceaſeleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028486_0005_0FD922E598FDB098"/>
of their attention, by diſſertations on that ſcience in which this beloved ſon had, from the earlieſt period of life, been his pupil, and in which they had both gained ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of renown. In vain did he encourage, among his men at arms, (for he carried into retirement with him a retinue, which cauſed no little jealouſy at court) thoſe martial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes for their courage and dexterity in which the men of that age were renowned. In vain did the court of the caſtle echo daily with the ſound of the trumpet.—In vain were the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſeen waving above the battlements. That heart which had ſo often leaped at the ſound of martial muſic, which owned no charms but thoſe which blazed in the front of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battled hoſt, now ſhrunk from what it deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a tedious mockery, and ſought to indulge its feelings amid the luxury of the moſt gloomy, ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>A deep and devious foreſt, which flanked the caſtle to the ſouth, afforded this ſolitude, and thither did Rhinaldo daily repair to feaſt his imagination on the thouſand charms with which the image of his Iſabel was replete.—His father, who diſcovered his diſlike of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and probably in ſome meaſure gueſſed at the cauſe of it, forbore, at length, to reſtrain his inclination. They ſeldom met but at table, (from the taſteleſs feſtivity of which Rhmaldo retired as ſoon as decency would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028486_0006_0FD922EE1072DC78"/>
permit him) or at thoſe hours when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties of religion ſummoned them to the neighbouring convent.</p>
                     <p>At theſe duties Rhinaldo was ſo conſtant, and his attention to them was ſo rigid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deviating, that his father could not forbear entertaining ſome fears, that his melancholy would at length enroll him among the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the place. Nor were thoſe fears enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon light or frivolous grounds. The ſociety conſiſted of thirty perſons, who had all borne arms with a conſiderable degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The ſuperior was an old knight, who had led Roderic himſelf in the field, and had been his guide in the path of glory, though he was yet, from a youth, inured to toil, and an age foſtered by temperance, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and hardy. But the perſon, the charms of whoſe ſociety ſo frequently led the ſteps of Rhinaldo towards the convent, was an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, who had built his cell hard by, and whoſe diſpoſition, truly charitable, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him highly reſpected, as well by the monks themſelves, as by the ſcattered inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the neighbour-hood.</p>
                     <p>The convent of St. Julian was ſituate cloſe to Count Roderic's caſtle, on a bold and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding eminence.—Conſiſting chiefly of rock, it ſeemed ſcarcely capable of affording
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028486_0007_0FD922EF55A8C8D8"/>
nouriſhment to the numerous ſhrubs, whoſe twiſted roots ſeemed incorporated with it, and was acceſſible only by a winding path of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length. Steep, rugged and intricate, it was a taſk of conſiderable labour to gain the ſummit, whoſe pictureſque appearance, from the vale below, never failed to incite in the mind an ardent wiſh to attain it.</p>
                     <p>The flinty walls of the convent ſeemed to have their foundation in air, and its Gothic ſpires hung over the brow of the rock with an awful magnificence. It overlooked the caſtle. This, as the latter was a place of ſtrength, was a circumſtance of importance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme care was taken, on any proſpect of an attack, to ſecure, this poſt, and to afford it ample ſupplies.</p>
                     <p>Beneath a projecting part of the cliff, cloſe to the winding path already mentioned, and at no great diſtance from the ſummit, had the hermit, of whoſe ſociety young Rhinaldo was ſo fond, fixed his abode. His daily care during the period of his reſidence in that ſpot, when the duties of religion had been fulfilled, was to enlarge, amend, and decorate his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cell, till he had at length formed an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, which, for ſimple beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the thoughtleſs inhabitant of the gay world might envy him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:028486_0008_0FD922F0D7406C50"/>
To this retreat, then, did Rhinaldo fly from the cumberous magnificence of Count Roderic's eſtabliſhment. Here could he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate at leiſure on the virtues and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of his beloved Iſabel. Here too, (and it was that circumſtance which rendered the ſpot ſo dear to him) could he confide, without the dread of cold ſarcaſm, or harſh reproof, the tender ſecret of his heart. Father Anthony (for that was the hermit's name) was auſtere indeed towards himſelf, but, like the holy maſter, to whoſe ſervice he had now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted himſelf, he wept over the failings of others.</p>

                     <p>SOME months had now paſſed ſince Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo quitted his command to retire to the Caſtle of his father, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> viſits to the hermitage had grown daily more and more frequent, when one morning at the approach of dawn, he ordered the draw-bridge to be let down, and, attended only by one faithful ſervant, took the road which led to the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. They paſſed the day in tracing the thick and impervious foreſt which cloaths for many miles the ſouthern frontier of that kingdom and the ſhades of evening overtook them as they gained it's verge. The night ſet in with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028486_0009_0FD922F86EA5A680"/>
unwonted darkneſs, and the chill guſt, which began to howl from the north, foretold an approaching tempeſt. A few drops of thick rain fell—the darkneſs redoubled—the diſtant thunder began to growl—Rhinaldo gave his horſe the reins, and truſting to the ſagacity of this long-tried favourite for his ſafety, he proceeded at a ſlow pace, attended by his faithful ſervant, catching every now and then a glimpſe of the wild ſcence around, by the gleam of the lightning, which began to dart with almoſt unabating rapidity.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero (ſo was Rhinaldo's ſervant called) ſtopped his horſe ſuddenly, and called to his maſter; "ſurely, my lord," ſaid he, "by the flaſh of the lightning, I juſt now deſcried the walls of a manſion."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo ſtopped. Rugiero bade him look to the right, and between ſome tall trees he thought he perceived ſome riſing turrets. They turned their horſes, and made ſlowly and cautiouſly for the ſpot. As they drew near, they found that their ſurmiſes were true.—They purſued their route, and at length with conſiderable difficulty, arrived at the gate of an old manſion.</p>
                     <p>Like moſt of the ſeats of the nobility in the kingdom, it was ſurrounded by a maot. Rugiero alighted from his horſe, and ſlowly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028486_0010_0FD922FACA416D60"/>
began to trace the moat round, to diſcover, if poſſible, a bridge over which they might paſs, and at leaſt gain ſome ſhelter from the inclemency of the night. He had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded far, before he perceived, on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, a draw-bridge drawn up, which made him conjecture, that, diſolate as the building appeared, (for the walls were in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts overgrown with thick ivy, and bore every mark, as far as the liget would permit them to be diſcovered, of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) it was inhabited.</p>
                     <p>He began now to halloo as loud as he could, but with little probability, from the howling of the ſtorm, of making himſelf heard. He continued his progreſs along the margin of the moat, and Rhinaldo, having alighted from his horſe, ſlowly followed him.—They had not proceeded far, before the diſcovered that this outwork bore as ſtrong marks of decay as the reſt of the building, and that the raiſing the draw-bridge at night muſt be more a work of cuſtom than utility.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, by a very eaſy, but broken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, gained the moat, and boldly ſtepped into it. He found it very ſhallow, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending upon the ruins which had fallen from a low and crumbling wall on the other ſide, he gained the oppoſite bank. He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to give his maſter notice of this

cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and to conduct him over. Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo did not heſitate; taking his horſe in his hand, he followed his ſervant. The beaſts ſprung lightly from the ruins upon the crazy remains of this mouldring bulwark, and the travellers, paſſing ſlowly round the walls of the houſe, arrived at a large and lofty porch, over-hung with ivy, and midleg deep in the graſs, which grew through the crevices of the ſtones with which it had been paved. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſtened their horſes to a thorn which grew cloſe to one of the pillars, they retired to the extremity of the porch for ſhelter. This ſhelter, however, they did not find—the rain beat in upon them with violence.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo reſolved to try if the door was open. It was not improbable that it ſhould be ſo, even if the manſion were inhabited. In a place ſo deſolate, there is little fear of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers, and the moat and draw-bridge would probably render the domeſtics careleſs.—He raiſed a weighty latch, and putting his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt the door, it opened heavily; and Rhinaldo and his ſervant entered. Rhinaldo ſtill held the door in his hand, and firmly perſuaded, from every thing he had hitherto witneſſed, that the houſe was uninhabited, ordering Rugiero to conduct the horſes into the hall, where he determined to reſt for the night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028486_0012_0FD92304DB600A98"/>
Rugiero ſtrenuoſly adviſed him to learn firſt, whether the manſion were actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited or no; and with this advice, upon conſideration, he thought it beſt to comply. He hallooed aloud, but the ſtorm ſeemed to mock his efforts. He walked ſlowly acroſs the hall, but ſtopping ſuddenly, exclaimed, "Rugiero, are theſe your footſteps which I hear?" "No, my Lord," anſwered Rugiero, "I have not moved from this ſpot." "There is ſomebody," continued Rhinaldo, "aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a flight of ſtairs."</p>
                     <p>He now hallooed again; when a hoarſe voice, in a low tone, exclaimed, "peace, fool! are you fit to be truſted with a ſecret of ſuch importance?" Still all was dark; the ſound of the footſteps on the ſtaircaſe died gradually away, and left Rhinaldo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. "Stay here," ſaid he, after a pauſe, to Rugiero, "till I return,"</p>
                     <p>Rugiero remonſtrated, but his maſter was peremtory, and this attendant had ſtudied diſcipline in a camp. "I will be cautious," ſaid Rhinaldo, mildly, in order to ſoften the apprehenſions of his faithful ſervant. "At all events, your remaining here will ſecure us a retreat, ſhould any thing ſiniſter occur."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo now advanced, and tracing his way ſlowly and cautiouſly along the hall,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028486_0013_0FD92305D87DDA08"/>
reached at length the ſtaircaſe, from which the words, which ſo much awakened his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, had proceeded. He judged that this ſtaircaſe, though now ſomewhat crazy from age, had once been magnificent. It was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpacious. He had ſcarcely got half way up it, when he heard footſteps above him, as if of ſome perſon deſcending He ſtood mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, in hopes that, whoever it might be, from the ſize of the ſtaircaſe they would paſs without detecting him; for the myſtery of perſons thus moving in the dark perplexed him even more than the ſingular ſpeech he had heard, and he was more than ever anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to diſcover the cauſe of it. The foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps now ſeemed advancing towards him; he moved a pace to the right, in order to avoid a meeting, and placed himſelf juſt in the way of the perſon deſcending, who joſtled him. A voice immediately exclaimed, "Gaſpard, why do you not ſpeak? You muſt either bawl or be dumb—the houſe is locked in fleep—you may now ſtrike a light—meet me, ten minutes hence, in the refectory."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo was now divided what to do—when a light, the only one he had yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, gleaming dimly from the door of a chamber into a long gallery above, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to purſue his way up the ſtaircaſe. He proceeded lightly and cautiouſly. The

                        </gap> horſe furniture. The perſon he had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſed ſtrait to the end of the room, and Rhinaldo gained ſuch a hight on the ſtair caſe, as to ſee him ſhove back a pannel of the wainſcot which ſeemed artificially contrived for the purpoſe of concealment, and pulling a bunch of keys from his pocket, open a ſtrong maſſy door, plated with iron: he then deſcended a few ſteps, ſhutting it after him and Rhinaldo loſt ſight of him.</p>
                     <p>Perplexed at this circumſtance, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome paces towards the iron door. He liſtened, and thought he could hear the ſound of voices; but it was ſo indiſtinct, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he was left at laſt in doubt whether he had not been deceived; and recollecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

which paſſed on the ſtaircaſe, he reſolved to return and rejoin Rugiero, with whom perhaps he might diſcover what was to be perpetrated in the refectory. He grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his way down again, and at his poſt he found his ſervant, who the moment he came near him, graſped his hand, and bade him, in a low wiſper, be ſilent and watch.</p>
                     <p>They had not ſtood many minutes before they perceived a faint light gleam from an arch way on the oppoſite ſide of the hall, and two figures advancing ſlowly along a paſſage, one of whom carried a kind of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthorn. They perceived them to be men meanly dreſſed, and of the moſt unprepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing appearance; one particularly whoſe profuſion of coarſe, long, black hair, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſingly contraſted with the livid paleneſs of his countenance, excited Rhinaldo's attention.</p>
                     <p>In a hoarſe and diſſonant voice, but which Rhinaldo diſcovered to be the ſame which had addreſſed him on the ſtaircaſe, he exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, "Hark! I heard ſomething." "'Twas nothing but the wind," replied the other.—"Hiſt!" exclaimed the firſt, and pauſed; "where are the ſervants?" "Locked in ſleep," ſaid the other.—They now pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their light on a table juſt within the arch way, and the man who had ſpoke firſt, ſaid to the other, "why did not you anſwer me,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028486_0016_0FD9230D5BE835F8"/>
when I met you on the ſtaircaſe?" "when?" ſaid the other. "Juſt now—within theſe ten minutes." "I never met you—I have not been up ſtairs."—"Lyar!" exclaimed the firſt. "May I fall dead this inſtant," retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſecond, "if I have left the refectory. Hey! what ails you? you tremble." "No matter," exclaimed the firſt, in a faltering voice. "Give me the bottle." He took a ſmall wicker bottle from the other, and drank from it. It ſeemed to revive him. "Give me the lanthorn," ſaid he, "and the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger." He received from him the dark lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, and a dagger of ſome length, which he ſtuck in his girdle. "Shall you want me?'! aſked the ſecond man. "No," ſaid the firſt; "go—wait for my lord—we ſhall not want you, 'till the body is to be diſpoſed of."—"Mercy on us!" cried the ſecond, in an awful but tremulous tone. The firſt turned ſhort round upon him, muttered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between his teeth, and walked ſlowly acroſs the hall towards another paſſage, while the ſecond man moved towards the ſtaircaſe, which he aſcended.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo and Rugiero, with as little noiſe as poſſible, followed the firſt man; yet they could not proceed ſo ſilently, but that they cauſed him to turn round ſeveral times. The loudneſs of the ſtorm, however, deceived
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028486_0017_0FD92312F576D420"/>
him, and he continued to move forward, through a winding paſſage, 'till he ſtopped ſuddenly at a low arched door, which he opened with a key.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo drew his ſword, and ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to prevent his ſhutting it again. This, however, he did not attempt, and Rhinaldo gained the door, juſt as he had placed the lanthorn on the floor, in the middle of a ſmall vaulted room, and ſeemed occupied in thought. He ſtood with his arms folded, and his face turned towards Rhinaldo. Never was a countenance ſo ghaſtly and horrid. It betrayed a moſt diabolical agitation of mind. After ſtanding thus for a few ſeconds, he ſtooped down, and, feeling along the floor, laid hold of an iron ring, by which, after a few efforts, he pulled up a trap door, and diſcovered, by the gleam of the lanthorn, a broken flight of ſteps. He now took up the lanthorn in one hand, and holding the door with the other, began to deſcend. Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo ſaw that there was not a moment to be loſt. If this ruffian ſhould once get beneath the trap-door, the murder he meant to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate (and of his intention there could not remain a doubt) might be committed in ſafety. Impreſſed with this idea, he ſprung forward. The man turned round at the noiſe, and on the inſtant re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

very hilt in his breaſt. He fell into the vault, uttering a deep groan—the lanthorn was clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his hand—the trap-door fell into its place as he deſcended, and Rhinaldo, with Rugiero, who had juſt entered the room, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained involved in the moſt impenetrable darkneſs.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                     <p>ASTONISHED at this circumſtance, Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo pauſed for a few ſeconds; but recollecting that it was poſſible the light might not be extinguiſhed by the fall, he felt for the iron ring, and lifted the trap-door. His conjectures proved to be right—the lanthorn lay on the floor, claſped in the hand of the dead man—and the flame within it was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the horn. Rugiero picked it up, and having adjuſted the candle within it, began to ſurvey the vault into which they had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</p>
                     <p>It was narrow, long, and low; and at the end of it was a very ſmall arched door-way, and a door apparently very thick, and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ſecured with bolts and bars. Rugiero puſhed the door with his hand, and was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly alarmed by a deep groan from the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028486_0019_0FD9231722D45220"/>
place, whatever it might be, to which it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He had not time, however, to ruminate long on this circumſtance; his maſter called to him in a very low voice from the other end of the vault, and when he came near, made him a ſign to liſten; he did ſo, and heard diſtinctly the footſteps of a man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a haſty and agitated ſtep over their heads. Every now and then he pauſed, as if to liſten to ſomething; and after a few minutes, they heard exclaiming in a low tone "Fabian!"</p>
                     <p>This was repeated ſeveral times;—and Rhinaldo at length perceiving that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed towards the vault, anſwered in as hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a voice as he could aſſume, "Here!"</p>
                     <p>"Is it done?" exclaimed the unknown perſon from above. "It is," anſwered Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo. "'Tis well," reſumed the voice from above. "Convey the body into the vaulted room—lay it out on the table, and cover it with the mantle which I ſhall ſend you."—They then heard the ſteps of this perſon mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the door, and the ſound of them ſoon died away.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, who now grew more anxious than ever to diſcover this myſtery, took his reſolution on the ſpot, and, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

of Rugiero, ſtripping the doublet and cloak from the body of the man he had killed, he put them on, pulling his hair over his face, and diſguiſing himſelf as artfully as he could with the blood which ſtill flowed from the wound he had inflicted. He then put on Rugieros's hat, which being much plainer than his own, was well calculated to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional concealment to his countenance; and, within the aſſiſtance of this ſteady and faithful domeſtic, lifting the trap-door, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the body into the vaulted cham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſtretched it on the table as directed.</p>
                     <p>This done, they prepared to ſecure the meſſenger who ſhould be ſent with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and who they judged would prove the perſon they had before ſeen in company with the man who was ſlain. In order to effect this, Rugiero, drawing his ſword, placed himſelf cloſe to the door of the room, juſt within the portal, while his maſter ſtood at the front of the table, on which the body was placed, and ſo much in front of the lanthorn, which he had contrived ſhould throw but a dim gleam of light, that a perſon entering the room, could only diſtinguiſh the figure of a man, but was not enabled to diſcover who, or what he might be.</p>
                     <p>They had not waited on their poſt many
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028486_0021_0FD9232198183E50"/>
minutes before, as they had conjectured, the perſon they ſo lately ſaw entered the room, carrying the mantle on his ſhoulders. He walked ſtrait towards Rhinaldo, to whom he ſaid,—"Fabian! my Lord requires you to attend him at the head of the great ſtaircaſe."</p>
                     <p>He had ſcarcely uttered theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rugiero, advancing from the door, ſeized him by the collar, and Rhinaldo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, the fellow fell down ſpeechleſs with horror. They raiſed him immediately, and Rhinaldo warned him, that to utter a ſingle exclamation would prove fatal to him.—He fell on his knees, and in the moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt manner entreated him to ſpare his life. Rhinaldo told him that his ſafety wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on his conduct. <q>Diſguiſe nothing from us, ſaid he, and you have nothing to fear.</q>—<q>Sir, ſaid the trembling wretch, I will conceal nothing, but my Lord, by this time, waits for Fabian and myſelf, at the head of the great ſtaircaſe.</q> After a moment's pauſe, Rhinaldo ſaid, <q>I think I can truſt thee ſo far.

                     <p>He advanced ſlowly into the room, and beckening the lady, in a ſtern tone of voice ordered her to follow him.</p>
                     <p>"What more am I to ſuffer?" ſaid ſhe. "What farther ſcene of ſavage cruelty am I to witneſs?"</p>
                     <p>He beckened Rhinaldo and his companion into the room. The lady ſtarted wildly when ſhe ſaw them. "Nay," ſaid ſhe, "if I am to be murdered, perpetrate your crime on this ſpot."—Saying this, ſhe ſeized the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix; claſped it to her boſom, and fell on her
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028486_0024_0FD9232915C0C960"/>
knees before the book, which lay open on the table. The perſon who had cauſed this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm then took her under one arm, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſign to Rhinaldo to do the ſame by the other, ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be conducted, without a murmur, whitherſoever they ſhould chooſe, ſtill holding the crucifix in her hand.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, ſtruck with compaſſion at the ſituation of this lady, was repeatedly tempted to whiſper comfort in her ear; but he thought a premature diſcovery of his deſign might in all prabability baffle every attempt he might make to ſerve her; he therefore proceeded, holding her ſtill by the arm, 'till they gained the vaulted chamber, when the perſon who had conducted her to it thus addreſſed her: "Adultereſs!"—She raiſed herſelf from the arm of Rhinaldo. "Monſter!" ſaid ſhe, "at leaſt, ſpare my fame—thou knoweſt the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of that inſinuation."—"That mantle,"—ſaid he, pointing to that which lay over the body of Fabian, "was the work of your hands, and deſigned doubtleſs as a preſent to me." "Never,"—anſwered the lady,—"heaven knows.—They to whoſe power it was my lot to bow, knew too well that it was not deſigned for thee."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps," returned he, with an air of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028486_0025_0FD9232C1A332B28"/>
the moſt ſavage triumph, "it was deſigned for him who now wears it." At this the lady ſtarted—ſhe looked wild with apprehenſion and terror—ſhe advanced towards the table—ſhe claſped her hands together, and eagerly looked on the mantle—"It cannot be," ſaid ſhe—"you are not ſuch a monſter." The man advanced, and with a barbarous readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeized the taper which his attendant carried, and held it before her. "Lift up the mantle, ſaid he, to Rhinaldo. Rhinaldo lifted it, fixing his eyes full upon him, and diſcovered the body of Fabian.</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens!" cried the lady; "what can all this mean?" She ſtaggered ſome paces back, and was caught in the arms of Rugiero, who had advanced to be ready to aſſiſt his maſter upon occaſion.—The man himſelf ſeemed petrified with aſtoniſhment upon ſeeing the corpſe—in a few ſeconds he drew his ſword.</p>
                     <p>"Conſummate villain!" ſaid he; and he flew at Rhinaldo. Rhinaldo, who watched his eye, drew at the ſame time, beat down the thruſt which was made, with extreme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, at his breaſt, and, returning it, buried his ſword in his adverſary's body; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, on recovering his guard, that he was himſelf wounded in the thigh; he, however,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028486_0026_0FD92333508D7CE0"/>
advanced towards the lady, and ſeeing her ſomewhat recovered, attempted to explain to her that the perſon for whoſe life ſhe ſeemed to labour under ſuch apprehenſions, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſafe—out he poured this intelligence into a deaf ear. Harraſſed to death by the cruelties of her oppreſſor, and the ſcene ſhe had witneſſed, ſhe ſeemed inſenſible to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her.—Rhinaldo and Rugiero con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her ſlowly to the apartment in which they had found her, and placed her on the bed.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo then inquired whether there were any female ſervants in the houſe, and hearing that there were two, he went, attended by the companion of the deceaſed Fabian, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them, and in a ſhort time procured their attendance on the lady.</p>
                     <p>After taking care that every poſſible aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be given to her, Rhinaldo turned his thoughts once more towards the vaulted chamber, and leaving the lady under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his faithful Rugiero, he ordered Gaſpard (for ſo was Fabian's comrade called) to attend him; and again proceeded down the ſtairs, determined to explore the vault, in which the miſcreant, he had ſo lately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, had met the reward of his iniquities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:028486_0027_0FD923346FEC66F0"/>
As they entered the room, the firſt object that ſtruck them was the body of the perſon who had juſt fallen by Rhinaldo's ſword. Rhinaldo held the taper to his face, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating his features, though now fixed by the agonies of death,—"Is not this," ſaid he, to Gaſpard, "the Lord of St. Amand?" Gaſpard anſwered in the affirmative. Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo felt the body; but no ſigns of life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. He then ordered Gaſpard to raiſe the trap-door, and followed him into the vault. They proceeded along this dreary ſubterraneous paſſage, 'till they came to the little door at the end. This, after ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they unbolted, for the faſtenings were numerous and ſtrong, and deſcending by a narrow broken ſtaircaſe, entered as diſmal a dungeon, as the moſt gloomy imagination could pourtray.</p>
                     <p>In one corner they deſcribed the figure of a man, ſeated on a large ſtone, to which he was chained. As they opened the door, he caſt a languid eye towards them, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "I ſhall at laſt then find an end to my miſeries! Do not fear to perform your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion—but, if you have any compaſſion left, bear the ring which you will find in my boſom to the wiſe of your lord."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo advanced towards him.—<q>Have

                     <p>The priſoner leaped in ſurpriſe from his ſeat, but, reſtrained by his chains, he ſunk down again. "Know ye not Rhinaldo?" ſaid the young knight, and ſprung forward to embrace him. The priſoner folded his arms about his friend; but the ſurpriſe proved too much for him, and he ſunk ſpeechleſs on Rhinaldo's boſom. In a little time, however, he recovered himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed he, <q>to meet Rhinaldo in the place of my execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</q> "Let us rid you," ſaid Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, "of theſe chains." The chains which ſecured him were faſtened by a ſtrong bolt round each leg. Rhinaldo thought that if his boots were cut off, the link would prove large enough to ſlip over his foot. He aſked Gaſpard for a knife, who went in ſearch of one, but in aſcending the ſtairs, found the dagger of Fabian, which had dropped from his girdle as he fell; with this he returned. Count Tancred's boots were ſlit down and taken off, but the link was ſmaller than they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028486_0029_0FD9233C9E43C1C8"/>
had ſuppoſed—it was neceſſary they ſhould be unlocked or filed.</p>
                     <p>Gaſpard then told Rhinaldo, that the key of the Count's fetters was probably in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian's pocket, which was immediately ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Count Tancred, whoſe impatience would only ſuffer them to unlock the link which faſtened him to the ſtone, wrapt his chains round his arm, and followed his friend out of the dungeon. His mind was agitated by a moſt in ſatiable curioſity—he aſked a thouſand queſtions on a moment. "I will lead you,"—ſaid Rhinaldo, "to one who will aſſiſt me in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> detail—for, to ſay the truth, I am, at preſent, rather weary."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo was at this time accompanying his friend up the ſteps of the vault. "You look faint," ſaid Count Tancred;—"You bleed too, my friend!" They reached the vaulted chamber, where the Count was final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from his fetters.</p>
                     <p>"Here," ſaid Rhinaldo, "lie your foes." Tancred ſurveyed the bodies.</p>
                     <p>"Mercileſs barbarian!" ſaid he, as he contemplated that of the Count;—"Why was not thy puniſhment reſerved for me? But Rhinaldo," continued he, in a faltering
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028486_0030_0FD9234265651AD8"/>
voice, "there is—a—beauteous and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed victim—"</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo threw himſelf into a chair. "I feel," ſaid he, "too much embarraſſed, by a ſlight wound I have received, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you up ſtairs.—This perſon will conduct you where your queſtion will be more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly reſolved; but ſtay—it will be proper, perhaps, to ſecure the fidelity of your guide—ſo ſaying, Rhinaldo pointed to the ſword of the Count de St. Amand, which lay on the floor. "But you, my friend," ſaid Tancred, taking up the ſword,—"You want aſſiſtance."—"You will find my old ſervant, Rugiero, above," ſaid Rhinaldo, "ſend him to me."</p>
                     <p>Count Tancred now quitted Rhinaldo, and, under the direction of Gaſpard, ſought the apartment of the lady. Rhinaldo had not been left many minutes in the vaulted cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before Rugiero attended him. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the wound in his thigh, and found it ſlight indeed; but by ſubſequent irritation much inflamed. He dreſt it as well as the little aſſiſtance he was enabled to procure on the ſpot would permit him, when Rhinaldo, addreſſing him with an air which marked the confidence he repoſed in him, ſaid, "It will be impoſſible for me to purſue my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028486_0031_0FD92343555814B0"/>
in this ſtate—mark attentively the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands I am about to lay upon you—make with all ſpeed towards the capital, and at the third houſe to the right, in the narrow ſtreet which leads from the little ſquare to the back of the palace gardens, you will find my old ſerjeant, and your former comrade, Bernard Tilly; he will take care of your horſe—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his houſe 'till night, and when you hear the palace clock ſtrike twelve, repair to the high bridge—there you will find a man walking muffled up in his cloak, with his hat drawn over his eyes—accoſt this man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and ſay to him, "YES or NO?" If he ſhould anſwer "YES," repair to me with all ſpeed.—If "NO," follow him without ſpeaking, and whatſoever you may judge may be for my ſervice, execute it ſuddenly and boldly. Know, Rugiero, that the taſk I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on you requires preſence of mind and intrepidity; but I have had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of your heart and mind, to bid me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with confidence on you. You will perhaps want money in the progreſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking—take this ring."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo here preſented a ring to Rugie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.—"Call on Ben Napthali, who lives to the weſt of the great ſquare, and he will ſupply you, on ſight of it, with whatever money you may want."</p>
                     <p>

Rugiero, though he knew not what it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But Rhinaldo ſoothed his apprehendſions by telling him that Count Tancred was with him, and that there were, as he had learned, only three male domeſtics in the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, after conducting his maſter up ſtairs, who found Count Tancred and the lady in a more convenient apartment than that in which ſhe had been confined, to which the women, who had been called to attend her, had humanity enough to remove her, went to ſeek for his horſe, and having found both his own and that of his maſter under the porch, from which they had not moved, he ſet off by the light of the dawn, which juſt now began to appear, in ſearch of ſome place in which he might find provender for them: His eye ſoon directed him to a building, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a ſtable, which was in many places unroofed, but which ſtill afforded a tolerable ſhelter. He led his horſes gently in his hand, and opening the door, diſcovered that he had not been deceived. In this ſtable he found a man occupied in ſaddling a horſe. This man ſtarted at ſeeing Rugiero, and let fall the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028486_0033_0FD9234C89EB9CA0"/>
ſaddle, which he was lifting to throw over the horſe's back.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero clapped his hand to his ſword, and the man ſeizing the horſe haſtily by the bridle, drew him, unſaddled as he was, out at an oppoſite door. Rugiero, encumbered with two horſes, knew not readily what to do. In an inſtant, however, he quitted them both, and ruſhed on foot through the door at which this perſon had ſled. He found the man already mounted on the bare back of the horſe, who ſeemed to be poſſeſſed of much fire, for he ſprung forward in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with conſiderable agility.—Rugiero ſprung forward alſo, but in vain. The man preſſed his horſe eagerly, and, circling the houſe, gained the corner of the moat at which Rugiero and his maſter had paſſed, and driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſteed reſolutely at it, paſſed it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accident, and fled with ſpeed into the thickeſt of the foreſt.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, at firſt, thought of purſuing the fugitive, and haſtened back for his horſe; but, upon a little reflection, he gave up this deſign. His horſe was exhauſted with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and the want of provender, while that of the fugitive was probably freſh. It would, beſides, be almoſt impoſſible to trace him in a wild ſo trackleſs and deſerted as the foreſt;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028486_0034_0FD92350F6FC7A20"/>
he therefore contented himſelf with ſearching the ſtables for provender, which, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he placed before his maſter's horſe and his own, and returned once more into the houſe to acquaint Rhinaldo with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which had juſt occurred.</p>
                     <p>In paſſing the door, an impulſe, which he could not reſiſt, induced him firſt to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vaulted chamber, and he there ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he diſcovered cauſe of the ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which had juſt occurred. He found the body of the Count de St. Amand removed from the middle of the room, where he had left it, to a corner cloſe under the window, which was opened to admit the light of the dawn, probably from the purpoſe of contemplating the face of the deceaſed.</p>
                     <p>He had now little doubt but that one of the ſervants had, during the period in which he conducted Rhinaldo up ſtairs, entered the vaulted chamber, and diſcovered the death of the Count St. Amand.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance, as he judged, was of extreme importance to the ſafety of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and he haſtened to inform Rhinaldo of it, who gave him full credit for the fidelity of his attachment towards him, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to urge him ſtrongly to haſten his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:028486_0035_0FD923531CD69950"/>
Rugiero, therefore, returned to the ſtable, and his horſe being ſomewhat refreſhed, he led him to the drawbridge, and letting it down, paſſed over it, directing his courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that part of the foreſt from which he judged that his maſter and himſelf had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, when the ſtorm had compelled them to ſeek refuge in the manſion.</p>

                     <p>THE Counteſs St. Amand, for ſuch, by the reproaches of the Count, Rhinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do perceived her to be, was now much reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the recent indiſpoſition which the horrors of the night had cauſed. Though ſhe could not but feel deeply and awfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the ſingular events which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, ſhe did not affect any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary degree of concern for the death of a man, whoſe cruel and ferocious diſpoſition had rendered him the deteſtation of all who knew him; her health indeed ſeemed to have been impaired by the inhuman conduct of this barbarian towards her, and the roſes had faded in her cheek. She was, however, notwithſtanding this, extremely beautiful;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028486_0036_0FD923582E54E6A0"/>
and the benevolence of her heart was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the gratitude which ſhe did not ceaſe to expreſs towards her deliverer. The concern ſhe felt at hearing of his wound, could ſcarcely be ſoothed by the tender atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tancred, nor by the repeated aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Rhinaldo himſelf, that the wound was trifling, and that he had a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſkill of his domeſtic, which he had in ſome ſimilar inſtances previouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
                     <p>The day now completely dawned, and the Counteſs propoſed to Tancred and Rhinaldo, that they ſhould take ſome repoſe after the fatigues they had undergone; but the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which they had recently received from Rugiero, of the eſcape of the ſervant, was of too ſerious a nature to permit them, for the preſent, to enjoy a thought of repoſe; and anxious as they ſeverally were to have the wonderful events of the night explained to them, they were compelled to delay the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their curioſity, and conſult toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the meaſures to be purſued in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo pregnant with danger to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, in the mean time, purſued his journey with as much ſpeed as poſſible, and arrived, without meeting any extraordinary adventure, at the capital. He reached the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028486_0037_0FD923593279F388"/>
houſe of Bernard Tilly, and, having put up his horſe, waited, not without anxiety, for the eventful hour of twelve. The clock from the neighbouring convent at length ſtruck, and Rugiero ſnatching up his cloak and his ſword, haſtened towards the high bridge. He found, as he paſſed, the ſtreets deſerted. The inhabitants had all retired to bed—he gained the high bridge, and as he advanced towards the center of it, he diſcovered a man wrapt in a cloak, walking with a ſlow and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pace towards him. This man paſſed Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giero, without ſeeming to notice him; when Rugiero, according to his inſtructions, put to him the queſtion—"YES or NO?" The man anſwered immediately, "NO;" and wrapping his cloak about him, quickened his pace, and proceeded forward, without ſo much as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Rugiero.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero followed him through ſeveral winding ſtreets, 'till he turned into a paſſage ſo narrow that it involved them in compleat darkneſs. Rugiero continued, however, to follow the man, 'till the paſſage opened into a kind of ſquare, which appeared to be in a ſtate of deſolation. The ground was rough, uneven, and full of hillocks. Their path was interrupted by fragments of ſtone, bricks, and rubbiſh; and the ſtench which aroſe around them, betrayed it to be the reſidence of the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028486_0038_0FD9235E9FA07F20"/>
meaneſt and moſt wretched inhabitants of the metropolis.</p>
                     <p>They at laſt reached a ſtone building, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of very ancient ſtructure, the entrance to which was a gothic door, ſo low that a moderate ſized man muſt ſtoop conſiderably at entering it, and very narrow.</p>
                     <p>At this door the man tapped gently, and a ſmall grated wicket in the middle of it was immediately unlocked.—Some words in a low voice paſſed—the door opened, as far as a chain, which was placed acroſs it on the inſide, would permit—and two men, with drawn daggers, appeared as centinels on the inſide, Rugiero and his conductor were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted—they paſſed under the chain, and the door was immediately cloſed.</p>
                     <p>They paſſed through a long winding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and up a narrow flight of ſtone ſtairs, at the top of which they tapped at a door, and were admitted into a large, gloomy, and almoſt unfurniſhed room, illuminated by a ſingle lamp, which hung over a table.</p>
                     <p>Several men, whoſe perſons could not, on account of the gloomy light which the lamp diffuſed, be very accurately diſtinguiſhed, were walking about the room, converſing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028486_0039_0FD92361E958B398"/>
with each other. When Rugiero was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, his guide approached them, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid ſomething to them in a low voice, paſſed out of a door at the farther end of the room, and in a few minutes returned, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a gentleman with a taper in his hand, who advanced haſtily towards Rugie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro; but ſtopped ſhort when he had approached near enough to diſtinguiſh him, and ſaid, with ſigns of diſappointment, "how is this? Is not your lord here?"</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, who knew him to be a young nobleman bound by the ſtricteſt ties of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to his lord, explained to him ſhortly the accident which had prevented Rhinaldo's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; but added, modeſtly, that whatever ſervice they might think proper to employ him in, he hoped and truſted he ſhould go through it with firmneſs.</p>
                     <p>"I do not doubt it," ſaid the nobleman: <q>but your lord's counſel and conduct on a day like this—his abſence affects us—it is, as it were, a limb lobbed from our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He then turned towards the remainder of the company, and entered into a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:028486_0040_0FD9236515939710"/>
Rugiero, by the light of the taper, which this gentleman had brought, added to that of the lamp, had an opportunity of viewing more diſtinctly the figures of theſe perſons. They ſeemed all armed and accoutred for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice. The nobleman who addreſſed him, though not completely armed, had on his cuiraſſe, and other pieces, which were not ſufficiently cumberous to prevent his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot.</p>
                     <p>After having converſed for ſome time with the reſt, this nobleman turned to Rugiero, and bade him follow him. They paſſed through the door at the end of the room, and arrived at a ſmall chamber, in which there was a common truckle bed and two chairs.</p>
                     <p>"This," ſaid the nobleman, ſmiling, "is my apartment. But come," added he, "let us loſe no time" He paſſed through this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and deſcending by a ſtaircaſe on the other ſide of it, entered a room, in which were ſeveral armed men, ſome walking, ſome ſitting down, and others lying on benches. Several pieces of armour hung round the walls, and ſwords and pikes ſeemed ſcattered careleſsly about.</p>
                     <p>"Come, my friends," ſaid the nobleman, as he entered—"our hour is arrived;"
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028486_0041_0FD9236562713ED8"/>
twelve of them then took up their arms, and the nobleman, followed by Rugiero, led them to the gate at which the latter had entered, which was opened at their approach.</p>
                     <p>They paſſed over the ruins, and keeping the moſt profound ſilence, gained the new bridge. They did not paſs over it, but paſſing down on one ſide of the river, diſcovered at no great diſtance a boat, in which ſate two men.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men aroſe at their approach, and the nobleman having ſaid ſomething to them, addreſſed Rugiero as follows:—</p>
                     <p>"I muſt now leave you, as my preſence is demanded elſewhere. Theſe men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you to the garden at the back of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace—there, if fortune befriends us, you will find the princeſs Iſabel. This will prove an eventful night. Your taſk will probably require fortitude and preſence of mind. If you have the good fortune to effect the eſcape of the princeſs, convey her with all ſpeed to the place whence we now came."</p>
                     <p>Saying this, the nobleman, with four of his comrades, departed, leaving Rugiero with the reſt, who immediately embarked in the boat prepared for them. Rugiero now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028486_0042_0FD923692D4B5A28"/>
that the two men in the boat were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo armed.</p>

                     <p>THEY dropped ſilently down with the tide, rowing as gently as poſſible, leſt the daſhing of their oars, amid the ſtillneſs of the night, ſhould create ſome alarm.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the back of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace gardens, which opened by a beautiful and lofty terrace towards the river. They were ſurpriſed by the ſound of many voices, and could faintly diſcover ſeveral perſons moving on the terrace. They now took in their oars entirely, and as the tide carried them ſlowly oppoſite the terrace, preſerved the moſt profound ſilence.—They did not, however, execute this ſo ſucceſsfully, as not to be perceived. They were challenged from the terrace, and ordered to bring to. In ſpite, however of this order, they ſtill continued to drop down with the tide, about the middle of the channel, when they were alarmed by the report of an arquebuſſe, evidently levelled at them; the ſhot, however, probably went
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028486_0043_0FD9236BD779C7E8"/>
over their heads, as they did not perceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effect from it. They now thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary again to ply their oars, which they did with ſome effect, but remitted their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour upon hearing a bugle ſound in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, at the call of which the ſoldiers, whom they had ſeen upon the terrace, ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, and left the gardens wrapt in total ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, upon this, reſolved to land there, and ordering the boat to pull in gently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the terrace, he threw a ladder of ropes, with which the boatmen were purpoſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, over the parapet; but the breadth of the wall prevented the grapplings, which were fixed to the end of the ladder, taking hold. They then puſhed the boat towards a large flight of ſtone ſtairs, which deſcended from a magnificent portico about the centre of the terrace, and entangling their grapp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with ſome wrought iron which united the gateway with the parapet, Rugiero aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the ladder, and was followed by the whole of his party, except the two perſons he had found in the boat, who ſtill remained to take care of it. They paced ſilently along the terrace, and ſaught the moſt retired part of the garden, intending to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the bowers with which it abounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:028486_0044_0FD923715672EAF0"/>
They had not proceeded for, before they diſcovered two women, who paſſed ſwiftly between the trees. Terror ſeemed to lend them wings. Rugiero and his party had ſcarcely time to obſerve them, before they ſaw their progreſs impeded by a party of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, whoſe leader, advancing towards the women, laid hold on the foremoſt of them by the arm, while his party ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, who immediately conjectered that this muſt be the lady Iſabel, ordered his men to ſtand to their arms, and advanced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely towards them. The women ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Rugiero heard the leader of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite band exclaim, "It is the lady Iſabel—ſecure her."</p>
                     <p>Upon hearing this, Rugiero ruſhed on him, and was reſolutely ſeconded by his men, one of whom gently led the women towards the terrace, while the reſt, placing their backs towards them, in a firm phalanx, covered the retreat. In this manner they gained the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race; but the exclamations of the oppoſite party, who called loudly for aſſiſtance, and the claſhing of their ſwords, had by this time ſo far increaſed the number of their enemies, that though they had gained the portico at which the ladder was ſuſpended, the found
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028486_0045_0FD923740D141D30"/>
themſelves ſo preſſed, that they began to give up every hope of eſcape. They had found means, however, with the aſſiſtance of the men below, to convey the two women ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the boat, and calling to thoſe below to puſh off, had no thoughts but of ſelling their lives as dearly as poſſible—when the attention of the foe was ſuddenly diverted by a violent attack on the gate of the portico, and in an inſtant Rugiero found his little forlorn party ſuccoured by a ſtrong reinforcement, who mounted the terrace by the rope ladder, which ſtill hung ſuſpended to the iron work of the portico.</p>
                     <p>The gate in a ſhort time was opened by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the inſide, and a conſiderable party, who had diſembarked from boats which lay moored to the ſtone ſtaircaſe below, ruſhed at once into the garden. The enemy found it in vain to contend longer, and made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate retreat, in which they were cloſely preſſed by the party which had juſt arrived.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, who had luckily (though very hardly preſſed) eſcaped without a wound, was now preparing to deſcend the ladder, in order to ſecure the retreat of the Lady Iſabel, when he was accoſted by a perſon belonging to the party juſt entered, who, calling him by his name, aſked him, if the lady was ſafe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:028486_0046_0FD923771518B9F0"/>
Rugiero knew this perſon immediately to be the nobleman he had ſo lately quitted, and his ſurpriſe at this unexpected meeting kept him for a moment ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"We have been betrayed," added this nobleman. "Our troops have met with a warm reception in the ſquare, and I have embarked with this reſerve to try whether this part of the palace would not prove leſs impregnable than the front; but where," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "is the lady Iſabel?"</p>
                     <p>Rugiero told him that ſhe was in the boat below, and he deſcended immediately by the ladder. In about five minutes he returned. "Rugiero," ſaid he, "we have been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.—The lady in the boat is not the Lady Iſabel; ſhe is, however, a lady, in whoſe welfare I intereſt myſelf much. The duty of the moment will not permit me to ſtay—the Lady Iſabel is confined in her chamber in the firſt ſtory on the left front of the weſtern tower. I will leave a truſty few for the guard of the boat, and with thirty more, whom I will ſpare to reinforce your detachement, you muſt attempt to reſcue the lady" Having remained juſt long enough to effect this arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, the nobleman haſtened towards the palace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:028486_0047_0FD9237D07F22E00"/>
Rugiero now took the command of the men who were delivered to him by the nobleman, and ſought the weſtern tower. He perceived the window on the left front—it was about the height of two pikes from the ground, and grated with iron—he perceived that the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber within was lighted up; he had taken the precaution to bring from the boat the ladder of ropes; he tied two pikes together and hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladder, fixed the grapplings to the bars of the windows and aſcended. The light in the chamber grew every moment more and more vived. What were the horrors which Rugiero felt when, upon gaining the window, he perceived the furniture and hangings of the chamber enveloped in flames.</p>
                     <p>He had ſcarcely time to reflect on this dreadful ſpectacle, before he heard the claſhing of ſwords, and perceived that his men were attacked below.—The garden was again in tumult, and the party which had lately landed were compelled to retreat to their boats, which they did in much confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero's guard ſtood boldly on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but were preſently overpowered by numbers, and compelled to ſeek their ſafety with the reſt. In this confuſion Rugiero ſtood ſupported by the gratings of the window, 'till the flames began to crack the panes of the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028486_0048_0FD9237DD6101240"/>
caſement, and his poſt was become too hot to be longer tenable. He now began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, when, either from the melting of the ſolder, through the increaſing heat of the walls, or from the rottenneſs of the ironwork itſelf, the grating gave way, and Rugiero fell to the ground.</p>
                     <p>He lay, for ſome time, ſtunned by his fall, and upon recovering himſelf, found that the tumult in the garden had in a great meaſure ſubſided. He had luckily received no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial damage from this accident, and now thought of effecting his eſcape; but reflecting for a moment on his ſituation, he judged it uſeleſs to proceed towards the terrace, as the boats had probably by this time quitted the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>As he walked ſlowly forwards, doubtful what he ſhould do, he perceived before him the body of a man, who had probably been ſlain in the late ſkirmiſh, and who was dreſt in the habit of the king's guard.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero heſitated not a moment, but ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him of his hat, his buff coat, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier, and placing his arquebuſſe on his ſhoulder, he fell in with a party who were in an irregular manner retiring towards the palace, and inſinuating himſelf among them,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028486_0049_0FD92381F88085F8"/>
ſoon gained the great ſquare in the front of the building.</p>
                     <p>He there found moſt of the troops in the city drawn up, and under arms, while a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were employed in extinguiſhing the fire which had filled his mind with ſo much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                     <p>Muſing on the dreadful fate which had probably attended the unfortunate lady, for whoſe ſake ſolely he ſeemed to have been commanded on his preſent ſervice, and ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the bare idea of cummunicating to his lord intelligence ſo pregnant with calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, he quitted the ſquare, unperceived by ſome ſentries who were poſted at the differnet aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, but who were employed in drinking, and gained the high bridge. From the high bridge, he ſtrove to retrace his former ſteps towards the ſpot on which he had firſt ſeen the noble friend of his lord. In this he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; but, on his arrival, he had freſh cauſe for aſtoniſhment and alarm. He ſaw the ruins allmoſt covered with dead bodies—a large party of the king's troops were ſtill there under arms—the building, at the little door of which he had been ſo cautiouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, was ſmoaking in ruins, and, oppoſite to it, were placed two ſmall pieces of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. In ſhort, there was every appearance
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028486_0050_0FD9238315193AD8"/>
that this houſe had been defended to the laſt extremity.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero retired with a melancholy ſtep from this ſcene of ſlaughter, and regaining the houſe of Bernard Tilly, he mounted his horſe, and prepared to convey to his maſter the heavy and heart-breaking intelligence with which he felt his mind oppreſſed. At the eaſtern gate, through which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould attempt his eſcape, he judged that he ſhould not be able to paſs without ſome difficulty—He reſolved, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to depend on the coat he wore, and the tale he ſhould be able to fabricate, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility this would ſcarcely have ſucceeded; but he was not put to the trial—he found the poſt deſerted—the guard had been recently attacked, and the gate forced—he now took the road towards the place where he had left Rhinaldo.</p>

                     <p>RUGIERO rode on, wrapt in mournful meditation, 'till he came to the ſkirts of a wood. As he entered the hollow way, which led through this wood, he heard a noiſe of the galloping of horſes at a diſtance behind him. He turned round, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a troop of horſmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the diſtance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of a mile, preſſing with all their ſpeed towards him.</p>
                     <p>As he did not think it prudent to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe men, he put his horſe forward, and perceiving a narrow path winding through the thicket on his right hand, he turned his horſe into it, and giving him the ſpur, and defended his face as well as he could with his hand, he ſpeedily loſt ſight of the road. He purſued the path, which became gradually more open, 'till thinking himſelf well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the horſmen, whoſe approach had alarmed him, he pauſed. He had the ſatisfaction to hear them paſs along the read, without attempting to turn out of it. He then thought of returning the way he came,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028486_0052_0FD9238AADBBFE18"/>
but perceived the thicket ſo deeply entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that he was compelled to purſue the path ſtrait forward.</p>
                     <p>It extended gradually, as he proceeded, 'till it opened into a green ſward, ſhaped like a little amphitheatre, and ſurrounded, on all ſides, by the wood. As he entered this place, he perceived the back of a man, who was gliding through the trees at the other end of it. He ſtopped his horſe when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this, and, as he was meditating on the path he ſhould purſue, he was ſurrounded by four men, who ruſhed out of the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thickets ſo ſuddenly, that they had ſeized upon his bridle and ſword before he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their approach.</p>
                     <p>They told him he was their priſoner, and, bidding him diſmount, tied his hands behind him, and led him through the thickeſt of the underwood,—his horſe being conducted by one of them ſlowly behind. After a toilſome walk of ſome length, their path being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by briars and matted weeds, and the hands of his conductors employed in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the branches by which they were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually interrupted. They arrived at the foot of a rock, gradually ſloping from a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous height, crowned on the ſummit with lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and majeſtic pines, and clad to the very
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028486_0053_0FD9238D9B2510F0"/>
foot with bruſh wood, intermingled with ſmall dwarf trees.</p>
                     <p>Beneath this rock were ſome cabbins, freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtructed with the branches of trees, and one indeed ſcarcely yet begun. Several perſons were employed in the labour of rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, whoſe arms lay by them.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero was conducted to the largeſt of the huts, which was built ſo as to form a kind of veſtibule to a cave, which ſeemed to have been ſcooped by nature in the ſolid rock. From this hut a perſon advanced to meet him, who ſeemed, as he could collect from the behaviour of the reſt, veſted with ſome authority.</p>
                     <p>The men who had ſeized Rugiero inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this perſon, that being detached for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they had fallen in with the priſoner as he was attempting to diſcover their retreat, and, as was beyond all doubt confirmed by his appearance, in order to betray it to the king.</p>
                     <p>The perſon whom they addreſſed, turning to Rugiero, aſked him how he came into that ſituation. "But," added he, 'his garb is evidence enough of his intention—we muſt teach him, that deſpair has rendered all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

againſt us dangerous—let him be conveyed aſide, and well guarded—we will ſpeedily determine on his fate. Rugiero beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be heard; but the perſon who had given theſe orders turning his back upon him, the men who had him in cuſtody were about to convey him away, when he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an officer of a ſuperior preſence approach.</p>
                     <p>This officer held by the hand a lady, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but handſomely dreſt. What was the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Rugiero, when he diſcovered in him the very nobleman under whoſe auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had conducted the buſineſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening.</p>

                     <p>The apartment in the cave was lofty and ſpacious. It received a degree of light, juſt ſufficient to render it habitable, by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perforation in the roof, which joined to the ſurface of the rock at ſome conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable hight above the entrance. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

and a table, carved rudely in wood, and ſeemingly very old. At the end was a rude altar, formed in the ſolid rock, having a crucifix carved with ſome ingenuity over it; and in the corner of the cave lay a ſmall bedſtead of wood, which was covered with fearn, newly gathered.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero related to the young nobleman, with horror in his countenance, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object which encountered him at lady Iſabels' window; and the circumſtances which attended his eſcape.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven be praiſed!" ſaid this nobleman, who was called Count Anſelmo;—"all then is yet well.

                     <p>To this propoſal Rugiero immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. He diſguiſed himſelf like a peaſant, and, loading an aſs belonging to the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with faggots, he waited the commands of Anſelmo.</p>

Your life, and the welfare of your lord, will perhaps depend on your care.—Do not, therefore, whomſoever you may ſee there, addreſs him; but place yourſelf with your back againſt the fifth pillar of the colonade from the right.

                     <p>Rugiero, armed with theſe inſtructions, ſoon departed; but fearing, notwithſtanding his diſguiſe, an examination at the city gates, he adopted the precaution of ſewing the ring within the lining of his pack ſaddle. Nor did this care prove needleſs—at the gates he underwent a ſtrict ſearch; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken great care that nothing about him ſhould convey the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion

of his being in any degree ſuperiour to the rank of the peaſant he appeared, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to paſs.</p>

                        </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo. He procured the money of Ben Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali, and repaired, when the clock ſtruck nine, to the place appointed. He had ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely placed himſelf againſt the pillar, when the man he had formerly ſeen walked ſlowly by him, ſo cloſe as to bruſh him with his cloak. After a ſhort time he returned, and perceiving nobody near, addreſſed him in the words he had been taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, Rugiero drew a canvaſs bag from his breaſt, in which were contained the thouſand crowns he had received from Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali, and gave them to the ſtranger, who, putting them under his cloak, told him to be in the ſame ſpot exactly in ſix hours—but to take particular care, if poſſible, to avoid the patrole.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero returned to his miſerable inn, and throwing himſelf on a truckle bed, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with impations the expiration of the ſix

hours. The clock at length ſtruck three—he aroſe, and haſtened towards the place of appointment. He had not proceeded many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before, at the corner of a ſtreet, he met the patrole. He ſtarted aſide, to avoid the ſerjeant, whoſe ſuſpicions were ſo far arouſed by this circumſtance, that he immediately ſprung forward, and ſeized him by the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. He was ſoon ſurrounded, and after a few queſtions taken into cuſtody, and marched towards the guard-houſe.</p>
                     <p>He had not proceeded far beyond the town-houſe, when the guard, in whoſe cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody he was, were encountered by another party. As ſoon as theſe parties came cloſe to each other, they halted, which they had ſcarcely done, when a man ſpringing forward from the midſt of the party which had juſt arrived, ſeized Rugiero by the collar, and ſaid to the commander of the detachment he was with, "This is the traitor—this is the very man we are in ſearch of—I charge you ſeize him."</p>
                     <p>The commander, upon theſe words, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards Rugiero, gave him into the cuſtody of his own party, after a few words had paſſed between him and the ſerjeant of the other detachment, when the parties ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, each returning the way they came.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:028486_0060_0FD923A4D9653498"/>
The aſtoniſhment of Rugiero kept him perfectly ſilent under this accuſation; nor was that aſtoniſhment leſſened, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the perſon accuſing him was the very man to whom he had ſo lately delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thouſand crowns, and who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to meet him.</p>
                     <p>He was now convinced that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and that his own life, and the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſts of his lord, muſt fall a ſacrifice to his ill fortune. Yet how it had occurred he could not divine.—Wrapt in theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflections, he walked on 'till they came to the remains of the old palace, a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which had long been converted into a priſon, for which uſe one would have thought, from its appearance, it had been originally deſigned.</p>
                     <p>In an outward apartment belonging to this place, the guard which had conducted Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giero hither halted, and depoſited their arms; and this faithful ſervant was ordered to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the commander of the party, who led him into a dark and intricate paſſage, while the perſon who had preferred the accuſation againſt him kept warily behind him. They paſſed through many ſtrong doors, of which the commander poſſeſſed the keys. At length they deſcended by the winding ſtaircaſe of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028486_0061_0FD923A9273FCE48"/>
a turret, and paſſing a long and narrow arched vault, lighted by two dim lamps, began to aſcend in the ſame manner. After aſcending for ſome time, the guide halted, and, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a door, introduced Rugiero to a ſmall ſtrong ſquare room, which ſeemed to admit the light in the day by one ſmall caſement, opened in a wall of immenſe thickneſs. In ſhort, it ſeemed a place of confinement for priſoners of a better order, who were not deſtined to be very rigidly dealt with.</p>
                     <p>In this room, at a table, on which burned two tapers, ſat a young man, plainly dreſt, who ſeemed, as it appeared to Rugiero upon entering, in the act of painting his face by a looking-glaſs which ſtood on the table; while another perſon, of about his own ſtature, ſtood at his elbow, aſſiſting him in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>Such an employment, in ſuch a ſituation, could not fail to ſtrike Rugiero. The young man aroſe ſuddenly upon their entrance, and, taking his cloak and hat from his attendant, ſeemed to await their orders.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero had now an opportunity of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. He ſeemed very young, of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant form, and brown complexion, his hair very much overſhadowed his face, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028486_0062_0FD923AAD85D1750"/>
as well as his eye-brows, was remarkably dark.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero's guide accoſted him reſpectfully, and, taking off his hat, told him that the TIME WAS COME. The young man's ſervant upon this took up a ſmall cloak bag, which was delivered to Rugiero, and attended his maſter, who followed the conductor to the guard room. The eſcort who had conducted Rugiero to this place, reſumed their arms, and proceeded towards the gate of the city, at which Rugiero had entered, but halted within about forty paces of it, when the commander, apologizing for the neceſſity he was under, ordered the young man and his ſervant to be bound together. The ſame ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was performed on Rugiero and his accuſer, who were, to his ſurpriſe, bound arm to arm.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the gate, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander aſked for the ſerjeant of the guard, and told him he was conducting ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to a caſtle, which he named, at no great diſtance. He then gave him the word of the night. The gate was opened, the drawbridge let down, and the detachment ſoon ſaw themſelves clear of the city.</p>

                     <p>THE leaders of this little party no ſooner found themſelves out of ſight of the gates, than they unbound the four priſoners, and ſtriking out of the road, purſued their march through a hollow way, which in a few hours led them to the ſkirts of a foreſt.</p>
                     <p>During this march, Rugiero found himſelf treated with much reſpect by the perſon who commanded the detachment, and the man to whom he had delivered the thouſand crowns.—The latter apologized to-him for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Upon the arrival of the detachment at the ſkirts of this foreſt, they were met by a party o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> horſe, at the head of which Rugiero ſaw the Count Anſelmo. This nobleman rode immediately up to the detachment, and diſmounting from his horſe, addreſſed himſelf moſt reſpectfully

to the young man who had accompanied them from the priſon, and inſiſted upon his riding during the reſt of the journey. This offer the young man, who ſeemed much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with fatigue, accepted, with many thanks, and was helped by the Count into the ſaddle. His ſervant was likewiſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with the charger of one of the troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the party purſued their march 'till they arrived, by a very narrow path, which would juſt admit a ſingle horſe, at the ſpot from which Rugiero had been detached on the preceding day.</p>
                     <p>On their arrival, the Count conducted the young man and his attendant into the cave, and ordered Rugiero to follow.</p>
                     <p>On his entrance to the cave, he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee the lady, whom he had left with the Count, riſe from her ſeat, and embrace the young man with ardour—but his ſurpriſe was quickly alleviated by the Count, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The cauſe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028486_0066_0FD923BA346B5B78"/>
was the rumour of a plot to reſtore my father to his throne. Of my eſcape I know little. I was alarmed by the cry of fire. I heard a confuſed noiſe at my door, which was ſuddenly opened. I was conveyed, with my faithful Barbara, to a room in the old palace, whither, late laſt night, the diſguiſes in which we now appear were conveyed to us. Ah! Count Anſelmo," continued the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, "Tell me, I intreat you, my father! is he ſafe?"</p>
                     <p>"He is, Madam," ſaid Anſelmo; "it was not thought proper, 'till this effort was made, to draw him from his retirement. The project of making ourſelves maſters of the perſon of your uncle, and thus ſecuring the capital, was entruſted but to few. Rhinaldo was among them. You will, I know, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, that he did not confide to you the whole of our project. Such a confidence he knew, from the delicacy of your ſituation, could alone be attended with pain, anxiety, and eventually, perhaps, with danger to your perſon. As Rhinaldo could not appear in the capital with ſafety, it was reſolved that he ſhould not join us 'till our project was ripe for execution, and that then he ſhould enter the town privately, and meet one of our party at a place appointed. If any thing had happened to diſconcert our meaſures, at a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028486_0067_0FD923BB5ACFF7C8"/>
word given by the perſon appointed to meet him, Rhinaldo was to take horſe and fly to bring up ſome troops, who are collected on the frontiers; if nothing had happened, he was to join us. Rugiero attended us in his place, and, receiving the word intended for his lord, was conducted to us, for we did not then ſuſpect, what we afterwards proved, that our plot had been diſcovered. As to your own eſcape, it was effected by a ſerjeant of Aſtolpho's guard, who had formerly ſerved your father, and was attached to us. He had been informed of your confinement, and projected, with an officer of our party, the plan for your eſcape, which was ſpeedily communicated to me. In the midſt of the confuſion, which occurred in the palace, he contrived to ſet fire to the chamber adjoining to yours, and prevailing on the guard, which was ſet over you, to open your doors, he entered with his own men, and, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of conveying you to your uncle, lodged you in the old palace. But if you wiſh to learn the ſtory from his own mouth, here he is."</p>

ought to expreſs my obligations to him." She now began to thank the ſerjeant for his conduct—when he interrupted her ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>"Lady," ſaid he, "this is no time for compliments. Heaven grant that you may yet be in ſafety."</p>
                     <p>"My Lord," ſaid he to the Count, "your ſcouts bring us but ſcurvy intellig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Alarmed at this intelligence, Anſelmo aroſe, and walked haſtily towards the mouth of the cave.

                     <p>They puſhed forward with as much ſpeed as they were able to make, 'till the ſhades of night, which fell heavilly and deeply over the foreſt, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure arreſted their progreſs. They were then compelled to proceed at a ſlower pace, for which they, however, felt ſomewhat conſoled by the reflection that their purſuers, if they were yet purſued, were equally impeded by the cauſe which obſtructed them. The night now grew darker, and, amidſt the gloom which was occaſioned by the thick and lofty branches of the trees, they found it extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult to diſcern the path before them, in which they were alone guided by the deep and rugged banks which aroſe on each ſide.</p>

The wind now aroſe, and whiſtled hollow through the trees—the gloom ſeemed redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led—the rain began to rattle amidſt the trees—and the thunder to roll at a diſtance—while the howling of the wolves on every ſide of them filled the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

induced. Anſelmo to run all hazards, and turning towards the place whence the light they had diſcerned diffuſed its beams, they found themſelves in a ſhort time cloſe to the walls of a ſpacious and ſtately caſtle.</p>
                     <p>It was here reſolved that, as their numbers might create ſuſpicion, Rugiero, who was not ſo well known as the Count, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was not ſo liable to detection, ſhould with the Lady Iſabel, her Couſin, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, demand admittance, and ſhelter from the ſtorm, while the remainder of the party waited without, and ſought protection from the boiſterous inclemency of the night, in ſome of the outhouſes of the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>This they might eaſily do without detection, for though this Caſtle was large and ſtately, it was a place of no great ſtrength. The ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation did not admit of its being moated, and its outward defence was a wall of no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hight.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero then, with Iſabel and her fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, while the reſt of the party ſtood aloof ſhrouded by the darkneſs of the night, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for admittance. He had ſlung round him a bugle horn, which Anſelmo had given him, with orders, in caſe he found himſelf in danger, to ſound an alarm. The apparel
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028486_0073_0FD923CB64666F88"/>
of Iſabel and her companion was plain and neat, and Ellenor was covered with her veil. After ſome time the gate was opened, and Rugiero begged for ſhelter 'till the ſtorm ſhould paſs over.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid that his party had been attacked by the wolves, in paſſing the foreſt, and that they had been compelled, in order to ſave their own lives, to leave their horſes a prey to thoſe ravenous animals. After relating this ſtory, they were, upon a ſhort delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admitted through the court into a lofty and ſpacious hall, hung round with armour.</p>
                     <p>The whole of the family ſeemed to have retired to reſt, except a few ſervants, who were ſtanding round a fire, to which Rugiero and his party advanced, in order to dry their cloaths. After ſome little time, the ſervants were ſummoned to attend their lord, who was preparing to retire for the night.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero and the Princeſs had waited but a few minutes, before they perceived the door of a room open, and two of the ſervants, who had juſt left them, deſcend by a few ſteps into the hall, bearing each a taper in his hand.</p>
                     <p>They were followed by a gentleman dreſſed in deep mourning, who advancing towards
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028486_0074_0FD923CEE36EADC0"/>
Rugiero and his companions, ſurveyed them with ſcrutinizing eyes; but what were the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Iſabel, when in this perſon ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the man with whoſe abhored addreſſes ſhe had been ſo much perſecuted—the Count Rhodolpho, the ſon of the Count St. Amand.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho, after he had aſked ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of Rugiero, advanced towards her. She was ſinking with terror—he looked at her, but, to all appearance, did not recollect her, for he paſſed on to her Couſin Iſabel, whom he deſired to lift her veil, What were the ſenſations of Iſabel at this requeſt! She knew that Rhodolpho was perfectly acquainted with her Couſin.—Ellenor, who likewiſe knew him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heſitated and trembled. He intimated his deſire with the tone of a man who would be obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Iſabel, inſtinctively, caught hold of the horn, which hung by Rugiero's ſide, and raiſed it to her mouth; but before her lips could reach it, overcome by her ſenſations, ſhe fainted and fell ſenſeleſs on the floor.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance called off the attention of Rhodolpho, who no longer perſiſted in his demand, but leaving Iſabel, whoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he imputed to fatigue, to the care of his ſervants, retired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:028486_0075_0FD923D295FCA598"/>
He had ſcarcely turned his back, when Ellenor, forgetting all precaution at behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Couſin's ſituation, threw off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>her veil; and flew to the lady Iſabel's aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſervants who had attended Rhodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho into the hall, two had remained behind. One of them was a ſhrewd fellow, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and addreſs had recommended him much to the favour of his lord.</p>
                     <p>The appearance of Iſabel and her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion had ſtruck him, as bearing in it ſomething peculiar. The circumſtance of her ſeizing the bugle, which hung at Rugiero's ſide, and attempting to ſound it, had not paſſed unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; and the beauty of Ellenor ſo ill accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the ſituation in which ſhe appeared, convinced him that ſome myſtery attended the arrival of theſe people at the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Impreſſed with this idea, while Rugiero, aſſiſted by Ellenor, Barbara, and the other ſervant, was occupied in the recovery of Iſabel he ſtole away to his lord, and communicated to him all he had obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho, arouſed by this intelligence, quitted his apartment, and returned to the hall, where he unluckily arrived, unſeen by any one, before Ellenor had replaced her veil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:028486_0076_0FD923D6589551D8"/>
"Lady Ellenor!" exclaimed Rhodolpho, ſtarting back, He looked alternately at her and Iſabel, who was ſtill ſitting in the chair. The efforts uſed to recover her had diſordered her dreſs—ſome falſe hair which ſhe wore was diſplaced—the water ſprinkled in her face had removed ſome of the paint which ſhe had uſed to give a brown and manly hue to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho looked ſtedfaſtly at her. He claſped his hands together, and raiſing them in a tranſport, exclaimed, "by all that's ſacred, this was above my hopes! The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Iſabel! At laſt, Madam, you are mine—nor is it in the power of heaven or earth to redeem you."</p>
                     <p>The arrival of all ſhe had dreaded rouſed thoſe ſpirits in the Princeſs which her fears had diſſipated. She aroſe, and waving her hand, ſaid to Rhodolpho, with an air of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,—"My Lord, I will remain no longer here—let me paſs."</p>
                     <p>"See that no one eſcapes," ſaid Rhodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho to his ſervants. "Ladies," continued he, with a ſneer,—"you muſt be content with my inhoſpitable roof to-night."</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo, my Lord," ſaid Rugiero, firmly. "Since this is the caſe, we muſt truſt again
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028486_0077_0FD923D78C55D258"/>
to the inclement elements;" and taking Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel in one hand, and Ellenor in the other, he conducted them towards the door.</p>
                     <p>"On your lives, let no one paſs," ſaid Rhodolpho to his ſervants, who advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero now quitting the hands of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, drew his ſword, and ſaid, in a determined tone, "The man who attempts to obſtruct our paſſage, dies."</p>
                     <p>Iſabel, Barbara, and Ellenor, now ran towards the door, while Rugiero, ſtill facing Rhodolpho and his ſervants, kept them at bay.</p>
                     <p>"Ring the alarm bell," cried Rhodolpho; and the ſervants flew different ways to arouſe the ſleepy inhabitants of the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero, finding himſelf free from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal attacks of his foes, took advantage of his breathing time, and, applying his bugle horn to his mouth, ſounded a charge, while the delicate and trembling hands of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were applied, with unſkilful haſte, to the maſſy bolts and bars of the door.</p>
                     <p>The active alarms of the ſervants ſoon brought aſſiſtance to their lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:028486_0078_0FD8BFDAB1435400"/>
Rugiero found his aſſailants increaſe. He had repeatedly ſounded his horn, when, to his extreme joy, he heard his friends on the outſide of the door, which Iſabel and her companions had at length contrived to unbar.</p>
                     <p>Count Anſelmo, and his party now ruſhed in, and giving a ſudden check to the aſſailants of Rugiero, bore away the Princeſs, her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and companion. By this time, however, the hall was full of men, for Rhodolpho had quartered his company of men at arms (which his father's intereſt had obtained for him) at his Caſtle that night, with intent to join the king on the next day. They ruſhed out in purſuit of the fugitives, and as they exceeded Anſelmo's little band conſiderably in numbers the latter were compelled to ſeek refuge in the darkneſs of the night, and the thickneſs and obſcurity of the tangled foreſt. Preſſed by a formidable enemy, cloſe at their heels, they knew not which courſe to take, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in different bodies, and ſought their ſafety in flight.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo, who would not quit his miſtreſs and her lovely Couſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found himſelf in a few minutes unaccompained by any man of his party, except Rugiero. He ſought the place where he had left his horſes, and, with the aſſiſtance of Rugiero, having mounted his

little female band as well as he could, they took the firſt path which led from the Caſtle, and preſſing forward with all the ſpeed they could make, ſoon found themſelves free from the noiſe of their purſuers.</p>

                     <p>ANSELMO and his fair companions had travelled for ſome time, Rugiero pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely keeping behind, that, if any purſuit ſhould be made after them, he might give early intelligence of it,—when the horſe on which this brave and faithful ſervant was mounted fell ſuddenly with him.</p>
                     <p>Rugiero readily extricated himſelf from him, but notwithſtanding every effort he could make, in vain attempted to raiſe this worn out animal, whoſe ſtrength was wholly exhauſted. After endeavouring, without ſucceſs, to make the Count, who was at ſome diſtance before him, acquainted with this diſaſter, for the roaring of the ſtorm compleatly drowned his exclamations, he reſolved to ſit under a tree, cloſe to the ſpot, where his horſe lay, and wait the approach of day with patience.</p>

In the mean time, Count Anſelmo, with the lady Ellenor, the Princeſs Iſabel, and her companion, proceeded onward, unconſcious of the fate of Rugiero. At laſt, however, hearing no longer the ſound of his horſes feet, they ſtopped to liſten—but they liſtened in vain. The howling of the wind was the only noiſe which ſaluted their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs. They knew not what to conjecture. Every idea they could form of the fate of Rugiero ſeemed pregnant with danger to themſelves. They were at length, after a long period paſſed in painful and fruitleſs expectation, compelled to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their journey without him, which they did in a cheerleſs and melancholy ſilence, each of them brooding over ideas which they were almoſt afraid to communicate to the others.</p>
                     <p>They were journeying in this manner, when they came to a more open part of the foreſt, a large and dark object before them, which they were ſoon convinced was, as indeed it proved, a houſe. Somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived at this proſpect, they puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpeedily arrived at an old and ruined manſion.</p>
                     <p>In this ancient and diſmantled dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they perceived no ſigns of inhabitants. They judged it on that account a more proper ſhelter for the night; and though
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028486_0081_0FD923E25C6B9AB0"/>
the Princeſs and her female companions were not unimpreſſed by terrors from the awfulneſs of the ſcene, they paſſed a crazy draw bridge, and, croſſing a courtyard, reached the door of the houſe, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo, diſmounting, preſently opened.</p>
                     <p>When he had opened it, he liſtened, but could hear nothing. He was the more convinced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this circumſtance, that the houſe was uninhabited, and prevailed, after much intreaty, on his timid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to leave their horſes, (which he faſtened together) and enter the manſion with him.</p>
                     <p>The lightning, which had not as yet ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to play around them, ſhooting through a large gothic window, diſplayed to them an old unfurniſhed hall. They found that the rain beat in near the ſpot where they ſtood, and the wind ſwept through the various avenues of this uncomfortable aſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. As they were much incommoded in this ſituation, Anſelmo propoſed that they ſhould ſeek a better ſhelter; and after ſome oppoſition, his friends clinging cloſe around him, proceeded acroſs the hall, and deſcending by a few ſteps, found himſelf in a warmer ſtation. He now began to trace his new apartment by the walls, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028486_0082_0FD923E38342AFB0"/>
ſoon perceived, by the ſtyle of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the extend of the fire place, that he had reached the kitchen of this manſion.</p>
                     <p>In purſuing his diſcovery, he ſoon found out that this part of the manſion could not have been long uninhabited, and began to entertain hopes, if he could, by accident, procure any implement with which he might ſtrike a light, of rendering their aſylum leſs comfortleſs for the remainder of the time which they ſhould be compelled to paſs in it.</p>
                     <p>His ſearch was not unſucceſsful, an andit became apparent, to demonſtration, that the houſe could not have been long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orſaken. He found the implements he ſought, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſome ſtraw and faggots in a receſs at no great diſtance from the fire-place, kindled a fire, and eaſily prevailed on his ſhivering friends to draw round it.</p>
                     <p>It was, in their ſituation, a luxury indeed. They wanted, it is true, to add to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the proviſions which they had brought from their retreat in the foreſt, but in the late attack, which diſperſed their party, they were ſeparated from the horſes which had been laden with them. They huddled round the fire, and dried their cloaths. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with ſomewhat more cheerfulneſs than
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028486_0083_0FD923E6D6FDCDA0"/>
their converſation had of late diſplayed, and congratulated each other on their eſcape from the hands of Rhodolpho; 'till, exhauſted with fatigue, fleep overtook them, and they ſat ſlumbering over the dying embers, 'till they were rouzed by a noiſe which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed up the hearts of the females with terror, and appalled even the firm and manly breaſt of Anſelmo.</p>
                     <p>A ſlow and ſolemn ſtep, attended by the claſhing of chains, ſeemed to gain upon their ears from a long paſſage oppoſite to that by which the had entered the kitchen.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo (for the lady Iſabel and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, breathleſs and overcome with terror ſhrunk behind their protector, and did not dare to caſt their eyes towards the place whence the noiſe which alarmed them procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) beheld a light gleam at a diſtance on the walls of the paſſage, and ſoon after diſcerned the form of a man advancing ſlowly along it.</p>
                     <p>A deadly paleneſs overſpread the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance—the eyes were hollow, and ſunk—the hair was clotted with blood—with which his garments were alſo ſtained, and the light which Anſelmo had deſcried, proceeded from a taper which he hold in his hand.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028486_0084_0FD923E823FD45A8"/>
Anſelmo's blood froze in his veins at this ſpectacle. In ſpite of all his fortitude his knees trembled, and a cold ſweat bedewed his brow; nor could he arouſe in his mind reſolution enough to addreſs the ſpectre before him, 'till he was awakened from this trance of terror by a ſingular phaenomenon.</p>
                     <p>The form which has been deſcribed contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to advance, 'till it approached ſo near to Anſelmo, that the light of the taper gleamed upon him; upon which he ſtarted ſuddenly, and prepared haſtily to retreat.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo, rouſed by this circumſtance, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to follow it; but the Princeſs Iſabel and her Couſin ſhrieked aloud, and clung to him under the impulſe of the moſt agonizing terror.</p>
                     <p>At their ſhrieks the phantom again turned towards them.</p>
                     <p>"Whatever thou art," cried Anſelmo, "I conjure thee ſtay and relieve me from this horror."</p>
                     <p>"Anſelmo!" exclaimed the ſpectre, in a hollow voice, but in a tone of perplexity and wonder.</p>

                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:028486_0085_0FD923E9170A0A70"/>
The voice, hollow as it was, ſounded like that of Rhinaldo. It recalled the wandering ſenſes of Iſabel. She looked in the face of the ſpeaker, pale and disfigured as it was—it was the countenance of Rhinaldo too.</p>
                     <p>Iſabel ſhrieked and fainted.</p>
                     <p>"Help, help my Couſin Iſabel!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Ellenor.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, (for he was the ſpectre,) ruſhed forward to her aſſiſtance, while Anſelmo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained motionleſs with wonder.</p>
                     <p>It was long before the beauteous Iſabel could recover her ſcattered ſenſes, and longer before ſhe could be perſuaded that her Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo ſtood before her, impreſſed as ſhe was with the idea that it was the ſpirit of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted lover which ſhe had ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Her doubts, however, at length ſubſided, and pity, at the ghaſtly appearance of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, took place. She aſked him, with a mixture of affection, compaſſion, and horror, the cauſe of his preſent appearance; and Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, poſtponing the gratification of his own curioſity, acquainted her with his arrival at the forlorn manſion in which ſhe ſaw him—the death of the Count de St. Amand—and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028486_0086_0FD923EB6ABC46F0"/>
the diſcovery of Count Tancred; after which he proceeded as follows:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Rugiero had not long left us when we diſcovered that the eſcape of that ſervant whom he had, without ſucceſs, attempted to detain, was as fatal a circumſtance as his affectionate fears forboded that it would be.—This fellow went immediately to a Caſtle of his lords, which is at no great diſtance from this, and alarmed the family with the ſtory of his death. Before we could ſettle any plan of eſcape, for which my wound, though it was but ſlight, in ſome degree ſtill diſqualified me, the houſe was aſſailed by the domeſtics of the Count. We barricaded it as well as we could, and prevailed on the ſervants who remained with us to aſſiſt us in our attempt to carry off the lady. We were preparing to depart when a poſten door was forced, and our enemies ruſhed in upon us. Count Tancred and I drew our ſwords, in defence of the lady. I know no more—I was cut down—nor did I recover my ſenſes, 'till I found myſelf loaded with the chains I now wear, and ſurrounded by a party of ruffians whom I had never before beheld. I was conducted into the preſence of Rhodolpho, who ſtood in the midſt of a circle of armed men. When he perceived who his priſoner
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028486_0087_0FD9251B16A78B98"/>
was, the hatred he had always borne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me broke out in the bittereſt invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and he ordered me to be conveyed to the dungeon from which I had reſcued the Count Tancred.—There my conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors left me. I heard the laſt door of my priſon cloſe—in vain did I wait to hear it open again—hour after hour paſſed away—and the horrid ſilence of the dungeon continued uninterrupted. My remorſeleſs foes had doomed me to all the horrors of death by famine. I ſoon enperienced many of its pangs. I awaked from my ſwoon to an intolerable thirſt. Chained as I was, they had not taken the precaution to fix me to a particular ſpot, preſuming, as I ſuppoſe, that I was well enough ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. I roved round my dungeon, raging under the agony of the thirſt which conſumed me, when I felt my foot touch ſomething. Judge what was my tranſport, when I perceived this to be part of an earthen pitcher of water, which had been left there when Count Tancred was removed. But I will not dwell on circumſtances which muſt afflict you. My wounds, though they had bled much, did not prove of much conſequence. The horrors of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave me ſtrength and courage. I ſurveyed my dungeon, and by a feeble
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028486_0088_0FD923F2D7F87980"/>
ray of light which entered at a narrow ſlip towards the roof, I deſcried a part of the wall bricked in the form of an arch. It immediately occurred to me that this had formerly been a door way, and that it might not be of the ſame ſubſtance as the reſt of the wall. I ſought again round my cavern for ſomething with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hich I might remove a brick, and at leaſt attempt to diſcover its thickneſs.—In ſearching near the ſtone to which my friend Tancred had been faſtened, I moſt providentially diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a dagger which I had uſed in attempting to free him from his chains, and had afterwards thrown careleſsly by. With this I went to work.—The firſt brick I found much difficulty in removing—when that was done, my labour grew lighter in proportion; but many weary hours paſſed, before I had made an aperture big enough to admit my body. This, however, I at length accompliſhed, and found myſelf in a dungeon more horrid than that which I had quitted. It was lower than the other, and nothing more diſmal, damp, and faetid, can be imagined. A few worn ſteps, juſt under the breach I had made, convinced me that that part of the wall had, as I had conjectured, been
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028486_0089_0FD923F48BF664A8"/>
formerly a door-way—but I was ſoon too dreadfully convinced of it, by an object which, when I adverted to my own ſituation, curdled my blood with horror. By the ſaint light which gleamed through the aperture I had made, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd a ruſty iron collar, chained to the wall—a hoop of iron, large enough to encloſe the waiſt of a man, hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, cloſe to the ground—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, amid a few ruſted chains, and the tattered remnants of cloth which had eſcaped putrefaction, lay in a heap the ſkeleton of the wretch who had thus ſhrunk from his fetters. The horrors with which I was ſtruck at this ſpectacle, did not, however, prevent my exploring my new place of confinement. I could find no door. Alas! upon this unhappy victim, the only door to the dungeon had, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, been walled up, as it was thought, for ever! In paſſing round this dungeon, I perceived the wind blew upon me from one corner, and, feeling the place, found that the walls were parted, either rifted by the bolt of heaven, or ſevered by the ſlow but ſure hand of time. At this ſpot, then, I renewed my labour. I will not trouble you with a detail of it. After infinite toil, for, though more decayed, the wall at this place was much thicker, than the former,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028486_0090_0FD923FA10EDF048"/>
I found my way, not many hours ago, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow winding paſſage, thro' which I aſcended into the houſe.—I proceeded, you may immagine, with extreme caution; nor did I diſcover all the horrors of my former ſituation, 'till I found that the whole of the premiſes were deſerted, and I was left to undergo the fate of the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able victim, whoſe remains I had ſo lately beheld. I juſt now diſcovered the remains of ſome ſalted proviſions, of which I have had the prudence to eat but ſparingly, and which perhaps, may not be unwelcome to you. What is become of my friend Count Tancred and the lady, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. She is, I ſuppoſe, carried off, and when I reflect on my own ſituation, I can ſcarcely entertain a hope that he is yet alive.</q>

brought forth the little ſtore of proviſions which he had diſcovered. The fire was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.

                     <p>Anſelmo and his Ellenor were too much occupied with each other to interrupt them, nor would they, in ſpite of the remonſtrances of Barbara, who had alone the diſcretion to reflect that their preſent ſituation was not wholly free from danger, have ſuffered a thought to intrude on the bliſs of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had not the ſtep of ſome perſons in the hall rouſed them from this ſtate of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo, ſtarting up, drew his ſword, and Rhinaldo, whom his own exertions and thoſe of his friends, tho' they could wholly liberate, had freed from ſo much of chains, that they were no longer an incumbrance, ſeized the firſt weapon he could meet with, and they both moved towards the paſſage which led to the hall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:028486_0092_0FD923FF96C58B48"/>
They perceived two men advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, one of whom bore a torch in his hand.</p>
                     <p>"Let us ſearch," ſaid he, who bore the torch, "through every corner of this ſeat of horrors. If he is alive I will find him."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo knew the voice of Tancred. "Count Tancred! and living!' cried Rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldo; "thro' what miracle is it that I am again permitted to embrace my friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Rhinaldo! exclaimed Tancred. "Then the object of my ſearch is attained—bleſſed be heaven for the ſafety of my deliverer!"</p>
                     <p>"But how could you eſcape," reſumed Rhinaldo, "the danger in which we were both involved?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid Tancred, "I am indebted for my unhappy life to the lovelieſt—the beſt of women!—but no more of that—the thought is too much—Oh! let me but live to return the boon ſhe gave!—to die for her!—but I rave—To make ſhort of my ſtory—"When I laſt ſaw you, we were occupied in the defence of the Counteſs. While we were engaged with a party, too numerous for any but deſperate men to contend with,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028486_0093_0FD9240132A79EF0"/>
another band ſeized the Counteſs, and bore her away. I left your ſide, my friend, and ruſhed to her aſſiſtance. I was ſtruck down by a partizan—another arm was lifted for my deſtruction—the Counteſs caught hold of it—ſhe put her purſe into the hand of the ſoldier, and begged he would make his miſtreſs his debtor, by ſaving my life. She promiſed the higheſt rewards. Intereſt, or, as I have reaſon to believe from his late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct humanity, determined this brave fellow. On the inſtant he beſtrode me, fallen as I was, his comrades were quickly occupied in conveying away the Counteſs; and when he found himſelf free from obſervation, he raiſed me from the ground, and carried me to a private part of the Caſtle, whither, after the departure of Rhodolpho, he returned with his father, a woodman, of this foreſt, and conveyed me to his cottage. I had there ſo little recovered the effect of the blow I had received, that I ſcarcely knew what they did; but was ſoon re-eſtabliſhed by the care that was taken of me. Behold my deliverer—he has reſolved to ſhare my fortune—"</p>
                     <p>As Count Tancred was proceeding, Rhinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do was alarmed by the trampling of horſes. They pauſed and liſtened—the noiſe increaſed—the voices of men were diſtinctly heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:028486_0094_0FD9240528345008"/>
"We are ſurrounded," cried Anſelmo. "Rhodolpho's party have traced us."</p>
                     <p>"There is then but one ſtep to take," ſaid Rhinaldo. "Follow me."</p>
                     <p>Iſabel and her companions ſeemed now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to terror. They ſuffered themſelves to be led in ſilence. Rhinaldo conducted them up a back ſtaircaſe, towards the room in which the Counteſs had been confined. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the little lumber room, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the battered armour. From this place Rhinaldo took the precaution to arm himſelf. He took down ſome of the ſwords, but they were wholly unſerviceable. At laſt he choſe a ſtrong and heavy pole axe, and ſhoving back the pannel, diſcovered to his friends the iron door. This door he opened, and bidding the forlorn party, which he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, enter the apartment, he replaced the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel as carefully as poſſible, and joined his friends below.</p>
                     <p>They were convinced that the noiſe they had heard proceeded from ſome perſons who had purſued them from the Caſtle of Rhodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, and who, probably, ſuſpecting that if they ſhould by chance have taken that road, they would retire to the old manſion for ſhelter, or, perhaps, attracted by the light
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028486_0095_0FD9240846975120"/>
of the fire they had kindled, or of the taper which Rhinaldo had procured, were induced to ſearch for them there.</p>
                     <p>They formed many conjectures as to the number of their enemies; at the ſuppoſed magnitude of which they were not ſo much alarmed, as at the idea that Rhodolpho might be among them, who had, moſt probably, been acquainted by his father with the ſecret of the pannel—a ſecret, as yet, perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divulged to any other perſon.</p>
                     <p>Their fears, however, as to the preſence of Rhodolpho, proved on this occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. He was on the ſucceeding day to join Aſtolpho with his company of men at arms, and had only detached on this purſuit a pretty numerous train of domeſtics, well armed and headed by two of his moſt truſty adherents.</p>
                     <p>While they ſtood wrapt in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and in a mournful ſilence the reſult of them, they were arouſed by the ſound of many ſteps aſcending the ſtairs, which led to the little lumber room. They liſtened in a ſtate of breathleſs expectation and terror.—They had not yet cloſed to the iron door; nor indeed could its ſtrength avail them, as all the faſtnings were on the outer ſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="unknown:028486_0096_0FD9240E95086E10"/>
They heard a perſon walk ſlowly round the lumber room. What were their ſenſations when he exclaimed, "We can go no farther this way—let us return."</p>
                     <p>This was aſſented to by a companion who was with him, and they heard, with a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſcarcely to be deſcribed, their returning footſteps on the ſtaircaſe which they had juſt aſcended.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo and his companions continued in their place of concealment for half an hour, before they judged it prudent to make any attempt towards diſcovering whether their purſuers had retired; for, in their ſecluded ſituation, they could hear nothing.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo then ſlowly began to open the pannel, when an object preſented itſelf, which induced him to cloſe it again with a haſte which ſtruck a ſudden terror to the hearts of his companions.</p>
                     <p>This object was the face of a man. This perſon, who bore a light in his hand, was aſcending the ſtaircaſe when Rhinaldo percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, who encouraged a faint hope, that, from the diſtance he was at, the taper he bore could not caſt any ſtrong reflection on the walls of the room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="unknown:028486_0097_0FD924126BE73260"/>
This hope, however, ſoon died away. They heard a clattering noiſe againſt the pannel itſelf, and immediately prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive this intruder in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to prevent, if poſſible, any diſcovery through his means.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> afterwards the noiſe ceaſed, and they heard the footſteps of this perſon deſcending the ſtaircaſe, as they immediately conjectured, to procure aſſiſtance. They now gave themſelves up for loſt, and an hour paſſed before Rhinaldo dared again attempt to open the pannel. He proceeded cautiouſly; but his effort was accompanied by a noiſe he could not account for; and a heavy object fell inwards againſt his legs. This he ſoon diſcovered to be a cuiraſs, which indeed the perſon who had cauſed them ſo much alarm had placed there.</p>
                     <p>This perſon had returned to this ancient armoury, to try if he could accommodate himſelf with ſome pieces of more value than his own—but probably retired diſappointed in his aim.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo now recovered from this new alarm, and proceeded cautiouſly towards the head of the great ſtaircaſe. When he arrived there, he heard the murmer of voices at the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028486_0098_0FD92414B1601B30"/>
door of the hall, and found that their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, tired of their vain ſearch, were about to mount their horſes and retire. He waited 'till he heard them paſs over the drawbridge, and then returning to his friends, acquainted them with this event.</p>
                     <p>Upon intelligence ſo welcome, they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their place of concealment, and after waiting 'till they judged that their purſuers had proceeded far enough <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They had no ſooner gained the foreſt, than Iſabel, throwing her arms round her Couſin, and faithful attendant, mingled her tears with theirs; and Rhinaldo and Anſelmo, preſſing Iſabel and Ellenor gently to their breaſts, joined with them in pouring forth their thanks to heaven for their ſignal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; while Count Tancred contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, in deep and ſilent ſorrow, the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fate which involved that adored object, for whom alone he thought the life he had ſo lately retrieved worth preſerving.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH Rhinaldo, the Lady Iſabel, and their friends, were delivered from their late peril, it was ſtill a matter of ſerious deliberation in what manner they ſhould now proceed. To remain where they were 'till the day ſhould dawn, would render them liable to all the dangers that might reſult from a diſcovery. It was reſolved, therefore, dark as the night was, to proceed, and they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onward, 'till the day broke upon them, in a ſmall opening of the foreſt.</p>
                     <p>A ſtream, which broke from the ſummit of a lofty cliff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that bounded them on one ſide, and ran murmuring along the foot of it, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to halt here for a ſhort time, and take that repoſe, of which they were ſo much in need. After drinking of this ſtream, and reſting themſelves, they purſued their journey.</p>

Though the dread of being overtaken had ſupported them thro' more than common exertions, yet nature began, at length, to be exhauſted—and Iſabel, diſſolving into tears, declared that ſhe muſt die where ſhe was, for ſhe could proceed no farther; ſaying this, ſhe ſunk into Rhinaldo's arms, who laid her gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the turf, and, ſupporting her head on his breaſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Anſelmo, Ellenor, and Barbara, (the two latter of whom felt a degree of faintneſs and laſſitude almoſt equal to that of the fainting Iſabel,) knew not what to do. At length An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo perceiving that the cliff, from which the ſtream took its courſe, ſtill appeared through the tops of the trees on his right hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Count Tancred, if poſſible, to climb it, that from its ſummit they might explore the country around, under the precarious hope that ſome relief might poſſibly be at hand. Impreſſed with this idea, they made their way towards it, and had ſcarcely gained the margin of the rivulet, when, to their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſurpriſe and joy, they ſaw the eminence terminate at ſome diſtance from them, by an eaſy deſcent, interſperſed with clumps of trees, leaving the rivulet to wind through a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful valley, which divided the foreſt as far as the eye could reach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:028486_0102_0FD9242155ED3860"/>
At the bottom of this deſcent, and cloſe on the banks of the rivulet, they diſcovered a cottage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and haſtened towards it, to endeavour to procure relief.</p>
                     <p>They had ſcarcely gained the wooden bridge, by which it communicated with the valley, when a man advanced from the cottage door to meet them. What was the ſurpriſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo, when he perceived this man to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giero.</p>
                     <p>After expreſſing his aſtoniſhment at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unexpected, he communicated to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giero the ſituation in which he had left his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and they returned to the ſpot where Iſabel had ſunk under her fatigue. They found her ſtill ſupported by Rhinaldo, and her Couſin and attendant ſitting by her, in a dreary ſilence. Intelligence of the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted relief which was at hand gave ſome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to their drooping ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Iſabel aroſe, with the aſſiſtance of Rhinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, and leaning on his arm, and upheld by Count Tancred on the other ſide, ſhe followed Anſelmo, who ſupported the feeble ſteps of his weary Ellenor, while Rugiero ſerved them as a guide, and Barbara leaning on the attendant of Count Tancred, followed her lady.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028486_0103_0FD92426E4688A98"/>
The owner of the dwelling received them with an honeſt though ruſtic hoſpitality. He deſired his wife, who was nothing backward in her civilities, to attend to the lady, for as yet he diſcovered but one, while he prepared a homely meal for the reſt, whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ſtand in great need of refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>Iſabel and Ellenor were conducted by the old woman, after ſhe had been informed of the ſecret of their ſex, to a comfortable bed, on which they threw themſelves without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing; and Barbara, at their deſire, placing herſelf by their ſide, they ſoon fell into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound and refreſhing ſleep.</p>
                     <p>During this period, Rugiero viſited Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo's wounds. They had been originally flight, and a good conſtitution had already ſo far contributed to their cure, that this ſkilful domeſtic found his labours limited to the freeing his maſter from the traces of the blood which had originally iſſued from them. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore dreſſed him as well as the bareneſs of his toilet would permit, and perſuaded him to take, in an eaſy chair, that repoſe of which he ſtood ſo much in need, he related to Count Anſelmo thoſe circumſtances, which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him ſince they had loſt him in the foreſt. He told him of the accident which had happened to his horſe, which he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe never roſe from the ſpot where he fell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028486_0104_0FD9242889861088"/>
"I waited," continued Rugiero, "under the tree, to which I had crept for ſhelter, till the ſtorm had in ſome meaſure abated, when I returned to try if I could raiſe my horſe. After ſeveral efforts I found it impracticable, and was finally obliged to give over the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, on hearing the trampling of a body of horſemen on the road. As it appeared to me probable that theſe were of Count Rhodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho's party, I turned immediately out of the path, and making acroſs the foreſt, which at that place is tolerably open, I had the good luck, before I had proceeded far, to arrive at the banks of this rivulet, and, finding no bridge acroſs it, purſued my path along its margin, 'till I diſcovered this cottage.</p>
                     <p>"The old pair, who inhabit it, are vaſſals to Count Rhodolpho, but having hoarded ſome money in the ſervice of the father of the late Count de St. Amand, are in eaſy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.—This I learned from themſelves on my arrival. They appear to be honeſt people, yet I cannot conceal from your lordſhip my apprehenſions that we are by no means in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If Count Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho ſhould diſperſe his party through the foreſt in ſearch of us, ſome of them will, in all probability, find their way to this cottage."</p>

                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028486_0105_0FD9242EC817C318"/>
After a few hours paſſed in ſleep, the Lady Iſabel aroſe, much refreſhed, and awakening her Couſin and attendant; they joined Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo and his friends.</p>
                     <p>A conſultation again took place.—Anſelmo communicated to his friends the fears of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giero, and it was agreed, after ſome delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould ſeek the Caſtle of Count Roderic, Rhinaldo's father, where they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves ſure of protection.</p>
                     <p>Though they were not acquainted with the direct road to it, they knew in what part of the country it lay; and Rugiero heſitated not to declare, that he thought he could undertake to conduct them towards it. Having then gratified their kind hoſts, and provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome refreſhments for their journey they departed, and croſſing into a thicker part of the foreſt, to avoid being diſcovered, they turned their ſteps towards that part of the country in which Rugiero conjectured the Count Roderic's Caſtle lay.</p>
                     <p>After a march of ſome hours, they ſtopped to refreſh themſelves, and ſetting forward again purſued their journey 'till the ſhades of evening began again to overtake them.</p>
                     <p>Though they had travelled far, there was yet no appearance of the Caſtle; and from
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028486_0106_0FD92431C441F358"/>
the anſwers of Rugiero, to the inceſſant que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which the fears of Lady Iſabel ſuggeſted, it was perceived that he was at leaſt more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his knowledge then he had been in the morning.</p>
                     <p>This diſcovery had an affect on the ſpirits of the whole party. The neceſſity of ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their fair companions, for another night, to the inclemency of the ſkies, gave a double portion of anguiſh to the breaſts of Anſelmo, and Rhinaldo, and they moved onward in a mournful ſilence, which every one ſeemed too much occupied by his own thoughts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt.</p>
                     <p>As they were thus ſlowly travelling onward they arrived at a riſing ground, on which was erected a ſtone croſs.—This mark Rugiero no ſooner perceived, than he ſuddenly exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he knew the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>"To the right," ſaid he, "is an hermitage belonging to the Convent of St. Julian; and to the left, within the diſtance of half a mile, the road, which leads to Count Roderic's Caſtle, which cannot be more than ſix miles from us."</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo propoſed that they ſhould turn towards the hermitage, where the Lady Iſabel and her Couſin, who ſeemed worn out with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028486_0107_0FD92434D4797868"/>
fatigue, might reſt 'till the morning; but theſe ladies appeared to have collected freſh ſpirits from the information of Rugiero, and anxious to arrive at a place of ſafety, declared that they were very well enabled to reach the Caſtle, urging Rhinaldo to proceed with ſo much eagerneſs, that the plan was, as it turned out, moſt unluckily adopted.</p>
                     <p>They ſoon reached the road, but had not travelled far along it, when, as they turned the corner of a wood, which projected towards the road, they were overtaken by a troop of cavalry, who had no ſooner diſcovered, than they gallopped immediately towards them.</p>
                     <p>At the head of this troop they quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Rhodolpho, who immediately ordered them to be ſurrounded and diſarmed.</p>
                     <p>The horſemen, who conſiſted of Rhodolpho's company of men at arms, attended by their valets, immediately preſſed upon them.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, prepared to defend the Princeſs and her Couſin to the laſt extremity, drew up his little band, with their backs to the wood, and ſeeing Rhodolpho preſs onwards with the reſt, ſprung forward, and aimed a blow at him with his pole-axe, which, as he ſtooped to avoid it, alighted on his ſhoulder, and brought him to the ground.</p>

                     <p>This accident occupied part of his troop, who ſurrounded him. As ſoon as he recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf, he gave orders that the women, whoſe habits he diſcribed, ſhould be ſeized, while the men were engaged, and carried off.</p>
                     <p>This command was ſpeedily executed by the valets, who, being unarmed, could the more readily diſmount.—While Rhinaldo and his friends were preſſed by the horſemen, theſe fellows ſeized on the Princeſs and her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in ſpite of their efforts, their tears and ſupplications, bore them away.</p>
                     <p>This was not done without oppoſition from their little party, who, upon hearing the ſhrieks of the women, made a daring effort to join them; but preſſed on all ſides by the horſemen, another body of whom formed up to cover the retreat of thoſe who bore off the Princeſs, they were finally compelled to retire, and ſeek ſhelter in the wood, which they did without difficulty, for the horſemen, who were completely and heavily armed, having no room to charge them, found themſelves rather incumbered than aſſiſted by their lances,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028486_0109_0FD9243B9A4C21C8"/>

                     <p>It would be difficult to paint the deſpair which ſeized on Rhinaldo and Anſelmo at this fatal event.

                     <p>It was at laſt reſolved that they ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their way to the Caſtle, when their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was called towards Count Tancred, who was ſitting at the foot of a tree. He had received a wound, from the thruſt of a lance, in his arm and it bled ſo profuſely, that there was little hope of his being able to walk ſo far as to the Caſtle that evening; and Rugiero, who bound up his wound, propoſed that they ſhould ſeek ſhelter for the night, at the hermitage he had mentioned, which was not a great diſtance, and proceed in the morning towards the Caſtle. This advice was in their preſent ſituation, too ſalutary to be neglected, and they returned to the ſtone croſs, which they had ſo lately left, whence Rugiero conducted them to the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage.</p>

                     <p>THE venerable inhabitant of the place had not yet lighted his lamp, but ſat at the door of his cavern, wrapt in meditation. He advanced to meet them with a benevolent ſmile, and offered them the ſhelter of his lowly roof, in terms which a long acquaintance with the more poliſhed ſociety among mankind could alone communicate; and he no ſooner perceived the ſituation of Count Tancred, than he produced ſome medicinal ſtores, for which he was much famed among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring poor, and inſpecting the wound, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to it a dreſſing, from the experienced virtues of which he promiſed himſelf a ſpeedy ſucceſs. He then "ſpread his vegetable ſtore" before his gueſts; nor was this all—the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his ruſtic neighbours had ſupplied him with more ſubſtantial food, of which he ſometimes, though ſparingly, partook.</p>
                     <p>He could not but perceive the gloom and deſpodency which hung over ſome of his gueſts and which all their efforts to gratify him by a cheerful acceptance of his favours, could not diſpel; but his ſkill in mankind had taught <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028486_0111_0FD92442CB12F218"/>
that were it ſeeks concealment, it is generally too poignant to be relieved by communication.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, however, who knew not of any motive he had to conceal himſelf, ſo near to his father's Caſtle, and who, had any ſuch motive occurred, would have diſdained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment with any one who belonged to the convent of St. Julian, made himſelf readily known to the hermit, and introduced his friends Anſelmo and Tancred.</p>
                     <p>The venerable hermit received this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with politeneſs, but a viſible reſerve hung over him during the reſt of the repaſt, which Rugiero, the moſt unconcerned of the gueſts, except Count Tancred's deliverer, was the firſt to notice.</p>
                     <p>It perplexed this faithful ſervant, and he watched an opportunity to communicate hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> obſervation to his maſter.—This, however, he waited in vain to obtain.</p>
                     <p>The hermit, as ſoon as their frugal repaſt was finiſhed, begged that Rhinaldo would indulge him, by accompanying him round his little domains, which it had been for many years hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The moon had now ariſen, and, after ſome general obſervations on the beauty of the place, which, at ſuch a ſeaſon, would have had a thouſand charms for any boſom leſs torn with conflicting paſſions than that of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, the hermit addreſſed him as follows:</p>
                     <p>"Count Rhinaldo, I am doomed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to you intelligence, of which I find by your converſation you are yet ignorant, and which muſt ſeverely afflict you."</p>
                     <p>"Proceed," ſaid Rhinaldo, firmly—"af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what I have ſuffered to-day, all other ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows muſt be light."</p>
                     <p>"Count Roderic's Caſtle," continued the hermit, "is in the hands of the king."</p>
                     <p>"Has my father then," ſaid Rhinaldo, in a tone of grief, "ſided with the uſurper? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! why was not I permitted to communicate to him that ſecret, the concealment of which has produced ſo much miſchief; for had he known that his lawful ſovereign—"</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid the hermit, "your father is himſelf a priſoner, if—if—he lives."</p>
                     <p>"If he lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid Rhinaldo, ſtarting back, and a viſible paleneſs overſpread his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:028486_0113_0FD9244A8D466C18"/>
The king," ſaid the hermit, "ſurprized him—no ſooner had the plot, in which you embarked, failed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than Aſtolpho ſet out ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily for the frontiers. He arrived here before any intelligence could be received, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired admiſſion to the Caſtle, as your father's gueſt, for a few days. Your father, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that he could have any freſh cauſe of diſpleaſure, and indeed unable, on ſo ſudden an occaſion, to prevent his admiſſion, was compelled to receive him; and he was very ſpeedily followed by a force which would have proved formidable, had his intention been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged. Thus has he contrived to ſit down before his enemies, occupying a very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable poſt. Our friends, however, yet poſſeſs the mount of St. Julian, where they are very ſtrong."</p>
                     <p>"And has no intelligence of the fate of my father yet reached you?"</p>
                     <p>"None, but the melancholy and uncertain rumour which I have already diſcloſed to you."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo ſeemed wrapt, for a moment, in gloomy reflections. He ſtarted, after a pauſe, from his reverie.—"And father Anthony?" ſaid Rhinaldo, in a heſitating voice.</p>
                     <p>"My ſon, I commend thy caution," ſaid the hermit; "but father Anthony is now
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028486_0114_0FD9244E1C9FD9B0"/>
acknowledged for that which he is. Yes," continued the venerable anchorite, his eyes gleaming with the fire of youth as he ſpoke, "our lawful lord and ſovereign, Emanuel, commands the forces on Mount St. Julian, and may ſucceſs attend his arms! His ſituation indeed, at preſent, is not without danger; but if the diverſion on the weſtern frontiers, which is already formidable, ſhould draw off any ſtrong detachment of Aſtolpho's forces, what may we not expect?"</p>
                     <p>"Thou ſpeakeſt with a ſire that would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"Would I could join my brethren of the Mount in arms!" replied the hermit. "But even here I may not prove wholly uſeleſs."</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo now returned to join his friends, and the hermit ſpread before them ſome mats, the work of his own hands, compoſed of graſs and ruſhes; but the ſofteſt down could not have allured Rhinaldo to ſlumber. He revolved in his mind the ſituation of his father; and the loſs of Iſabel, which had ſo deeply afflicted him, ſeemed to loſe ſome of the bitterneſs with which it had overwhelmed him.</p>
                     <p>He judged that his own conduct, which he now cenſured as haſty and raſh, had involved that honoured parent in diſgrace and ruin—

perhaps had given him up a prey to the knife of the ſecret aſſaſſin. He could not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment endure the pang of a thought ſo pregnant with horror. He reſolved at all events to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Caſtle, and learn the fate of his father, that, if he ſtill lived, he might learn his deſtiny, and participate his misfortunes; and, if dead, might revenge his death, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf a ſacrifice to the fatal conſequences of his raſh and myſterious enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo, whoſe loſs would not permit him to enjoy a large portion of repoſe than fell to the lot of Rhinaldo, left his couch with the firſt dawn of day, and perceived his friend already riſen, and tracing, with penſive ſtep, the beautiful, yet gloomy receſſes, with which the neighbourhood of the hermitage abounded.</p>
                     <p>Here Rhinaldo related to him the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which he had received from the hermit, and concluded with his fixed determination to diſguiſe himſelf, and at all events, if poſſible, gain acceſs to the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>The venerable father now joined them, and having in vain endeavoured to point out to Rhinaldo the raſhneſs of his undertaking, was compelled to acquieſce in his determination, and offered to aſſiſt in preparing him for the perpetration of his deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028486_0116_0FD92456466B9DA0"/>
Anſelmo, when he heard that the rallying point of the party which had been ſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in the enterpriſe, of which he had been the leader, was ſo near the ſpot where he now was, reſolved to join the faithful adherents of Emanuel at the convent of St. Julian; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence from the hermit of a paſs by which he might gain the out-poſts, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time the troops of Aſtolpho, and a ſecret word, which would procure him ready admiſſion to their leaders.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, in purſuance of his deſign, cut his hair cloſe to his head; and having other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by the aſſiſtance and advice of his friends, ſo diſguiſed his perſon, that there was little dread of his being diſcovered, changed his dreſs for that of the man who had attended Count Tancred, and, having taken a friendly leave of that nobleman, whoſe wound became ſo much inflamed, as to threaten him with ſome confinement in the hermitage, he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, accompanied by Count Anſelmo and his faithful Rugiero.</p>
                     <p>When they had proceeded about three miles on their journey, Count Anſelmo, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Rugiero, whom his lord, in ſpite of all his intreaties, refuſed to admit to a ſhare in the adventure he was about to undertake, leſt his preſence ſhould lead to a diſcovery, quitted

Rhinaldo to purſue the road which the hermit had pointed out to him.</p>
                     <p>Deep in meditation on his intended ſcheme, and revolving in his mind plan after plan, now adopting and now rejecting them, as they offered themſelves for his conſideration, Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo came within ſight of his father's Caſtle, before any ſettled ſyſtem of operation had ſuggeſted itſelf to him.</p>
                     <p>While he was thus muſing, his eyes fixed with a mournful gaze on the well-known tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, which recalled to his memory many of the cheerful and innocent hours of childhood, he came ſuddenly upon a guard of Aſtolpho's ſoldiers, who were poſted on one of the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>The centinel who was on duty aſked him who he was? and where he was going? As he was heſitating what anſwer he ſhould give, he perceived the corporal, who was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding officer of this party, miſerably thrumming upon a harp.</p>
                     <p>He anſwered, "that he was a poor harper, who had been robbed in the foreſt of that which was the only means of his ſubſiſtence—his harp."</p>
                     <p>This was a lure, from which he hoped to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028486_0118_0FD9245BA7DADD98"/>
derive ſome advantage, for he was well ſkilled in this inſtrumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, which had formed great part of his amuſement during his youthful days. Nor was he deceived in his expectations. The corporal aroſe upon hearing this, and, giving him the inſtrument, deſired him to play. He had no ſooner touched it, than the whole guard forgot their duty. They received him as if he had been an old acquaintance, and the corporal placing him on the ſeat which he had juſt occupied, they ſat in a circle round him, liſtening to the ſtrains which flowed from his inſtrument in ſilent rapture.</p>
                     <p>To this officer he particular attached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo won upon him, by imparting to him a few inſtructions concerning the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſo much admired, that when he was relieved, he ſwore he would not part with ſo valuable a friend, but conducted him to the guardhouſe of the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>He was ſoon familiarized among the ſoldiers, and frequently urged to enliſt among them, but telling his friend, the corporal, frankly, that he did not like the ſituation, and wiſhed to be placed in ſervice, that officer ſoon intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to one of the ſervants of the houſe, who was like himſelf fond of muſic; and by the good offices of this patron, Rhinaldo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſoon enrolled among the liveried attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants on Aſtolpho.</p>

                     <p>THUS introduced to his paternal manſion, he mingled unnoticed with the ſervile herd, among whom he was enrolled, and traced, in this obſcure ſituation, thoſe ſtately apartments, which had rung with gratulatory acclamations at his birth, and where his youth had been foſtered with the moſt anxious care.</p>
                     <p>The ſplendid armour which adorned the hall, had proved the hardy deeds of a long line of warlike anceſtors; and the banners which waved over them, were badges of their illuſtrious deſcent.</p>
                     <p>On the morning ſucceeding the day of his admiſſion to the Caſtle, as he was employed, with others, in preparing a repaſt, Aſtolpho, attended by the chief officers who had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him on this expedition, entered the hall. He was leaning on one of his train in cloſe and familiar converſe. How was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of Rhinaldo arouſed, when he found his favourite to be his cruel enemy Rhodolpho!</p>

                        </gap>ven at the ſide of Aſtolpho, a victim to his own wrongs, and the tears of his adored Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. But the idea of this lovely maiden preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to his imagination, at a fortunate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, to check the wild frenzy which had ſeized him.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho was in the Caſtle. Was it not probable that Iſabel was there too? The hope, faint as it at firſt appeared, that ſhe might, even now, be under the ſame roof with him—that, unknown as he was, ſome favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſerving her might occur to him, ſoothed his tranſports, and he retired, as ſoon as the duties of his office would permit him, to meditate, in ſolitude, on a ſubject, which ſo amply engroſſed his contemplation. But he had ſoon, alas! a deeper ſubject for meditation; for
<q>
                           <l>Meditation, even to madneſs.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was no longer a ſubject of doubt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment in the Caſtle, that Roderic the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the lord of the domain, the father of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo! had been murdered, within half a league of the Caſtle, and the finger of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion pointed at Aſtolpho.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:028486_0121_0FD92465999E3270"/>
Indeed, when the circumſtances attending this tranſaction were conſidered, little doubt could be entertained on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Roderic had not been ſeen ſince he had wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed the king to the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>A very ſhort time had ſufficed to acquaint him with Aſtolpho's deſign, and at day-break on the enſuing morning, (for it was evening when Aſtolpho arrived,) he had departed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly armed, with a few truſty attendants. It was thought that Aſtolpho was aware of this departure, and winked at it, though Count Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric could have but one deſign in it, which was to join his friends in the weſt, for, within half a league of the Caſtle, he was ſet upon by a party, and killed with the ſhot of an arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſs, pointed directly at his breaſt, ſo cloſe that his corſlet was unable to reſiſt the balls.</p>
                     <p>Not one of his attendants eſcaped; but the tranſaction was witneſſed by ſome who knew his armour. They ſought afterwards for the body, but that, as well as thoſe of his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, was carried off, and probably for reaſons known to Aſtolpho, if he were really the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this murder, buried in ſome ſacred place.</p>
                     <p>The reflections of Rhinaldo upon this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cataſtrophe, were the moſt bitter that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028486_0122_0FD92469E9C43320"/>
grief and unavailing remorſe could furniſh. He looked upon himſelf as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of his father. A ſettled gloom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his mind, and nothing but the hope of revenge could have inſtigated him to perform the taſk he had undertaken, or have procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, for a moment, a diſcovery which muſt have proved fatal to him.</p>
                     <p>From theſe more than melancholy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was arouſed by intelligence which diverted his affections into a different channel. He learned that the Princeſs was actually, as he ſuſpected, in the Caſtle; but nobody whom he could converſe with had yet ſeen her. It was alſo reported that Rhodolpho was ſoon to be married to her.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, acquainted as he was with the Caſtle from the days of his earlieſt youth, knew that, if ſhe was actually there, ſhe could not be long concealed from him, and reſolved to watch the motions of Rhodolpho with a ſcrutinizing eye.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time hoſtilities were vigorouſly carried on between the two parties.</p>
                     <p>Aſtolpho had a very ſtrong force with him at the Caſtle, with which he continued to make vigorous aſſaults againſt the Priory; but, beſides that, that poſt was almoſt impregnable

—it was defended by the moſt brave and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced knights—for ſuch had been the fathers of St. Julian, before they devoted their days to the duties of religion.</p>
                     <p>The wound which had detained Count Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred at the hermitage, proved more obſtinate than he had expected; nor did the ſtate of his mind in any way contribute to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding its cure; but he found, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the venerable hermit, much alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation to his ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>This holy father, who had long trod, in a diſtinguiſhed character, the buſy ſtage of the world, had not viewed mankind without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. His mind was, therefore, amply ſtored with true wiſdom, that which is born of ſound reflection upon long experience, and the ſublime truths of religion had ſoftened his heart to the frailties and infirmities of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, while they ſpread over his breaſt that delicious calm which they alone are capable of beſtowing.</p>
                     <p>Count Tancred, who, in communicating his griefs to ſuch a man, found the only alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation to his ſorrows of which they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, ſoon entruſted to him the ſecret of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>YOU will not, my venerable father, ſaid the Count, long wonder at the weight which oppreſſes my ſoul, and which, in ſpite of all efforts to throw it off, ſtill baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles my endeavours, when I relate to you my unhappy ſtory.</p>
                        <p>You are not ignorant, that our monarch Aſtolpho, ſurnamed the Proud, had a ſiſter many years younger than himſelf, whom, when upon the death of the great and good Emanuel, he mounted the throne of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy, he drew from the retirement in which ſhe had been 'till that period im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured.</p>
                        <p>The Princeſs Aſpaſia was at this time of ſuch tender years, that it was not judged proper to detain her long at court. The Caſtle of Montalban, than which none can be more delightfully ſituated, was fitted up in a moſt princely manner for her reſidence; and her houſehold was eſtabliſhed under the government and direction of a lady, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028486_0125_0FD92475696C2428"/>
Of this eſtabliſhment I had, what I then eſteemed, the good fortune to make one. In an age, little advanced beyond that of infancy, I was appointed one of the pages to the Princeſs.</p>
                        <p>Let me paſs over, my venerable father, thoſe hours, in which the ſeeds of a paſſion, which I ſhall carry with me to the grave, began to unfold themſelves.</p>

                        <p>The Princeſs ſoon diſtinguiſhed me—I adored her—we grew up together, and our paſſion ſtrengthened with our years.</p>
                        <p>Let me haſten to the concluſion of a tale, which too much oppreſſes me.</p>
                        <p>

In the time of the late wars, Aſtolpho ſcarcely during three years reſided for three months in the capital. The Princeſs, tho' of an age to grace the moſt diſtinguiſhed circles, by her underſtanding as well as her beauty, ſeemed to be forgotten, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without a murmer on her part, at the Caſtle of Montalban.</p>
                        <p>Happy period! Period! made up of the moſt delicious moments! To ſee her dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—to attend her as the ſweeteſt, the moſt grateful of duties urged me, was all my full ſatisfied heart had learned to wiſh! Alas! it was too ſoon to end. I became of an age, when it was deemed improper that I ſhould remain idle at home.</p>
                        <p>I was appointed to a command; and, with as much alacrity as a man can poſſeſs, who leaves behind him all to which his heart has learned to cleave, I joined the army. I was then ſtationed with the ſame brigade as Rhinaldo, and it was our fortune to ſee ſome ſevere ſervice together. I returned about the time when Aſtolpho ordered the Princeſs to court. She there became the theme of ceaſeleſs admiration.</p>
                        <p>Aſtolpho himſelf ſeemed to adore her, when ſuddenly, contrary to all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028486_0127_0FD9247C1E225B00"/>
in ſpite of her deteſtation towards the object—of her prayers and ſupplications—of the groans ſhe uttered—and the tears ſhe ſhed at his feet—he ſacrificed her to his ſtern and brutal favourite, the Count St. Amand.</p>
                        <p>Proud, vindictive, and remorſeleſs, this man ſeemed little ſoftened by the beauties which inflamed him; but bore his wrech-victim to a dreary Caſtle on the north of this foreſt, where, in ſolitude, ſhe was left to ſhed unavailing tears over the miſerable fate to which the unaccountable partiality of a brother, who, ſhe had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, loved her, had conſigned her a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prey.</p>
                        <p>What, alas! was my ſituation during this dreadful period! My deſpair was not to be concealed. It became ſo marked, that the cauſe of it began to be whiſpered at court. My frantic love at length, no longer to be reſtrained, burſt forth in an act, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the object of it, as well as myſelf, in the moſt wretched calamity.</p>
                        <p>I determined to obtain an interview, a laſt one, with the Princeſs, and then to ſeek in a foreign war that death, which the peaceful ſtate of my own country then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to my wiſhes.</p>

Unhappy reſolution! I bribed her ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and gained admittance to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. She was in her chamber, which ſhe ſeldom quitted. I found her employed in adding ſome ornaments to a mantle of ſtate which ſhe had formerly embroidered and deſtined for me, upon Aſtolpho's promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at her interceſſion, to appoint me, young as I was, to the office of Knight Marſhal, which is, as you well know, a poſt of great honour, and to which my birth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, though it is not inconſiderable, could ſcarcely, at ſo early a period, have entitled me.</p>
                        <p>She was weeping—weeping, as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, in an agony of ſorrow, as ſoon as her reſentment at the raſh action of which I had been guilty had ſubſided, over the unfortunate Tancred.</p>
                        <p>Let me hurry over this delicious though fatal interview. I told her my reſolve—we were both in tears—I was kneeling at her feet, bidding her adieu, and had my lips preſſed to her lovely hand, which was wet with my tears, and on which I imprinted a laſt kiſs, and was riſing to tear myſelf away for ever—when the Count, whether appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſervants I had corrupted, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the rumours which prevailed at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028486_0129_0FD9247FDAB8F140"/>
Court, and the ſettled ſorrow and diſguſt which the Princeſs could not conceal at the ſacrifice ſhe had been compelled to make, burſt into the room, attended by a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train of ſervants.</p>
                        <p>I was about to draw my ſword, when I was ſeized and diſarmed.</p>
                        <p>The brutality of the Count's nature now raged uncontrouled. He drew a poignard, as if about to murder his wife in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but a thought of a deeper revenge ſeemed to check this purpoſe. He ſmiled grimly on her, and, ſheathing the dagger, ordered me to be carried to a place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                        <p>We were both of us, the next morning, before the day broke, conveyed ſecretly to a ruinous manſion, which he paſſeſſes, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the verge of the foreſt, attended by himſelf and two ſervants, in whom he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confided.</p>
                        <p>The miſeries which the unhappy Aſpaſia endured, from the ſavage and unbridled cruelty of this monſter, during a month's confinement in that deſolate manſion, ſhe alone can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I was the tenant of a loathſome dungeon,

from which the hand of Providence, and the courage and conduct of my friend Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, relieved me. In what manner you have heard from himſelf. You have alſo heard how the Princeſs was again torn from us. But let me periſh ignobly, if I do not diſcover the miſcreant Rhodolpho, the baſe ſon of this inhuman father, if the earth does not conceal him.

Rhodolpho is as firmly fixed as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in the favour of Aſtolpho; and were another ſiſter to be ſacrificed, dear to that monarch as was Albina, ſhe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly become the ſacrifice of this connexion.</p>

                           </gap> with it. Liſten then to the ſtory I ſhall relate:—</p>
                        <p>It is now about fifteen years ſince Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy ſuſtained a loſs, which it has never yet recovered, in our great and good Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, when this half-brother Aſtolpho aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the throne. It was generally thought that Emanuel had periſhed in a hunting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which he was ſaperated from his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and in ſpite of all thoſe inquiries which the anxiety of a whole people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, he was never, for the ſpace of above fourteen years, heard of.</p>
                        <p>This ſuppoſition was rendered the more probable, as the part of the foreſt in which he was miſſed abounded with wolves of the largeſt and moſt ravenous kind.</p>
                        <p>His dauntleſs courage—the wiſdom which was diſplayed in every act of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028486_0132_0FD92485178B4478"/>
—the mildneſs and urbanity of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and manners, rendered the loſs of ſuch a king univerſally regretted. Nor was it without ſymptoms of gloom and diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Aſtolpho's title to the crown was confeſſed; and the daughter of Emanuel, though then in the age of abſolute infancy, did not want partizans, who ſuggeſted in very loud terms her right to the throne.</p>
                        <p>The party of Aſtolpho, however, who was indiſputably brave and ſkilful in the field, and who poſſeſſed ſome of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which allure popularity, ſoon ſilenced theſe murmurers, and he was proclaimed king.</p>
                        <p>Fourteen years had elapſed ſince the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent took place, when a ſtranger, poorly glad, but of a dignified and majeſtic mien, arrived towards the fall of night at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of St. Julian, and demanded of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour admiſſion into the brotherhood, pledging himſelf to make good his claim on the ſucceeding day.</p>
                        <p>The neceſſary qualification for a brother of our order is, that the candidate be a knight, who has for fifteen years ſerved his country bravely, faithfully, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="unknown:028486_0133_0FD92489EC09CDC0"/>
The ſtranger was preſented with ſome refreſhment after his journey, and conveyed to a cell, where he was left to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 'till the morning, when he was deſired to attend the ſuperior of the order.</p>
                        <p>When the ſtranger was admitted into the preſence of the ſuperior, he aſked him "if he knew him?"</p>
                        <p>The old man, who had lived for above thirty years in that retirement, had loſt all traces of his countenance.</p>
                        <p>"My father!" exclaimed the ſtranger, "if your pupil Emanuel, who followed your ſteps ſo inadequately at the battle of the Bucklers<note n="*" place="bottom">So called from a corps of infantry called Buckler Men, who fought with ſword and target, and whoſe gallant ſtand under the ſhelter of their bucklers, which were exceedingly large, ſaved the right wing of the army, commanded by the father of Emanuel in perſon, and turned the fortune of the day,</note> ſhould be ſtill living, might he hope protection from the brothers of St. Julian?"</p>
                        <p>The good old man aroſe from his ſeat at theſe words, and approached the ſtranger, for his eyes had begun allready to grow dim with age. He ſurveyed him for a ſhort
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028486_0134_0FD92491F4831D80"/>
time, and then falling at his feet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his knees,—"I have lived long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough!" exclaimed the venerable ſoldier; "am I permitted once more to behold my ſovereign!—one who has ſo long been the pride of my heart!—one whoſe death my age has ſo long lamented."</p>
                        <p>Emanuel (for he was the ſtranger) raiſing the old man, folded him in his arms, and aſked him whether he might confide a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, on which his life depended, to the reſt of the fathers!</p>
                        <p>Of this indeed he little doubted. He knew them all—for they had all been the companions of his youth, as renowned for their courage as their conduct, and he eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily gave credit to the venerable prior, when he took upon himſelf to anſwer for their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                        <p>The were immediately ſummoned, and Emanuel diſcovered himſelf to them, and related the circumſtances of the myſterious fate which enveloped him, nearly as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:—</p>

                     <q>
                        <p>ON the day which firſt beheld me torn from my kingdom, and doomed for fourteen years to a ſtate of dreary melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly confinement, I was purſuing the chace with my wanted eagerneſs, and found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, through the ſwiftneſs of my horſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all my companions and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, except my brother Aſtolpho, and his friend the Count St. Amand, who had changed their horſes, and were thus enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to keep up with me.</p>
                        <p>After riding for ſome conſiderable time, and finding ourſelves involved in the moſt intricate part of the foreſt, notwithſtanding the ſkill of the Count de St. Amand, who undertook to guide us, it was propoſed by that nobleman that we ſhould ſeek refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at a manſion of his, which he ſaid he was ſure could be at no great diſtance from the part of the foreſt in which we then were.</p>
                        <p>It proved, as he had conjectured, that we were near to this ſpot, and a ſhort time conducted us to it. It was an old building,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028486_0136_0FD92496566B8468"/>
ſpacious, and formerly, no doubt, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.</p>
                        <p>The Count apologized for the reception we were about to meet with, in a houſe where he maintained but few ſervants, and where he ſeldom reſided. It did not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, appear ſingular to me to be welcomed only by a ſingle domeſtic, who received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to attend to our horſes, and procure us ſome refreſhment; while we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Count himſelf to a ſpecious apartment. There a collation was ſoon ſpread, and we ate like men who had rode hard all the morning.</p>
                        <p>After dinner the Count propoſed to ſhew us the houſe, in the conſtruction of which, old as it was, he ſaid there were ſome things, deſerving attention.</p>
                        <p>After viewing many apartments, we were conducted up a ſtaircaſe into a ſmall room, in which were depoſited various pieces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; from this room, ſlipping aſide a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the wainſcot which concealed a door ſtrongly fortifyed with iron, the Count led us into an apartment tolerably ſpacious, but very cloomy, furniſhed with a bed, and other conveniences of a ſtately ſtructure, but of very antique faſhion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="unknown:028486_0137_0FD9249B9D58EC98"/>
In this apartment I was much ſurpriſed to find a man of a ſtern ferocious countenance and a robuſt make, whom, though I had not much noticed him before, I ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the ſervant who had attended at our entrance. He was armed with a cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs, had a ſword by his ſide, a dagger in his girdle, and hold a partizan in his hand. "I obſerved, with ſome ſurpriſe, that he did not move his hat, which he had on, at our approach; and a little alarmed at this circumſtance, as well as his general appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, from my own defenceleſs ſtate, (for I had ſet out in the morning armed only with a cutlaſs for the chace, which I had unbuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and thrown aſide, during our repaſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of my brother and the Count,) I turned round to look for Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, and perceived that he had not entered the room with us.</p>
                        <p>I had no time to waſte in conjectures on this circumſtance. The Count ſhut the door behind him, and, advancing towards the man, ſeized the partizan which he held in his hand, and pointing it to my breaſt, ſwore vehemently that if I ventered to ſtir, I ſhould die.</p>
                        <p>He then deſired the fellow to do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who, reaching down a pair of manacles,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028486_0138_0FD924A244EC0280"/>
which were hung to the wall, came forward to bind them on my wriſts.</p>
                        <p>Unarmed as I was, I diſdained to ſuffer this treatment tamely. I ſeized the partiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an which the Count held to my breaſt, and ſhould ſoon have wreſted it from him, had not his aſſociate come to his aſſiſtance, and; drawing his ſword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſworn he would plunge it to my heart it I did not deſiſt.</p>
                        <p>I found farther reſiſtance enſured my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate death, and was, at lenth, obliged to ſubmit. My hands were manacled, and, after being aſſured that if I proved tractable, my life would be ſafe, and I ſhould want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I was left to meditate on this ſingular tranſaction, the iron door being ſecured, as I could but too well hear, by many locks and bolts.</p>
                        <p>During fourteen years confinement, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw this fellow afterwards, and have great reaſon to believe, from what I have been ſince able to learn, that my brother and the Count made him attend them to the thickeſt of the foreſt upon my horſe, and there diſpatched him and my favourite beaſt together, as my horſes furniture, my cloak, (which in the heat of the chace I had given to the Count to carry,) and my cutlaſs, were
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028486_0139_0FD924A3173D5B28"/>
found at no conſiderable diſtance from each other, in the part of the foreſt which the wolvesmoſt infeſt, who had probably made a meal of this fellow and his horſe.</p>
                        <p>It was ſome time before I could ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently recollect my ſcattered ſenſes to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the apartment in which I was confined. This, however, I at lengh did. I found it ſupplied with every conveniency which could contribute to render confinement to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
                        <p>Among other things there was a good collection of books, which in ſuch a ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proved a treaſure.</p>
                        <p>The firſt idea with which I began the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of this apartment, was that of eſcaping. I ſurveyed it round; but the more I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it, the more was I mortifyed with a conviction of the impoſſibility of ſucceeding in any attempt of that kind.</p>
                        <p>The windows were very high, and ſo ſmall that it would have been impoſſible to force a man's body through them; tho' the opened gradually towards the inſide of the wall, which was very thick. The chimney was extremely narrow, as was indeed every outlet which was neceſſary to this chamber

of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>inement; and it was defended, as I found in an attempt I made to thruſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up it, by a ſtrong iron gate—perhaps by more than one—nay, if I had made my way to the roof, through the chimney, or had been able to ſqueeze my body through one of the windows, I ſhould ſcarcely have found myſelf in a better ſituation than in my apartment, which was at an immence diſtance from the ground.</p>
                        <p>I found that they had left for me ſome proviſions, a few bottles of wine, and ſome of water; and, as ſoon as the meloncholy ideas, with which my ſituations could not fail to impreſs me, would permit to think of gratifying the calls of nature, I took a ſlight repaſt, and throwing myſelf on the bed, I delivered myſelf to an agitated and broken ſlumber.</p>
                        <p>On the next morning I examined the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron caſed door. To this door you aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſome ſtone ſteps, from the apartment.</p>
                        <p>In returning from this examination, which ſtill contributed to damp my hopes to eſcape, I found, at the bottom of theſe ſteps, another door. It was very ſtrong, made of wood, and furniſhed with a maſſy lock and bolts, and in the centre of it was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028486_0141_0FD924AC198FC320"/>
ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe uſed in convents, which are turned upon a pivot, for the purpoſe of conveying things from the outſide to the perſons within.</p>
                        <p>While I was muſing upon theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I heard the bolts of the iron door unfaſtened, and the Count St. Amand ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red armed with more precaution than on the preceding day.</p>
                        <p>I upraided him with his treachery and diſloyalty, and approaching, with an intent to ſeize him, he drew his ſword, and ſwore that my life ſhould anſwer for any attempt on his perſon.</p>
                        <p>Sir," ſaid he, "if you will ſubmit with patience to your deſtiny, your confinement ſhall be rendered as little irkſome as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. You ſhall want for nothing—but, 'till the period of that confinement, you muſt not expect to ſee any perſon whatever. You ſhall be allowed pen and ink—and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a note into the box of this inner door, you will make known your wants, which will be ſupplied.</p>
                        <p>So ſaying, he threw me a key, that I might unlock my fetters, from which I was permitted for the future to be free, and from that moment I ſaw him no more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="unknown:028486_0142_0FD924B08CA22180"/>
I was, however, regularly ſupplied thro' the medium of this inner door, which he locked and bolted after him, with whatever I wanted, furniſhed always, as I had reaſon to believe, by himſelf in perſon, though I ſometimes ſuſpected, from the difference of the ſtep which I heard, a ſtep with which my ear was not unacquainted, that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſtolpho ſupplied his place.</p>
                        <p>I will not detain you with endleſs projects, and ſome futile attempts to eſcape, which always proved abortive, during a period of fourteen years confinement:—Let it ſuffice to ſay, that it was at laſt accompliſhed in the following ſingular manner:—</p>
                        <p>I was awakened one night by a terrible ſtorm—the wind ſhook the building to its foundation—the thunder broke in deaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I aroſe from my bed, and paced my chamber, deeply meditating on the awful horrors of the night, when a flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning darted full on the building, attended by a clap of thunder ſo terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I thought the tottering fabric would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len at one blow in ruins to the earth.</p>
                        <p>

I was ſtruck down, and lay for a ſhort time ſenſeleſs, and upon recovering myſelf, was preparing again to lie down on the bed, when, caſting my eyes to the other end of the room, I was ſtruck by an object which called all my attention.</p>

                        <p>I removed the rubbiſh with an eagerneſs which almoſt fruſtrated its own intent, and ſqueezing my body through the crevice, perceived with a rapture, which I cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, that my eſcape from my priſon was become almoſt certain, if I would hazard the attempt.</p>
                        <p>I fell on my knees on the ſpot were I ſtood, and amid the awful horrors of the ſtorm, returned thanks to that Providence whom it had pleaſed thus almoſt miraculouſly to relieve me from ſo long and melancholy an impriſonment.</p>

The lightning (the near approach of which I had ſo ſenſibly felt) had fallen on one of the turrets of this old manſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the apartment in which I was confined, and having torn off the roof, the battlements, and great part of the wall, had left moſt of the ſtone ſtaircaſe within it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.—When I got through the breach which the ſtorm had made, I found myſelf on one of the ſteps of this ſtaircaſe which now ſtood, undefended by any wall or bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate, winding down of the outſide of the building.</p>
                        <p>The ſight of it was indeed tremendous. The lightning diſcovered to me the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the moat beneath, at an immenſe diſtance.</p>

After ſome riſque from the looſneſs of my footing, and the power of the wind, I arrived at laſt ſafely at the bottom, and found myſelf within the manſion.</p>
                        <p>Whether, during my confinement, any ſervants had been kept at this place, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the houſe had been deſerted. I do not know. I explored my way through the dark receſſes into which the ſtaircaſe had led me, and after much difficulty, undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by any one, probably becauſe, if there were ſervants in the houſe, the ſtorm pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their hearing me, I found my way out at the door of the hall, and gained the forrest, where I paſſed a night of rapture, unabated by the howling of the ſtorm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me:</p>
                        <p>In the morning I made my way to the cottage, whoſe inmates, little imagining they were protecting their monarch, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me ſhelter and food. They ſhall not, however, repent their hoſpitality, if I ſhould be fortunate enough to regain poſſeſſion of my throne. From this cottage I am come to ſeek farther ſhelter with you.</p>

                     <p>Such was the ſtory which Emanuel related to the prior and community of St. Julian's—in the courſe of which it will occur to every

one as a ſingular circumſtance, that, inſtead of ſubjecting themſelves to the hazard of the king's eſcape from his place of confinement, the conſpirators did not immediately take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life.</p>
                     <p>This was entirely owing to the ſuperſtition of Aſtolpho—a quality which is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attendant on the moſt daring courage, tho' ſeemingly extremely oppoſite to it in its nature.</p>
                     <p>Aſtolpho had been informed, early in life by an old man who pretended to be deeply verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in judicial aſtrology, and who was, on that account, much reſpected by him, that he ſhould not long ſurvive his brother; and this idea, with the truth of which, as with that of all ſuch predictions, he was fully impreſſed, prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſaved Emanuel's life.</p>
                     <p>He was willing to riſque any thing but his own life, which he thought depended on Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel's, to obtain the crown.</p>
                     <p>He might alſo, perhaps, feel, in the midſt of all his ambition, ſome degree of tenderneſs towards a relation, who had himſelf ſhewn ſo much affection towards him; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is rendered the more probable, when we reflect on his conduct towards the princeſs

In the courſe of this purſuit, the young Count Rhinaldo, whoſe father, Count Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, ſurnamed the Hardy, is lord of the Caſtle at the foot of the mountain, and of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main around it, was deemed worthy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with this ſecret and important event.</p>
                     <p>Virtuous, enterpriſing, and active, he was called by his father at the concluſion of the laſt campaign from the buſtle of the field, to partake of that retirement to which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Aſtolpho had condemned this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Retirement at ſuch a period of life, and with ſuch a diſpoſition, but ill ſuited the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Rhinaldo. He grew, on a ſudden, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, reſerved, and gloomy, and his only conſolation, amid the deſpondency which ſeemed to ſurround him at the Caſtle of his father, was the converſation of the fathers of St. Julian.</p>
                     <p>Knights, like himſelf, they ſtill delighted in the tales of former times, but their raſhneſs was tempered by experience, and their fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by age.</p>
                     <p>It was in this ſociety that father Anthony, (for ſo was Emanuel called,) became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and tho' he had been at variance with Count Roderic, who had, at a very early
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028486_0149_0FD924C854D18760"/>
period of life, imbibed ſome diſcontent from a conduct which he had thought partial in the king, and had ſo behaved himſelf upon the diſcovery, as totally to alienate the affections of Emanuel, yet that Prince diſcovered ſo much virtuous energy and early wiſdom in the conduct and converſation of the ſon, that he became ſpeedily attached to him, and at length ventured to diſcover to him his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret—but under a ſolemn engagement, that he would never reveal it to his father, whom he could not prevail upon himſelf to confide in.</p>
                     <p>How was the loyalty of Rhinaldo confirmed, when he beheld in Emanuel, the father of his adored Lady Iſabel! He pledged his faith to this revered but unfortunate ſovereign, and became one, among a very few, entruſted with a plot lately formed in the capital, which has unfortunately proved unſucceſsful, to ſeize upon the palace and the perſon of Aſtolpho.</p>
                     <p>What will be the event of this attempt to re-eſtabliſh on the throne this brave but injured monarch, it is impoſſible at preſent to decide.</p>
                     <p>His friends are buſy in the ſouthern and weſtern parts of the kingdom, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready raiſed forces, which appear formidable to Aſtolpho. At preſent that uſurper has a ſuperiority at the Caſtle, and has made ſome
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028486_0150_0FD924C95804DD60"/>
vigorous attacks on the mount, which is moſt reſolutely defended by Emanuel and my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there, who have again reſumed their arms. Old as I am, I had determined to join them; but it was judged that the little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I was able to perform in favour of a cauſe to which I feel ſo ſtrong an attachment, might be, with better ſucceſs, attempted here. I have a frequent but guarded communication with them, which my ſituation has hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the eyes of the enemy. If, however, it ſhould at length be diſcovered, I ſhall remember that I am a knight, and gladly yield up the few hours which yet might have been ſpared to me in the cauſe of true loyalty.</p>
                     <p>The hermit thus concluded his ſtory, which agitated the breaſt of Count Tancred with mingled indignation, pity, and ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>It for a while ſuſpended his ſorrows for the Princeſs Albina, and he felt that he had one more cauſe to lament the unhappy tardineſs of his cure.</p>

                     <p>RHINALDO, under the diſguiſe of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, became again familiarized to the apartments of his paternal manſion.</p>
                     <p>

He was every day a witneſs to the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour of Rhodolpho with the uſurper, a circumſtance which excited leſs ſurpriſe in his breaſt than grief and indignation. He daily heard Emanuel treated in the Court of Aſtolpho as an impoſtor—a ſlander, to which, indeed, a claim revived after a ſilence of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, afforded ſome foundation; and he was aware that Rhodolpho was probably the only man who could lay open the foulneſs and falſehood of ſuch an aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>He was not, however, aware of one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which had thrown Aſtolpho, more compleatly than he had conjectured, into the hands of his favourite.</p>
                     <p>The Count St. Amand had, with that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fondneſs which the worſt men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feel, entruſted his ſon, after binding him by many oaths to a ſtrict concealment, with this important ſecret, as a means by which he might enſure the continuance of Aſtolpho's favour, in caſe that Prince ſhould ſurvive the Count—but fortune had done more for him. On the night of Emanuel's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, he had left behind him, among other things, a book, in which he had minuted every occurrence which he thought worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice during his long confinement.</p>
                     <p>As every day was much like the preceding
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028486_0152_0FD924D0DA1DBAE0"/>
one, this work was not very volumnious, but it contained a ſhort account of his arrival at the manſion, and was continued at intervals nearly up to the day of his eſcape.</p>
                     <p>Upon viſiting the rooms after the eſcape of the king, the Count St. Amand found this journal, and, even amidſt the confuſion which ſeized upon him when he diſcovered the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape of his priſoner, he did not forget to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf of it.</p>
                     <p>This book, with annotations in many pages of it in his father's hand-writing, all combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bear teſtimony to the truth of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, fell into the hands of Rhodolpho upon the Count's death; as did a ring which was known to be Emanuel's, and which, as it was found among the rubbiſh by the workmen, who repaired the ruins which the ſtorm had made, was probably loſt by the king as he forced his way through the aperture in the wall in order to make his eſcape.</p>
                     <p>With ſuch proofs in his power, (of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of which Aſtolpho was not ignorant,) it was of the utmoſt importance to that prince that he ſhould ſecure to himſelf the good will of Rhodolpho; and the ſervile adolation of that young nobleman rendered this by no means a difficult or unpleaſant taſk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:028486_0153_0FD924D255832BF0"/>
Rhinaldo, however, beheld the influence he was poſſeſſed of with the utmoſt dread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware as he was that it threw his beloved Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel compleatly into the power of this unworthy rival. Nor was it long before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his fears were but too well founded.</p>
                     <p>Inceſſantly employed in endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in what part of the Caſtle the Princeſs was confined, he in a ſhort time perceived that two of Rhodolpho's ſervants, who were more conſtantly than the reſt about their maſter's perſon at the hours of meals, always attended him with ſix covers for his table, though he himſelf always dined and ſupped with Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho; theſe ſervants Rhinaldo reſolved to watch; and, on the day ſucceeding that on which he had formed this reſolution, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, at the uſual hour, towards their lord's apartments—he ſaw them enter with the covers which had been prepared, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after return, preceded by Rhodolpho, who led them up the great ſtaircaſe, and unlocking a door, remained at it while they entered a ſuit of apartments, which Rhinaldo knew to terminate in a ſpacious chamber, formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to himſelf, which extended to the other ſide of the building. Satisfied with this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very he returned, and was croſſing the court of the caſtle, to gain the oppoſite wing, when he was called to his duty, which was on that day to attend at the carrying up Aſtolpho's dinner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:028486_0154_0FD924DA4BAA34C0"/>
Mad as he was at the delay which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading duty occaſioned, he was obliged to ſubmit, and ſome hours paſſed before he was at leiſure to purſue his intended deſign, for he could not omit any portion of the ſervile taſk allotted to him, without incurring ſuſpicion, which might ruin his deſign, or without the danger of a diſmiſſion, which would effectually fruſtrate his long-cheriſhed hopes.</p>
                     <p>Evening had for ſome time ſet in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he found himſelf at liberty, and a ſecond time croſſing the court, gained the ſide of the houſe which had been ſo long the object of his anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſolicitude.—He aſcended a ſtaircaſe, every ſtep of which was familiar to him; though it ſeemed little frequented by the preſent inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Caſtle; and had not indeed been much uſed by his father, as it led to the moſt ancient part of this extenſive pile, a part which had been for many years much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the more modern portion of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on which great coſt had been beſtowed. The ſteps of Rhinaldo, however, had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traced this ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rable and neglected fabric.—He loved to muſe in a long gallery, hung with the pictures of his anceſtors, and rendered a fit object for the indulgence of that enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm which is often the companion of youthful imagination, by the gloom which the narrow, coloured panes, and maſſy frames of its gothic windows threw ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:028486_0155_0FD924DB5E69DBB0"/>
To this gallery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which extended from wing to wing on one ſide of the building, a ſpace of very conſiderable length, Rhinaldo now aſcended, and tracing his way along it by the light of the moon, arrived at the oppoſite door to that by which he had entered.—He was much mortified when he found that this door, which was not far diſtant from the apartment, in which he conjectured that the Lady Iſabel was confined, was locked.—He tried in vain to open or force it, and was conſidering what ſtep he ſhould purſue, when he recollected, that over the gallery there was another room of the ſame ſize, which had never been uſed but as a loft, through which he might paſs and gain the apartments; on that ſide of the caſtle; he therefore returned along the gallery to the ſtaircaſe he had juſt quitted, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending ſtill by a more narrow part of it, which, as it had been very ſeldom frequented, was ſomewhat incumbered by rubbiſh, he paſſed through one or two ſmall rooms, and arrived at the door of the loft; this he laid hold on, and puſhing it againſt ſome rubbiſh, which for a moment prevented its opening, he entered the loft.</p>
                     <p>As he entered he heard a noiſe at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and, by the light of the moon, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he perceived the figure of a man, which ſtarting from a ſeat, or diſappearing haſtily by the oppoſite door.

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028486_0156_0FD924DCD6682520"/>
aſcertain the figure of this object, in delineating which he was, perhaps, deluded by his imagination; but upon the cooleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion he was convinced he had ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing move in that end of the loft, and that whatever it might be that was in motion, it was an object ſo poliſhed as to reflect the moon's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and by which alone he had been enabled to diſcover it.</p>
                     <p>He puzzled himſelf in vain for ſome time, with reflexions on this ſingular circumſtance, till at laſt, recollecting the primary object of his purſuit, he paſſed the loft, and entering at the oppoſite door, which he ſound open, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by another ſtaircaſe, and ſoon arrived at thoſe apartments from which the door of the gallery below had excluded him.—He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded through two ſmall rooms and gained a third, which joined to the apartment in which he ſuppoſed the princeſs to be confined.—This apartment, the laſt of thoſe which were inhabited on that ſide of the houſe, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly communicated by a ſmall door with the room in which Rhinaldo now ſtood; but this door had long been nailed up, and the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way had been plaiſtered over on the inſide, to render it level with the wall, at a time when, by Count Roderic's order, the apartment had been hung with an elegant tapeſtry.—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t this door Rhinaldo liſtened, but could hear nothing.—He examined the faſtenings, they were old
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028486_0157_0FD924E219486D68"/>
and worn with ruſt; he found that if he could procure inſtruments, it would not be difficult to draw the nails, and thus open the door.—This he determined to attempt at an hour when the family were aſleep, when he had little doubt that he might work undiſcovered in ſo retired a part of the manſion.</p>
                     <p>Having formed this reſolution, he returned through the loft, and mingling with the other ſervants, occupied himſelf in the duties of his office till the hour of reſt approached.</p>
                     <p>A ſtillneſs now began by degrees to invade the roar and tumult to which the hours of waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel gave birth.—Aſtolpho and his companions had retired to reſt, and the menial ſervants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited till ſome of his inferior officers, who were indulging themſelves in a ſober ſilent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, ſhould chuſe to retire.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, who had taken care to provide himſelf with tools fit for his purpoſe, waited with anxiety for the concluſion of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per—the clock from the turret tolled out twelve, and this party, as if awakened from their lethargy by the ſound, aroſe, to the ſecret joy of Rhinaldo, who ſaw them take their route to their ſeveral apartments. He retired to a ſmall room allotted to him, and waited till the caſtle was buried in profound ſilence; then taking his tools in his hand, he ſet out in purſuit of his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028486_0158_0FD924E397FCE650"/>
As he paſſed the door of the long gallery, in his way to the loft above it, he heard a noiſe, and imagining that ſome part of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were yet up, he determined to enter the gallery, and wait there.—He had no ſooner ſet his foot within the door-way than he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a moment rivetted by ſurpriſe to the ſpot where he ſtood.—The moon ſhone in full ſplendor thro' the windows of the gallery, and clad with an awful and ſolemn beauty, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic ornaments of the place: when, by the light it diffuſed, Rhinaldo beheld, ſeated on a chair, beneath the picture of his father, the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igure which he had before diſtinguiſhed in the loft above, and which he could now plainly perceive to be that of a man, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete armour.</p>
                     <p>As he entered the room the figure ſtarted up, and diſappeared by the oppoſite door, which Rhinaldo had found ſhut on his previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſit to that place. As ſoon as he could recover himſelf from the ſudden aſtoniſhment and confuſion with which he was overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he followed haſtily along the gallery, but found, when he arrived at the further end of it, the door, by which the figure had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſtill locked. This circumſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him with new aſtoniſhment, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, in ſpite of all the firmneſs of his mind, with terror; he returned, however, through the gallery, and aſcended the other flight of

ſtairs, in order to paſs through the loft to the apartment in which he was to proceed to work.</p>
                     <p>As he entered the loft he again ſaw the ſame figure which he had ſeen twice before, ſtanding in the oppoſite door-way, and upon the noiſe he made on entrance it again diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.—Rhinaldo now, agitated by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand different ſenſations, ruſhed haſtily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and paſſing ſwiftly through the loft, gained the ſtaircaſe at the other end of it, which led to the apartments which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to viſit.—He deſcended the ſtairs ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and examined minutely every apartment.—all was ſilence—he could perceive no object—he could hear no ſound.—After muſing ſome time he begun to be convinced that his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination had deceived him, and ſearching for the little door which was to be the object of his labours, he proceeded to work. As he was fearful, if the adjoining apartment ſhould really prove to be that of the Lady Iſabel, the noiſe he might make would alarm her, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on his work with extreme caution, and nearly, an hour had elapſed before he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly conquered all the difficulties which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to him, and had opened the door, which he did very gently, leſt the croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its ruſty hinges ſhould be heard.</p>
                     <p>He now found himſelf cloſe to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he meant to explore; the only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028486_0160_0FD924ED588B3400"/>
between the two rooms being a thin partition of plaiſter, which caſed the door-way on the inſide.—He liſtened—all was ſilent; this was to be expected at ſuch an hour. He thruſt one of the implements he had with him through the wall, to diſcover whether there was any light in the room; but the tapeſtry which covered the walls prevented this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>He pauſed again—After a ſhort time he diſtinctly heard the ſtop of a man in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and concluding, from this circumſtance, that his conjecture, as to this apartment, had been ill-founded, was preparing to retire, when he heard the voice of a man, who, addreſſing himſelf to another, in a low but haſty tone, ſaid, <q>My lord, the King requires your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence immediately.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Curſed ill-fortune," replied the other, in a voice which he knew to be Rhodolpho's, "What can he want with me at this hour?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Something has dreadfully diſordered him; he has riſen from his bed; his looks are full of perplexity and horror; and he has deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your immediate preſence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They now walked ſlowly from the place, and Rhinaldo, ſatisfied that he had taken his trouble for nothing, retired.</p>

                     <p>AFTER paſſing through the two adjacent apartments, Rhinaldo arrived at the door of the gallery which was locked, and was about to aſcend the ſtaircaſe which led to the loft above it, in order to return in his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual way, when he again beheld the ſame figure on the ſtairs, leaning with one hand againſt the wall.—The moon, through a ſmall win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which gave light to this part of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, diſcloſed, compleatly, the head of this figure; in the countenance of it, Rhinaldo, from the momentary view he gained, (for at his approach the figure turned haſtily from him and diſappeared) was convinced, that he ſaw that of his murdered father.—The helmet was his—the plumage, the very plumage he wore when he had laſt attended him in the field.</p>
                     <p>Struck with horror at this ſight, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſome moments rooted to the ſpot where he ſtood; but recovering himſelf, at length he ran haſtily up the ſtaircaſe, and entered the lobby.—He could ſee nothing—he liſtened—all was ſtill.—In a ſhort time he heard a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028486_0162_0FD924F4172F5D20"/>
aſcending from below, and the treading of ſeveral footſteps, as if the inhabitants of the caſtle were already ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>He croſſed the loft, and deſcending into the hall, found ſeveral of Aſtolpho's attendants, and ſome of the ſervants, who were collected in different groupes, and huddled cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if liſtening to ſome dreadful tale.—He joined one of theſe parties, and learned, that the cauſe of the confuſion he witneſſed was the diſordered ſtate of the king, who had been awakened from his ſleep in ſuch a parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſm of horror, as to have ſpread, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, a general alarm.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this was not certainly known, becauſe, as ſoon as he became again maſter of himſelf, he imputed his alarm to a dream, and ordered his attendants again to their repoſe; but the firſt report had been, that the figure of Count Roderic, who was generally ſuſpected to have been ſlain by his order, had appeared to him compleatly armed; that it had opened his curtains, and preſented a dagger to his breaſt; but had, after a ſhort pauſe, with a look of mingled contempt and pity, withdrawn it and diſappeared. This figure had been ſeen by none of the attendants in the anti-chamber, who were buried in a profound ſleep, except one indeed, who declared that he ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bruſh by him, and paſs out at the door;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028486_0163_0FD924F896D82118"/>
but as this perſon had been in company with the reſt, drinking freely in the courſe of the evening, this was generally imputed to the fumes of the liquor with which he had been indulging himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the hurry of the firſt alarm Count Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho had been ſent for, but that order had been now countermanded: the king had ſent to him, as he had done to others of his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to tell him that he was not wanted, and had ſhut himſelf up in his chamber with the captain of his guard, an approved and valiant knight.</p>
                     <p>Agitated by this freſh intelligence, which concerned him ſo nearly, and bore ſo palpable a relation to the appearance which had three times encountered his ſight in the courſe of the ſame evening, Rhinaldo was loft in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—his companions, dropping off one by one, left him alone in the hall; he ſat muſing for ſome time; at length, no longer able to bear the accumulated pangs of the various feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which aſſailed him, he reſolved again to explore that part of the building where he had already beheld this ſingular ſpectre; to addreſs it.—if it fled, to follow it.—In ſhort, at all events, if poſſible, to put an end to the horrid ſuſpence which now oppreſſed him.</p>
                     <p>He accordingly aſcended, for the third time,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028486_0164_0FD924FA15C46728"/>
to the gallery.—All there was ſtill and ſilent.—He again viſited the loft.—He thought he perceived ſomething—he advanced—it was only a ſingular appearance at an angle of the wall, cauſed by a particular direction of the moon-beam.—He paſſed along the loft, and began to deſcend by the oppoſite ſtaircaſe.</p>
                     <p>He had reached the door of thoſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in one of which he had ſo lately been at work, when he heard a noiſe behind him, as if on the top of the ſtaircaſe, near the door of the loft. He re-aſcended five or ſix ſteps of the ſtaircaſe, and thought he perceived at the top of it ſomething moving.—He was ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to aſcertain it, when he was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by loud and repeated ſhrieks from below; they were in a female voice.—The Lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel was ever preſent to his imagination. He thought the voice was her's—he liſtened for a moment.—His ſuſpicions grew ſtronger. He leaped down the ſtairs; the ſhrieks were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.—He liſtened—they let him into the little ſuite of apartments—he ruſhed through them in an inſtant; in the third was the door which he had recently opened.—He now heard the voice of his Iſabel diſtinctly; it proceeded from the apartment which he had at firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be her's, and from which he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated by a ſlight partition of plaiſter.—The ſhrieks for a moment ceaſed.—He heard
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028486_0165_0FD925021C10DC38"/>
the voice of Iſabel, in a tone of terror and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, imploring the mercy of ſome perſon:</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, <q>for pity's ſake ſpare me.—If I muſt at laſt become your wife, cruel as is my deſtiny, I muſt ſubmit; but for heaven's ſake—for your own ſake, do not attempt a deed which will call down accumulated vengeance on your own head.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"I thank you," ſaid Rhodolpho, (for it was to him that this prayer was addreſſed) in a tone of cruel and bitter raillery, <q>for your conſent to marry me, thus unſolicited; while you were your uncle's preſumptive heir, it was ſomething; but your father's raſh attempt has hurl'd you from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"At leaſt," ſaid Iſabel, in a more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined voice; "dread the vengeance of that father! of my uncle!"</p>
                     <p>"As to your uncle," ſaid Rhodolpho, in a familiar tone; <q>my dear creature, he will never quarrel with a man for lowering your pride, in the preſent moment; and as to your father, I never fear dangers at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—Come, continued he, do not force me to harſh meaſures.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſhrieks of the Lady Iſabel were now
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028486_0166_0FD92503196148B0"/>
repeated. Rhinaldo, in a tranſport of rage and indignation, ſetting his back againſt the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fence which ſeparated the two apartments, eaſily broke through it, and lifting the tapeſtry which covered it, diſcovered his beloved Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, in a night-dreſs, ſtruggling with Rhodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho.—He ſprung upon him like a lion, and ſeizing him with both hands by the collar, ſoon ſeparated him from the princeſs.</p>
                     <p>"Vile diſhonourable coward," ſaid he, <q>who braveſt diſtant dangers! ſhudder at one which has come thus unexpectedly upon thee, in the midſt of thy villanies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Baſe born hind! doſt thou know me? ſaid Rhodolpho.—Unhand me inſtantly.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo ſtill held him: but perceiving that he felt about his girdle with his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, he ſeized it juſt as it had graſped a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and wrenching the weapon from him, bade him prepare to die. A ſhriek from the Lady Iſabel now awakened his attention; and, throwing the dagger from him, he flew tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards her, and conducted her, almoſt fainting, to a chair.</p>
                     <p>The apartment they were now in had been aſſigned to the Lady Iſabel, and was uſed by her as her dreſſing-room. On one ſide of it was a ſmall apartment, in which ſtood her bed,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028486_0167_0FD92509D58D22B8"/>
connected with it, by an arched door-way, over which hung a curtain of ſilk, which was ſeldom let down, as it interrupted the free paſſage of the air.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho, to whoſe cuſtody her uncle had conſigned her, kept the keys of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the outer apartments of which he kept ſafely locked; and Iſabel, relying upon their being ſecured, neglected to take any precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the inner ones, as much, becauſe ſhe thought it uſeleſs, as becauſe, by leaving them unfaſtened ſhe preſerved a communication with the chambers of her couſin Ellenor, and her ſervant Barbara, who were placed in other apartments, nearly adjacent to her's.</p>
                     <p>Ellenor, who had been awakened by the ſhrieks of her couſin, flew, with Barbara, to the door of her chamber; and, finding it lock'd, knock'd loud for admittance. Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo ordered Rhodolpho to admit them, which the other did not chuſe to refuſe, but opening the door, ſuffered them to enter, and quitted the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Ellenor flew to embrace her couſin, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſly inquired into the cauſe of her alarm.—Iſabel ſatisfied her, and expreſſed the higheſt ſenſe of the obligation, under which the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and myſterious preſence and interpoſition of the ſtranger had laid her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:028486_0168_0FD92509D78AAC20"/>
"Do you not, then, know me?" ſaid Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, falling at her feet, and preſſing one of her hands to his lips.</p>
                     <p>The voice of Rhinaldo, now, for the firſt time, ſtruck her ears; and the lamp, which burnt in her chamber, gave ſufficient light to enable her to diſtinguiſh his countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Rhinaldo," ſaid ſhe, in a voice ſcarcely audible; ſhe ſunk into his arms; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments flew, while theſe lovers gave themſelves up to thoſe chaſte and pure raptures, which true paſſion alone can yield, and which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Ellenor, far from reſtraining, embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the lovely Iſabel to acknowledge with leſs reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Raptures like theſe were not deſtined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long.—Barbara firſt alarmed them with the intelligence, that ſhe heard the ſound of footſteps approaching the chamber; and Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo inſtinctively flew to the door, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Rhinaldo!" exclaimed Iſabel, <q>I know not how you came hither; but, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake, if there is any mode of eſcape, fly from a fate, which, if you ſhould be taken, muſt doubly embitter the remaining moments of a life, already ſufficiently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</q> Here ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:028486_0169_0FD9250BCA0E7680"/>
Rhinaldo, in a tone of fixed reſolution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would remain where he was, to protect Iſabel and her couſin; but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was combated with tears and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Ellenor, as well as Iſabel, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that after the alarm which had been given, it was impoſſible that any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate danger could accrue to Iſabel; and, that as to any future evil, it was only by keeping himſelf free from diſcovery, that he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a hope of averting it.</p>
                     <p>"Fly then," ſaid Iſabel, the tears ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her lovely eyes; "at leaſt for my "ſake."</p>
                     <p>This argument was, with Rhinaldo, unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.—They now diſtinctly heard many footſteps in the adjacent chamber.—He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Iſabel and her couſin, and haſtily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the apartment by the cavity through which he had entered it.</p>

                     <p>RHINALDO, who did not doubt but that in a few minutes his mode of retreat would be diſcovered, faſtened the little door
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028486_0170_0FD9251354712780"/>
after him, by the bolts which ſtill remained unimpaired, and heſitated for a moment what ſtep to take. He conjectured that Rhodolpho might not have diſcovered him, and thought that no place offered more ſecurity than his own chamber, if he could gain it unperceived.</p>
                     <p>He heard the voices of ſeveral men in Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel's apartment, and had no longer time to heſitate. He moved quickly up the ſtairs, and croſſing haſtily thro' the loft, began to deſcend on the other ſide. He had already paſſed the gallery door, when he heard voices at the foot of the ſtairs, and was enabled to diſtinguiſh, among others, theſe words: <q>Here is the ſtaircaſe which leads to that ſide of the houſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He returned in a moment, and aſcended again to the loft. The gallery door was open, and he judged that his purſuers would take that way, which would compel them to return, and that he ſhould thus gain time. They indeed entered the gallery; but inſtead of returning, upon finding the door ſhut, they forced it open; and when Rhinaldo, who had in the mean time croſſed the loft, prepared to deſcend, he heard their voices at the bottom of the ſtaircaſe. In the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, he looked anxiouſly and eagerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, for an outlet; the door of the loft, on this ſide, opened into a ſmall ſquare
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028486_0171_0FD9251489B0E178"/>
room, which formed a kind of landing-place, whence the ſtairs deſcended. In one corner of this landing-place was a ſmall door which opened, as Rhinaldo diſcovered, on a narrow winding ſtaircaſe, leading, as it ſeemed, to the roof of the caſtle. As he had no time for choice, he began to aſcend; but was ſuddenly ſurpriſed by a noiſe above him, on the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, he liſtened, and thought he heard the ſteps of a man. Aſtoniſhed as he was, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to aſcend, feeling his way along the wall with his hand, which at laſt encountered a ſmall door; he puſhed againſt it—it opened; but was immediately cloſed by ſome perſon from the inſide, and faſtened.</p>
                     <p>Thus excluded, he was obliged to purſue his way up the ſtaircaſe; it ended in a narrow room, in the ceiling of which was a trap-door; but there was no ladder to enable him to reach it.—He heard a trampling in the room below. He looked round, and diſcovered a ſmall win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the caſement of which was almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone.—It looked out upon the battlements, he perceived that it was juſt wide enough to admit the paſſage of his body through it.—He caught hold of a bar, which divided it is two, and ſpringing up, thruſt himſelf, with ſome little difficulty, through it, and found himſelf on the battlements of the loftieſt part of the caſtle.—He purſued his way along them, though he found it ſomewhat impeded by the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028486_0172_0FD923F1DDD5B200"/>
ruins which had fallen from the tower above him, out of which he had eſcaped, which was the moſt ancient part of the whole edifice, and, as has been before obſerved, the moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>He arrived at length at a door, leading into one of the turrets, with which theſe battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were flanked; this turret was nearly in as ruinous a ſtate as the tower above. And Rhinaldo, when he puſhed open the door, found himſelf impeded by the rubbiſh which had fallen on the inſide of it.—He entered, however, with ſome little difficulty, and found himſelf at the top of the winding ſtaircaſe of the turret, by which he reſolved to deſcend; it was very old and broken; the walls emitted unuſual dampneſs; and it bore every mark of having been deſerted for ages.—After purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this deſcent for a conſiderable time, he found himſelf at a kind of reſting-place; this was a long narrow vaulted paſſage, branching off to the left of the ſtaircaſe, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſtill continued to deſcend.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo felt his way along this paſſage, which, from the length of time he had already been deſcending, and from his arched form, he judged to be ſituated among the vaults un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the caſtle, and having purſued it for ſome time, found, at the end of it, a low door, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly very ſtrong, ſtudded with large nails,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028486_0173_0FD9251B18A0BFA0"/>
and almoſt choaked up with rubbiſh.—He now returned towards the ſtaircaſe of the turret—he liſtened, but could hear nothing of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, who, it was probable, had given up their ſearch.—He heſitated whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or no; but curioſity prompting him, he reſolved to explore to what profounder depth the ſtaircaſe extended, having already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him, as he was convinced, many feet under ground.</p>
                     <p>He began again to deſcend—the ſtaircaſe continued, winding downwards, till it ended in a low arched paſſage, extending in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary direction to that above.—The mouth of this paſſage was cloſed by an iron grate, which hung ſloping towards the ground, ſupported only by one of the hinges, (the other having given way) and the bolt on the oppoſite ſide. This grate Rhinaldo eaſily throw to the ground, and entered the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>After having walked for a conſiderable time, and immured in total darkneſs, and gradually deſcending as he went; he thought of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but perceiving, ſuddenly, that he began to aſcend, he reſolved again to proceed, and finding himſelf impelled by a curioſity, which every moment intereſted him more and more; he continued to move forward, feeling his way with his hands, and gradually aſcending, till his foot ſtruck againſt ſomething, which,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028486_0174_0FD9251C9F343478"/>
upon examination, he found to be a ſtone ſtep; he felt with his hands, and diſcovered that he was at the bottom of a ſtaircaſe, which he began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>This ſtaircaſe was of conſiderable length, and Rhinaldo, who felt himſelf incommoded by the damp air of the ſubterraneous vault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was compelled, after ſome time, to ſtop and reſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>After a pauſe, he again proceeded, and found himſelf at length at the ſummit of the ſtaircaſe, his farther progreſs being oppoſed by a trap-door of great weight. Rhinaldo placed his back againſt this door, and after ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourous attempts, he ſucceeded in raiſing it. As it roſe he felt himſelf almoſt covered with rubbiſh, and found, by a noiſe above, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been diſplaced by his efforts.—He entered a place, damp, cloſe, and confined; he could not conjecture what it might be.—As he walked curiouſly round it, he felt his progreſs impeded; he ſtooped to diſcover the cauſe of this impediment, and his hand alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a coffin, covered with velvet, and ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thick with nails.</p>
                     <p>Wrapt in the reflexions which this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object gave riſe to, he proceeded ſlowly, till he came to a flight of ſteps, which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and found, at the top of them, a pair
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028486_0175_0FD92520DFF1B048"/>
of folding doors.—Theſe he attempted to open, but, for a long time, in vain; at length, old, rotten, and crazy, they yielded to the vigorous and repeated efforts, which the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he conceived at being buried alive urged him to make, and he found himſelf within the iron railing which ſurrounded a magnificent tomb, in a ſmall chapel, within that belonging to the monaſtery of St. Julian. This place he knew (for the moon ſtill ſhed her mellow light through the painted windows of the chapel) to be the tomb of his anceſtors; a privileged place of burial for the lords of the caſtle, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main around.</p>
                     <p>His rapture on this diſcovery is ſcarcely to be conceived.—He ſaw the uſurper, Aſtolpho, delivered into the hands of his gracious and rightful ſovereign, the great and good Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel. He ſaw his father revenged, and his princeſs delivered!</p>
                     <p>After having opened a gate in the iron rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrounding the tomb, which he effected by putting his hand between the bars, and puſhing back a bolt; he paſſed through a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of the ſame materials, which ſeparated the little chapel from that of the convent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the latter; but deſpairing of making himſelf heard before the chapel ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at mattins, he placed himſelf on a bench in the choir, and muſing on the ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028486_0176_0FD92524D6DD16A0"/>
ventures of the evening, was at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by ſleep.</p>
                     <p>He had ſlept but a ſhort ſpace of time, when he was awakened by the ſtep of ſome perſon walking ſlowly down the aiſle, in which he ſat.—What were his emotions, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, advancing towards him, the ſame armed figure which he had thrice before diſcovered in the courſe of the ſame evening!</p>
                     <p>He was a ſecond time convinced that it was the armour of his father; the vizor of the helmet was up; he could no longer doubt it; the eye of his father was bent full upon him.—Rhinaldo fell on his knee, and with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of enthuſiaſtic affection and reverential awe exclaimed:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>O ſacred ſhade! which beareſt the form of the moſt honoured, the moſt revered of fathers, diſcloſe, I conjure thee, the cauſe of this moſt ſolemn viſitation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Can it be Rhinaldo!" exclaimed the ſeeming ſpectre, in the voice of Count Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric; "ariſe, my ſon, and tell how it happens "that I thus encounter thee."</p>
                     <p>Theſe words almoſt bereft Rhinaldo of his ſenſes.—The ſurpriſe of the moment was ſcarcely to be borne..—That the father he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028486_0177_0FD92527371764C0"/>
murdered ſhould thus unaccountably ſtand before him! He ſeemed growing to the pavement, where he kneeled.—His father ſaw the conflict, and, advancing, raiſed him from the ground, and embraced him tenderly. Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo now recovered himſelf.—He fell again at the feet of his father, and ſeizing his mailed hand, preſſed the cold rivets to his lips, and bedewed it with the tears of filial affection.</p>
                     <p>A third perſon now joined them, who prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a faithful domeſtic of Count Roderic, named Hugo; and ſome time was ſpent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father and the ſon, in expreſſing their mutual ſurpriſe at ſo unexpected a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo having ſeated himſelf by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, gave him an account of all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which had, on his ſide, conduced to ſo extraordinary an event; and when he had finiſhed his ſtory, his father gratified his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, by a ſhort relation of the circumſtances which had, on his part, contributed to this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular encounter.</p>
                     <p>He told him, that upon perceiving Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho's intentions, which though he had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them, he did not find himſelf enabled to reſiſt, confirmed by his conduct when he entered the caſtle; he had, himſelf, firmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to quit it, but to lie concealed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028486_0178_0FD9252AC7EEF5C8"/>
till ſome opportunity ſhould offer itſelf of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining his lawful poſſeſſion, or at leaſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecpting vengeance on his enemies. That in order to effect this, he had recourſe to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſſiſtance of his noble and valued friend, Leopold, who had agreed to leave the caſtle, and join the forces of Emanuel (though he had not yet declared himſelf on his ſide) on the weſtern frontiers, clad in a ſuit of Count Roderic's armour, and accompanied by a choſen party of brave friends, who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the deception might be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to be perſuaded that it was Roderic that accompanied them.</p>
                     <p>This ſcheme ſucceeded but too well for Leopold, who, being taken for his friend, was purſued by the malignant hatred of Aſtolpho, and periſhed.—Count Roderic in the mean time remained ſecreted in the old part of the caſtle, confining himſelf in the day time to a ſmall room, which opened on the ſtaircaſe, leading to the tower, from the battlements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which Rhinaldo had eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>He was here ſupplied with neceſſaries by the means of his faithful domeſtic, Hugo, who mixed, unſuſpected, with the ſervants of the caſtle.—From him he learned the death of his friend, and, in a tranſport of grief and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, formed a firm reſolution to revenge it. He reſolved, however, to delay the execution
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028486_0179_0FD9252C56D4BA00"/>
of his vengeance till the time when other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhould determine him to leave the caſtle. Since the period in which the conduct of Aſtolpho had become, towards him, that of an implacable enemy, Roderic, whom, after many years of faithful ſervice, not even the juſter claims of Emanuel would have induced to appear in arms againſt the uſurper, ſuffered overtures to be conveyed, through the means of Hugo, to his oppreſſed and virtuous prince; through the ſame channel he received infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that a company of men at arms would quarter, on the very evening when this event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting took place, at about five miles from the caſtle.—Count Roderic reſolved to join them; but before he executed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, he determined to exact the vengeance he meditated for the murder of his friend. Hugo had bribed the centinel on the bridge, that they might be ſuffered to paſs at a more early hour than uſual. Two of the Count's horſes were ready in the ſtable; and it was probable, that an officer of the Count's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, though he would ſcarcely have been permitted to enter them, might be ſuffered to quit the lines unſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>This would probably have been the caſe, had he purſued only his deſign of eſcaping; but his mind was agitated by the hopes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching vengeance. He was armed by the aſſiſtance of Hugo, and waited with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028486_0180_0FD92534CC21AEB0"/>
for the hour when the centinel on the bridge ſhould be relieved, that the man whom Hugo had bribed might take his turn; it was during this period of ſuſpenſe, that he was thrice ſeen by Rhinaldo.</p>
                     <p>At length the hour approached; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the chamber where he knew Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho ſlept.—He paſſed the anti-chamber with caution; the officers were buried in a profound ſleep; he approached the bed of Aſtolpho, and putting aſide the curtains, drew his dagger.—Aſtolpho awaked, and fixed his opening eyes on him till they exhibited a degree of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which, in ſome meaſure, recalled Count Roderic to himſelf. The uſurper lay ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, under the impreſſion of the moſt agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrors.</p>
                     <p>Roderic was unfit for the office of an aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.—He was a knight of hitherto unſtained reputation; the victim before him he had long obeyed as his ſovereign.—He ſheathed his dagger, and ſlowly quitted the room, leaving Aſtolpho, who was extremely ſuperſtitious, under a firm conviction, that the object he had beheld was the ſpirit of the murdered Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, who had appeared to reproach him with his guilt.</p>
                     <p>The Count retired, as he had entered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted; and his next object was to effect
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028486_0181_0FD9253618CED098"/>
his retreat from the caſtle. He returned to the chamber in the ſtaircaſe, in ſearch of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.—The caſtle was now alarmed, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary to wait till all ſhould again be quiet.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of a ſhort period the ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rhinaldo commenced, and led his purſuers to the very part of the caſtle in which the Count was concealed. When he heard their footſteps he did not, for a moment, doubt that he was the object of their ſearch.—He heard them at the bottom of the ſtaircaſe, the room in which Count Roderic was concealed, which was in the tower, communicated by a flight of narrow ſtairs with the platform.—There was no time for heſitation.—The Count, accompanied by Hugo, aſcended, and they found themſelves on the loftieſt part of the roof of the caſtle; but even here, if purſued, they muſt be taken.</p>
                     <p>There ſeemed no mode of eſcape, unleſs they could gain the battlements below.—They perceived, on examination, that part of the parapet had in one place fallen in, towards the battlements, and rendered the deſcent not very difficult; they reſolved to attempt it, and ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>They purſued the path which Rhinaldo had trod before them; it was, indeed the only one
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028486_0182_0FD9253CA21F1798"/>
they could take; they came to the turret.—it promiſed to them an aſylum, as he had done to him before; they entered it; the courage of Count Roderic was as little to be daunted by the proſpect of the ſubterraneous paſſage as that of his ſon, and the neceſſity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting his eſcape was, perhaps, more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                     <p>He entered it, accompanied by Hugo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious whether it might lead him; for it had been long before his time diſuſed, and the very knowledge of it, though palpably formed to add ſtrength to the caſtle, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording a communication with the mount, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in oblivion.—They arrived in the chapel at the period when Rhinaldo's fatigues had buried him in that ſleep from which the ſound of his father's footſteps awakened him.</p>

                     <p>DAY had ſcarcely begun to encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pale light which the moon had diffuſed over the venerable walls of the chapel, when the ſacriſtan unbarred the door, and was ſurpriſed by the ſight of Count Roderic and his ſon. He conducted them, at their
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028486_0183_0FD9253DCB336E80"/>
deſire, to the officer of the guard, in whom Rhinaldo immediately diſcovered his friend Anſelmo. After mutual embraces Rhinaldo informed him of the ſingular adventures which had led his father and himſelf to that ſpot; and Anſelmo introduced them to the preſence of Emanuel, who had already ariſen, and was in arms,—This gracious prince received Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo with a cordial embrace; for he had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the virtues of this young knight, during their intimacy, while he concealed his rank, under the garb and name of Father Anthony.—To Count Roderic his demeanour was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, frank and open.</p>
                     <p>He had, not long before he was diſpoſſeſſed of his throne, by the perfidy of Aſtolpho, conceived ſome diſpleaſure at the conduct of Roderic, whoſe fiery unbending ſpirit had compelled the king at length to baniſh him his preſence, and the intelligence he received, upon his enlargement, that this nobleman had, for many years, poſſeſſed, in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the favour and confidence of Aſtolpho, led him to ſuſpect that he was privy to the perfidy which had deprived him of his liberty and his crown. This ſuſpicion, unfounded, as in truth it was; for Roderic owed his riſe in the court of Aſtolpho, to his recent diſgrace with Emanuel; and his continuance in the confidence of that uſurper, to his power in the ſtate, and his conduct in the field, ſo firmly
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028486_0184_0FD92543DA256F88"/>
poſſeſſed the mind of Emanuel, that though he had learned his late diſgrace at the court of Aſtolpho, he did not think it ſafe to truſt him with the ſecret, on which, not only his hopes of again aſcending the throne of Lombardy, but even his very life depended. The ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions were now wiped away; his diſpleaſure had long ſubſided, and the daring ſpirit, and undiſguiſed open temper and demeanour, which had procured this nobleman the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Roderic the Hardy, again obtained their former credit in the mind of Emanuel.</p>
                     <p>The diſcovery of the ſubterraneous paſſage was made known to the king, and after a council of the knights had been called, it was agreed, that the caſtle ſhould be ſurpriſed by the means of this inlet, while every prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made for an active and vigorous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation from without.</p>
                     <p>The riſing ſun had not long ſhed its golden light on the turrets of Count Roderic's Caſtle, before a knight, completely armed, arrived at the gate and demanded admiſſion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Aſtolpho. As ſoon as that prince had ariſen, and a council had been ſummoned, he was admitted. This knight, who was of a figure in which ſtrength, grace, and agility were combined, was magnificently armed, and a large ſable plume waved on his helmet.—He advanced towards the chair in which Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028486_0185_0FD92583588CE980"/>
was ſeated, and bending one knee to the ground, demanded juſtice againſt a knight of his train, whom he pledged himſelf to prove a recreant, falſe to his God, and to his king; an oppreſſor, and baſe wrong-doer, towards that ſex which he was bound by his oath, and the order he profaned, to ſuccour and protect.</p>
                     <p>Aſtolpho promiſed him the battle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if the knight were in preſence, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him, at the ſame time, to ſpeak boldly, and of good heart.—The knight with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plume then riſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lifted the vizor of his helmet, and diſcovered the face of Count Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. He fixed his eyes on Rhodolpho, who ſtood near the chair of the king and addreſſed him thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Count Rhodolpho, as thou art a knight, attend.—Thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ldeſt in a rigorous and cruel captivity, if thy ſavage rage hath not yet deſtroyed her, the Princeſs Aſpaſia, the ſiſter of this injured monarch, whoſe favour thou abuſeſt.—The truth of this I pledge myſelf to make good upon thy head, when, and at what weapons, (provided they be ſuch as may become a knight) thou wilt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At theſe words Count Tancred threw down his gauntlet, which Rhodolpho took up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, with many aſſeverations, but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt confuſion, the truth of the charge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:028486_0186_0FD9254813BA4718"/>
Aſtolpho, in whoſe countenance, amidſt the ſtrongeſt marks of aſtoniſhment, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand paſſions ſeemed ſtruggling for maſtery, aroſe, and ordering the liſts to be prepared, and the battle to take place on the ſucceeding morning, at day break, left the chamber, and the council broke up.—In the mean time, Count Tancred, who was known to many of the knights in Aſtolpho's train, was welcomed to the caſtle, and care was taken that he ſhould be honourably treated till the next morning ſhould arrive.</p>
                     <p>Aſtolpho, in the mean time, remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the deepeſt perplexity. Among his many faults, want of affection towards this ſiſter had no place. He was fond of her, and it was much againſt his inclination that he had felt himſelf compelled to ſacrifice her to the arms of the Count St. Amand.—His indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore, againſt Rhodolpho was raiſed to the higheſt pitch, by the very idea, that the accuſation of Count Tancred might be true; but the important ſecret, of which this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite was maſter, compelled him to ſtifle his reſentment, and to hide in ſmiles the rage which rankled in his heart; for he well knew, that many perſons of the firſt conſequence, who at preſent ſupported his cauſe, did it from a conviction, which had been artfully inſtilled into them, that his opponent was an impoſtor,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028486_0187_0FD9254C99B2E738"/>
and that Emanuel had actually periſhed, as had been reported.</p>
                     <p>While he was muſing in his chamber, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by theſe reflections, he was ſurpriſed by the preſence of Rhodolpho, who had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of entering this apartment.—He could not readily account for this viſit, at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and was not a little ſurpriſed to find, that the cauſe of it was the anxious deſire which Rhodolpho felt to make a ſolemn denial of the foul charge, preferred againſt him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his ſovereign, a charge which he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly averred to be founded in the moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocious falſhood, and the moſt inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, which, he added, he did not doubt he ſhould fully prove on the ſucceeding morning; proteſting at the ſame time, with the ſtrongeſt aſſeverations, that he had not ſeen the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs ſince the death of his father.</p>
                     <p>This declaration was graciouſly received by Aſtolpho, and was, indeed, highly grateful to him.—He was willing to believe it true; but in ſpite of his inclination, he felt ſome doubts which he could not holy ſuppreſs. He had long ſuſpected the courage of Rhodolpho, and could ſcarcely account for his meeting this charge with ſuch determined reſolution. This reſolution, however, if it was not a proof that he was innocent, was, at leaſt, a ſtrong one that he was willing to appear ſo; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028486_0188_0FD92551CAC52038"/>
which was calculated to ſpare to Aſtolpho much mortifying ſelf-humiliation; nor could he help looking with ſome ſecret anxiety towards the event of the battle, which, by the death of Rhodolpho, might free him from a ſubject already become too powerful not to cauſe him much uneaſineſs.</p>

                     <p>RHODOLPHO, in the mean time, who had never made this declaration till he had taken a reſolution effectually to prevent the diſcovery of its falſhood, thought of nothing leſs than of meeting Count Tancred in the field.—His brain, fertile in every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of villany, had engendered the plan of preventing the combat, before he had pledged himſelf to Aſtolpho, that he would ſo ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace that method of proving his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and he retired from that prince's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to give more maturity to his deſign.—He knew no method of preventing the combat, which was to take place in the morning, ſo effectual as that of aſſaſſinating his adverſary over night; nor did his heart, at once trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, cowardly and cruel, revolt at a crime, not ſanctioned indeed, but unhappily rendered
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028486_0189_0FD92554DBA61448"/>
too frequent by the barbarous manners of the age.</p>
                     <p>He thought, that by the means of ſome worthleſs inſtruments, about his perſon, he might be enabled to do this undiſcovered; but at all events, ſhould ſuſpicions ariſe, he was ſure of protection from Aſtolpho. His only ſubject of debate now was how to accompliſh his infamous deſign; and after ſome time ſpent in deliberation, he formed the following plan:</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of his brutal and unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attack on the defenceleſs Iſabel, during the preceding night that lady had ſent a moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intreaty to Aſtolpho, that if ſhe was in future to be confined, her place of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be near to his apartments; nor did Rhodolpho, whom the ſudden appearance, and myſterious eſcape of Rhinaldo had filled with ſtrange ſuſpicions and fears, oppoſe this requeſt; in conſequence of which the princeſs, together with her couſin and attendant, was removed to an apartment nearly adjoining to that of Aſtolpho.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho, who had the ſuperintendance of the houſehold, though he could not, in this caſe, act officially, eaſily procured it to be intimated to the ſteward, who ſupplied his place, that the apartment lately quitted by the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028486_0190_0FD9255662141348"/>
princeſs, would afford the moſt proper accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation for the ſtrange knight; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment was, upon this intimation, prepared for him.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho now ſaw his enemy in his hands; he had, in the purſuit of Rhinaldo, diſcovered the door by which he had eſcaped; an inlet to the apartment which would be effectually concealed from the unſuſpecting inhabitant by the tapeſtry. Through this door he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give entrance, at midnight, to the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian, who had been privy to his infamous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on the Lady Iſabel, and to two others of his train, whom this man pointed out as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtruments for the buſineſs.—Theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants were to diſpatch the unfortunate Count and his attendant with their daggers, while Rhodolpho, himſelf, waited without to aſſiſt them in diſpoſing of their bodies.</p>
                     <p>The plan being thus projected, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid inſtruments of his infamous deſign well inſtructed; he ſaw his unſuſpecting adverſary retire from a ſlight meal, of which he partook with ſome friends, towards his apartment, for the night.—Aſtolpho alſo retired to reſt. The tumult of the hall began, by degrees, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and all grew ſilent.</p>

a deſign ſo diabolical; yet urged by deſperate cowardice to the perpetration of his guilt, paced, with trembling ſtep, the ſtill gloomy receſſes of the caſtle.—The darkneſs and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſcene ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d a double portion of terror, over his mind.</p>
                     <p>The clock toll'd two—this was the hour at which his accomplices had agreed to meet him—all was ſtill ſilent, not a ſtep to be heard; he thought they had miſtaken the place of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and were, perhaps, already arrived at the ſpot, which was to be the ſcene of their infamous action.—He went up ſtairs, paſſed through the gallery, and arrived at the little door; he found no perſon there; the door was ſtill faſtened.—He had juſt opened it, when he heard the footſteps of ſome perſons deſcending the ſtairs, on that ſide of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; they entered the apartment with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſilent ſteps.—Rhodolpho advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Come, ſaid he, in a low tremulous voice; you are late; the door is opened; be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but be reſolute. When the deed is done bring the bodies into this room, with every thing that can lead to a diſcovery, and we will diſpoſe of them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had ſcarcely uttered theſe words, when he received the ſword of the perſon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028486_0192_0FD9255E96607078"/>
through his body, and the voice of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo exclaimed, <q>Die, moſt infamous aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, with his father, and friend Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, had been deputed to conduct a ſelect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Emanuel's troops through the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous paſſage, and they had gained the tower, undiſcovered, at the hour when it was judged that the inhabitants of the caſtle were lulled in profound repoſe.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, to whom the ſafety and protection of the Lady Iſabel had been particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by her father, haſtened, accompanied by a few friends, towards that door, which he knew communicated with her apartment when he was thus met, and thus accoſted by Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho.</p>
                     <p>Rhodolpho, when he received the wound, groaned and fell.</p>
                     <p>Rhinaldo, impreſſed by the words of Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho, with the utmoſt horror, drew his ſword from the body, and ruſhing towards the door, which he found open, entered the apartment, accompanied by his attendants.—On lifting the tapeſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was ſurpriſed to diſcover, by a light which burned in the room, a perſon buſily employed in arranging and adjuſting ſeveral pieces of armour; nor was this perſon,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028486_0193_0FD92562B57C2768"/>
who was Count Trancred's former deliverer, leſs ſurpriſed to ſee a figure, with a ſword im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with blood, advance from behind the tapeſtry.—He dropped the helmet which he held in his hand, and his ſudden exclamations awakened his maſter. Count Tancred, who, ſlipping on a looſe robe, and ſnatching up a ſword which lay by him, entered from his chamber.</p>
                     <p>The mutual ſurpriſe of Rhinaldo and the Count, at this meeting, kept them, for ſome moments, ſilent.—Rhinaldo at length inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his friend, in a few words, of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the night, and left him in the care of two of his attendants, while he himſelf proceeded in ſearch of Iſabel.</p>
                     <p>He paſſed haſtily through the hall, where he had already perceived that the buſineſs was begun.—A party, near the ſteps of the range of apartments, which were occupied by Aſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, boldly, but unſucceſsfully oppoſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the head of which Rhinaldo diſcovered the plume of his father; he ruſhed forward to join him; the oppoſite party retreated up the ſteps towards the chambers of Aſtolpho. When they arrived at his chamber, they found it empty; nor were they long in diſcovering the fate of this guilty and unfortunate Prince.</p>
                     <p>The viſion, as he thought it, of the preceding
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028486_0194_0FD9256613818F90"/>
night, had ſo much occupied his mind, that the idea of it had, ſince its appearance, almoſt inceſſantly haunted his imagination.</p>
                     <p>He was obſerved to be thoughtful and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my during the courſe of the day, and when, after ſupper, he again retired to bed, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in vain to compoſe himſelf to reſt. After ſome hours ſpent in anxiety and terror, he aroſe, and, dreſſing himſelf, walked about his chamber, waiting impatiently for the dawn.</p>
                     <p>Tired, at length, with his own thoughts, he walked into his anti-chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he found the officers of his guard and other attendants more alert than uſual from the alarm of the preceding evening. He converſed with them at intervals for ſome time. During a pauſe in the converſation, he thought he heard the ſound of footſteps without. The ſtate of his mind made him awake to every ſuſpicion—he liſtened again—it was no longer to be doubted. In a fit of deſperation he ruſhed out at the head of his few attendants, and met his fate at the very firſt onſet. He was found ſoon afterwards in the hall covered with wounds, and deprived of every ſymptoms of animation.</p>
                     <p>After having aſſiſted to beat back the party who oppoſed his father, Rhinaldo, whoſe thoughts were continually bent upon his Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, again detached himſelf with a ſmall party
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028486_0195_0FD9256A501297F0"/>
in purſuit of her. From the door of a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber near to Aſtolpho's, he ſaw three females ruſh forth in all the wildneſs of ſudden and extreme terror.—He met them, and repeating the name of Iſabel, ſtopped their progreſs.—The firſt of theſe females pronouncing the name of Rhinaldo, ruſhed, as if for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into his arms.</p>
                     <p>It was the Lady Iſabel. He conducted her, with her Couſin and attendant, to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Count Tancred, under whoſe protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he left them, that he might again join his father; but he found his preſence uſeleſs. Emanuel had on the preceding day contrived to ſend intelligence to the party of cavalry which Count Roderic had prepared himſelf to join, of the plan in agitation, with orders to march in the night, and ſurpriſe, if poſſible, that part of Aſtolpho's lines, which was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to their quarters; at the ſame time he quitted the priory, and at the head of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen troops made an attack on thoſe poſts which were the neareſt to him. Aſſaulted at once on oppoſite ſides, and this in the middle of the night, Aſtolpho's troops made but a feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and after a ſhort ſtand they began to give way on all ſides.</p>
                     <p>Count Roderic, in the mean time, having filled the Caſtle with his followers, and ſecured the ſoldiers within, who, lulled in a fatal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028486_0196_0FD9256C227EB810"/>
were moſt of them ſurpriſed without arms, had by this meaſure effectually diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the troops, who fled before Emanuel; for when they retreated for refuge to the Caſtle, they found the drawbridge in poſſeſſion of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>They threw down their arms—the gates were ſoon opened to Emanuel, and the dawn of day ſaw his ſtandard diſplayed on the walls.</p>

                     <p>RHINALDO had no ſooner ſaluted his beloved and revered ſovereign, and joined in the general congratulations on this ſingular ſucceſs, than he flew to the apartment of Count Tancred, that he might introduce his Iſabel to a parent whom ſhe had not ſeen ſince the age of childhood, and whom ſhe had ſo long lamented as dead.</p>
                     <p>He found the chamber empty—but, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was attracted by the ſound of voices to the little room behind the tapeſtry, where he diſcovered the Count, the Lady Iſabel, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and their attendants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="unknown:028486_0197_0FD9256DE7675760"/>
They were ſurrounding a wretched man, who ſeemed mortally wounded. He was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the ground with his back againſt the wall, and was ſupported on one ſide by one of the attendants.</p>
                     <p>It was Count Rhodolpho, whoſe groans had led them from the inner chamber to the ſpot where he lay.—When Rhinaldo entered, he was imploring the pardon of the ſurrounding audience, but particular of Tancred, for the offences he had committed, and for the farther ones which he had meditated againſt them.</p>
                     <p>He told Count Tancred that the Princeſs Aſpaſia was confined in his Caſtle, and, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ring from his finger, informed him, that upon producing that token to his ſteward, who had then the command of the Caſtle, ſhe would be immediately delivered to him.</p>
                     <p>He confeſſed, with much contrition, that a paſſion he had conceived for that lady, ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that which bound him towards the Lady Iſabel, had cauſed him thus to ſecrete her.</p>
                     <p>As he was much exhauſted, Rhinaldo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be conveyed to the bed in the adjoining chamber.—This was with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty done.—His wound was there dreſſed,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028486_0198_0FD92572336735D0"/>
but he died in the courſe of the ſucceeding day.</p>
                     <p>Emanuel, thus reſtored to his throne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed every day freſh marks of his favour on Rhinaldo and his father, who had been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of this happy revolution.</p>
                     <p>For Rhinaldo he had long felt and long profeſſed the affection of a father; he no ſooner received his long-loſt daughter from his hands, than he returned her to this affectionate lover, as the brighteſt boon he could beſtow.—That ſhe was indeed ſo, every hour which this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable father ſpent in her company convinced him; and, perhaps, if he had not ſo ſuddenly given her to Rhinaldo, the difficulty he felt in parting with her might have inclined him to heſitate.</p>
                     <p>Anſelmo now interceded with Rhinaldo to mention his pretenſions to the Lady Ellenor; nor were they for a moment diſregarded. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel expreſſed himſelf happy to be enabled thus to reward the attachment of this deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young nobleman.</p>
                     <p>The laſt words of the miſerable Rhodolpho filled the boſom of Count Tancred with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of hopes and fears. He had no ſooner been introduced by his friend Rhinaldo to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, than he prepared to depart for Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpho's
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028486_0199_0FD9257695FDC6A8"/>
Caſtle, having obtained, in addition to the token he had received, a mandate from the king. It will be needleſs to deſcribe the rapture which attended the meeting of theſe lovers.</p>
                     <p>By the interceſſion of Rhinaldo the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs obtained the reſtoration of the eſtates of the Count St. Amand, which had been forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and after ſome time paſſed in widowhood, from reſpect to the memory of an huſband, who had ſo little deſerved it, ſhe rewarded the faithful attachment of Count Tancred with her hand.</p>
                     <p>The ſteady and zealous ſervices of Rugiero were not forgotten by Rhinaldo, who obtained for him an honourable and lucrative ſituation. Nor did the Lady Iſabel overlook in Barbara, the companion of her toils and her dangers; and they found, when, after a reign of many proſperous years, the death of Emanuel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted them to the throne of Lombardy, in theſe ſteady and zealous adherents, true and loyal ſubjects, and firm and faithful friends.</p>
                     <p>The hours of adverſity which Emanuel had known, had ſtrengthened his mind, which his tedious ſolitude had much inured to habits of reflection; nor could he fail to obſerve, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028486_0200_0FD9257AD2F72DC8"/>
as he contemplated the combination of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which had brought about a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſo ſingular, how ſeldom, if we would wait patiently for events, we ſhould have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inveigh againſt the ſucceſs, even in this life, attending criminal actions; and with how little conſtancy and foreſight we are to continue to lament thoſe circumſtances as evil, which eventually, though inexplicably, produce our greateſt good.</p>
