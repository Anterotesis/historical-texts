            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>SO Odious and Abominable is the name of a Witch, to the Civilized, much more the Religious part of Mankind, that it is apt to grow up into a Scandal for any, so much as to enter some sober cautions against the over hasty suspecting, or too precipitant Judging of Persons on this account. But certainly, the more execrable the Crime is, the more Critical care is to be used in the exposing of the Names, Liberties, and Lives of men (especially of a Godly Conversation) to the imputation of it. The aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand of God now upon us, in letting loose of evil Angels among us to perpetrate such horrid Mischiefs; and suffering of Hells instruments, to do such fearfull things as have bin scarce heard of; hath put serious persons into deep Musings, and upon curious enquiries what is to be done for the detecting and defeating of this tremendous design of the grand Adversary: and, though all that fear God are agreed,</hi> That no evil is to be done, that Good may come of it; <hi>yet hath the Devil obtained not a little of his design, in the divisions of Reuben, about the application of this Rule.</hi>

enemies of Mankind, and set upon mischief, is not to be doubted: That the Devil can (by Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission) and often doth vex men in Body and Estate, without the Instrumentality of Witches, is undeniable: That he often hath, and delights to have the Concurrence of Witches, and their consent in harming men, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to his Native Malice to man, and too La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably exemplified: That Witches, when detected &amp; convinced, ought to be exterminated and cut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Men serve God in doing their Duty: he never intended that all Persons Guilty of Capital Crimes should be discovered and Punished by men in this Life, though they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And it is of no less necessity in point of Justice; There are not only Testimonies required by God, which are to be Credited according to the Rules given in His Word referring to witnesses: but there is also an Evidence supposed to be in the Testimony, which is throughly to be weighed, and if it do not infallibly prove the crime against the person accused, it ought not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Blaspheming Pharisees said, <hi>He casts out the Devils thro' the Prince of Devils.</hi> Math. 9. 34. There is then not the best Saint on Earth (Man or Woman) that can assure themselves that the Devil shall not cast such an Imputation upon them. <hi>It is enough for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that he be as his Master, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Master of the House Beelzebub, how much more them of His Houshold.</hi> Math. 10. 25.

I shall mention but one Scripture more to confirm the Truth in hand. It is that in,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000658_0015_0FA9A22F32A149D8"/>
Eccles. 9. 2, 3. Where it is said, <hi>All things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all, there is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, as is the Good, so is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this is an evil amongst all things under the Sun that there is one Event happenet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From hence we inferr that there is no outward Affliction whatsoever but may befal a Good Man; now to be represented by Satan as a Tormentor of Bewitched or Possessed Persons, is a sore affliction to a Good man. To be Tormented by Satan is a sore Affliction, yet nothing but what befel Job, and a Daughter of Abraham whom we read of in the Gospel. To be represented by Satan, as tormenting others, is an affliction like the former. The Lord may bring such extraordinary Temptations on his own Children, to Afflict and Humble them, for some sin they have been guilty of before him. A most wicked Person in St. <hi>Ives,</hi> got a Knife, and went with it to a Ministers House; designing to stab him, but was disappointed. Afterwards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science being awakened, the Devil appears to this Person in the Shape of that Minister, with a Knife in his hand exhorting to Self-murder. Was not here a punishment suitable to the sin which that Person had been Guilty of? Perhaps some of those, whom Satan has represented as committing Witchcrafts, have been tampering with some foolish and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sorceries, tho' not to that degree, which is Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and Capital by the Laws both of God, and

            <p>Some Popish Authors argue, that that Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not personate an innocent man as doing an Act of witchcraft, because then he might as well represent them as commiting Theft, murder &amp;c. And if so, there would be no Living in the world. But I turn the Argument against them, He may (as the mentioned Instances prove) personate honest men as doing other Evils. And no solid Reason can be given why he may not as well personate them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of witches as under the notion of Thieves, Murders and Idolators.

            <p>Arg: 3. <hi>If Satan may not represent one that is not a covenant servant of his as afflicting those that are bewitched or possessed, then it is either because he wants Will, or Power to do this, or because God will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him thus to do.</hi> No man but a Saddu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

If he does destroy the perfect with the wicked, and Laugh at the Trial of the innocent (Job 9. 22, 23.) who shall enter into His Counsels! who has given Him a Charge over the Earth. or who has disposed the whole world! men are not able to give an Account of his ordinary works much less of his secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and the Dark Dispensations of his Providence. They do but darken counsel by words without knowledge when they undertake it. If we are not able to see how this or that can stand with the Righteousness of him that Governs the world, shall wo say that the Almighty will pervert Judgment? or that he that Governs the Earth hateth Right?
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000658_0022_0FA9A234726444C0"/>
shall we condemn him that is most just? But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis objected where is Providence? and how shall men live on the Earth, If the Devil may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to use such power? I demand, where was Providence, when Satan had Power to cause sons of Belial to lye and swear away the life of innocent <hi>Nab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That was the strangest Provi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dence that has happened since the world began, and yet in the Issue the most glorious. We must therefore distinguish between what does ordinarily come to pass by the Providence of God, and things which are extraordinary. It is not an usual thing for a <hi>Naboth</hi> to have his life taken from him by false Accusations, or for an <hi>Athanasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is not usual for Providence to permit the Devil to come from Hell and to throw Fire on the Tops of Houses, and to cause a whole Town to be burnt to Ashes thereby. There would (it must be confessed) be no living in the world if Evil-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels should be permitted to do thus when they had a mind to it.

            <p>To proceed, Is it not usual for Persons after their Death to appear unto the Living. But it do's not therefore follow, that the Great God will not suffer this to be.

But a Fortnight after his Death, he Appeared to her, saying, <hi>Mother, you are solicitous about my eternal Welfare. Trouble your self no more, for I am happy,</hi> and so vanished. Should there be a continual Intercourse between the Visible and the Invisible World, it would breed Confusion. But from thence to inferr, that the Great Ruler of the Universe will never permit any thing of this nature to be, is an inconsequent Conclusion.

I have heard of an Inchanted Pin, that has caused the Condemnation and <hi>D</hi>eath of many scores of Innocent persons. There was a Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Witchfinder</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that undertook by a Pin, to make an Infallible discovery of suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, whether they were Witches or not If when the Pin was run an Inch or two into into the Body of the Accused party, no blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, nor any sense of Pain, then he declared them to be Witches. By means hereof my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells me no less then 300 persons were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000658_0032_0FA9A23CB1E08E00"/>
condemned for witches in that Kingdom. This Bloody Jugler after he had done enough in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> came to the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed.</hi> An honest man now living in <hi>New-England</hi> assureth me that he saw the man thrust a great Bras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Accused Party was not in the least sensible of what was done, and therefore in danger of receiving the Punishment justly due for Witchcraft. Only it so happened, that Collonel <hi>Fenwick</hi> (that worthy Gentleman, who many years since lived in <hi>New England</hi>) was then the Military Governour in that Town. He sent for the Mayor and Magistrates, advising them to be careful and cautious in their Proceedings. For he told them, it might be an Inchanted Pin, which the Witch-finder made use of. Whereupon the Magistrates of the place ordered that he should make his Experiment with some other Pin as they should appoint: But that he would by no means be induced unto, which was a sufficient Discovery of the Knavery and Witchery of the Witch-finder. There is a strange Diabolical Energy goeth along with <hi>Incantations.</hi> If <hi>Balak</hi> had not known that, he would not have sent for <hi>Balaam</hi> to see whether he could Inchant the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> The Scripture intimates that Inchantments will keep a Serpent from biting, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 11.

thing with that Knife, it would dy immediately. And that there is a wonderful Power of the Devil attending things Inchanted, we have confirmed by a prodigious Instance in Major <hi>Weir</hi> a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> That wretched man was a perfect Prodigy. A man of great parts; esteemed a Saint; yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in secret Uncleanness with his own Sister for Thirty Four Years together. After his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was discovered, he did not seem to be troubled at any of his Crimes, excepting that he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a poor woman to be publickly whipped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she reported that she had seen him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Beastiality: which thing was true, only the woman could not prove it. This horrid Creature, if he had his <hi>Inchanted Staff</hi> in his hand, could pray to Admiration, and do extraordinary things, as is more amply related in the Postscript to Mr. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi> his Book before mentioned. But if he had not his Inchanted Rod to Lean upon, he could not transform himself into an Angel of Light. But by all these things we may conclude, that it is not impossible, but that a guilty Conjurer, that so he may render himself the less suspected, may by his Magical Art and Inchantment cause Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be Represented as afflicting those whom the Devil and himself are the Tormentors of.</p>

What his Judgment was in the Case now under Debate, we may see, page 209, 210. Where his words are these: <q>An Apparition of the Party suspected, whom the Afflicted in their Fits seem to see, is a great suspicion. Yet this is but a Presumption tho' a strong one, because these Apparitions are wrought by the Devil, who can Represent to the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000658_0037_0FA9A24081A96270"/>
Phantasy such as the Parties use to fear, in which his Representation he may as well lye as in his other Witness.

            <p>As for the Judgment of the Elders in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so far as I can learn, they do generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr with Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bernard.</hi> This I know, that at a Meeting of Ministers at <hi>Cambridge, August</hi> 1. 1692. where were present seven Elders besides the President of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> the Question then discoursed on, was, <hi>Whether the Devil may not sometimes have a Permission to Represent an Innocent Person as tormenting such as are under Diabolical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestations?</hi> The Answer which they all concurred in was in these words, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That the Devil may sometimes have a Permission to Represent an Innocent Person as tormenting such as are under Diabolical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestations. But that such things are rare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, especially when such Matters come before Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures.</hi> And that some of the most Eminent Ministers in the Land, who were not at that Meeting, are of the same Judgment, I am assured. And I am also sure, that in Cases of this Nature, the Priests <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ips should keep Knowledge, and they

should seek the Law at his Mouth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>Arg. 6. <hi>Our own Experience has confirmed the Truth of what we affirm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in another Book given an account concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Eliz. Knap,</hi> of <hi>Groton,</hi> who complained that a Woman as eminent for Piety, as any in that Town, did appear to her, and afflict her. But afterwards she was satisfied that that person never did her any harm, but that the Devil abused them both. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ago, a bewitched person in <hi>Chelms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in her Fitts, complained that a worthy good man a near relation of hers, did afflict her. <hi>S</hi>o did she likewise complain of another person in that Town, of known Integrity and Piety.</p>
            <p>I have my self known several of whom I ought to think that they are now in Heaven, considering that they were of good Conversation, and reputed Pious by those that had the greatest Intimacy with them, of whom nevertheless, some complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that their Shapes appeared to them, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. Nor is this answered by saying, we do not know but those persons might be Witches. We are bound by the Rule of Charity to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And they that censure any, meerly because much a sad Affliction as their being falsely represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Satan, has befallen them, do not do as they would be done by. I bless the Lord, it was never the portion allotted to me, nor to any Relation of mine to be thus abused. But no man knoweth what may happen to him, since <hi>There be just Men
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000658_0039_0FA9A241F2269B98"/>
unto whom it hapneth according to the work of the Wicked.</hi> Eccles. 8. 14. But what needs more to be said, since there is one amongst ourselves whom no man, that knows him, can think him to be a Wizzard, whom yet some bewitched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons complained of, that they are in his Shape Tormented. And the Devils have of late, accused some Eminent Persons.</p>
            <p>It is an awful thing which the Lord has done to convince some amongst us of their error. This then I Declare and Testify, that to take away the life of any one, meerly because a <hi>Spectre</hi> or Devil, in a Bewitched or Possessed person does accuse them, will bring the Guilt of Innocent Blood on the <hi>L</hi>and, where such a thing shall be done. Mercy forbid that it should, (and I trust that as it has not, it never will be so) in <hi>New-England.</hi> What does such an Evidence amount unto more then this. Either such an one did afflict such an one, or the Devil in his likeness, or his <hi>E</hi>yes were bewitched.</p>
            <p>The things which have been mentioned make way for, and bring us unto the Second Case, which is to come under our Consideration,</p>
            <p>

               <hi>If one Bewitched is struck down at the Look or Cast of the Eye of another, and after that Recovered again by a Touch from the same Person, is not this an infallible Proof that the Person Suspected and Complained of is in League with the Devil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer; It must be owned that by such
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000658_0040_0FA9A2438B4D2870"/>
things as these Witchcrafts and Witches have been discovered more then once or twice. And that an ill Fame or other Circumstances attending the suspected Party, this may be a ground for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; but this alone does not afford suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter for Conviction. As <hi>Spectres</hi> or Devils appearing in the Shapes of men that have been murdered, declaring that they were murdered by such persons and in such a Place, may give just Occasion to the Magistrate for Enquiry into the matter.

And he is called the Accuser of the Brethren. Albeit I cannot deny but this has very often proved true, yet seeing the Devil is such an one as you heard, Christian men should not take his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to give in Verdict upon Oath, and so swear that the Devil has therein spoken the Truth. Be it far from good men to confirm any word of the Devil by Oath, if it be not an evident Truth without the Devils Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who in speaking the truth has a lying Intent, and speaks some truths ofthings done, which may be found to be so, that he may wrap with them some pernicious Lye, which cannot be tried to be true, but must rest upon his own Testimony to insnar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <q>No man can doubt but that the vertue wherewith this Touch was indued, is supernatural.

               <hi>That the Gift of healing the Sick and Possessed was a special Grace and Favour of God, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Truth of the Gospel, but that such a Gift should be annexed to the Tonch of Wicked Witches, as an infallible sign of their Guilt, is not easy to be believed.</hi> It is a thing well known, that if a Person possessed by an Evil Spirit, is (as oft it so happens) never so outragious whilst a good man is Praying with, and for the Afflicted, let him lay his hand on them, and the Evil Spirit is quiet. I hope this is no evidence of any Covenant, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Communion between the Good man that is Praying and the Evil Spirit. No more does the Case before us, Evince any such thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There are that Question the Lawfulness of the Experiment.</hi> For it this healing power in the Witch is not a Divine but a Diabolical Gift, it may be dangerous to meddle too much with it. If the Witch may be ordered to Touch Afflicted Persons in order to their healing or recovery, out of a sick Fitt, why may not the Diseased person be as well ordered to Touch the Witch for the same cause? And if to touch him, why not to scratch him and fetch Blood out of him, which is but an harder kind of Touch? But as for this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doubts not to call it, a <hi>Practice of Witchcraft,</hi> It is not safe to meddle with any of the <hi>D</hi>evils Sacraments or Institutions. <hi>For My own part,</hi> I <hi>should be loath

to say to a man, that I knew or thought was a Witch, do you lock on such a Person, and see if you can Witch them into a Fitt. And there is such an Afflicted Person do you take them by the Hand, and see if you can Witch them well again. If it is by vertue of some Contract with the Devil, that Witches have power to do such things it is hard to conceive how they can be bid to do them, without being too much concerned in that Hellish Covenant.</hi> I take it to be (as elsewhere <note n="(w)" place="bottom">

But if the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of such a person as afflicting, or the Look or Touch be an infallible proof of the guilt of Witchcraft in the persons complained of, 'tis the easiest thing in the world to discover them. For it is done to our hand, and there needs no enquiry into the matter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let me here premise two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The evidence in this Crime ought to be as clear as in any other Crimes of a Capital Nature. The word of God does no where intimate, that a less clear evidence, or that fewer or other witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may be taken as sufficient to convict a man of Sorcery, which would not be enough to convict him were he charged with another evil worthy of Death. <hi>Numb;</hi> 35. 30. if we may not take the Oath of a distracted person or of a possessed person in a case of Murder, Theft, Felony of any sort, then neither may we do it in the Case of witchcraft.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me premise this also, that there have been wayes of trying witches long used in many Nations, Especially in the dark times of Paganism and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the righteous God never approved of. But which as (judicious Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> expresseth it in plain English) were invented by the Devil, that so Innocent Persons might be condemned, and some notorious witches escape. Yea, many superstitions and Magical experiments have been used to try witches by. Of this sort is that of scratching the witch, or seething the urin of the Bewitched person, or making a witch-cake with that urine. And that Trial of putting their hands into scalding water, to see if it will not hurt them. And that of sticking an Awle under the seat of the suspected
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000658_0058_0FA9A2527B22E2B0"/>
party yea, and that way of discovering witches by tying thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hands and feet, and casting them on the water, to try whether they will sink or swim. I did publickly bear my Testimony against this supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Book Printed at <hi>Boston</hi> Eight years past.</p>
            <p>I hear that of late some in a Neighbour Colony have been playing with this diabolical invention. It is to be Lamented that in such a <hi>Land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> as <hi>New-England</hi> once was, a practice which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant writers generally condemn as sinful, and which the more sober and I earned men amongst Papists themselves have not only judged unlawful but (to express it in their owne Terms) to be no less than a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> should ever be heard of.

Nothing can be more clear. Suppose a man to be suspected for <hi>Murder,</hi> or for Committing a <hi>Rape,</hi> or the like Nefandous Wickedness, if he does freely confess the Accusation that's ground enough to condemn him. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approveth of Judging the wicked Servant out of his own Mouth. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 22. It is by some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that persons in Discontent may falsely accuse themselves. I say, if they do so, and it cannot be proved, that they are false Accusers of themselves, they ought to dye for their Wickedness, and their Blood will be upon their own Heads. The Jury, the Judges, and the Land is clear. I have read a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sad and amazing and yet a true story to this purpose</p>
            <p>There was in the Year 1649 in a Town called <hi>Lauder</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> a certain woman accused and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned on suspicion of witchcraft. When others in the same prison with her, were convicted, and their Execution ordered to be on the Monday following, she desired to speak with a Minister, to whom she
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000658_0066_0FA9A25886381638"/>
declared freely that she was guilty of Witchcraft, acknowledging, also many other Crimes committed by her, desiring that she might dye with the Rest. <hi>S</hi>he said particularly that she had Covenanted with the <hi>D</hi>evil, and was become his Servant, about twenty years before, and that he Kissed her, and gave her a Name, but that since he had never owned her. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ministers who were jealous that she accused herself untruly, charged it on her Conscience, telling her that they doubted she was under a Temptation of the <hi>Devil</hi> to destroy her own Body &amp; Soul, and ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When she came to the place of Execution, she was silent until the Prayers were ended. Then going to the Stake where she was to be Burn't; she thus expressed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>All you that see me this Day! Know ye that I am to Dye as a Witch by my own Confession? and I free all men, especially the Ministers, and Magistrates from the Guilt of my Blood! I take it wholly on my self, and as I must make answer to the God of Heaven, I declare I am as free from Witchcraft as any Child, but being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by a Malicious Woman, and imprisoned under the Name of a Witch, my Husband and Friends disowned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If so, they can as well turn Horses into men. But all the Witches on earth in Conjunction with all the Devils in Hell, can never make or unmake a rational Soul; and then they cannot transform a Bruit into a man, nor a man into a Bruit. So that this Transmutation is Phantastical. The Devil may, and often does impose on the Imaginations of his Witches and Vassals, that they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Converted into Beasts, and reverted into men again. As <hi>Nebucadnezzar</hi> whilest under the Power of a <hi>Doemon</hi> really imagined himself to be an <hi>Ox,</hi> and would lye out of Doors and eat Grass. The Devil has inflicted on many a man the Disease called <hi>Lycanthropia,</hi> from whence they have made Lamentable Complaints of their being Wolves. In a word, there is no more Reality in what many Witches confess of strange things seen or done by them whilest Satan had them in his full Power, than there is in <hi>Lucian's</hi> Ridiculous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his being bewitched into an <hi>Asse,</hi> and what strange Feats he then played. So that what such
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000658_0069_0FA9A25AC1648970"/>
persons relate concerning Persons and Things at Witch-meetings, ought not to be received with too much Credulity. I could mention dismal Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Innocent Blood which has been shed by means of the Lies of some confessing Witches. There is a very sad Story mentioned in the Preface to the Relation of the Witchcrafts in <hi>Sweedland,</hi> how that in the year 1676. at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man accused her own Mother (who had indeed been a very bad woman, but not guilty of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and Swore that she had carried her to the Nocturnal meetings of Witches, upon which the Mother was burnt to death. Soon after the Daughter came crying and howling before the Judges in open Court, declaring that to be revenged on her Mother for an Offence received, she had falsely accused her with a Crime which she was not guilty of: for which she also was justly Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. A most wicked man in <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> freely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himself to be a Magician; and accused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others whose Lives were thereupon taken from them, and a whole Province had like to have been ruined thereby; but the imposture was discovered. The Confessing pretended Wizzard was burnt at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1668. I shall only take notice further of an awful Example mentioned by A. B. <hi>Spotswood</hi> in his History of Scotland. p. 449. His words are these. <q>This Summer (<abbr>

with Torture, did confess herself Guilty. Being Examined touching her Associates in that Trade, she named a few, and perceiving her Delations find Credit, made offer to detect all of that sort, and to purge the Country of them; so she might have her Life granted. For the reason of her Knowledge, she said, <hi>that they had a secret mark all of that sort in their Eyes, whereby she could surely tell, how soon she Looked upon any, whether they were Witches or not.</hi> And in this, she was so readily believed, that for the space of 3 or 4 Moneths she was carried from Town to Town to make Discoveries in that kind. Many were brought in Question by her Delations, especially at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi> where <hi>diverse Innocent women, through the Credulity of the Minister</hi> Mr. <hi>John Cowper, were condemned and put to death.</hi> In the end she was found to be a meer deceiver, and sent back to <hi>Fife,</hi> where she was first apprehended. At her Tryal she Affirmed all to be false that she had confessed of her self or others, and persisted in this to her death, which made many fore-think their too great Forwardness that way, and moved the King to recal his Commissions given out against such persons, discharging all Proceedings against them, except in case of Voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, till a solid Order should be taken by the Estates touching the form that should be kept in their Tryal.</q> Thus that famous Historian</p>

            <p>Some are ready to say, that Wizzards are not so unwise as to do such things in the Sight or Hearing of others. But it is certain that they have very often been known to do so.
