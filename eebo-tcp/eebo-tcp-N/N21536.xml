            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LONG have you been my <hi>fathers</hi> and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> my attentive <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors,</hi> in the intereſting ſcience of medicine. You juſtly hold on me, therefore, a twofold claim for the twofold duty of a pupil and a ſon. In reſpectful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this undeniable claim, I now ſtep forward and thus publicly ſolicit your acceptance of the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of that medical education, which you yourſelves were pleaſed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028310_0004_0FD8800C811311F8"/>
to patronize and direct with ſuch ability and care.</p>
            <p>Avowedly to ſolicit an extenſion of your immediate patronage and protection to the following tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, would be to offer you an indignity little ſhort of actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Such a ſolicitation would falſely repreſent you as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to become the ſpontaneous guardians and friends of ſilent, unaſſuming truth and merit, but ſtanding with open arms for the reception even of intruſive error itſelf, when uſhered to your notice by a brazen front and a blanditious tongue.</p>
            <p>The original work of Profeſſor Blumenbach has been already ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028310_0005_0FD896327B91ADF8"/>
by the applauding voice of the learned and the ingenious in almoſt every part of the globe to which phyſical ſcience has hitherto found its way. On the ſolitary baſis of its own intrinſic merit let my <hi>tranſlation</hi> alſo ſtand; or if, indeed, it be deſtitute of ſuch baſis, with diſgrace let it ſink into that ſea of oblivion which ſo juſtly awaits its final reception.</p>
            <p>From you, Gentlemen, it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of at leaſt, a patient, and, I flatter myſelf, an impartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Should the execution of the work fortunately meet with your approbation and applauſe, you will be its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Preface by the Tranſlator.</head>
            <p>WHAT a faſhionable letter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction is to its bearer, a faſhionable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is to the literary performance which it openly announces to the world. The former procures, for the moſt part, admiſſion, and, at leaſt, a dinner; the latter moſt commonly an attentive peruſal. For their future conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, however, in favour and eſteem, both the viſitant and the volume muſt depend on ſomething more ſubſtantial, and of more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal utility, than either the light eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette of a letter, or the ſpecious propoſals of a recommendatory preface.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:028310_0008_0FD89637BA9D6EA0"/>The reader is requeſted to view the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prefatory addreſs as a mere peace-offering, made by the tranſlator to ancient and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cuſtom, and not as a ſolemn appeal to the public deſigned to enhance either the <hi>merit</hi> of the following <hi>performance,</hi> or the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of the <hi>motives</hi> which led to its execution. For with regard to the <hi>merit</hi> of the work, I flatter myſelf that no character of literature and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents will ever reſign his right of judging for himſelf; and as to the <hi>motives</hi> by which I was induced to engage in its tranſlation, they are indeed at preſent nothing better than ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute non-entities, and will in no way effect its utility to man.</p>
            <p>The want of a new and complete ſyſtem of phyſiology has been long and very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly experienced and regretted by all medical ſtudents on this ſide the Atlantic. As to myſelf, I am ſure I was led moſt devoutly to
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:028310_0009_0FD8963951C15D48"/>
regret ſuch a want, throughout every ſtage of my medical ſtudies. In order to acquire a knowledge of the improvements which had lately taken place in this important branch of phyſical ſcience, I was obliged to range with an infinitude of labour and attention, through daily accumulating volumes, which it was ſometimes extremely difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. This difficulty was augmented even to impoſſibility itſelf with thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately living out of the ſphere of public libraries.</p>
            <p>The mutilated abridgment of Haller's phyſiology, publiſhed in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is (to uſe a common mode of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) certainly nothing more than a <hi>bare apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for a ſyſtem. It is imperfect, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and, in many places, to me wholly unintelligible. In ſome parts, therefore, it no doubt inculcates truth, in others implants
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:028310_0010_0FD8963AB8E94E30"/>
the ſeeds of error, and in other places again leaves the young mind at liberty to indulge itſelf in all the wildneſs and revelry of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
            <p>For theſe deficiencies and faults. I am ſure that at leaſt ſome compenſation is made, and ſome degree of remedy provided in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets, which I am about to uſher forth to the world. But on this ſubject let deciſion be awarded, and judgment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, by the candid and intelligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not by</p>

It appears to deſerve a place among the moſt elaborate juices of the body, as it ſeldom appears in the tender foetus previouſly to the fourth week after concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in the naſcent young of gallinaceous fowls till the fortieth hour of incubation.

                        <p>Upon the whole, the cauſes, which augment the quantity of the red globules in general, and alſo heighten the intenſity of their colour, are ſufficiently evident: but to diſcover from what ſecret ſource their diſpoſition to this crimſon dye is originally derived, is a matter of Herculean difficulty indeed. Haller aſcribed it to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>crocus martis,</hi> becauſe the blood abounds more with iron than the bones, or other parts of the body, although the quantity contained, even in the blood itſelf, is very ſmall; and although authors differ aſtoniſhingly in their attempts to aſcertain it. Thus, for inſtance, Menghinus eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated its relative proportion to the whole maſs of the blood, to be as 1 to 110; whereas, the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Rhades calculated it to be only as 1 to 427; and again, in ſome future experiments, to be no more than as 1 to 503, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>On the preſent ſubject it ſeems proper to make the following obſervation; viz. that no iron can

be diſcovered in the cruor of the blood unleſs it be previouſly calcined; whereas, on the other hand, when it was dried with a gentle heat, and reduced to the moſt impalpable powder, I could not obſerve a ſingle particle of it attracted by the magnet, whether the experiment was made in water, or in that moſt fluid of all vehicles, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver.</p>

                        <p>We now come to the conſideration of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent part of the maſs of blood, which ſtands laſt in our order of enumeration, viz. the <hi>Lymph;</hi> which is by ſome called the baſis of the craſſamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, by others, the mucous or glutinous part, and by others, the fibrous portion of the blood.</p>
                        <p>This, in former times, was very erroneouſly confounded with the ſerum, from which it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very widely different, in all its eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial properties. When the lymph is expoſed to the action of air, eſpecially of ſuch as is of a low tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, it is immediately coagulated; but by the admixture of quicklime, (which has been already ſaid (§ 11.) to have the power of coagulating ſerum), it is preſerved in a fluid ſtate; or, even though it be already coagulated, yet, by the addition of this ſubſtance, it is again immediately reſolved.</p>

                        <p>We have already touched on the methods, by which this part of the blood may be ſeparated from the cruor (§ 9.). It is alſo by other artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial methods, ſuch as whipping or agitating the blood with ſmall twigs, induced to aſſume the appearance of a membrane, which has been named after Ruyſch its celebrated diſcoverer.</p>

                        <p>It may be proper on the preſent occaſion to mention a few of thoſe numerous phenomena al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, which evidently derive their origin from this property of the lymph; thus we may inſtance in particular, the <hi>pleuritic cruſt,</hi> which is formed on the ſurface of the craſſamentum of blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into a veſſel and ſuffered to remain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time at reſt; the <hi>membrane-like</hi> appearances which uſually tranſude from, and completely inveſt the ſurfaces of the ſeveral viſcera when in a ſtate of inflammation; and alſo the <hi>membrana caduca</hi>

From the ſame ſource originates likewiſe, that production of cellular membrane by which we ſee frequently the lungs connected to the pleura in caſes of peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; as alſo the preternatural portions of the ſame ſubſtance often found in the cavity of the abdomen after profuſe hemorrhages; and finally, to no other ſource can we rationally refer thoſe membrane-like productions, which, in that ſingular ſpecies of diſeaſe, vulgarly denominated Lithopoedion, firmly attach to the contiguous viſcera ſuch parts as are irritated to inflamation by the too long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the calculus or ſtone in the abdominal cavity.

                        <p>And, in the firſt place, its firmneſs is not always uniform.</p>
                        <p>For, in general, other circumſtances being alike, the cellular membrane of the human body is very tender indeed, when compared with that of other animals. If I am not deceived, this very ſoftneſs and pliancy of the cellular ſubſtance in the human ſyſtem, deſerves to be ranked among the leading prerogatives of man; becauſe, in conſequence of it, his ſuſceptibility of impreſſions from the more refined and ſubtle ſtimuli is greatly increaſed, as well as his capacity to perform motions and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous functions, with facility and perfection.</p>
                        <p>But with regard to the more lax or firm texture of the cellular membrane, even among mankind
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028310_0039_0FD89669F8A08178"/>
themſelves, a very great variety occurs, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on age, ſex, mode of life, climate, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the condition of this membrane as to denſity and firmneſs, is various, as it is found exiſting in different parts of the ſame body: thus, it is more lax on the eye-lids and prepuce, more compact and firm about the ears, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>We now proceed to conſider another uſe or office of the cellular membrane, beſides that which we have already ſaid it performs to the body in general, (§ 29, 30); namely, that by means of its numerous ſmall cells, it affords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient temporary receptacles for fluids of different kinds.</p>
                        <p>That fluid, which thoſe minute cells are more particularly deſtined to receive, is a fine halitus of a ſerous nature, or a very ſubtle water, by which almoſt all parts of the body are moiſtened, and lubricated, and which this cellular web appears to abſorb, after the manner of a ſponge <note n="*" place="bottom">If it be admiſſible to deſignate by the name of <hi>veſſels,</hi> thoſe <hi>minute interſtices</hi> of the cellular membrane, by which it abſorbs fluids after the manner of a ſponge, I readily acquieſce in the opinion of William Hunter, (ſee Medic. Obſ. and Inquiries, vol. ii. p. 27. ſeq.) that this web-like expanſion, now under immediate conſideration, is compoſed of a congeries of veſſels, in like manner with the other parts of the body. But if he entertained a belief, that this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane conſiſts of ſmall <hi>cylindrical veins,</hi> which anatomiſts commonly mean to repreſent by the term <hi>veſſels,</hi> I muſt acknowledge, that microſcopical obſervations, conducted with the utmoſt degree of minuteneſs, and the moſt cautious circumſpection, have not been ſufficient to furniſh me with any unequivocal teſtimony that ſuch veſſels actually exiſt, but have rather induced me to embrace a contrary opinion.</note>.</p>

                        <p>And here indeed a threefold variety preſents itſelf to our conſideration:</p>
                        <p>There are, in the firſt place, certain parts of the body, the cellular ſubſtance of which, though of a very ſoft and extremely flaccid nature, is notwithſtanding, never filled with fat in a healthy ſubject; ſuch, for inſtance is that which lines the eyelids, and that ſpread on the genital organs of the male, &amp;c. But further, in numerous parts throughout the body, there are not unfrequently found irregular and tranſient collections of fat, which appear to reſide in the ſame kind of cells, which at other times act as reſervoirs to the atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated ſerous fluid already mentioned.</p>
                        <p>But finally, in certain parts of the body, and, unleſs I am deceived, in cells of a peculiar nature, and given deſcription, fat is found conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, deſigned to ſubſerve ſtated, uniform, and ſpecific uſes in the animal economy, ſuch, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is that which, in the female ſyſtem, forms the <hi>mons veneris,</hi> which appears to me to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a very peculiar and completely circumſcribed protuberance <note n="*" place="bottom">This circumſtance I had an opportunity of aſcertaining in a much more ſatiſfactory manner in the dead body of a female ape. After having for ſome time ſubjected the corpſe to the action of cold, I was able, by removing the ſkin, to expoſe entire the circumſcribed globe of fat ſituated beneath the pubes.</note>.</p>

                        <p>On the ſubject of the fat itſelf we will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make a few obſervations, the being ſo very proper a place for entering on the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                        <p>It is an oil, not unlike the unctuous oils of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; bland, inodorous, and lighter than water, conſiſting of phlogiſton, united to phlegm by means of an acid of a peculiar nature.</p>

                        <p>Its conſiſtence is various in different parts of the body.

                        <p>A controverſy has exiſted with reſpect to the <hi>ſecretion</hi> of the ſubſtance, namely, whether it is performed by a peculiar ſet of glandular bodies,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028310_0043_0FD896717A3DE598"/>
agreeably to the opinion of William Hunter, or whether it merely tranſudes, by ſimple diapedeſis, through the patulous mouths of arteries? The latter of theſe opinions, beſides other arguments which might be advanced in its favour, appears the moſt probable from hence, that not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preternatural collections of fat have been diſcovered in other parts than thoſe commonly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by this ſubſtance: this circumſtance can be much more aptly and rationally explained by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing ſuch unuſual collections of fat to an <hi>error<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loci,</hi> ariſing from a morbid ſtate or diſpoſition of the veſſels, than by referring it to an unnatural and recently formed ſyſtem of glands: thus for example, in the very ball of the eye itſelf, fat has been ſometimes found; and a ſubſtance of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like ſuet, uſually fills up the cavity from which a teſticle has been extracted; indeed there ſcarcely exiſts a cavity in the body in which ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatous collections have not made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude; thoſe ſmall glands to which certain celebrated characters have been ſolicitous to attribute the ſecretion of fat, appear as yet to be in reality nothing more than mere creatures of analogy.</p>

                        <p>The uſes of the fat are numerous. It lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the ſolids, and thus facilitates motion.

by the living ſolid itſelf, conſidered as a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial body. We will confine ourſelves ſolely to the conſideration of thoſe energies which reſide in our body as a ſyſtem of organiſed matter, and which appear to be related to each other in the following order.</p>

                        <p>The firſt and moſt univerſal ſpecies of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal energies, and which may indeed be regarded as an inferior degree of the others, or rather as the threſhold leading to them, is ſimple <hi>contractility,</hi> i. e. a propenſity in a part to contract itſelf.

                        <p>What ſhould be eſteemed the definite ſtandard of the celerity of this motion, in a healthy human ſubject, we are not well able to determine. In this reſpect there is not only a difference between one ſubject and another, but there alſo occurs a great variety relating to this point, ariſing from the difference of ages: there indeed exiſts a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the celerity of the blood's motion, even in the different parts of the ſame body.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the venous blood appears to glide on more ſlowly than the arterial; and when flowing through the <hi>trunks</hi> of veſſels, its motion is more rapid than when paſſing their ſmaller ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                        <p>They are compoſed of three membranous ſtrata, or coats.</p>
                        <p n="1">I.

It conſiſts of condenſed cellular membrane, externally more lax, but becoming by degrees more compact, as you advance nearer to its internal ſurface, where it is overſpread with numerous ſmall blood veſſel.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028310_0069_0FD8969B78DD8E60"/>
To this coat the artery appears to be chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for its tone and elaſticity.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The ſecond or middle ſtratum, is compoſed of tranſverſe fibres, aſſuming a lunated or falciform figure and direction; its ſubſtance has a fleſhy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, from whence it has been called the muſcular coat, and in it the vital energy of the arteries appears in a very particular manner, to reſide.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The laſt and moſt internal coat, is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of an extremely ſmooth and poliſhed ſurface, which ſerves as a lining to the cavity of the artery.</p>

                        <p>All the arterial branches in the human body take their origin from either one or the other of two leading trunks.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe trunks is the <hi>pulmonary</hi> artery, which, riſing from the anterior ventricle of the heart, paſſes into the lungs.</p>

                        <p>An opinion has been conceived and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated as an eſtabliſhed truth, that, throughout the whole ſanguiferous ſyſtem, the <hi>aggregate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of all the branches, taken together, is ſuperior to that of the trunk from which ſuch branches directly originate. I fear, however, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this opinion have expreſſed themſelves on this ſubject in terms by far too general, and have ſometimes even confounded the meaſure of the diameter of veſſels, with that of their area. In my inveſtigations and inquiries on this ſubject, I did not truſt to the reſult of a ſingle experiment, nor did I confine my experiments to veſſels filled with wax, which, however improper, were the only kind uſed by ſome celebrated phyſiologiſts, in their attempts to aſcertain the matter now under conſideration; but, as the nature and importance of the ſubject evidently demanded, I made my experiments and obſervations on the ſound and unaltered veſſels of ſubjects recently dead. I took,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028310_0071_0FD8969F3B9A9738"/>
for example, that nameleſs trunk from which the right carotid and ſubclavian arteries diverge as branches, and alſo the brachial trunk, together with its branches, the radial and cubital arteries, and having formed a rectangular triangle, from the diameter of the trunk and the diameters of its appended ramifications, I found, from the well known theorem of Pythagoras, that the ſquare of the hypothenuſe was equal to the ſum of the ſquares of the baſe and perpendicular.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, in arteries of the ſmalleſt orders, Haller himſelf acknowledged that the capacity of the trunks is greater than that of their ramifications; ſo that, at leaſt, the common calculation does not apply univerſally, but, (if it be indeed ever admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible), muſt be reſtricted to a very few orders of veſſels.</p>

                        <p>Each trunk and ramification, ſeparately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, have been commonly believed to poſſeſs a conical figure, the baſe, or that part next to the heart, being ſuppoſed more capacious than the oppoſite extremity. This opinion appears however to be hypothetical: for, whoever will take the trouble of examining the arteries with accuracy and attention, will find their figure to be perfectly cylindrical: indeed, on the other hand,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028310_0072_0FD896A0C76F9468"/>
there are not wanting inſtances of ſome arteries which in their progreſs rather widen and expand, ſuch, for example, are the mammariae internae, or internal mammaries, and even the arch of the aorta itſelf is more contracted at its baſe than at its apex or top. All arteries, eſpecially thoſe of the larger orders, appear to be a little dilated and enlarged, juſt before their diviſion into branches.</p>

                        <head>§ 76.</head>
                        <p>The number of orders, formed by the diviſions of the main arterial trunk into the progreſſive ſeries of uniformly decreaſing ramifications, from its firſt origin at the heart, to its final termination in the extreme capillaries, cannot poſſibly be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally aſcertained and eſtabliſhed as a general and unvarying reſult. The truth of this poſition will be obvious to any one who conſiders, that in the different parts of the body, eſpecially in the viſcera, the arteries are ſubject to great variety with reſpect to their diviſions; and that, on this account, they ſometimes form more, ſometimes fewer orders of veſſels, previouſly to their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into evaneſcent capillaries.</p>
                        <p>Hence the diſagreement of authors who have attempted to amuſe themſelves with calculations of this kind. Thus, for example, Keil eſtimated the number of the orders of arteries at fifty, while
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028310_0073_0FD896A2435005C0"/>
Haller contended that they amount to no more than twenty.</p>

                        <p>After numerous diviſions of this kind, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious anaſtomoſes, by which the neighbouring branches of arteries communicate with each other, they at length arrive at their final terminations, which are completely continuous with, or which fairly open into, the origins of <hi>veins;</hi> ſo that, their route being uninterrupted, they are reflected from extremities that can ſcarcely be diſcerned, and thus converted into thoſe returning veſſels, by which the blood, lately arterial, but now become venous, is conveyed back again to the heart.</p>

                        <p>This ſyſtole of the ventricles, which is ſuppoſed to conſume about one third part of the whole time of the heart's pulſation, is performed in ſuch a manner, that the exterior ſides of thoſe cavities are approximated and contracted towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſeptum which ſeparates the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle from the left; which contraction, eſpecially if we attend to the conical figure of thoſe cavities, appears fully ſufficient to evacuate them of their contents.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this approximation of the lateral parts of the heart towards each other, the apex of that organ is, during its ſyſtolic motion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted towards, and brought nearer to its baſis; as has been frequently obſerved not only in the inferior animals both of <hi>cold</hi>

I am led to the adoption of this opinion from a variety of obſervations made on the heart of a duck, in a great portion of which a complete oſſification had taken place. This heart was depoſited in my anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal collection by my very liberal and worthy friend C. F. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelis, and is marked by completely oſſified ſtriae running from its baſe to its apex.

                        <p>The frequency of the pulſations of the human heart in a healthy ſtate, is extremely different in different ſubjects.

                        <p>But it is an obſervation as common as it is true, that the pulſe becomes more frequent after the taking in of aliment, and after an emiſſion of ſemen. The ſame effect is alſo produced on the pulſe by a want of ſleep, by bodily exerciſe, or by paſſions of the mind.</p>

                        <p>In this inceſſant routine, the heart continues its pulſations, down to the extreme glimmerings of life's periſhable flame; and even <hi>then,</hi> all its parts do not ceaſe from action at the ſame moment,

                        <p>This may be ſufficiently illuſtrated in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: After the laſt act of expiration, the lungs now in a collapſed ſtate, can no longer admit the blood to flow through them in its cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary channel, while at the ſame time that wave of blood which they have juſt returned to the left ſide of the heart, is from thence forceably expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through the aorta, and thus urges forward by a <hi>vis a tergo</hi> the advancing column of venous blood: from this combination and concurrence of circumſtances, the blood returning with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation and impetuoſity, ruſhes violently into the appendices and ventricle on the right ſide of the heart, in conſequence of which the parietes of thoſe cavities are thrown into convulſive efforts, and thus continue to be agitated, for ſome time, after the left ſide of that organ is completely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all vital motion.</p>

But, on the other hand, it is no leſs evident and incontrovertible, that the nerves do alſo poſſeſs a very powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and command over the action of the heart: this we learn, as well from the peculiar habit and appearance of the cardiac nerves, from their ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their defect of covering, and their ſingular diſpoſition and arrangement, as from the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſent of the heart with by far the greater number of the functions of the human body, even with thoſe of the moſt oppoſite nature. In teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the reality of this conſent, it may be ſufficient barely to mention, the ſudden and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſympathy which, even in a healthy ſubject, exiſts between all the paſſions of the mind and the heart, together with that, which, in a great many ſpecies of diſeaſe, manifeſts itſelf between this organ and the <hi>primae viae.</hi>

                        <p>Of theſe <hi>ſecondary powers,</hi> the firſt to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is, the <hi>functions of the arteries,</hi> the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which, in promoting and continuing the circulation of the blood, appears to be, indeed, very conſiderable; although the true principles and mode of their action, on this fluid, have not yet been fully developed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Speaking in general terms, there exiſts a very conſiderable reſemblance between the arteries and the heart itſelf: that the arteries, for example, have a <hi>muſcular coat,</hi> is a fact of the utmoſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity (§ 72.)</p>

                        <p>Finally, It is well known to every one that the arteries pulſate, and that indeed with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and force, that if we ſuffer one of our legs to lie over the other knee, the pulſations of the popliteal artery are ſufficient to elevate in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed for a long time paſt, both a ſyſtolic contraction and diaſtolic relaxation have been attributed to the arteries, which motions have been ſaid to correſpond and harmonize with the alternate contractions and dilatations of the ventircles of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Though the truth of this laſt propoſition is generally believed to be eſtabliſhed and confirmed by the ſimple teſtimony of the ſenſes themſelves, the ſubject is nevertheleſs ſtill embarraſſed with
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028310_0106_0FD882956A555378"/>
various doubts and difficulties: theſe difficulties immediately riſe to view, when it is aſked, whether this vibrating or pulſatory motion, which is felt on examination by the finger, is to be attributed to the inherent energy of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, or to the impulſe of the heart; and whether the whole motion of the arteries does not depend ſolely on the impetus with which the blood is projected into the aorta, and thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinges againſt the ſides of that tube, and its rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications?</p>
                        <p>Diſſections of living animals have not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to decide this controverſy. For it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that during the live-diſſections of warm blooded animals you may diſcover the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger arteries pulſating, while at other times again they appear in a ſtate of complete reſt. In man himſelf, while in the enjoyment of vitality, I had once an occaſional opportunity of obſerving the neighbouring trunks of the aorta and pulmonary artery, to be perfectly deſtitute of all motion; but it ſhould not be forgotten, that this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non appeared in a caſe of monſtrous or preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural formation of the parts.

                        <p>When all circumſtances relative to this ſubject are impartially weighed and diſpaſſionately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, this appears to be the reſult, viz. that the <hi>diaſtole</hi> of the larger arteries takes place in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their peculiar nature, and is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the impetus of the blood ruſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly into them, and expanding their coats or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics, which, by means of their elaſticity, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately return again to their natural dimenſions. To the ſame impulſe alſo ſhould be attributed that lateral or curving motion of their axes, which may frequently be obſerved in the larger arteries when they run in a ſerpentine direction, and lie embedded in ſoft cellular membrane.</p>
                        <p>But in a ſound ſtate of the ſyſtem, we contend that the arteries ſcarcely exhibit any unequivocal proofs of a <hi>true ſyſtole,</hi> i. e. they do not by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine contraction recede from their <hi>natural,</hi> to <hi>ſmaller</hi> dimenſions, as long as the heart is adequate to the due performance of its momentous func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but although it be certain, that the arteries do not always, yet we acknowledge that they do ſometimes, exhibit and exerciſe a power of real contraction: thus for inſtance, when the heart is

deficient in its action in conſequence of labouring under either a morbid oſſification, or ſome other ſpecies of diſeaſe, it is probable that then the duties of this important organ devolve on, and are diſcharged by, the arteries, and that the blood is thus kept in motion by the vital energy of thoſe animated tubes.</p>

That theſe minute valves are of the utmoſt importance in promoting and continuing the regular and free circulation of the blood, is ſatisfactorily demonſtrated by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent congeſtions and infarctions, which happen in thoſe veins that originate in the inferior parts of the abdominal cavity, and which are entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſuch valves.</p>

                        <p>This pliability, or facility of motion is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obſervable in ſix pairs of the true ribs, which

                        <p>Enquiries have been inſtituted for the purpoſe of aſcertaining the nature of thoſe changes which the air we inſpire undergoes in our lungs. Such changes certainly do not ariſe, as was formerly believed, from the loſs of any myſterious principle of elaſticity, which reſides in the air, but are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently produced by a decompoſition of its elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary parts. For the atmoſpheric air which we breathe is truly an aſtoniſhing mixture of elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubſtances, very widely different from each other in their natures. Not to mention the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious heterogenous matters which this neceſſary fluid contains; ſuch, for example, as the aerial ſeeds of the ſmalleſt and moſt ſimple plants, the odorous effluvia ariſing from numerous bodies, volumes of duſt, and a thouſand other ſimilar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which for the moſt part float in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. Not to mention, I ſay, theſe hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous bodies at all, the air which we breathe always contains aqueous exhalations in larger or ſmaller quantities, and is alſo more or leſs charged with the matters of electricity and magnetiſm. But finally, though the whole of the foregoing ſubſtances be left entirely out of view, yet even then the air of our atmoſphere does not conſiſt of one ſimple aeriform fluid, but is compoſed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſticated, phlogiſticated, and fixed airs.</p>

It is in the mean time, however, the common eſtimation, that the air of our atmoſphere conſiſts of about ¼th, part of dephlogiſticated, 11/16ths of phlogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and 1/6th of fixed air.</p>

                        <p>It appears, that at each inſpiration, (in which an adult ſubject, breathing in a quiet and tranquil manner, draws in about 30 cubic inches of air,) a fourth part of the dephlogiſticated air is decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and, in a great meaſure, exchanged for phlogiſticated and fixed airs; ſo that the expired fluid, being received into a proper veſſel, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes flame or coals when immerſed into it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates lime from the water which ſuſpends it, and far exceeds atmoſpheric air in its ſpecific gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>Speech</hi> itſelf is a peculiar modification of the voice, chiefly by the aid of the tongue, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially alſo by that of the lips, the teeth, the palate, and by the further aſſiſtance of the noſe, combined into the formation of words.</p>
                        <p>Hence the difference between <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>ſpeech</hi> appears very obvious and plain: the firſt is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently formed in the larynx itſelf; whereas the latter is effected by the ſingular mechaniſm of the other organs already mentioned. It is but juſt and proper, however, to obſerve, that this laſt poſition is not capable of univerſal application, as there are a few nations (of which the Sinenſians may ſerve as an example), among whom their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>homonymous</hi>

With reſpect to man himſelf, it is however to be remembered, that he appears to be inferior, in the heat of his ſyſtem, to thoſe other kinds of animals we have juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Thus, in our climate, the heat of the human body generally ſtands at about the 96th degree of Fahrenheit's ſcale, whereas, in other animals belonging to the claſs Mammalia, the vital temperature very conſiderably exceeds this point, while it aſcends ſtill higher in individuals of the feathered tribes.</p>

For the opinion formerly delivered by Boerhaave, that man has not a power of exiſting in a medium of ſuch a nature as exceeds in temperature the native heat of his own body, has, ſince the famous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of that illuſtrious traveller and former governor of Georgia, H.

                        <p>The whole drift and tenor of Crawford's theory obviouſly reſults in this, that <hi>reſpiration,</hi> no leſs than <hi>combuſtion,</hi> belongs to ſuch proceſſes as are called phlogiſtic; in which the phlogiſton reſiding in, and conſtituting a part of, our bodies, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the acceſſion of <hi>free</hi> or <hi>ſenſible</hi> heat, (which ought to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from heat exiſting in a <hi>fixed</hi> or <hi>latent</hi> ſtate.)</p>

                        <p>It appears, therefore, extremely probable, that the igneous portion of the air we breathe enters thoſe minute blood-veſſels, which are every where diſperſed throughout the ſubſtance of the lungs, and ſeparated from the air-veſicles themſelves by nothing more than ſubtle partitions of the moſt filmy texture (§ 136); that from the lungs it is conveyed through the pulmonary veins to the aorta, from whence it is again, by means of the arterial ſyſtem, diſtributed throughout every part of the body.</p>

This phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic principle, being thus mixed with the blood, and occupying the place juſt evacuated by the matter of heat, is conveyed back, by means of the venous ſyſtem to the right ſide of the heart, and from thence by the pulmonary artery, into the lungs, where, agreeably to thoſe laws of affinity which we juſt now hinted at, it is immediately received and taken up by the volume of air recently inſpired. In conſequence of the acceſſion of this quantity of phlogiſton, and its union with the air contained in the lungs, a freſh portion of the element of fire or heat is ſet at liberty, which inſtantly enters the blood and is thus inceſſantly diſtributed throughout the ſyſtem in the manner already deſcribed.</p>

                        <p>For it ſeems altogether probable, that thoſe extremely minute ramifications of the ſanguiferous ſyſtem, are parts of ſuch utility and importance, that in proportion as their action is ſtronger or weaker, a correſpondent increaſe or diminution takes place in that exchange of the element of fire for the matter of phlogiſton, which goes conſtantly forward in the body, and alſo in the heat of the animal uniformly generated by ſuch exchange.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe memorable and ſtriking phenomena, from which it appears, that animal heat (if indeed the matter be determined by a thermometer, and not truſted to the fallacious teſt of ſenſation), remains in general at very nearly the ſame preciſe point of temperature, little augmented by the ſummer's blaze, little diminiſhed by the winter's blaſt; and further, that on certain occaſions the heat of our bodies is even increaſed in conſequence of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion in cold water—Thoſe phenomena, I ſay, ſeem to demonſtrate, and reduce it to a certainty,

that according to the variations that take place in the <hi>temperature</hi> of the medium in which we live, correſponding diverſities immediately follow in the <hi>action</hi> of the ſmalleſt vaſcular ramifications of our bodies. From this ſingularly accommodating power, reſident in the minute extremities of our vaſcular ſyſtem, it follows, that on being expoſed to cold (which appears to act by increaſing their tone), they are immediately enabled to exchange a <hi>larger quantity</hi> of the principle of phlogiſton for the igneous pabulum, and thus generate a higher degree of heat; whereas, on the other hand, they are obliged to exchange a much <hi>ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> as often as they are rendered inactive by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected to the influence of a relaxing and debilitating medium.</p>

                        <p>The texture of the epidermis is ſimple to the utmoſt degree, being entirely deſtitute of veſſels, of nerves and of pores.

                        <p>The part now under conſideration, conſtitutes the primary and principal ſeat of colour in the human race. In all men the true ſkin is fair and ſhining; the cuticle alſo is ſemipellucid and whitiſh in all nations, except the inhabitants of Aethiopia, in whom it is more duſkiſh and obſcure.

This peculiarity of appearance is produced by ſmall plicae or folds, which they exhibit, running in angular directions, more or leſs oblique. Theſe folds were formerly deſcribed by P. P.

In conſequence of this intricate and uninveſtigated texture of theſe bodies, he conjectured, that each nervous filament, or thread proceeding from them, participates, or contains in its compoſition, a part of every filament that enters into their ſtructure, however numerous thoſe filaments may be, or however different the ſources from which they originate.</p>

This native or excluſive energy of the nerves, appears to be principally ſupported and preſerved by that vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cortex or covering of thoſe organs, of which we briefly ſpoke on a former occaſion (§ 205).

of this ſyſtem, other parts of the body, eſpecially ſuch muſcles as are ſubjected to the influence of the will, are excited to motion; of this function, however, we will treat more fully in another place.

                        <p>That an oſcillation of the nerves does indeed exiſt, is a poſition, powerfully ſupported by a great variety of very ſtriking and pointed phyſiological phenomena. This oſcillation muſt not, however, be ſuppoſed to bear any reſemblance to the rude vibrations of tenſe chords, but is ſuch a ſubtle, tremulous motion, as may be readily conceived to

                        <p>But as an eye perfectly ſound is able to diſcern, with equal diſtinctneſs, bodies, whether at a greater or leſs diſtance, it muſt, without doubt, be furniſhed with peculiar faculties or powers of accommodating itſelf to the various diſtances of objects. That theſe internal and accommodating changes of the eye, are in a great meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the preſſure of the <hi>recti</hi> muſcles on the ball which they embrace, is a poſition ſo clear, and apparently well founded, as ſcarcely to admit of a doubt. Beſides other arguments which might
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028310_0205_0FD8835C286C4C10"/>
be advanced in favour of this opinion, I am induced to adopt it in conſideration of the very ſingular ſtructure, and extreme flexility, of the <hi>ſclerotica,</hi> in the eye of the Greenland phoca, or ſea-calf. By this peculiarity of fabrication and arrangement, nature has made the moſt exquiſite proviſion to enable this amphibious animal to enjoy at all times, the advantages of viſion, though paſſing its life alternately in media of very different denſities.</p>

                        <p>By means of theſe ſame muſcles, our eyes, whilſt we are awake, are perpetually agitated, although with an almoſt inſenſible motion, and ſo directed as to have their viſual axes arranged in right lines with the objects viewed. For although the whole of the retina be poſſeſſed of ſenſibility, yet it is not in every part equally well adapted to receive the images of objects.</p>
                        <p>For at the genuine axis of the eye-ball, in the place, for example, where the optic nerve enters, it appears, from the well-known and celebrated experiment of Mariotte, that the human eye is deſtitute of the power of viſion.</p>

                        <p>The habit of directing the axis of the eye with diſpatch and facility towards the object of viſion, is finally acquired only by uſe and daily exerciſe. That this is a poſition founded in truth, is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated not only by the example of ſuch individuals as, having been born blind, acquired afterwards the power of viſion in adult age, but alſo by that of tender infants, who ſeldom attain to this happy facility of moving their eyes previouſly to the third month after birth.</p>

perfection of the human eye, becauſe this extent of the angle of viſion may continue nearly the ſame, under any light whatever, whether that of the meridian ſun, or that of a weak lamp, ſo that though the window or pupil of the eye be greatly contracted and diminiſhed, yet the clearneſs of viſion can, from that ſource, be ſcarcely in any degree affected.</p>

                        <p>For, on the one hand, a few of the functions of our bodies, over which the will, unaſſiſted by other powers, may be ſaid to poſſeſs no command at all, may notwithſtanding be excited and brought into action, when the imagination and paſſions of the mind act in concert with the will.</p>

                        <p>Thus, for example, we wink <hi>contrary</hi> to our determination, when the finger of a friend is haſtily approached towards our eye, although it does not touch it; and in moſt perſons, the flexion of the little finger is uſually attended with a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronous flexion of the ring finger, though a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination had been formed to preſerve the latter entirely unbent.</p>
                        <p>Without the <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> of the mind we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently move our limbs, even when wrapt in the moſt proſound ſleep.</p>

To this head we may refer the difficulty of deſcribing, by ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronous movements, circles in contrary directions, with the hand and foot of the ſame ſide, together with other motions of a ſimilar nature, which, although truly voluntary, and extremely eaſy when practiſed alone, are, notwithſtanding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the utmoſt difficulty, if an attempt be made to aſſociate them with certain other motions.</p>

In confirmation of the truth of this, we have the public teſtimony of Baynard and Cheyne, two phyſicians of the higheſt reputation
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028310_0219_0FD88385E12AB518"/>
and veracity, who were themſelves witneſſes to the aſtoniſhing phenomenon.</p>
                        <p>That the motion of the ſtomach may be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, (as indeed the proceſs of rumination in general ſeems to evince), I had once an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of aſcertaining, to my entire ſatisfaction, in a ruminating human ſubject, in whom this retrogade or reverted motion of the ſtomach, was under the moſt perfect ſubjection to the command of the will.</p>
                        <p>Although the motion of the iris be involuntary, in by far the greater part of the human race, I have, notwithſtanding, been favoured with an account, ſufficiently authenticated, of a man, who poſſeſſed a power of voluntary command over this membrane, in ſuch a manner, as to be able, by a very ſingular effort, to contract the pupil of the eye even in a weak and dull light.</p>
                        <p>There are indeed a great variety of motions, which, though generally performed without the influence of the mind, are nevertheleſs voluntary in certain individuals, eſpecially if a high degree of attention, and a vigorous effort of imagination be excited.

                        <p>Perhaps thoſe phenomena may be ſatisfactorily explained from the <hi>re-action</hi> of the <hi>ſenſorium,</hi> which appears to be indeed as powerfully excited by means of the imagination waking up and exhibiting before it, the <hi>image</hi> of an active ſtimulus, as by the <hi>ſtimulus itſelf,</hi> when impreſſing it by its actual preſence.

                        <p>Their texture is fleſhy, compoſed of a peculiar ſet of fibres, of a very pale red colour: they are ſo joined together, that every muſcle conſiſts, in the firſt place, of fibrous cords, theſe cords again, of ſmaller bundles of fibres, which bundles, by a ſtill further progreſſive diviſion, may be finally ſeparated and reſolved into fleſhy fibres and fibrils of inconceivable minuteneſs.</p>

blended along with the muſcular fibres; but the <hi>former</hi> are ſo extenſively and minutely interwoven among thoſe very tender fibres, as to paint the whole of the fleſhy parts with that beautiful crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dye, by which they are uniformly characteriſed.

                        <p>Finally, a circumſtance common to moſt of the muſcles is, that they terminate in <hi>tendons</hi>—parts, which, though likewiſe of a fibrous texture, are notwithſtanding ſo extremely different, with reſpect to colour, ſtructure, elaſticity, &amp;c. that their entire diſagreement from both the preceding kinds of fibres, is very eaſily aſcertained and demonſtrated. Hence, therefore, we are enabled ſucceſsfully to refute the opinion of thoſe phyſiologiſts, who have erroneouſly ſuppoſed, that the <hi>tendinous,</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than mere continuations of the <hi>muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> fibres. To the adoption of this opinion, they have been inadvertently led by attending to the following phenomenon, obſervable in the muſcles of infants; namely, if we compare the <hi>muſcular parts,</hi> of theſe tender ſubjects, with <hi>thoſe</hi> of adults, we will find the proportion of fleſh, to that of tendon, greater in the former than in the latter.</p>

                        <p>The principal ſeat of this energy, where it moſt plentifully abounds, is the hollow muſcles, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervient to the vital and natural functions: of theſe muſcles, the heart, as was obſerved formerly (§ 119.), poſſeſſes the higheſt degree of the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic</hi> now under conſideration: of this laſt mentioned organ, the internal ſurface, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is endowed with the moſt exalted degree of life, and is by far the moſt tenacious of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

                        <p>Haller himſelf, that illuſtrious defender of the doctrine now under conſideration, appears to me to have, without ſufficient foundation, attributed irritability to <hi>certain parts</hi> of the body, which are found, indeed, on experiment, to be endowed with <hi>contractility</hi> (§ 50 ſeq.), but in which I have never been able to diſcover any indubitable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of genuine <hi>irritability.</hi>

                        <p>On no better foundation, in my opinion, is irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability attributed, by others, to the iris, to the external ſurface of the lungs, &amp;c. in all which parts (if, indeed, I be capable of judging rightly), there exiſts no more of this vital energy, than there does in the common cellular membrane, and parts compoſed of it, ſuch, for inſtance, as the common integuments, the meninges, the pleura, the peritoneum, the perioſteum, the medullary membrane, the tendons, the aponeuroſes, &amp;c.; or than there does in thoſe viſcera compoſed of genuine <hi>parenchyma,</hi> (§ 27.), ſuch as the liver,

                        <p>With regard to the general principle, commonly taught and adopted on this ſubject, viz. that every muſcle while in action, draws the more moveable part to which it is attached, towards that which is more permanent, it ought to be conſidered, (as has been very juſtly obſerved by the ſagacious Winſlow) in a relative point of view, and is indeed ſubject to a variety of limitations. Thus, for example, the two parts to which a muſcle is attached, may be rendered, each more moveable than the other, in alternate viciſſitudes, accordingly as the one or the other is fixed and rendered ſtationary, by the joint action of other co-operating muſcles.</p>
                        <p>As to the action of the flexor muſcles, it ought to be eſtimated on contrary principles, and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion formed reſpecting it.

                        <p>Beſides the peculiar advantages which the muſcles ſeverally derive from their determinate figures, their actions are alſo promoted by a variety of other concomitant aids, ſuch, for inſtance, as the annular ligaments by which they are ſurrounded; the fat, in which a great number of them are imbedded; the lymphatic dew with which they all abound; and, what ought to have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the very firſt inſtance, the conformation of the ſkeleton itſelf, eſpecially as far as the ſame relates to the ſtructure of the apophyſes, and the

                        <p>Sleep is a function perfectly periodical, which ſuſpends, as it were, for a time, all intercourſe and communication between the mind and body. The various phenomena of this function, ſome of which ſhall be immediately enumerated, appear to declare, with no ſmall force of evidence, in favour of the exiſtence of a nervous fluid.</p>

of ſleep, a ſluggiſhneſs and gradually increaſing dullneſs of the external ſenſes, together with a relaxation of moſt of the voluntary muſcles, eſpecially ſuch as are of conſiderable length. To theſe may be added a congeſtion of the venous blood in, and near, the heart, and an effort to remove the uneaſineſs thence ariſing, by the aid of yawning. Finally, the only additional pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſor to be mentioned at preſent, which appears to conſtitute the very <hi>iſthmus,</hi> as it were, between the waking and ſleeping ſtates, and the immediate tranſition of the former into the latter, is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſpecies of tranſient delirium.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>remote cauſes</hi> which induce ſleep are very plain and obvious. For to ſay nothing of narcotic ſubſtances themſelves, we may conſider as very energetic cauſes in the production of this ſtate, all <hi>waſte</hi> of the <hi>animal powers</hi> by means of preceding <hi>fatigue,</hi> by <hi>watching,</hi> &amp;c. To theſe we may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the influence of cuſtom, together with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſilence, reſt, &amp;c. which appear indeed to derive their ſomniferous powers from the ſame ſource; we may alſo further add, gentle, uniform, and conſtant impreſſions acting on any of the ſenſes, ſuch, for inſtance, as the ſoft murmurings of the rill, or the appearance of a harveſt field, agitated and thrown into wavy undulations, by the mild fannings of the weſtern breeze, &amp;c. Under the ſame head of remote cauſes we may alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, full meals, and intenſe cold acting on the body, together with a variety of other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, tending to derive the blood from the encephalon, as pediluvia, clyſters, and profuſe hemorrhages, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe remote cauſes which we have mentioned in the latter part of the preceding paragraph, are, of themſelves, ſufficient to conduct us to the <hi>proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe,</hi> which appears, from the beſt evidence

                        <p>That this is indeed the proximate cauſe of ſleep, is powerfully illuſtrated and confirmed, by a very ſingular and ſtriking phenomenon, which I had once an opportunity of obſerving in a living human ſubject, whoſe caſe has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on another occaſion. As often, and as long, as this perſon indulged himſelf in ſleep, his brain ſubſided and continued in a ſtate of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable collapſe, but during his waking hours throughout the day, this organ became again turgid and diſtended in conſequence of a more copious afflux of blood.</p>
                        <p>As an additional argument in ſupport of the ſame <hi>cauſe,</hi> we may obſerve, that <hi>morbid watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> on the other hand, uſually ariſes from congeſtions of blood in the region of the brain.</p>

                        <p>That man is by nature an herbivorous animal, Rouſſeau attempted, with a great degree of acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to prove, not only by arguments taken from the figure of his teeth, and the length of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, but by the further conſideration, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is naturally uniparous, and furniſhed with two mammae, &amp;c.; to all which might be added, actual examples of rumination having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by human ſubjects, a proceſs well known to belong excluſively to herbivorous animals.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe, on the contrary, who, with Helvetius, conſider man as a carnivorous animal, attempt to ſupport their opinion by the ſhortneſs of his <hi>inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum caecum,</hi> and other arguments of a ſimilar nature.</p>

                        <p>But from more accurate obſervation, and a more minute inveſtigation of the ſubject, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that nature did not intend to reſtrict man to the excluſive uſe of either the one or the other of thoſe kinds of <hi>aliment,</hi> but more indulgently deſtined him to a free participation of both. That this is indeed the kind deſtination of man with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the nature of his food, we very naturally infer from his teeth, eſpecially the <hi>molares,</hi> and the conformation of his inteſtines, briefly mentioned above, poſſeſſing a middle ſtate between the ſame parts, as they exiſt in carnivorous and in herbivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous animals.

                        <p>Of all animals, with which we are in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure acquainted, man may, with the ſtricteſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and truth, be ſaid to be <hi>omniverous.</hi> As on the one hand he is calculated to banquet in luxury, amidſt the moſt profuſe variety of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that art can prepare from the immenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, ſo, on the contrary, he is able to retain his health and vigour when ſubſiſting on the moſt ſimple and frugal fare.</p>
                        <p>Thus, to produce only a very few examples, a great many men even at the preſent day ſubſiſt ſolely on a vegetable diet, ſuch as potatoes, cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, dates, &amp;c. which conſtituted alſo the food of the firſt progenitors of the human race: for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears highly probable, that thoſe ſimple and hardy ſons of nature, ſupported life firſt by the fruits and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028310_0351_0FDAB670E8573D70"/>
roots of plants, and afterwards, by the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and durable fare of grains and pulſe.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Mooriſh tribes in Africa live almoſt entirely on the gum ſenegal.</p>

                        <p>Some nations of Barbarians ſubſiſt even on raw fleſh, a circumſtance which is undoubtedly true, with reſpect to the Samoids, the Eſquimaux, and certain tribes of people inhabiting South America.</p>
                        <p>Neither are the liquids made uſe of as drinks, in certain nations, leſs ſingular and ſtriking.</p>

                        <p>The motion of the tongue, in this momentous buſineſs, is regulated and directed by the os hyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ideum.</p>
                        <p>To prevent any of the ſubſtances ſwallowed, from paſſing, by miſtake, either into the internal nares, or into the euſtachean tubes, the ſoft palate is very wiſely provided.

                        <p>The <hi>glottis</hi> is ſecurely guarded by the tongue itſelf, becauſe at the very inſtant in which we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſwallow, the larynx, being drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, is in a certain degree concealed beneath the retracted baſis of the tongue, and is ſo compreſſed by it, that the glottis, not only by this conſtriction, but alſo by the additional ſecurity of the epiglottis, is thus very effectually guarded againſt the intruſive entrance of any heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubſtances.</p>

ſtrata of muſcular fibres, which are uſually divided into three orders, one longitudinal, and two circular; the circular fibres are again divided into thoſe that are <hi>directly,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,</hi> circular. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that ſo extremely variable and irregular are the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of this coat, with regard to their direction and diſtribution, as ſcarcely to admit of reduction to, and arrangement under, any determinate and general rules.</p>
                        <p>The third principal coat is called the <hi>nervous,</hi> an appellation extremely improper, as it is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wholly of condenſed cellular membrane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming gradually more ſoft and lax on each ſide; by which means it is connected externally to the muſcular, and internally to what we ſhall preſently call the <hi>villous,</hi> coat. It is, notwithſtanding, ſo firm and robuſt, that it may be aptly enough call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>baſis</hi> of the whole ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, the <hi>internal</hi> coat, which has been very improperly called <hi>villous,</hi> is exceedingly tender, ſomewhat ſpongy, porous, and folded into a very great number of rugae or wrinkles, ſo that its area is much more extenſive than that of any of the other coats which we have juſt deſcribed: it every where exhibits cells of the utmoſt minuteneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

ſimilar in appearance to thoſe larger ones, with which the <hi>reticulum</hi> of ruminating animals is very beautifully and elegantly characterized.</p>
                        <p>The internal ſurface of this coat is lined with mucus, apparently ſecreted by ſmall mucaginous cryptae, ſome of which may be, indeed, readily enough diſtinguiſhed near to the <hi>pylorus,</hi> or lower orifice of this organ.</p>

                        <p>The ſtomach is furniſhed with an aſtoniſhing apparatus of nerves, whence its ſenſibility is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that it is capable of being very readily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſtimuli of almoſt every kind, whether they be <hi>external,</hi> as cold &amp;c. or <hi>internal</hi> as food, and even by the inquiline humours themſelves.

                           <p>Doctor Maclurg, of Virginia, publiſhed in the year 1772, an experimental treatiſe on the formation, the nature and the uſes of the human bile, which has acquired for its learned and ingenious author, no ſmall degree of reputation both at home and abroad. That this elaborate publication poſſeſſes an uncommon ſhare of merit, not even the avowed enemies of the Doctor are themſelves able to deny.

He appears to have made himſelf perfectly maſter of the opinions of all authors of celebrity and diſtinction, who had previouſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the ſame ſubject. With regard to the literary merit of the compoſition itſelf, it is doubtleſs entitled to the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums that even the moſt partial eulogiſt can beſtow.

                           <p>All human compoſitions are, however, like the ſources from whence they originate, in ſome meaſure faulty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. To this general maxim, humiliating as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the pride of the ſelf-adoring philoſopher, the treatiſe of the illuſtrious Maclurg is by no means an exception. In ſeveral of the Doctor's experiments there appears to be a want of ſufficient accuracy and definitude, in others a want of object and deſign. Over theſe faults, however, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as they are in the works of an experimentaliſt, we feel inclined to ſpread a kind mantle of palliation, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that our author experimented and wrote in the early morn of ſcientific chemiſtry. Experimenters had not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfect adopts in their nice and momentous art; they had not yet acquired ſufficient circumſpection and addreſs to obviate every ſource of fallacy, and to avail themſelves of every circumſtance that might pave the way to ſatisfactory and unequivocal reſults.</p>

His moſt plauſible reaſons in ſupport of this opinion are, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the parts, from whence the incipient radicles of the vena portarum immediately originate, contain, and communicate with, matter already in a ſemiputreſcent ſtate. And <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that the bile is moſt abundant in quantity and moſt active with regard to its quality, at that ſeaſon, and under thoſe circumſtances, which are moſt favourable to the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and progreſs of putrefaction in the living ſyſtem, as well as in all other phyſical bodies.</p>
                           <p>Plauſible as thoſe arguments may, on firſt view appear, they are certainly, as already obſerved, founded on nothing better than fair, but fallacious analogy.

This air, or rather its baſe (termed oxygene by the ingenious chemiſts of France) is, as we have the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſons to believe, from the experiments of Goodwyn, Beddoes, Girtanner, and others, intimately blended with the circulating blood in its paſſage through the lungs. As the blood proceeds in its mazy route through the different parts of the arterial ſyſtem, it is gradually robbed of its concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant oxygene or baſe of vital air, by the myſterious action of the animal ſyſtem. The conſequence of this ſpoliation is, that the florid <hi>arterial,</hi> aſſumes a much darker colour, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers finally a complete tranſmutation into <hi>venous</hi> blood. In this latter ſtate the putrefactive proceſs is leſs apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, becauſe the blood contains leſs oxygene in a ſtate of intimate mixture, or perhaps I might with more propriety ſay, in a ſtate of combination. For in proportion as the baſe of vital air is more intimately blended with, and therefore more nearly approximated to, the conſtituent parts of the blood, the more powerfully can it co-operate with other aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliary agents, in inducing <hi>theſe parts</hi> to aſſume that inteſtine motion, which conſtitutes the putrefactive proceſs. Although our learned author is decidedly of opinion, that putrefaction commences more readily, if vital air be excluded altogether from the putrefying ſubſtances, yet it is now well know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, that the very reverſe of this is true. Exclude vital air from a body, in the compoſition of which none of this energetic fluid exiſts, and you thereby embalm that body in a deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> equal, if not ſuperior to the embalmment of the unperiſhable mummies of the Eaſt.</p>
                           <p>No body, whatever, is capable of taking on the putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proceſs, that does not contain in its compoſition more or leſs of thoſe ſimple ſubſtances that belong to the claſs of <hi>inflammables.</hi> Reaſoning therefore a <hi>priori,</hi> or climbing the arduous ſteeps of ſcience by the more laborious ſteps of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment and obſervation, we are warranted in either caſe to conclude, that putrefaction conſiſts, in a very conſiderable degree, in the intimate combination of the baſe of vital air to certain ſubſtances of an inflammable nature. Both the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary elements of which putrefiable bodies are compoſed, and alſo the reſults of actual putrefaction, co-operate in the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the ſame concluſion.</p>
                           <p>It is certainly a truth, that vital air is as eſſential to the putrefactive proceſs as it is to the ſupport of combuſtion, or the continuance of animal life.</p>
                           <p>Upon the whole, we may without the ſmalleſt heſitation conclude, that the former opinions of phyſiologiſts reſpecting the ſuppoſed putreſcent diſpoſition of the hepatic blood, are wholly inſupportable by argument or fact, being indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſed to the literal reſult of poſitive experiment; and therefore, that the pious eulogia ſo profuſely beſtowed on the powers of the animal economy, in being able to form an <hi>antiſeptic</hi> out of a highly <hi>putreſcent</hi> fluid, appear to be as viſionary and hypothetical, as <hi>nature's</hi> final intention in the preparation of this fluid was thought to be beneficent, and her proceſs itſelf beautiful, and intereſting.</p>

                        <p>Although the former of theſe opinions appears, on the firſt view of the ſubject, to be rendered moſt probable from the analogy of other ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are evidently the reſult of arterial action, yet from a more accurate inveſtigation of the matter we will readily be convinced, that by far the greater part, if not indeed the whole, of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary ſecretion, is derived from the vena portarum: the blood of this veſſel being lurid, and highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with phlogiſton, correſponds preciſely with the nature of the bile; but how extremely different, on the other hand, are the habit and conſtitution of the florid and fiery arterial blood, which the caeliac artery tranſmits from the aorta immediately to the liver!</p>

                        <p>Thus the abundant phlogiſton, now become troubleſome and noxious to the blood, is firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the liver, where it is rendered ſubſervient to the formation of a ſingular and very important humour: After this humour has fully anſwered the end of its deſtination, its ſuperfluous, or rather noxious part is included among the excrements, and finally eliminated from the ſyſtem.</p>
                        <p>A further uſe of the bile is, to evolve and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate from the alimentary canal, the fixed air, which had been hitherto confined among the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous maſs: it appears alſo to act on, and aid, the inteſtinal tube, by means of its ſtimulus, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing it to perform its periſtaltic motion with greater vigour and energy.</p>

                        <p>It ought to be obſerved, however, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the ſources of mucus appears to reſt on very equivocal evidence. For if I be not greatly deceived, both the Brunnerian and Peyerian glands, as commonly exhibited in plates, are the reſult of a vitiated and diſeaſed ſtate of the inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tube.

                        <p>With reſpect to the naſcent origin of the lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teals from the inteſtines, there exiſts ſcarcely a doubt, but that this is conſtituted by the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>villi</hi> of the internal inteſtinal coat, of which we have already ſpoken. It is, however, ſtill a matter of controverſy, whether the lacteals origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate immediately from thoſe villi themſelves, or only preſerve a more diſtant intercourſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with them, by means of interjacent cellular ſubſtance. As far as my information has extended, no one has hitherto been able, more than myſelf, to trace the evaneſcent radicles of the lacteal veſſels to the villi themſelves, with ſuch clearneſs and definitude, as to diſcover an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and unequivocal connection between the parts; on the other hand, the lacteals appear here and there, throughout the coats of the inteſtines, to form trunks of conſiderable ſize, immediately after their orgin, and, (if a conjecture be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able), to abſorb from the cellular ſubſtance of the adjacent parts, that chyle which had been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally taken up from the cavity of the inteſtines by means of the villi themſelves. This phenomenon I think I have frequently obſerved, in young pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, into which I had poured, according to the celebrated experiment of Liſter, a ſolution of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian blue, one or two hours before ſubjecting them to the operation of <hi>live-diſſection.</hi>

                        <p>It has been propoſed as a phyſiological queſtion, whether or not the <hi>large,</hi> poſſeſs alſo lacteal veins, in common with the <hi>ſmall</hi> inteſtines? The affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this has been zealouſly advocated, and its defence attempted by arguments drawn from the influence and efficacy of ſpecific enemas, of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas compoſed of nutrimental ſubſtances, of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briating ſubſtances, &amp;c. and alſo from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well known circumſtance, viz. that the longer inſpiſſated faeces are retained in the large portion of the alimentary canal, the more indurated and inſucculent they are uniformly found. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe arguments do not ſatisfactorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that any genuine chyle is abſorbed from the faeces after their tranſition over the valve of Fallopius, they furniſh, notwithſtanding, additional evidence in confirmation of that, which has indeed been long ſince eſtabliſhed on the teſtimony of the ſenſe of viſion itſelf, namely, that the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines abound with a ſufficiently plentiful appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus of lymphatic veins, perfectly ſimilar to the lacteals both in their ſtructure and functions: in teſtimony of this entire ſimilarity, it may be proper to obſerve, that when the inteſtines are deſtitute
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028310_0414_0FDAB86536719F40"/>

                        <p>Another queſtion, more important and difficult of ſolution than the former, is, whether or not the whole of the chyle, abſorbed from the cavity of the ſmall inteſtines, be conveyed to the blood through the ſame <hi>public,</hi> and <hi>royal</hi> route, as it is termed, or whether there do not exiſt certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret channels, through which it may glide ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiouſly onward, to mingle its ſtreamlets with the general current of circulating blood?</p>
                        <p>It muſt indeed, be confeſſed, that moſt of the arguments, by which phyſiologiſts have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove a private abſorption and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of chyle through the ſanguiferous veins, do not appear to reſt on a very ſolid foundation: thus the aſſertion of Ruyſch, that on the approach of old age the meſenteric glands become ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and conſtricted, as to be rendered unfit for performing their functions, has been long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and it has, on the other hand, been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily demonſtrated that, different affections of theſe glands, ſuch as ſwellings, &amp;c. very errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly paſs under the common name of <hi>obſtructions,</hi> while, at the ſame time, their veſſels remain in a ſtate ſufficiently pervious to afford a very eaſy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

and tranſition to injections of quick ſilver. That well known phenomenon, from which it is aſcertained, that tepid water, thrown into the inert meſenteric veins of a dead ſubject, tranſudes into the cavity of the inteſtines, appears to contribute but very little towards the ſatisfactory elucidation of any function of the human body while in a living ſtate; much leſs can we repoſe confidence in the evidence derived from that <hi>bicrural</hi> and <hi>two branched</hi> tube of copper, which was invented by Lieberkuhn, for the purpoſe of confirming the ſame opinion. As to the aſſertion, that chyle has been unequivocally detected in the red veins of the meſentery, it appears to me to ſtand in need of farther evidence for its unqueſtionable confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; on the whole, I have never yet been convinced, that thoſe veins convey any thing elſe than blood very highly charged with phlogiſton, deſtined for the ſecretion of bile.</p>

                        <p>This duct is a membranous canal, of a delicate appearance and texture, yet ſufficiently robuſt and ſtrong, more or leſs circuitous in its courſe, and not unfrequently ſubject to very ſtriking diverſities with regard to the direction in which it runs, and the diviſions it occaſionally undergoes: it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of muſcular fibres and nerves, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed here and there with ſmall valves, and, after having paſſed over the <hi>left ſubclavian vein,</hi> is again reflected towards, and finally inſerted into, the <hi>ſame,</hi> and, at the very point of inſertion, has its entrance guarded by a valve of a peculiar ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        <p>The powers which produce and continue the onward motion of the chyle, both in the lacteal veins, and through the thoracic duct, are to be attributed, indeed, principally to the contractility of theſe veſſels themſelves, but, in part alſo, to the valves with which they are furniſhed, to a propulſive <hi>vis a tergo,</hi> and to the uninterrupted pulſation of neighbouring arteries.</p>

                        <p>It appears probable, that the principal deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the valve, which is fixed, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, in the entrance of the chyliferous duct into the ſubclavian vein, is not ſo much to obſtruct the lateral paſſage of blood into this duct, as to regulate the neceſſary diſcharge of chyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vein, and prevent its admiſſion in any other manner than by a ſlow and gradual ſtillicidium.</p>
                        <p>By this means, adequate proviſion is made againſt the ſimultaneous entrance of too large a quantity of recent chyle, into the maſs of blood.

                        <p>Seeing the blood is an animal humour of ſo very ſingular and excluſive a kind, as to be wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar to every other fluid yet diſcovered in any department of nature, it is a propoſition ſufficiently ſelf-evident, that there muſt be a variety of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant powers which contribute, by their joint co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation, to incorporate and aſſimilize with the blood, the heterogeneous and adventitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which it is conſtantly deriving from the thoracic duct.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028310_0429_0FDAB8A22B733EC8"/>

                        <p>With reſpect to ſome particular ſolid parts of the body, ſuch, for example, as the epidermis, the nails, &amp;c. there exiſts indeed not a ſhadow of doubt, but that they are gradually deſtroyed and again repaired; and with regard to the deſtruction or waſte and ſubſequent reparation of the bones themſelves, the teſtimony will appear equally plain and concluſive, to any one who may conſider with attention the reſult of the well known experiments made by feeding warm-blooded animals, for ſome time, on the root of the <hi>rubia tinctorum,</hi> or who may take the further trouble of contemplating attentively the phenomena exhibited by certain large plain bones, eſpecially thoſe of the cranium, which in extreme old age become remarkably attenuated, or diminiſhed in thickneſs, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſcanty nouriſhment with which they are ſupplied at that period of life.</p>

Theſe <hi>tubuli Belliniani</hi> (as they are frequently termed) paſs by a direct route from the cortical, and enter the medullary ſubſtance, of which they conſtitute by far the greater part; and uniting afterwards by reiterated coalitions into a ſmall number of narrow trunks, finally perforate, by their extreme orifices, in a ſieve-like manner, the ſeveral <hi>papillae</hi> contained in the renal pelvis.</p>

                        <p>The papillae correſpond for the moſt part to the number of lobes, of which we already ſaid each kidney is compoſed.

                        <p>The pelvis is continued into the <hi>ureters,</hi> which are membranous canals, exquiſitely ſenſible, and defended internally by a complete inveſtiture or lining of mucus; they are capable of extreme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation; in man they are here and there uneven in the width of their cavities, and are at length inſerted into the poſterior ſurface, not far from the neck of the urinary bladder. This inſertion is effected in ſuch a manner, that the ureters do not immediately perforate the parietes of the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cyſt, but deſcend a ſhort diſtance between its muſcular and nervous coats (which are here poſſeſſed of more than ordinary thickneſs), and open finally into the cavity of this organ by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique orifices.

                        <p>Beſides thoſe public and well known routes of the urine, of which we have already ſpoken, it appears probable from ſeveral phenomena, that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028310_0259_0FDAB538148B9CF0"/>
there exiſt alſo certain ſecret avenues, which lead immediately from the inteſtines to the uropoietic organs. For the ſpeedy diſcharge of certain drinks from the urinary emunctory, ſo frequently imbued with the odour, tinctured with the colour, and characterized by other ſpecific qualities of the aliments recently taken in, will ſcarcely admit the belief, that theſe liquids had performed, in ſo ſhort a time, the cuſtomary long and circuitous route through the thoracic duct and ſanguiferous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: to the foregoing circumſtance we may add an account we have read, of the urine having been found covered with <hi>oil,</hi> that entered into the compoſition of an enema, which had been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and recently thrown into the inteſtinum rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.

Laſtly, it is now unequivocally aſcertained and confirmed by live diſſections, that if both ureters of a dog be tightly encloſed in ligatures, and his <hi>bladder</hi> perfectly evacuated of its contents, this latter organ will, notwithſtanding, in the term of three hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, contain a certain quantity of urine; while at the ſame time the uſual avenues of this fluid, namely, the ureters, are completely obſtructed, as is evident from this circumſtance, that above the

                        <p>But through whatever avenues the urine has been conveyed to the bladder, its gradual accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in that organ excites an uneaſy ſenſation, which becoming urgent and troubleſome (§ 381.) potently ſolicits its final elimination, through an emiſſary or ſewer deſtined for that particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, namely, the <hi>urethra.</hi> This excretory canal is ſubjected to a variety in its conformation, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the diverſity of the ſexes, of which we will ſpeak more amply when treating profeſſedly of the ſexual functions.</p>

the human ſubject after birth, this difference of habit is diſtinctly obſervable; but during the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foetal ſtate, is ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed, unleſs by more cloſe and pointed attention; neither indeed, in this ſtate, can the external organs of generation themſelves be diſcriminated, on a tranſient and ſuperficial view, owing to the extraordinary magnitude and prominency of the female clitoris, and the very diminutive ſize of the male ſcrotum.</p>

                        <p>With reſpect to the ſoft parts of the body, we may obſerve in general, that in females, the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lular membrane is more lax, more pliable, and conſequently more readily dilatable in the ſtate of pregnancy: while the ſkin is more tender, fair and beautiful, in conſequence of the immediate ſubſtratum of fat.</p>

                        <p>A peculiarity of this fluid, which muſt not be paſſed over in ſilence, is, (as was firſt obſerved by Lud.

                        <p>The foregoing opinions receive additional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the many well guarded but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs attempts that have been made by different phyſiologiſts to inject the veſſels of the umbilical cord through thoſe of the uterus, or, on the other hand, to fill the <hi>veſſels</hi> of the latter organ by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections forced through <hi>thoſe</hi> of the former. As a further evidence in ſupport of the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we may mention the difference which is obſerved to exiſt between the pulſe of the mother and that of the foetus before their final diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement from each other; and laſtly, it may not be improper to add, as a circumſtance tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eſtabliſhment of the ſame reſult, the obſervations which we formerly delivered reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between the nature of the foetal and that of the maternal blood (§ 147).</p>
                        <p>But further, it appears probable that a portion of chyle is alſo conveyed to the foetus along with the blood of the mother. For beſides the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

that the blood of the mother is not at all times equally pure and unmixed, but, for ſome hours after every meal, carries along with it, in an unaſſimilated ſtate, that portion of chyle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently received from the thoracic duct, it has been demonſtrated, on a former occaſion, that the uterus itſelf poſſeſſes a ſingular and ſtrong affinity to the chyle and milk (§ 550.553.); and there are alſo on record a great variety of obſervations, from which it appears, that a milky juice has been actually diſcovered in the uterine portion of the placenta.</p>

                        <p>During the progreſſive advancement of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, while the foetus and ſecundines increaſe ſo very remarkably in magnitude, it is obvious that the uterus muſt be alſo ſubjected to ſtriking and remarkable changes.

                        <p>As we uniformly obſerve the uterus beginning to ſwell ſhortly after the time of impregnation, (§ 567.) ſo being from that period increaſed both in bulk and weight, it deſcends a little deeper into the ſuperior part of the vagina; notwithſtanding this deſcent it ſtill retains its former figure in all, except the following, reſpects, viz. its fundus becomes a little more convex, its <hi>anterior paries</hi> or wall, recedes a little farther from the <hi>poſterior,</hi> and its cavity, which was before very narrow and

                        <p>About the end of the firſt month, the ovulum itſelf amounts to the ſize of a pigeon's egg, and has the two deciduae ſeparated from each other, and alſo the ſmall amnion ſituated at a diſtance from the larger chorion: about the termination of the third month it attains the ſize of a gooſe's egg, the caduca re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>About the fourth month after conception, the uterus begins to aſſume more of an oval or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what globe-like appearance; its neck being more and more ſoftened, gradually ſhortened, and as it were, deſtroyed, or rather latterly diſtended, it again protrudes upwards, and begins to aſcend from the ſmaller into the larger pelvis. At the ſame time the fallopian tubes themſelves, with the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028310_0323_0FDAB61AAA827DF8"/>

                        <p>In the middle ſtage of pregnancy, which occurs about the end of the fifth month, the uterus has attained ſuch a magnitude, that its fundus is elevated to a point half-way between the <hi>pubes</hi> and <hi>umbilicus,</hi> and the pregnant ſtate becomes now

                        <p>The orifice referred to in the preceding para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph is called the <hi>foramen ovale,</hi> through which by far the greater part of the aſcending column of blood, derived immediately from the inferior vena cava, is conducted into the left <hi>auris</hi> of the heart during each diaſtole of the auricles: of this blood the regurgitation is effectually prevented, by the elegant falciform valve formerly mentioned, which is cloſely ſpread over the foramen, and appears to cloſe that orifice completely, during each ſyſtolic motion of the auricles. During the firſt years of infancy the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> is in part cloſed by means of this ſmall valve, and partly obliterated by the gradual but ſlow adheſion of its ſides: in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to ſuch adheſion, the valve of Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius itſelf undergoes alſo a ſlow and gradual diminution in point of ſize, till ſcarcely a wreck of it is left behind.</p>

                        <p>Of that blood which, at the ſame time, enters the right auricle of the heart from the ſuperior vena cava, a very ſmall portion only can be received by the lungs of the foetus, as yet in a weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active condition: it is therefore taken up by the <hi>ductus arterioſus,</hi> from the trunk of the pulmonary artery (of which this duct is indeed the leading branch) and conveyed by a direct and ſpeedy route
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028310_0439_0FD88D514BC42D30"/>
to the arch of the aorta, without paſſing through the lungs at all. Within the courſe of a few weeks after the birth of the infant, the cavity of the ductus arterioſus is, for the moſt part obliterated, and its parietes or walls converted into the nature and appearance of a denſe and firm ligament.</p>

                        <p>As the lungs perform in the foetus ſcarcely any function at all, their general <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> differ very materially from thoſe which they aſſume after the infant has commenced the proceſs of reſpiration. Thus, their bulk is proportionably much leſs, their colour more dark, their ſubſtance more compact, and hence their ſpecific gravity ſo much greater, that when immerſed, recent and free from putrefaction, into a veſſel of water, they ſink inſtantly to the bottom; whereas, on the other hand, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>From the obſervations which were formerly propoſed on the nutrition of the foetus (§ 574, 581.), it may be very eaſily perceived that the ſtate and condition of the <hi>alimentary tube</hi> and <hi>chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoletic ſyſtem,</hi> are extremely different before, from what they are after, the birth of the infant, theſe viſcera being in the firſt caſe inert and wholly incapable of action.

                  <head>APPENDIX, IN WHICH IS EXHIBITED A Condenſed and Summary View OF THE EXISTING DISCOVERIES AND SPECULATIONS Relative to the Subject of, what is uſually denominated, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY.</head>
                  <p>STEADY and uniform as the lapſe of time itſelf, are the exertions made by the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and induſtry of man, to ſhed light on the <hi>arcana</hi> or <hi>ſecret proceſſes</hi> of nature. In proportion as ſuch laudable attempts are proſecuted with boldneſs and crowned with ſucceſs, <hi>revolutions</hi> and <hi>improvements</hi> take place in the various branches of phyſical ſcience. Revolutions derive birth from the detection of error, while improvements reſult from the diſcovery of truth. On the repudiation of falſe principles in ſcience, as well as on the developement of new ones deduced from the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028310_0457_0FD89B23EB2DFC50"/>
concurrence of numerous and unequivocal facts, it is not without the ſanction of reaſon and propriety that new ſyſtems are forthwith compiled, digeſted and uſhered into the world.</p>
                  <p>For, to be complete and ſatisfactory, a ſyſtem in any branch of ſcience, ſhould embrace and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range in order all the well authenticated principles ſpontaneouſly reſulting from facts already aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and obſervations already made, relative to that particular branch. A ſyſtem leſs general and comprehenſive in its ſcope than this, ſhould be deemed, at beſt, but defective and partial, and received as the abortive production of a mind deficient in point of information.</p>
                  <p>Of the former deſcription was the famous phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiological ſyſtem of Baron Haller, at the time its illuſtrious author firſt ſubmitted it to the eye of the world. That excellent phyſician and philoſopher graſped in his acute and comprehenſive mind, and detailed at large, in the work to which I here allude, all the authentic and well defined princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples reſulting from the infinitude of facts with which the ſcience of phyſiology was at that time enriched.</p>
                  <p>But all ſyſtems are ſtationary and have been as yet imperfect, while, happily for the intereſt of
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028310_0458_0FD89B252FC4D9F0"/>
man, improvements in ſcience are progreſſive and advancing towards perfection. In the courſe of a few years, ſuch a blaze of phyſical light was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed abroad by the induſtry and ingenuity of philoſophers in general, but of phyſicians and chemiſts in particular, that the deficiencies and errors of the Baron's elaborate ſyſtem were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered obvious to the moſt weak and inattentive obſerver. In the important <hi>doctrines</hi> reſpecting the <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>animal heat</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi> of reſpiration, in particular, entire revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were effected by the numerous and ingenious diſcoveries of chemiſts in that branch of ſcience denominated aerology.</p>
                  <p>To ſupply, as far as poſſible, the deficiencies of this ſyſtem of Haller, and to circumvent the errors which the authority of ſo celebrated a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter might tend to diffuſe throughout the minds of his numerous readers, became <hi>deſiderata</hi> of no ſmall moment in the ſcience of phyſiology.</p>
                  <p>The moſt effectual method of accompliſhing theſe deſirable ends was too obvious to eſcape diſcovery. For as violence is moſt effectually repelled by counter violence, and one diſeaſe not unfrequently removed from the animal ſyſtem by the impetuous invaſion of another, ſo in like manner, in ſcience, the defects of one ſyſtem are moſt advantageouſly
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028310_0459_0FD89B29158DFD78"/>
ſupplied, and its errors moſt effectually contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and expoſed, by the plenitude and unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal certainty of the principles of a rival ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>This truth did not eſcape the obſervation of that learned and acute profeſſor, of Goettingen, who now fills the chair which was formerly rendered vocal by the eloquence of the immortal Haller. Need I add, that profeſſor Blumenbach is the man to whom I allude—a man, for the completion of whoſe greatneſs and utility in phyſical ſcience, nature and art appear to have all but exhauſted their abundant reſources! For induſtry and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the collection of materials, for powers to combine and arrange materials when thus col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and for ingenuity and acumen to deduce and ſpeculate from ſuch combination and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the preſent age certainly boaſts few—too few phyſiologiſts who may be ſet in competition with the illuſtrious Blumenbach.</p>
                  <p>For this phyſician and philoſopher was reſerved the honourable and important taſk of collecting, digeſting and conſigning to publicity, a ſyſtem of phyſiology deſtined to ſupply the deficiencies and correct the errors of that which had already reſulted from the labours of his celebrated friend and predeceſſor. The ſyſtem of profeſſor Blumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach was, like that of Baron Haller, perfect and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028310_0460_0FD89B2CB071F270"/>
complete at the time in which it was handed to the world. There exiſted not, at that period, an eſtabliſhed principle, nor ſcarcely even a probable conjecture in phyſiology, with which he was not minutely acquainted, and which he did not draw into the extenſive and powerful <hi>vortex</hi> of his ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>Had the ſcience of phyſiology been finally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete at the time in which profeſſor Blumenbach wrote, the induſtry, the immenſe reſources and the comprehenſive talents of that philoſopher would, no doubt, have quite precluded the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of future ſyſtems in this branch of ſcience. But in the unfathomed depths of the animal economy more <hi>arcana</hi> yet exiſted—more <hi>terra incognita</hi> lay yet unexplored, and further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of enterpriſe were therefore eſſential.</p>
                  <p>By the combined labours of experimental phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologiſts in different parts of the world, this branch of ſcience was at length matured for giving birth to another <hi>diſcovery,</hi> which will probably be found of equal importance, in explaining the phenomena, and in removing the diſeaſes of the animal ſyſtem, with that which conſigned to immortality the name of the illuſtrious Harvey. The diſcovery to which I wiſh at preſent to direct the attention of the reader is that of, what is uſually called <hi>animal
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028310_0461_0FD885C6177BAC48"/>
electricity,</hi> or, of the exiſtence and operation of a fluid extremely ſimilar to electricity in the living animal ſyſtem. For the fortunate Galvani pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of anatomy at Bologna, was reſerved the honour of lighting <hi>by accident</hi> on this beautiful and divine diſcovery—a diſcovery which entitles its author to be ranked with the great promoters ſcience and the eſſential benefactors of man.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a fluid did actually exiſt in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of animals, had been long ſuſpected by phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiologiſts and other ſpeculative philoſophers. The matter reſted however on pure conjecture alone, and was yet unſanctioned by the teſts of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obſervation. The apparent intricacy of the ſubject depreſſed the hopes of the boldeſt experimenters, and the ſubtlety of the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to throw an inſurmountable bar in the road to ſucceſs. But <hi>accident</hi> not unfrequently does more for the real advancement of ſcience, than boaſted genius and induſtry are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. It was accident that firſt ſuggeſted to the celebrated Gallileo the conſtruction and uſe of that optical inſtrument denominated the <hi>tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope</hi>—It was accident which firſt led the immortal Newton to the original conception of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>gravitation,</hi> by which he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, with ſuch facility, the movements and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite balance of the material univerſe. And it
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028310_0462_0FD89B2F3648E190"/>
was, in like manner, accident—fortunate accident, that firſt ſuggeſted to the induſtrious and acute Galvani the mode of experimenting, with effect, on the intricate ſubject of <hi>animal electricity</hi>—a ſubject which may poſſibly be deſtined as the only proper clue to conduct future phyſiologiſts to the genuine ſprings and principles of life itſelf.</p>
                  <p>"Whilſt the profeſſor (alluding to Galvani) was engaged in diſſecting a frog in a room where ſome of his friends were amuſing themſelves with an electrical machine, one of them drew a ſpark from the conductor, at the ſame time that the profeſſor touched one of the nerves of the animal. In an inſtant the whole body of the frog was ſhook by a violent convulſion. The profeſſor was aſtoniſhed at the phenomenon, and believed it owing to his having wounded the nerve; to aſſure himſelf whether this was really the caſe, he pricked it with the point of his knife, without any motion of the body being produced; he now touched the nerve with the inſtrument as at firſt, and ordered a ſpark to be taken from the machine, on which the contractions were renewed. The experiment was repeated a third time, but the animal remained motionleſs; however, upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he held his ſcalpel by the handle, which was of ivory (a bad conductor), he changed it
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028310_0463_0FD885C8684EF840"/>
for a metallic one, and re-excited the movements, which he conſtantly failed of doing whilſt uſing an electric ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>"After having made a number of experiments with the elect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this end he raiſed a conductor upon the roof of his houſe, from which he brought an iron wire into his room, and to this attached metal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors, connected with the nerves of the animals deſtined to be the ſubjects of his experiments, and to their legs he tied wires, which reached the floor. Conſiderable movements were obſerved in the animals, whether of cold or warm blood, whenever it lightened. Theſe preceded thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and correſponded with its intenſity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, and even when it did not lighten the movements took place when any ſtormy cloud paſſed over the apparatus."</p>
                  <p>"Profeſſor Galvani one day ſuſpended ſome frogs, perhaps with ſimilar views, on metal hooks, fixed in the ſpine of the back, upon the iron rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his garden; ſeveral times he remarked that theſe animals contracted, and appeared to receive ſhocks; at firſt he conceived the movements were owing to changes in the atmoſphere, but a more

ſcrupulous examination undeceived him· Having placed a prepared frog <note n="*" place="bottom">That the reader may not be entirely ignorant of what is meant by a prepared frog, I take the liberty of preſenting him with the following brief extract from the firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment detailed in Dr. Valli's publication: "My firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made on a frog, in the following manner: I opened the abdomen in order to lay bare the ſpine of the back, and diſcover the crural nerves which iſſue from it; a few lines above this point I cut the animal in two, and by paſſing my ſciſſars immediately under the origin of theſe nerves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the remaining portion of the vertebral column, ſo as only to leave the vertebrae which united the bundle of nerves. Having enveloped this portion of the vertebrae with a piece of ſheet lead, with one end of a metal conductor, I touched the coated part, and with the other the ſurface of the thighs, which had been previouſly ſtripped of the ſkin. The movements were violent, and continued for a long time," &amp;c. In general, throughout the whole of this phyſician's expertmental treatiſe, when one or more of the nerves of an animal are coated with ſheet-lead or any other metal, that animal is ſaid to be <hi>prepared.</hi>
                     </note> upon an iron plate in his room, and happening with his diſſecting forceps to preſs it againſt the plate, he obſerved the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take place. This experiment ſucceeded with all metallic bodies, but more particularly well with ſilver; non-conducting ſubſtances were not proper for it. From this period our author began to ſuſpect the animal poſſeſſed an electricity of its own; and in this ſuſpicion he was further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the following circumſtance:—He held
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028310_0465_0FD885CC005E3530"/>
a prepared frog by a hook with one hand, ſo as to let its feet reſt upon the bottom of a ſmall ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cup, which he happened unintentionally to ſtrike with the other; at the inſtant the body of the animal fell into violent convulſions. If one perſon held the prepared frog, and another touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cup, no movements were excited. The profeſſor being now aware of the neceſſity of a communication, undertook a ſeries of experiments for the farther inveſtigation of this ſubject. He firſt placed a prepared frog upon a non-conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurface, and brought one end of a conductor in contact with the hook which ſecured the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and with the other touched its feet, on which the contractions took place. When the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arch was interrupted by a non-conducting ſubſtance, the frog remained motionleſs, &amp;c."</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had profeſſor Galvani publiſhed to the world his experiments on animal electricity, than their ſame diſpread, ſwift us the intangible fluid which they regarded, throughout the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of Europe. Animal electricity became, in a ſhort time, a ſubject of very intereſting ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to medical philoſophers. Among the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral phyſiologiſts who entered the liſts in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, the moſt diſtinguiſhed whoſe writings have fallen into my hands, are Dr. Valli, an Italian phyſician, from whoſe publication the preceding
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028310_0466_0FD89B309F5CCF00"/>
account reſpecting the firſt diſcoveries of Galvani is extracted, and Mr. Fowler, a native of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he iſland of Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Valli appears to have led the van of thoſe philoſophical characters who firſt co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the celebrated Galvani in inveſtigating that animal fluid, the exiſtence of which had been ſo long ſuſpected, but ſo lately realiſed by actual experiment. After repeating moſt of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his predeceſſor in this branch of phyſics, the Doctor proceeded to a ſeries of new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, moſtly conceived and inſtituted by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The objects which he appears to have kept ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in view throughout the whole courſe of his experiments and obſervations were, to aſcertain the <hi>nature</hi> of the animal fluid diſcovered by the profeſſor of Bologna, and to determine its <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>medium</hi> of operation in the animal eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. In the proſecution of theſe ends the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has doubtleſs diſplayed all that induſtry and patient perſeverance, ſo eſſentially requiſite in the character who would ſucceſsfully inquire of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through the medium of experiment. I am ſorry, however, to obſerve, that all his experiments were not conceived and inſtituted with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and perhaps I may add, not executed with equal accuracy and definitude. Many of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028310_0467_0FD89B3470BFD7D8"/>
them appear to have been inſtituted without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reference to any ſpecific or particular end— Equally unhappy with regard to conception, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite with reſpect to their nature, and inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in point of reſult, they leave no <hi>impreſſions</hi> on the mind of the reader, ſave thoſe of <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> and <hi>regret</hi>—regret that a character of ſuch learning and induſtry ſhould, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, interrogate nature with ſo little meaning, and (I am ſorry to add) with ſo little ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The preceding obſervations muſt be conſidered only in the light of <hi>general rules,</hi> and as ſuch, are liable to numerous exceptions. Many of the experiments of Dr. Valli are, doubtleſs, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and valuable; and I even entertain the utmoſt confidence, that the period will yet arrive, when the whole of them, that are aſcertained and related with juſtneſs and definitude, will be made ſubſervient to the eſtabliſhment of general and uſeful reſults. At preſent, however, they ſtand in an <hi>inſulated</hi> ſtate, completely detached from practical concluſions, and diſconnected from all known principles in phyſical ſcience.</p>
                  <p>After a ſeries of experiments ſufficiently lengthy and tedious, the Doctor conceived himſelf une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally authoriſed to conclude, that the animal fluid of Galvani, was entirely the ſame with the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028310_0468_0FD885D1C98D9650"/>
ſubtle matter of electricity. This concluſion he alleges to be the ſpontaneous and neceſſary reſult of the following poſitions, which he delivers as ſubſtantiated and confirmed by actual experiment.</p>
                  <p>"Firſt, ſubſtances which conduct electricity, are conductors likewiſe of the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p n="2">"2<hi>dly,</hi> Subſtances which are not conductors of electricity, do not conduct the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p n="3">"3<hi>dly,</hi> Non-conducting bodies, which acquire by heat the property of conducting electricity, preſerve it likewiſe for the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p n="4">"4<hi>thly,</hi> Cold at a certain degree, renders water a non-conductor of electricity, as well as of the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p n="5">"5<hi>thly,</hi> The velocity of the nervous fluid is, as far as we can calculate, the ſame with that of electricity."</p>
                  <p n="6">"6<hi>thly,</hi> The obſtacles which the nerves, under certain circumſtances, oppoſe to electricity, they preſent likewiſe to the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p n="7">"7<hi>thly,</hi> Attraction is a property of the electric fluid, and this property has been diſcovered in the nervous fluid."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="unknown:028310_0469_0FD89B35B7FD6F60"/>Having enumerated and detailed the foregoing arguments, the Doctor, in an effuſion of triumph, ſubjoins, "We here ſee the greateſt analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe fluids; nay, I may even add, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of their identity."</p>
                  <p>As an additional ſupport to the ſame opinion, Dr Valli adduces the peculiar and ſtriking pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena exhibited by the <hi>torpedo,</hi> the <hi>gymnotus elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricus,</hi> the <hi>ſilurus,</hi> &amp;c. which proceed, as he alleges, from a fluid in every reſpect the ſame with that which was diſcovered in frogs, by the profeſſor of anatomy at Bologna. As the Doctor, however, has advanced nothing in confirmation of ſuch entire ſameneſs, ſave a certain remote analogy which he ſays he has diſcovered between the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of animals, and the <hi>electrical apparatus</hi> of the torpedo, the gymnotus, &amp;c. it is obvious that this latter argument will but very ſlightly impreſs the philoſophical phyſiologiſt, who founds his belief of principles on <hi>facts,</hi> rather than on vague and viſionary <hi>conjectures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus, as he ſuppoſed, ſatisfactorily aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the identity of the <hi>nervous</hi> with the electric fluid, he next proceeds to ſpeculations on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the diverſified movements and functions of the animal economy. To me, however, I muſt confeſs, the greater part of this ſpeculative inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, appears to be rather the efferveſcent
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028310_0470_0FD89B372CCEA460"/>
effuſions of an <hi>imagination,</hi> heated to exceſs in a favourite purſuit, than the ſolemn <hi>deciſions</hi> of a tranquil and unbiaſſed <hi>underſtanding.</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf unable, in many inſtances, to diſcern the neceſſary nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s or affinity between his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and the facts from which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:—or perhaps I may ſpeak my ſentiments more fully when I ſay, that the learned author appears not unfrequently to have ſubſtituted mere <hi>hypothetical allegations,</hi> for fair and logical <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>—the vacant reſults of his own conjectures, for genuine principles developed by experiment, and aſcertained by obſervation. It very often happens, that by attempting to embrace too much under a ſingle cauſe, we extend the tortured principle beyond its natural limits, and thus, to appearance, weaken or render doubtful its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even on thoſe phenomena which it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately regards. This obſervation applies with too much propriety and force, to the ſpeculations of the indefatigable Valli. By attempting to explain <hi>all,</hi> he has in fact explained <hi>none,</hi> of the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of the animal economy, by that ſubtle fluid on which he ſo patiently experimented. Many of his phyſiological facts and ſpeculations are indeed ingenious and intereſting, but, in my view, they are equally deducible from any other ſeries of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as from that by which they are preceded in the Doctor's publication. Many of the learned author's facts may be, no doubt, true and well
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028310_0471_0FD89B38AFAAFCD8"/>
defined, and ſome of his principles and reſults to a certain degree intereſting to the phyſician and philoſopher, but, taken in the aggregate, they are too diſjointed to conſtitute any thing like a ſyſtem, too diſconnected to form a regular chain of inveſtigation. On my mind, his <hi>ſpeculations</hi> on the cauſes of <hi>muſcular motion, ſenſation ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>nutrition,</hi> impreſs no more ſolid convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than do <hi>thoſe</hi> of Stahl on the ſubject of his <hi>anima medica,</hi> of Van Helmont reſpecting his ſubtle <hi>Archeus,</hi> or of the airy Paracelſus with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his <hi>planetary influence.</hi> Notwithſtanding the apparent ſeverity of the foregoing obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am ſtill obliged to declare it as my opinion, that the novelty and importance of the ſubject on which Dr Valli has experimented and written, entitle his work to the particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the learned and ingenious of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>For the want of ſyſtem and requiſite deciſion in the writings of the preceding author, compenſation is, in a great meaſure, made by a ſubſequent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the accurate and ingenious Fowler. The experiments and ſpeculations of this young philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, on what he terms, the "<hi>influence diſcovered by Galvani,</hi>" made their firſt public appearance at Edinburgh, in the courſe of the year 1793: they are not, indeed, ſo numerous as thoſe of the Italian phyſician, but they appear to have been
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028310_0472_0FD89B3A3260ED48"/>
conceived with more deſign, and executed with more judgment. Mr. Fowler ſeems to have been among the firſt who controverted the opinion of Galvani and Valli, reſpecting the identity of the nervous and electric fluids: and he has, doubtleſs, controverted it with ability and effect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fowler prelimina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es his obſervations, with a lucid and forcible ſtatement of a certain previous combination of circumſtances, which he alleges, muſt have ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed the mind of profeſſor Galvani, with a belief of the ſameneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding fluids.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a prepo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſion muſt have had, indeed, a powerful effect on the ſubſequent deductions and concluſions of the Profeſſor, will be readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by every one who has experienced the influence of preconceived opinions—an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence pregnant with error, and leading countleſs evils in its train.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fowler proceeds then to mention the firſt object which engaged his attention, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of his intereſting inquiry, and which appears well calculated to pave the way, for the more eaſy and effectual accompliſhment of his experimental courſe. This, to make uſe of his own words, was, "to aſcertain, as well the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028310_0473_0FD89B3DF44E26E8"/>
circumſtances, eſſentially requiſite to the production of theſe new phenomena, as thoſe in which they can be rendered moſt obvious." The iſſue of his enquiry on this ſubject, I will alſo lay before the reader in his own words. "After" ſays he, "a great variety of experiments, of which it would be unneceſſary here, to relate more than the reſult, I found, that I could not excite in an animal the appearances deſcribed by Galvani, with any ſubſtances whatever, whether ſolid or fluid, except the metals: and that the mutual contact of two different metals with each other, ſo far as I was able to determine, was in every caſe neceſſary to the effect."</p>
                  <p>After a ſatisfactory attainment of this object, the ingenious author next proceeds to a judicious ſeries of experiments, with a view to diſcover the genuine nature of the animal fluid, firſt realiſed by the fortunate profeſſor of Bologna. Of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments he does not give us a minute ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only furniſhes ſtatements of their moſt obvious and ſtriking reſults. Theſe ſtatements he alſo occaſionally interſperſes with intereſting and important remarks, and ſome very ingenious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.</p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed his ſeries of experiments, (a ſeries ſufficiently numerous and diverſified for the
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028310_0474_0FD89B402F1D7E30"/>
ſtabliſhment of general principles) relative to the nature of the nervous fluid, and its affinity to the matter of electricity, Mr. Fowler at length favours us on this ſubject with the following concluſions, which I ſhall take the liberty of preſenting to the reader in the words of their ingenious anther.</p>
                  <p>After having ſtated a few analogies between the animal fluid of Galvani, and that poſſeſſed by the <hi>torpedo,</hi> he then reverſes the compariſon, and lays down ſeveral points of eſſential difference, not only between the two preceding fluids, but alſo between the former of them, namely the fluid of Galvani, and the matter of electricity.</p>
                  <p>"This influence, (ſays he, referring to the nervous fluid of animals) differs, both from that of the torpedo, &amp;c. and from electricity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing no ſenſation (in man at leaſt) at all ſimilar to that of an electrical ſhock."</p>
                  <p>"—That ſome kind of diſagreeable ſenſation is occaſioned by it, even in frogs, independent of that which muſt neceſſarily ariſe from irritation and the contractions of their muſcles, is evident from their reſtleſſneſs and expreſſions of uneaſineſs. In other animals, as I ſhall afterwards have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew, theſe expreſſions are ſtill leſs equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal: and in man we can aſcertain both their
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028310_0475_0FD885D2FA3D2630"/>
degree and their kind. That they differ conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from ſuch as are produced by electricity will be proved when I come to ſpeak of the effects of this influence upon our ſenſes."</p>
                  <p>"But the moſt important, and characteriſtic difference which I have yet been able to diſcover, between this new influence and electricity, conſiſts in their effects upon the contractile power of animals and of plants. The contractions of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals excited by electricity have a tendency to deſtroy that power upon which contractions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. But the contractions excited, by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the metals, have, in all my experiments, had the directly oppoſite effect. The more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contractions have been in this way excited, the longer do they continue excitable: and the longer are the parts upon which ſuch experiments are made, preſerved from putridity. An influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, capable of exciting contractions without occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ioning exhauſtion, was a thing I ſo little expected to find, and ſo contrary to the character which had been given of this both by Galvani and by Doctor Valli, that I at firſt diſtruſted my own obſervation of the fact: but the number of comparative experiments which I had afterwards occaſion to make, though with views different from that of aſcertaining the point in queſtion, convinced me that this influence, ſo far from
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028310_0476_0FD89B41D859DB30"/>
deſtroying the contractility of muſcles, has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to preſerve it. Oxygene is, ſo far as I know, the only ſtimulus in nature, whoſe effects are at all analogous."</p>
                  <p>"When a frog has been long dead, I have been ſometimes more than a quarter of an hour without being able to excite a ſingle contraction by the application of the metals: but after this, without at all varying the means employed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions have appeared, and have become gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more and more vigorous."</p>
                  <p>"It is ſaid (for I have never had an opportunity of making the experiment), that a ſtream of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, paſſed through a ſenſitive plant, produces an almoſt immediate collapſe of its leaves. But the influence diſcovered by Galvani produced no ſuch effect in the following experiment. Having ſeparated the leg of a frog from its body, I freed its crural nerves from ſurrounding parts, and with one hand held it ſupported upon the end of a probe. An aſſiſtant placed a piece of ſilver under its foot, and held the zinc with which it was to be touched. A ſenſative plant formed the medium of communication between us. He held the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of its ſtem between his fingers, while I held the top; ſo that when the ſilver was touched by the zinc, the influence paſſed up the plant, and
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028310_0477_0FD89B46682851B8"/>
through the whole of its ſtem. The frog's leg inſtantly contracted, and repeated its contractions every time the ſilver and zinc were brought in contact: but the leaves of the plant did not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe; neither did they when any of its branches formed part of the circuit."</p>
                  <p>I muſt however, confeſs that the plant, upon which this experiment was made, had been kept through the winter. With a young one the reſult might poſſibly be different; but ſuch an one I have not yet had in my power to procure.</p>
                  <p>"The torpedo does not appear at all affected by the influence which itſelf produces. Animals in which Galvani's phenomena are produced, are ſtrongly affected."</p>
                  <p>The very ingenious author paſſes on next to report the reſult of certain experiments which he inſtituted, in order to refute the opinion of thoſe, who allege, that the fluid of Galvani proceeds entirely from the metallic ſubſtances uſed, and does not reſide at all in any part of the animal ſyſtem. In his enquiry reſpecting this point he diſplays the ſame fertility in deviſing, the ſame ſagacity in judging, and the ſame ingenuity in deducing, which ſo forcibly impreſs the reader throughout every part of his experimental inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028310_0478_0FD89B4AB01AD5A8"/>
He alſo farther ſhows, that the nervous influence of Galvani, and the ſubtle fluid of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity differ very materially from each other in the following particular, namely, that againſt the effects of the former, animals are able to guard themſelves by means of a certain voluntary e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas the operation of the latter is not in the ſmalleſt degree ſubject to the controul or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the will.</p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed the conſideration of the <hi>nature,</hi> Mr. Fowler proceeds to make ſome uſeful <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> of the influence diſcovered by the profeſſor of anatomy at Bologna. In his attempts to ſhed light on certain controverted points, and to ſolve certain abſtruſe queſtions, in phyſiology, by means of this fluid, he appears no leſs ingenious and ſatisfactory than in the former parts of his enquiry.</p>
                  <p>He appears peculiarly happy and concluſive in his reſearches after the <hi>ſource</hi> from whence the nerves and muſcles derive their reſpective powers. I beg leave to lay before the reader two of the author's experiments, inſtituted for the purpoſe of aſcertaining this intereſting particular—a particular which has ſo long furniſhed a ſubject of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy among ſpeculative phyſiologiſts. The latter of the two experiments, (to which the former
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028310_0479_0FD885D82933E5B8"/>
ſerves only as a neceſſary introduction) is of itſelf more than equal to all that has ever been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>EXPERIMENT I.</p>
                  <p>"I divided (ſays Mr. Fowler) the ſciatic nerve of one leg, and tied the crural artery of the other in a large frog. Scarcely any blood was loſt in doing either. Two days aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this I ſtrangled it. During the firſt 24 hours, the leg in which the nerve had been divided, appeared to contract with the moſt vigour; after this period the difference between them became more doubtful; but the contractions were at no time ſtronger in the leg whoſe artery was tied, than in that whoſe nerve was divided.</p>
                  <p>EXPERIMENT II.</p>
                  <p>"The ſame operations were performed upon a large female frog full of ſpawn. Four hours afterwards ſhe was covered by a male, who had been treated in a ſimilar manner. I mention this circumſtance, as it tends to prove, that the pain occaſioned by the operation was probably not ſo great as to produce much fallacy.</p>
                  <p>"On the day following, ſhe had ſpawned, and on the ſixth day from the operations, ſhe was ſtrangled. When laid upon a plate of zinc, and

excited by means of a rod of ſilver, the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were found extremely feeble in the leg whoſe artery had been tied, and ceaſed altogether in about twenty-two hours after her death.</p>
                  <p>In the leg, whoſe nerve had been divided, they appeared as vigorous as they uſually are in legs to which no injury has been previouſly done, and continued excitable upwards of two days after they had ceaſed to be ſo in the other."</p>
                  <p>It may be proper on the preſent occaſion briefly to obſerve, that the influence diſcovered by Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vani was the teſt uſed by Mr. Fowler to determine the exiſtence or ceſſation of irritability in the muſcles of the animals ſubjected to the preceding experiment. For this influence, as our author judiciouſly obſerves, appears to be indeed by far the beſt and moſt delicate teſt that has ever yet been diſcovered for aſcertaining the loweſt poſſible degrees of muſcular irritability. After having become wholly inſenſible to the impreſſions of all other ſtimuli, muſcles ſtill continue to vibrate to the kindred touches of this ſubtle fluid, to which nature appears to have given them ſuch a nice, and, perhaps I may ſay, ſpecific correſpondence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fowler, after having tranſiently glanced on the ſubject of inflammation, paſſes on to the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028310_0481_0FD89B53723B96B0"/>
attack of a phyſiological doctrine, propagated with zeal, and ſupported with ability by that celebrated experimentaliſt, the Abbe Fontana. The doctrine alluded to, embraces the exiſtence or reſidence of a certain vital principle in the volume of the blood. On this principle, as the induſtrious Abbe alleges, poiſons produce their inſtantaneous effect, when introduced into the vaſcular ſyſtems of living animals. To all the different parts of this phyſical <hi>doctrine</hi> I could never yet be induced to ſubſcribe, notwithſtanding the reſpectability of its learned and numerous advocates.</p>
                  <p>By attacking and vanquiſhing one of its moſt powerful champions, Mr. Fowler has doubtleſs contributed much to its final demolition. For, in the conteſt now under our immediate conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I muſt confeſs, that to me the laurels of victory appear to be fairly wreſted from the ſilvered temples of the <hi>Italian,</hi> and planted over the youthful brow of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>I have thus exhibited a view, ſomewhat general indeed, though confeſſedly very ſuccinct, of the reſults laid down, and of the opinions entertained, by the ingenious Fowler, on the ſubject of the animal influence diſcovered by Profeſſor Galvani. To lay before the reader a full account of all that is uſeful and important in the obſervations of this
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028310_0482_0FD89B548869A020"/>
intereſting author, would be to tranſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print his whole publication.</p>
                  <p>The only productions in the Engliſh language, which this country now furniſhes, profeſſedly on the ſubject of the animal fluid diſcovered by Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vani, are (as formerly obſerved) thoſe of Fowler and Valli. On the comparative merit of thoſe two authors I will here take the liberty of advancing a few general, and, I flatter myſelf, impartial, obſervations:</p>
                  <p>The experiments of Doctor Valli are more numerous and pompous—thoſe of Mr. Fowler more definite and intelligible. The former author appears <hi>often,</hi> the latter, <hi>never,</hi> to have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented without ſome determinate end in view. The experiments of the Italian may be compared to the promiſcuous plants of the foreſt, ſtrewn at random by the ſportive and irregular hand of nature—thoſe of the young Briton, to choice and valuable collections, arranged with order and elegance, in a well regulated and beautiful garden. The experiments of Valli appear to throw into <hi>ſhade,</hi> thoſe of Fowler into <hi>light,</hi> the objects which they immediately regard. From the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the reader collects information with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, from the latter, without labour or painful attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="unknown:028310_0483_0FD89B5CB8A01418"/>In their deductions and ſpeculations, the two preceding authors are no leſs diſſimilar, than with regard to their experiments themſelves. Valli is more diffuſe and often hypothetical—Fowler more pointed and generally concluſive. Valii appears to give looſened reins to a glowing imagination— Fowler to be conſtantly under the ſteady guidance of a powerful and well-cultivated underſtanding. The former makes a greater diſplay of learning, and, therefore, too frequently views objects through the more obſcure <hi>media</hi> of previous publications—the latter exhibits a higher degree of ingenuity, and derives the principal part of his information, not from pages, ſanctioned only by the names of celebrated, yet fallible, authors, but from the great <hi>folio</hi>-volume of <hi>nature,</hi> impreſſed with her own ſignature. On the whole, Valli has experimented and written in the moſt lengthy and profuſe—Fowler in the moſt definite and concluſive manner. In many parts of the writings of the former, nothing elſe than the <hi>fiat</hi> of an almighty genius would be able to bring <hi>order</hi> out of <hi>confuſion</hi>—in thoſe of the latter, lucidity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and regularity, ſhine pre-eminent through almoſt every page.</p>
                  <p>Having thus, without reſerve, delivered my ſentiments on the <hi>publications of others,</hi> I hope I may be allowed to treſpaſs on the reader's attention
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028310_0484_0FD885DAAD1E1838"/>
while I make a few obſervations relating to <hi>my own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing could have induced me thus haſtily to forſake the humble, but ſecure, retreats of obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and riſk myſelf before the eye of the world in the hazardous character of an author, ſave a ſolicitous wiſh to contribute to the advancement of medical ſcience, and thus aid in acquiring for man a more effectual exemption from miſery and pain. I ſaw with regret the literary treaſures of a Blumenbach concealed from the view of my fellow-citizens beneath the drapery of an ancient and an obſolete language. I was anxiouſly deſirous to ſee the phyſiological ſyſtem of that illuſtrious character completely clothed in the language of my country. I engaged in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this work, not becauſe I conceived my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better qualified for its execution than others, but becauſe others appeared to me unpardonably remiſs with regard to the undertaking. The execution proved laborious and difficult beyond my expectations. The difficulty of detecting an author's preciſe meaning through the duſky medium of a Latin expreſſion, can be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and realiſed only by him who has made the arduous experiment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="unknown:028310_0485_0FD885E5A70D67F0"/>Even after the ideas and opinions in the original are fully embraced and completely comprehended, another difficulty of no ſmall magnitude ſtill remains, namely, to convey them to the reader with unequivocal definitude, through the indefinite medium of a different language. It is well known how extremely liable we are to miſapprehend the preciſe meaning of an author who even writes in our own vernacular tongue, much more ſo of one who publiſhes in a language but little uſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and, at beſt, but imperfectly underſtood by any man living.</p>
                  <p>Should the foregoing tranſlation ever fall into the hands of the celebrated profeſſor of Geottingen, I hope he will receive, with candour and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, a well meant attempt to extend the empire of his utility and his fame, by increaſing the number of his admiring readers. If the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be in any part erroneous, in any part defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſtrictures and corrections will be thankfully received, and punctually attended to in a ſecond edition of the work, ſhould a ſecond be demanded by a patroniſing public.</p>
                  <p>To preſerve as far as poſſible the firm and energetic ſpirit which characterizes the writings of the illuſtrious profeſſor of Goettingen, and to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028310_0486_0FD89B622FC508D0"/>
convey to my readers the facts, the principles, the ſpeculations, and the opinions contained in his original work, without even the ſhadow of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diminution, or addition, has been my ſteady and uniform aim throughout the whole of the foregoing tranſlation. Owing, however, to the different <hi>conſtitutions</hi> or <hi>idioms,</hi> as they are more generally termed, of the Latin and Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, my tranſlation is in many places far—very far from being ſtrictly literal. <hi>Phraſeology</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, at beſt, as the mere trappings or drapery of <hi>compoſition,</hi> while <hi>facts</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> conſtitute its more ſubſtantial and important part. To preſerve the latter, therefore, inviolate, and to communicate them with the utmoſt definitude, is the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty of a tranſlator, from a principle of juſtice to the original author, to the public, and to himſelf; but in my opinion, he is not bound, by any principle whatever, to make an entire ſacrifice of all <hi>elegance</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> to mere puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>literality</hi> of expreſſion. Impreſſed with the propriety and truth of theſe ſentiments, I have, throughout the whole of the foregoing work, been ſometimes <hi>literal</hi> and ſometimes <hi>free,</hi> accordingly as the one or the other mode of tranſlation gave birth to a phraſeology or ſtile moſt agreeable to my ear, and moſt accordant to the ſpirit of the original compoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="unknown:028310_0487_0FD89B6674222160"/>With reſpect to the appendix itſelf, it may not be amiſs to make it the ſubject of a few tranſient obſervations. The <hi>principle</hi> which theſe additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal pages regard, and are intended to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, is juſtly becoming, among medical philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, an object of primary importance. This principle opens to the view of the ſpeculative mind a rich and ſpacious field, never yet printed, ſave by the adventurous ſteps of a few pre-eminently active and enterpriſing phyſiologiſts—A field, the ſalutary fruits of which will, no doubt, at a future day, ſerve to elucidate the nature, to develope the compoſition, and to alleviate the complicated miſery of man.</p>
                  <p>My whole deſign in this appendix is to give a condenſed, but ſomewhat general view, of this principle or influence diſcovered by profeſſor Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vani.</p>
                  <p>By far the greater number of medical charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the immenſe tract of country embraced within the limits of the <hi>United States,</hi> are, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their diſtances from literary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, excluded from acceſs to public libraries, and ſituated quite beyond the free circulation of phyſical ſcience. To ſuch my appendix will ſerve the humble purpoſe of a <hi>literary chronicle;</hi> it will convey to them a brief account of the diſcoveries
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028310_0488_0FD89B67EC4FDB58"/>
which are now going forward in the delightful and important ſcience of phyſiology.</p>
                  <p>On the ſubject of the influence diſcovered by Galvani I have myſelf inſtituted and performed a conſiderable number of experiments <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>That the reader may be acquainted with an eaſy, cheap and familiar method of experimenting on this ſubject, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having his feelings hurt by the agonizing pangs of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and dying animals, I will here take the liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, in form of notes, a few extracts taken from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication tranſmitted to Mr. Fowler, by his learned friend Mr. Robiſon, profeſſor of natural philoſophy in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Edinburgh.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. "I find (ſays the profeſſor) that if a piece of zinc be applied to the tongue, and be in contact with a piece of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which touches any part of the lining of the mouth, noſtrils, ears, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rethra, or anus, the ſenſation reſembling taſte is felt on the tongue. If the experiment be inverted, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſilver to the tongue, the irritation produced by the zinc is not ſenſible, except in the mouth and the urethra, and is very flight.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. "If the zinc (finely poliſhed) be applied to the ball of the eye, the brightneſs of the flaſh ſeems to correſpond with the ſurface of contact of the ſilver with the tongue, palate, fauces, or cheek. The ſame thing happens when the ſilver is applied to the eye."</p>
                        <p n="3">III. "When a rod of zinc and one of ſilver are applied to the roof of the mouth, as far back as poſſible, the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions produced by bringing their outer ends into contact, are very ſtrong, and that by the zinc reſembles taſte, in the ſame manner as when applied to the tongue."</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. "I had been paring my toe nails with ſciſſars, and had cut off a conſiderable portion of the thick ſkin, ſo that the blood began to <hi>ooze</hi> through in the middle of the wound. I applied the zinc there, and an extenſive ſurface of ſilver to the tongue. Every time I brought the metals into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, I felt a ſmart irritation by the zinc at the wound," &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>A variety of other experiments of a ſimilar nature are contained in the ſame communication from Mr. Robiſon to Mr. Fowler; but a further detail of them I conceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as the ingenious reader, being acquainted with the foregoing, can with facility deviſe other experiments for himſelf. Thus I have frequently conveyed to my eye the luminous flaſh mentioned by Mr. Robiſon, not only from the internal veſtments of the mouth, the noſe, the ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, &amp;c. but alſo from between my fingers, from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bital flexure of my arm, and from various other parts of my body, where the texture of the cuticle and ſkin is more fine and ſoft than ordinary; always taking care, however, to moiſten the part previouſly to the application of the metals.</p>
                     </note>; ſome of
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028310_0489_0FD885DEE81DC298"/>
my reſults have appeared ſtriking and new, but my experiments have been neither ſufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nor varied to warrant the deduction and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of general principles. My preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is (ſhould heaven indulge me in life and health), to proſecute to ſome extent this highly
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:028310_0490_0FD89B6E70A0A390"/>
intereſting ſubject. Should my inveſtigation be favoured with the diſcovery of any thing curious in ſcience, or uſeful in practice, a detail of it may be expected in a future communication.</p>
                  <p>To my ſolemn audit before the bar of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, I now haſten in tremulous anxiety, "with all my imperfections on my head,"—imperfections which will no doubt awaken the cenſure of the critic, but receive, I flatter myſelf, the indulgence of the liberal and candid. The approbation of the former I neither court nor regard; that of the latter it ſhall be my conſtant ambition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The profeſſed buſineſs of moſt modern critics appears to be, to condemn—promiſcuouſly condemn, too frequently without the fainteſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of either inclination or talents to diſcriminate merit from its reverſe.</p>
                  <p>In my view the <hi>approbation</hi> of a profeſſed critic is perfectly ſynonymous with the <hi>cenſure</hi> of the liberal and the ingenious, to whoſe candid exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the preceding pages are ſubmitted with all that reſpect and deference due from an inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced writer.</p>
