            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AMERICAN FARMER's GUIDE.</head>
            <p>THE ſucceſs of Farming depends principally on the collecting manure—on a proper change of crops, and on good tillage or plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground properly to keep it clean; on the choice and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtock, and on the care of the orchard and its produce. On theſe ſeveral articles I ſhall make ſome notes, which are chiefly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from Mr. Young's Farmer's tour through England, publiſhed in 1771.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:031718_0003_0FEE1A4ADE4DFAF8"/>
               <head>Means for collecting manure, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a farm-yard.</head>
               <p>Let the farm-yard be made tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly large, around it let there be ſheds or ſhelter for cattle. The yard ſhould be level, or rather hollow in the middle, that the ooze may not run off. Into this yard throw all your ſtraw, which is not uſed for bedding. But as this will not be ſufficient, it will be well to mow ſtubble, which is cut high, and cart it in the yard. All the rubbiſh and weeds in the lanes, &amp;c. which ſhould be cut while green before they go to ſeed, ſhould likewiſe be carted in. But above all, rake together the leaves in the woods, which may be loaded into carts with large baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and carry them into the yard. Theſe being ſpread over the yard, will by the cattle's treading on them, and receiving their dung and urine all winter, be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as rich a manure as any in the world.</p>
               <p>When cattle are houſed, they ſhould be bedded every night with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031718_0004_0FEE1A4E3A2BAD88"/>ſtraw or leaves up to their bellies. This contributes to their health and encreaſes the dung. Let their ſtall be cleanſed out once a week, The heat of their bodies lying on the litter for that time will begin to promote a fermentation, by which it will be reduced to a good manure. By this mean, for every horſe or cow kept in a ſtable during the winter, you may make at leaſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen large loads of dung. This dung ſhould, in the ſpring, be carted out to a ſtercorary, which ſhould be prepared in the following manner: Firſt, ſpread a layer of earth (the cleanſing of ditches or earth ſcraped from the ſurface of the ground will anſwer for this) then throw on a thick layer of dung, and then a layer of earth, and ſo alternately a layer of dung and a layer of earth, but ſo that the quantity of earth ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one half the quantity of dung. By this mean you will have 23 or 24 loads of good manure for every beaſt, and this laid on in the fall will be a good dreſſing for an acre of land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031718_0005_0FEE1A519CBF6BB8"/>
In making the ſtercorary, the carts ſhould not drive on the heap, as this would preſs it too much and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fermentation, which is neceſſary to render it good compoſt. The loads may be ſhot down by the heap and thrown on with ſhovels, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Great care ſhould be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the urine and ooze from the yard and ſtercorary. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome careful farmers ſink wells, the bottom and ſides of which are well clayed. To theſe the ooze is conducted, and when they are full, ſome pump it up and throw it back upon the heap; others cart it out and ſprinkle it over the graſs. This laſt is ſaid to be an excellent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>There is another practice which turns to great account, as well for increaſing the quantity of manure as for feeding horſes and cattle in the cheapeſt manner; let a field of red clover be ſowed near the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; in the ſecond year after it is ſown it will be fit for cutting in the ſecond week in May. Let the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031718_0006_0FEE1A5549BC4388"/>and cattle be then kept in the yard, and clover cut and given to them in the ſtable or in racks. It has been found by experience that 7 acres of clover will feed 20 hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 7 cows, 5 calves, and as many pigs, for 17 weeks. Suppoſe the rate of keeping to be as follows:

                  </note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the quantity of dung is immenſe where there is litter at command; and this is always the caſe where leaves can be gathered
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031718_0007_0FEE1A58E10381F0"/>from the woods; for cattle fed on green food make much more urine in the ſummer. It has been eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that four or five hundred loads of good dung may be made in the time mentioned from the above horſes and cattle. This, mixed with earth as before directed, will produce upwards of 600 loads of manure, which would be a pretty good dreſſing for thirty acres of land.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved that a careful farmer ſuffers nothing to go to waſte; and therefore all the urine and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals from the houſe, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure from the neceſſary are carried and thrown on the ſtercorary or farm-yard.</p>
               <p>In preparing a place for the ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corery, it may not be amiſs firſt to dig out the earth about two or three feet deep. In that caſe the bottom ſhould be well rammed and clayed, to prevent the ooze from ſinking into the earth. The earth that is dug out, if of a loomy quality or ſandy mixed with loom, will ſerve to mix with the dung; ſo that the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031718_0008_0FEE1A5A6BA5A908"/>labour of digging the pit will not be loſt.</p>
               <p>In order to mix the earth and dung well together, the ſtercorary ſhould be turned at leaſt once in the ſummer. For this purpoſe a ſmall ſpace ſhould be left at one end, then beginning at that end throw an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſpace of the compoſt from top to bottom into that empty ſpace, and ſo proceed till the whole is well turned and mixed. The ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corary ſhould be kept moiſt, but not too wet; for though a moderate degree of moiſture promotes fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and putrefaction, too great a degree will prevent them. As our ſummer ſun is very warm, and exhales too much of the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, it will be well to cover the ſtercorary with hurdles or leavy branches, or a thatched cover may be made over it.</p>

               <head>2 <hi>The change and courſe of crops.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It is a common opinion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this country, that land ſhould yield a crop only once in three
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031718_0009_0FEE1A61B2700878"/>years: this ſurely is bad farming, and what nothing but the great quantity of land could warrant. In England and throughout Europe, and indeed in all old ſettled coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where land is ſcarce and rents high, it is abſolutely neceſſary that a crop of ſome ſort be raiſed from the ground every year. And expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has evinced that land will bear this, and that the goodneſs of the crop depends upon culture and manure, and a proper change of ſeeds. For though good lands are of great importance, yet the ſkill and induſtry of the farmer, will, in a great degree, compenſate for the want of goodneſs in the ſoil in its natural ſtate; and it is found that by proper management, lands which are naturally poor have been bro't to yield crops nearly as great as rich lands, and much greater than rich lands ill managed. The man therefore to whoſe lot it has fallen to poſſeſs lands naturally poor ſhould not be diſcouraged, but rather ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated to exert his abilities and ſhew his ſkill in meliorating nature.</p>

A ſucceſſion of the ſame fort of crops will ſpeedily exhauſt the beſt land. For this reaſon the ſkilful farmer changes his crops almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year. The ſucceſſion moſt approved, and which is practiſed to great advantage in Norfolk, one of the beſt farming counties in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is;
<list>
                     <item>1 Turnips,</item>
                     <item>2 Barley with clover ſeed,</item>
                     <item>3 Clover,</item>
                     <item>4 Wheat;</item>
                  </list> Then turnips, &amp;c. in ſucceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Some have had the third and fourth year clover, and the fifth wheat.</p>
               <p>Another courſe, which they find extremely beneficial, is,
<list>
                     <item>1 Turnips,</item>

They plough it again in the ſpring, having firſt laid on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; then they plough and harrow it again in May, and give it the laſt ploughing and harrowing in June, when the ſeed is ſown.</p>
               <p>Some put on their manure juſt before the laſt ploughing. With reſpect to this experience will be the beſt director. The turnips ſhould be ſown in rows, or the ſeed drilled with a drill plough. The turnips, while growing, ſhould be hoed twice, or ploughed between the rows, as it is common for pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, and kept clear of weeds.</p>
               <p>The crop is fed off with cattle and ſheep. Some feed them off as they grow, confining the cattle and ſheep by hurdles to an acre, and when that is eaten up, removing the hurdles, and taking in another acre till the whole is fed off. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers purſue the following method: they firſt feed one piece, ſuppoſe an acre, by running a row of hurdles acroſs the field; then, before they move the hurdles, they draw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031718_0012_0FEE1A6BD36587C8"/>acre, and cart them for the cattle to the acre eating off, and ſo on through the field, always cart the crop from the land where it grows to the part laſt cleared. If the produce is large, and cattle turned in, they ſpoil as much as they eat, but when turnips are laid clear above the ſoil, and the earth partly ſhaken off, they eat them up clean.</p>

               <head>Clover.</head>
               <p>After the barley is ſown and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, they then ſow the clover ſeed, eight or ten pounds of ſeed to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031718_0014_0FEE1A6EE584EB60"/>the acre, and then roll the ground with a large wooden roller, which preſſes in the ſeed and breaks the clods. In this country ſome defer ſowing the clover till the barley is off. The land is then ploughed and well harrowed, and ſown with clover ſeed, eight or ten pounds to the acre, and then rolled. Some recommend the ſowing buckwheat before the laſt harrowing, and then to ſow and roll in the clover ſeed. The buckwheat, they obſerve, ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the young clover from the ſun, and keeps down weeds and other graſs.

               <p>The year following they mow the firſt crop of clover, and feed the ſecond. The crop of hay is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally two tons to an acre, ſometimes three.

               <head>Hay-making.</head>
               <p>In anſwer to ſome enquiries I made of Col. G. M. reſpecting his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of making hay, I received the following letter: "I make a point of mowing only when the weather promiſes, with a degree of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it will be fair, afternoon guſts excepted, which, in our climate, cannot be guarded againſt only by my proceſs. I then ſet my mowers at work as ſoon as I can get them at it. They continue to cut until ten o'clock. At nine o'clock I turn my horſes and cattle out of the ploughs, and after the ploughmen have taken their breakfaſt, I ſet them and the mowers to raking my graſs from the ſwarth into winrows, beginning at the graſs laſt cut, and proceeding on until they have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into winrows all the ſwarths which were cut the preceding part of the day. Theſe winrows are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031718_0017_0FEE1A7AC7B56768"/>then made into what we call graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks. This being done, the mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers proceed in cutting, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers follow and gather and cock af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them as faſt as they cut until night. When I do not chooſe to take my ploughmen off, and have not other hands, my mowers cut till 11 o'clock, by which time each has cut an acre or more. The mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then proceed to rake and cock, beginning with the graſs laſt cut, and finiſhing with that firſt mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the morning. If I ſee clouds ariſe in the afternoon, I diſpatch hands ſufficient to aſſiſt and get all into cock before the rain comes on. When it continues fair all day, a mower can cut about as much graſs by eleven or twelve o'clock, as he can conveniently rake and cock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſun-ſet. Thus my mowing and making my hay coſts me about 5<abbr>ſ.</abbr> or 5.<abbr>ſ</abbr> 6. per. acre; for that is the price I give per day to a good workman, who finds himſelf in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals and liquor, and who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cut leſs than an acre by eleven o'clock, provided he is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it the ſucceeding part of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031718_0018_0FEE1A7C50F297B0"/>day. I ſay the mowing, making, and cocking coſt me 5<abbr>ſ.</abbr> or 5<abbr>ſ.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> per acre, becauſe I never open theſe cocks till I houſe or ſtack my hay; for if even repeated and continual rains ſhould fall, while it is in cock, the water never penetrates farther than the ſun or wind will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately dry. This mode of making hay preſerves it (all except the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſide of each blade expoſed to the ſun) of a green colour, and prevents the evaporation of the rich juices of the graſs, which are preſerved in the higheſt perfection. I have practiſed this method ſix ſucceſſive ſeaſons with my common meadow graſs, and having fallen into the very beneficial practice of ſowing twenty acres of clover every year, I have cured all my clover hay in this method; and you may depend upon it to be the beſt as well as the cheapeſt. All the caution neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be uſed in this manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hay is, that the graſs be dry when firſt put into cock; by this I mean dry from dew or rain. In the uſual manner of making clover into hay, the leaves become of a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031718_0019_0FED37DE3B8AFF08"/>dark tobacco colour, and part from the ſtalks on the very ſlighteſt touch, ſo that you houſe very few of them. But by this method the whole are preſerved of an olive green, and the ſtalks are ſoft and pliable and contain great nutriment. In regard to the time your hay muſt continue out in cocks before it be houſed, that muſt depend on the weather, and your judgment of its ſtate. Having no fear of its being injured by continuing too long in the field, I leave mine out from one to three weeks, never hurrying my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from other neceſſary work at this buſy ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Some put up their clover when it ſeems to be but half cured, but to preſerve it from heating in the mow they uſe this precaution: they have a quantity of ſtraw ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; they then firſt lay down a layer of ſtraw, and a layer of hay upon that, and ſo alternately: Some uſe a farther precaution: When they put up their hay in barracks, they leave a ſpace at the bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ground and the hay:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031718_0020_0FEE1A86B9D75B98"/>they have then bags filled with hay, one or more, as they judge neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to the largeneſs of the barrack and the ſtate of the graſs. Theſe bags they ſet up an end on the floor, and then throw in the hay and ſtraw alternately as above, treading them down and drawing up the bags as the rick ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and thus vent holes are made for the air to paſs through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the hay from bottom to top, which cools it and prevents it from heating. By theſe means the dry ſtraw ſoaks up the ſuperfluous moiſture of the hay, and becomes ſo impregnated with the juices of the clover, that the whole is eaten up clean by both horſes and cattle. This practice of intermixing ſtraw with clover is recommended on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account: The mixture of ſtraw prevents the bad effects of clover, which, when eaten by itſelf is apt to hove cattle. And it is worthy of obſervation, that when cattle are fed in a yard, if there are racks of ſtraw therein, as well as clover, the cattle will of their own
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031718_0021_0FEE1A8846A0E258"/>accord go from the clover to the ſtraw, and then to the clover, and ſo backwards and forwards alternately. And hence it appears to be proper, if ſtraw be not mixed with clover in the rick, that a portion of it ſhould be given to the cattle along with the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>If the ſecond crop of clover is ploughed in, it will anſwer as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure for wheat; but if the ſecond crop is cut, then it will be proper to lay on a coat of compoſt from the ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corary, from ten to twenty large loads to an acre, as you have it to ſpare. Plough it in, and ſow the wheat. Some harrow the ground, ſow the wheat, and plough it in; others ſow, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the ſeed; and in harrowing, ſome croſs harrow, and divide the field into ridges by a furrow drawn with a plough; others harrow with the furrows, which throws the ſeed into rows and makes the field appear as if it was ſown with a drill plough; others plough and harrow the ground, and then drill in the ſeed with what is called the drill harrow, which drops the ſeed, and at the ſame time covers
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031718_0022_0FEE1A89CEFF14B0"/>it, and is made with ſuch a number of drills, that with it one man can ſow five or ſix acres a day or more. This laſt I take to be the beſt method; but experience will direct in this as well as the quantity of ſeed to be ſown; for which purpoſe, it will be well to try different methods in the ſame field, and note the difference.</p>
               <p>After the wheat is reaped, it is a common practice with the Norfolk farmers to harrow the ſtubble and cart it home to the farm yard. If the wheat be cradled there will be leſs ſtubble left on the field; but ſtill it will be worth while to harrow and cart home what can be collected. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this they proceed in the culture of the land for turnips next year, and in the ſucceſſion of crops, as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, without ever ſuffering the land to lie idle.</p>

               <head>Indian Corn.</head>
               <p>As the culture of turnips is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, at leaſt to ſuch a degree in this country as in England, I am inclined to think Indian corn may be ſubſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031718_0023_0FEE1A8B57E91800"/>to good advantage in place of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips; and as we have not yet found marle for manuring our lands, though I have no doubt there is plenty of it if ſought for, but till it be found, lime, where it can be got conveniently, may be uſed inſtead of marle. In this cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I would recommend the plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the field in the fall. Then lay on about forty buſhels of unſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lime freſh from the kiln to every acre. Various methods are uſed in laying on the lime: ſome put it in heaps, and when it is ſlacked, they mix it with earth, and cart out the mixture and ſpread it over the land. Some ſhoot down a load of forty buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els on each acre, there let it ſlack, mix it when ſlacked with ſome earth, and carry it out and ſpread it over the ground. Others divide the load into ſmall heaps on the ground, and as ſoon as it ſlacks, ſpread it with a ſhovel without any mixture of earth, taking care to ſcrape up the ground under the heap. They then harrow the ground to mix and cover the lime: which of theſe methods is beſt I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, not having had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031718_0024_0FEE1A9445B2C938"/>Different experiments may be made, which is the only mode of acquiring knowledge in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the ſpring, plough and harrow the ground, and when it is time to plant, furrow out the ground, croſſing it at right angels with deep furrows for planting: the furrows ſhould be ſtrait and equidiſtant. The breadth of the intervals between the furrows or rows, will depend upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoil. When the ground is furrowed out, drop two or three grains at every interſection of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and cover them with a hoe. If a ſhovel full of good dung is mixed with earth and put into each interſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the corn is planted, the goodneſs of the crop would largely pay the expence. Then plough and harrow it as uſual till the corn begins to taſſel, always keeping the ground looſe, and clear from weeds and graſs. But after it taſſels, and the ſilk begins to appear, it ſhould be left to itſelf. Meddling with it at that time is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And if it has had a good fall and ſpring ploughing, been limed and well tended till that time, the weeds after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031718_0025_0FEE1A95CF37DFC0"/>will not come to any great height, at leaſt not to injure the crop. When the corn is ripe, plough the ground down from the rows into the furrows or middle, leaving the corn ſtanding to dry, the blades of the ſtalks being ſtripped off, and the tops cut and carried home. After the corn is pulled, the ſtalks may be cut down and the ridge ploughed up. And thus the ground may be left the enſuing winter either for barley or clover ſeed, or for potatoes, which is a crop that deſerves the attention of the farmer, either for the market or for feeding.</p>
               <p>There is another method of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ground for planting Indian corn, which I am inclined to prefer to that juſt mentioned. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that corn does not ſtrike a deep root, but draws its nutriment from the upper coat of earth. For this cauſe it is common to make hills with hoes round the root of the ſtalks, but as this requires much labour, I would recommend the ploughing the land in the ſpring, into ridges of the width of the intended intervals between the rows, making the firſt furrow pretty
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031718_0026_0FEE1A97584151F0"/>deep; then croſs the ridges with a deep ſurrow, and at the interſection of the ridge and croſs furrows, plant the ſeed, and as the corn ſprings up, plow down the ridges into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and harrow the ground to keep it clear of weeds. By this method the corn will have plenty of rich looſe mould for ſupplying it with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without much trouble of hoeing.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Potatoes.</head>
               <p>If potatoes are fixed on to follow the corn, I would recommend plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground in April, pretty deep, into ridges of three and an half feet wide. Dung the furrow with about 14 or 15 loads of yard dung to an acre; then plant the potatoes on the dung, one row in a furrow, and one foot aſunder. Some recommend the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the potatoes on the earth, aad the dung over them, and as the beginning of our ſummers are uſually dry and warm, I am inclined to believe this is the beſt method. However, in this, as has been already obſerved, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be the beſt guide. Then
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031718_0027_0FEE1A9E5DC98CA0"/>cover them with a plough from each fide. When the ſhoots appear a few inches above the ground, plough down the land to them, and repeat the ploughing till the center of the ridges becomes a furrow. Some, after this, give them one hand hoeing, drawing up the earth cloſe to the ſtalks; but this is condemned by others, who ſay that the centre of the ridge ſhould be kept low to retain the moiſture and rain, and prevent its running off. If in ploughing between the rows, a plough was uſed with a double mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, to throw the earth on both ſides, the furrow in the middle might be ſunk deeper, and the earth thrown up to the ſtalks without injuring the roots. In October they are dug up with prongs. This operation may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered eaſy by cutting down the ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on both ſides into the furrows with a plough.</p>
               <p>When the potatoes are gathered they ſhould be ſpread to dry, and when dry, then ſtored away till they be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to market or uſed at home. They are found to be an excellent food for cattle and hogs; cows will eat them
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031718_0028_0FEE1A9FE56161B8"/>raw greedily; hogs will fatten well on them boiled and marſhed with a little barley meal or Indian corn meal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In England they are eſtimated to be worth 2<abbr>ſ.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> a buſhel for feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattle; and by the culture above mentioned, an acre of land will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upwards of one hundred buſhels, and of ſome forts two hundred buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. The time for planting is the end of April, but they will do in May, or even the firſt week in June. Next ſpring ſow barley or clover ſeed as before mentioned, firſt giving the ground one good ploughing, then ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the barley and rolling in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeed as before directed. As your ground will now be in good heart, you may get a tolerable crop of clover that ſeaſon after the barley: but then in December, when the ground is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and before the ſnow falls, you ſhould lay on about ten loads an acre of yard dung. The clover may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main two years, then follow it wtth wheat on one ploughing.</p>
               <p>After this, ſome let the land lie ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one year; but if this be adopted, it will be beſt to plough in the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031718_0029_0FEE1AA16E7B0C40"/>and ſow early in the ſpring about one half the uſual quantity of rye. This will afford fine paſture in the ſpring and ſummer. Some ſow clover ſeed with the wheat, and this is found to anſwer well, as it furniſhes good fat paſture after the wheat is reaped, as well as rich paſture the ſummer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. This is a mode practiſed by the German farmers in Pennſylvania, and is found very advantageous.</p>
               <p>If the trouble and labour required for raiſing two ſpring crops the ſame ſeaſon, which muſt be the caſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded potatoes be adopted as one of the rotine or courſe crops, be thought too much, corn and potatoes together, I mean a certain number of acres for each, may be made one courſe.</p>
               <p>I have not mentioned oats, becauſe in this country it is a contemptible crop, and ſcarce worth raiſing; barley being far better even for the feed of horſes.</p>

               <p>If at all adventures oats muſt be raiſed, I would recommend a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which, I am told, has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome farmers to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: They chooſe out a piece of ground, no matter though of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quality, ſo it be convenient to the houſe; they firſt plough it up in the fall, and lime it with about forty buſhels of unſlacked lime to the acre; in the ſpring, they plough it again and ſow it with oats: as ſoon as the oats are cut and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, they plough in the ſtubble, harrow the ground and ſhut up the field. The oats ſcattered in reaping or cradling ſpring up and yield a good fall paſture for milch cows. Next ſpring it is ſown again with oats, and treated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo from year to year. I was told by a farmer that he had ſixteen crops of oats ſucceſſively
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031718_0033_0FEE1AAF0F0EA510"/>year after year from the ſame field, treated in this way, and that the land, from being very poor, became ſo rich, that he was obliged to change the crop and ſow barley. I will not vouch for the truth of this, but it may be worth trying.</p>
               <p>Though crops of corn and pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, barley, clover and wheat, may be conſidered as the ſtaple articles in farming, yet there are other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of produce that deſerve the attention of a farmer.</p>

               <head>Pumpkins.</head>
               <p>Pumpkins is one of theſe: For raiſing a crop of pumpkins, chuſe a piece of ground near the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; a light loomy ſoil anſwers beſt; plough it up in the fall, then croſs plough and harrow it in the ſpring; furrow it out into ſquares of ten feet each, and provide a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of well rotten dung, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly hogs dung in preference to any other.</p>
               <p>In the laſt week of May dig holes at the interſections of the furrows,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031718_0034_0FEE1AB26796D3A0"/>and throw into each two or three ſhovels full of dung, mixing it well with a parcle of the mould dug out of the holes. About the 10th of June, mix again the dung and mould in the holes and plant the ſeed. The yellow fleſhed round pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins or the flat ribbed ſort are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the beſt. After the ſeed is planted, plough up the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween and harrow it; and while the plants are growing, plough and harrow the ground as often as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep it looſe and clear of weeds, always hand-hoeing round the plants. It is the practice of ſome to make up hills and plant the ſeed in the hills: this may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in England, from whence I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the practice has been brought, where the ſummer ſun is weak and faint; but it is certainly improper in this country under our ſcorching ſuns, and where the ſummers are commonly dry; and therefore the holes, when the dung and mould are mixed in them for planting ſhould be ſomewhat lower than the ſurface of the adjoining ground.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031718_0035_0FEE1AB9730032B8"/>About ſix or ſeven ſeeds ſhould be planted in each hole; but when the the plants are up and out of danger from flies or inſects, then the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhould be plucked up, and only three of the moſt vigourous plants left in each hole. When the pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins are ripe, gather them into heaps, laying them on a thick bed of ſtraw, and cover the heaps well with ſtraw to guard them from froſt. They are an excellent food both for cattle and hogs. They are to be broken or chopped into pieces and given to the cattle in troughs, or thrown upon clean graſs. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral farmers have fattened both hogs and cattle entirely with them. The produce is immenſe; it is calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an acre of ground may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upwards of twenty tons.

               <p>Cabbage is a crop much cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in England for the food of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031718_0036_0FEE1ABB001DCCE8"/>On a light loarn, plough the ground well in the fall; as ſoon as the froſt is out of the ground, plough it again in the ſpring, and a third time about the beginning of April, or latter end of March. On this earth manure with compoſt, twelve loads to an acre, turn it in, in June. Sow the ſeed in a garden the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of April; three quarters of a pound of ſeed for each acre intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be planted. Prick out the plants when in two leaves ſix inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es apart from each other, in beds prepared for the purpoſe. About the 20th of June tranſplant them into the fields in rows three feet aſunder, and the plants eighteen inches diſtant. This may be done by the ſlight mark left by the plow in ſtriking every fourth furrow. If the ground is ploughed by a good ploughman, the rows will be quite ſtraight enough without the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome exactneſs of a line, which is otherwiſe neceſſary on flat land. Some plant in rows, four feet by two from plant to plant. And it has been obſerved that the larger
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031718_0037_0FEE1ABC89302858"/>the plants are at ſetting out, ſo much better is the crop. The ground muſt be kept clean by hoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Strong clay land has been found to anſwer by the following culture. The land was ſummer-fallowed, or ploughed the year before, and again the ſpring following. The ſeed was ſown in April, and the plants ſet on three feet ridges, two feet from each other, the 24th of June. They were horſe-hoed twice with a ſkim plough, which is ſo conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to cut or ſhave the ſurface of the ground without turning a ridge. The rows were twice hand-hoed, and after that furrows were ſtruck with a common plough, earthing up the plants.</p>
               <p>Cabbages are found to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for compleating the fattening of oxen or weathers which have had the ſummer's graſs, and ſhould be applied to that purpoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the fall.</p>

               <head>The application of the foregoing crops in feeding.</head>
               <p>Potatoes boiled and mixed with rye or barley meal in the proportion of one or two buſhels to twenty, fatten large hogs better than corn alone. In the proportion of one to forty, they fatten porkers, and half fatten bacon hogs. One third barley meal, and two thirds pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes boiled, are found to exceed peas or barley alone in fattening hogs; but what is more material, experience has proved, that being boiled and given alone, they will fatten porkers as well as poſſible. Feeding cows with them has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been tried, and found to anſwer well, and the milk and butter have proved exceedingly good. But it is to be obſerved that it is bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to give cows in winter a food which will anſwer for fatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any animal; and therefore the grand object of potatoe culture ought to be the fattening of hogs, for which uſe experience has proved
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031718_0039_0FEE1AC6F3E4DDC8"/>they will anſwer in great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yield a large profit.</p>
               <p>I have not heard of any accurate experiments to aſcertain the beſt uſe that may be made of pumpkins: but as they are a rich ſolid food, I am inclined to think they may be applied to the purpoſe of fattening, and may be found nearly equal to carrots.</p>
               <p>Carrots are found to be excellent for feeding horſes and fattening ſheep, cattle and hogs. Boiled and given to hogs, they have been found to be worth four pounds ſterling a ton, or 2<abbr>ſ.</abbr> a buſhel: given raw they are eſtimated to be worth 1<abbr>ſ.</abbr> ſterling a buſhel, or 40ſ, a ton, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feeding horſes, or fattening hogs, ſheep or cattle. It has been eſtimated, and experience has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ten acres of good carrots will fatten ſixty ſheep, four large oxen, and winter eight horſes: this ſufficiently ſhews the great profit ariſing from this culture: Nor is this all, the ground is admirably cleared and prepared for future crops, and the dung ariſing in the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031718_0040_0FEE1AC881CAF430"/>expenditure of the crop is of vaſt conſequence in the improvement of other fields. By actual experiments made, it has been found that twenty tons fattened four oxen, weighing on an average, 1330lb. in fourteen weeks, each beaſt having ſeven pounds of hay per day; and leſs than two hundred weight fattened a pig, bought for the purpoſe, and which ſold to the butcher, yielded a profit of 8<abbr>ſ.</abbr> ſterling.</p>
               <p>The beſt uſe of cabbage has been mentioned above. The application of all roots to the food of cattle or hogs is the material object; becauſe the difference in good huſbandry between ſelling a crop and uſing it at home is immenſe. Upon the moſt moderate computation, one acre of potatoes or carrots, if the cattle are kept well littered, which may eaſily be done by collecting leaves or ſtubble, or both, will in the conſumption raiſe dung enough to manure two acres well. The encreaſing fertility of a farm, a part of which ſo employed, wants no il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration: it is an object alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031718_0041_0FEE1ACA09F1A780"/>to change the face of land.</p>
               <p>I ſhall omit making any obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations on the culture of beans, peas, onions, &amp;c. my object being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the improvement of a farm with the view of raiſing and fatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtock. Where there are natural meadows, I preſume theſe will not be neglected; and where there is a command of water, I take it for granted, a careful farmer will not fail to lead it over his ſloping grounds, and the ſides of hills which he will keep for mowing grounds. If he has boggy lands, he will be careful to drain them, or if that cannot be done, he will try to produce meadow or duck graſs, which will grow in very miry places, and form a tolerable firm ſurface even upon bogs, ſo that in a few years they may not only be mowed, but will be ſufficiently firm to bear hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and carts to carry off the hay.</p>

               <head>St. Foine; or Sainfoine.</head>
               <p>Where the land is gravelly and unfit for the culture before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it will be well to try the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031718_0042_0FEE1ACD6DCDA988"/>Sainfoine graſs. This is a native of Italy or the hilly country border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Alps: it is now much cultivated in France, and of late years has been introduced into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: and from all accounts, it appears as if it would anſwer well in this country. It ſtrikes a deep root, grows on poor ſoils, and yields a large crop. Even when ſown on the tops of hills, and on ſtony or gravelly ground, it is ſaid that it will yield, on an average, two tons an acre, and a good fall paſture. It is ſown broad caſt among oats or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpring grain, in the ſame way as clover, and will laſt from fifteen to twenty years. Any ſoil will do for it if free from ſprings and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water. When it grows wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it is harrowed till the ground has the appearance of a fallow. This deſtroys the weeds and natural graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without injuring the ſainfoine, and adds to its duration. If one half of what is ſaid of it be true, it certainly will deſerve the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our farmers. The ſeed may be imported from France or England. The uſual time of ſowing it is in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031718_0043_0FEE1AD47B3A9518"/>April. The quantity of ſeed is four buſhels to an acre. About ten loads of dung to an acre, laid on in the fall, every four years, and a good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> harrowing the ſpring following is all the culture neceſſary.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other artificial graſſes, ſuch as burnet, luzerne, &amp;c. which are highly recommended, but I have ſome doubt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is ſaid of them, whether, upon a fair experiment, they will be found to excel our blue graſs and white clover, or our red clover. Sainfoine, indeed, according to what is ſaid of it, has this in its favour, that it will thrive and yield a good crop even on poor ſoils, may be ſown with grain, and will laſt for many years. Its culture is cheap and ſimple, and when it begins to fail it may be ſoon renewed. But after all, the culture of clover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the particular attention of the farmer, and will be found to be one great pillar of good huſbandry. The importance of a graſs which is of ſo hardy a nature as to bear ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with grain, and is ſubject to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031718_0044_0FEE1AD6070F01C0"/>ſcarcely any failure; which will, the year after it is ſown, yield from three to four tons of hay from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and oftentimes more at two mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which will laſt one or perhaps two years longer, if it ſuits the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and which is a better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for wheat than the fineſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, requiring at the ſame time but one ploughing before the wheat is ſowed. All theſe circumſtances u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to render clover an object of high importance and well deſerving the attention of a farmer. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will appear ſtill greater, when it is conſidered that the crop may be all, and uſually is, conſumed by cattle at home. Hence the farmer is enabled to keep great ſtocks of cattle on ſoils where he could not otherwiſe have any, and thereby raiſe much dung, and keep his land in good heart.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have directed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the farmers almoſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the collecting and making manure from his ſtock. This is the more neceſſary as other kinds of manure, ſuch as marle lime, &amp;c.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031718_0045_0FEE1AD78F752B28"/>are not always within his reach; but where any of theſe can be got at a reaſonable rate, he will be very wrong if he does not avail himſelf of the advantage.</p>

               <head>Liming land.</head>
               <p>As the ſubject of liming land is of importance, I will here inſert the obſervations and practice of a friend of mine in the uſe of lime for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, which he was ſo obliging as to communicate to me as follows:</p>
               <p>"I have in the courſe of ſeven years, put on as many thouſand buſhels of lime in a great variety of modes. With reſpect to farming for wheat, rye or corn, every one takes his own method. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to form a general rule to ſuit all ſoils. The method muſt depend on the quality of your land. If the land be much worn out it will take the leſs quantity of lime. The ſoil beſt adapted to lime is a loomy ground inclining to ſand, at leaſt I have found it to anſwer beſt, tho'
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031718_0046_0FEE1ADAF7D4E860"/>I have heard of great things being done with lime on clay. Deep ploughing, in the firſt inſtance, ought to be practiſed, but ſhallow ploughing after the lime is laid on. Lime evaporates, but it has a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inclination to ſink into the earth. Mixing it well by frequent harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is abſolutely neceſſary. You may put on a greater quantity if you plough deep; but do not be in haſte for your profit the firſt year as the cultivation requires frequent ploughing and tending. Rye will anſwer the firſt year; but wheat will come to nothing, as the crops on the limed lands are late, and the mildews with us operate moſt on late crops. I generally begin with forty buſhels of unſlacked lime per acre, and put on the ſame quantity every third year. This you may continue to do until you find your land in ſufficient heart. I have never exceeded 120 buſhels on an acre, put on as before deſcribed. My land would not average with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lime above eight buſhels of wheat an acre, and when I had
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031718_0047_0FED37E00066C498"/>limed it ſufficiently, I have had in ſome inſtances twenty-five and on an average twenty buſhels per acre. The beſt time for putting on lime is in the autumn; after ploughing deep, put on your lime, harrow it in and let the ground lie fallow through the winter. There is no advantage in letting your ground lie idle, as the lime waſts as well without as with a crop. If you chuſe to turn ground into graſs, the beſt way I have found is, after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off three crops of grain, to ſow buckwheat with the graſs ſeed after harveſt. Let it lie three years in clover, which of itſelf meliorates the land; you may then plough it, and proceed with the uſual cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for grain, putting on lime as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I have ſucceſsfully plouged clover in when it was in full bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: This is a great nanure, and your crop overpays for the loſs of the graſs. I have found great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in ſprinkling a pint of ſlacked lime on every hill of Indian corn juſt after it is planted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:031718_0048_0FEE1AE22ED25BD0"/>
On this I would juſt obſerve, that, had my friend attended to the true courſe of crops, he would have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced much greater advantage from his lime. The taking three crops of grain; or even two crops, after Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an corn, muſt foul the land and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt it too much.</p>
               <p>There is another manure for graſs, which has of late been highly extoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I mean gypſe or plaiſter of Paris, powdered fine and ſcattered over the ground, about three or four buſhels to the acre. The ſtone uſed about Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia has been brought from No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Scotia or Cape Breton. I am told there is a vein of it found in Bucks County in Pennſylvania, and another near Patuxent in Maryland. I wiſh further experiments to be made with this manure. I have had ſome made on light gravelly ſoils and on dry loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ground, which produced amazing effects.</p>
               <p>Having been informed that my friend, whoſe letter I have quoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove on the ſubject of lime, had made ſome experiments with gypſe, which had exceeded his moſt ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031718_0049_0FEE1AE3B6827F90"/>I wrote to him and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to communicate to me his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and, at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him about taking one of my farms into my own management: his anſwer contained the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
               <p>"If you are ſerious about your farm, ſet ſomebody at work directly to clear your water courſes on your meadow: mend your dams, and get ſomebody to look after them and the water courſes this winter: (his letter was dated the 8th of November.) One week of the winter water, is better than a month in ſummer. Try a few buſhels of lime on your meadow. I ſpread above twenty buſhels to the acre laſt fall, and had good ſucceſs. I did this becauſe I could get no plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Paris that was good. I am a devotee to the gypſe upon my graſs; my experience this way is of long ſtanding; but as to grain, I never tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it till this year. I put on my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian corn a ſmall quantity, one large handful to four hills, and I think it produced a wonderful effect. About four buſhels manured nine acres of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031718_0050_0FEE1AE543AD5090"/>corn. The whole of my field was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but I left ſome rows without the gypſe. And though the corn is all good, there is a very perceptible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. In the ſummer the gypſed corn was of a deeper green, and now the cars are much the largeſt. I alſo put ſome on a field adjoining, where the land was very poor, and had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been dunged nor limed. The effect is the ſame comparatively with the other corn in this field, but not equal to the limed field. I tried a ſmall quantity on buckwheat, and I think I ſaw a difference much to the advantage of the gypſe in this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As to graſs, I am convinced of its effects—I never tried it in vain. I have put only four buſhels to the acre, and that in the ſpring, about the middle of March. It will not do for wet or ſour land: it is beſt to ſcatter or ſow it in calm drizly weather.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A choice of the breed of horſes, cattle, ſheep, and hogs, which is too little regarded, is of great importance to a farmer, and deſerves his cloſeſt attention. The expence is as great, may oftentimes greater, in keeping a creature of a bad breed as of a good, and the value is very different. It appears that the Canada breed of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would be found excellent for the plough or for draught, and the Eſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus breed for the carriage. In the choice of horſes, the form ſhould be particularly attended to. The Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da breed comes the neareſt to the form of horſes in the higheſt eſtimation in England for draught, to wit, that of a true round barrel, remarkably ſhort, and lower over the forehand than in any part of the back; the legs alſo ſhort. The Eſopus breed, of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhape and ſize, are ſightly horſes for a carriage: they are gentle, tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and eaſily broke, and yet have a proper degree of ſpirit—have a good
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031718_0052_0FEE1AEFB56B52D0"/>carriage; are eaſily kept, and hardy. The Narraganſet breed have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted excellent for the ſaddle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bakewell, a farmer in England; has rendered himſelf famous by his breed of cattle. His principal aim is to gain the beaſt, whether ſheep or cow, which will weigh moſt in the moſt valuable joints; and at the ſame time that he gains the ſhape, which is of the greateſt value in the ſmalleſt compaſs; he finds, by experience, that he gains a breed much hardier, and eaſier fed than any others. In the breed of cattle, his maxim is "the ſmaller the bones, the truer will be the make of the beaſt; the quicker it will fatten, and the weight will have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proportion of valuable meat." The ſhape, which ſhould be the criterion of a cow, a bull, or an ox, and alſo of a ſheep, is that of a hogſhead or barrel, truly circular, with ſmall and as ſhort legs as poſſible; upon this plain principle, that the value lies in the barrel, not in the legs. All breeds, the backs of which riſe in the leaſt ridge, are bad.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031718_0053_0FEE1AF141525160"/>brings up his cattle in amazing gentleneſs. His bulls ſtand ſtill in the field to be examined. They are driven from one field to another, or home, by a little ſwitch. He or his men walk by their ſide, and guide them with a ſtick wherever they pleaſe. His cattle are always fat, and this he inſiſts is owing to the excellence of the breed. The ſmall quantity and inferior quality of the food, which will keep a beaſt perfectly well made, in good order, is ſurpriſing. Such an animal will grow fat in the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that would ſtarve an ill made, great boned one.</p>
               <p>He is equally curious in his breed of ſheep. The bodies of his rams and ewes are as true barrels as can be ſeen, round broad backs, and the legs not above ſix inches long. An unuſual proof of their kindly fattening, is their feeling quite fat within their fore-legs, on the ribs, where the common breed never carry any fat. He finds that hardly any land is too bad for a good breed of cattle, and particularly ſheep.</p>
               <p>With regard to the rot in ſheep, Mr. Bakewell thinks it is ſolely owing to their feeding on lands that have
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031718_0054_0FEE1AF2C8FE94F0"/>been flooded. Hence it appears that ſheep ſhould not be ſuffered to feed on watered meadows. Water flowing over the land after the beginning of May, is ſure to occaſion the rot, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſoil.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bakewell is remarkably atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the point of wintering his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. All his cattle are tied up in open or other ſheds all winter; and fed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kind; on ſtraw, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, or hay. The lean beaſts have ſtraw alone. Young cattle, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be kept in a thriving ſtate, and alſo fattening ones, have turnips; and in the ſpring, when turnips are gone, hay is wholly their ſubſtitute. By theſe means he is able to keep a large ſtock. His farm, in all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of about 440 acres, 110 acres of which are arable, the reſt is graſs; and he keeps ſixty horſes, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred large ſheep, one hundred and fifty horned beaſts of all ſorts, yet has generally fifteen acres of wheat and twenty-five acres of ſpring corn.</p>
               <p>He has adopted a new ſyſtem in the management of his horned cattle. He uſed to draw with teams of ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and found that he muſt keep
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031718_0055_0FEE1AF45E241C38"/>double the number worked, to have one ſet coming into work and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going out. He therefore chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that ſyſtem and draws all with cows. They are kept on ſtraw till three years old, then bulled and worked till four years old; by which means he finds a great ſaving; and that calves bred from cows ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from-three to four, far exceed thoſe from cows riſing from two to three years. He finds alſo that the teams of cows are full as handy, and draw as well as oxen of the ſame ſize.</p>
               <p>In working with cows or oxen, I am perſuaded, if harneſs was uſed inſtead of yokes, the cattle would draw with much greater power, would move faſter, and be more handy and convenient. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be much the ſame as that for horſes; except the collar's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hled on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worn in the contrary manner to horſes, tha is, the narrow end of the collar which opens being downwards; and as the chains are faſtened to them in the ſame direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031718_0056_0FEE1AFD4D6CF360"/>as in horſe-harneſs, the cattle draw with them much higher than horſes, the line of the chains being above the cheſt, and almoſt up to their backs. This variation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary from the different ſhapes of horſes and oxen.</p>
               <p>The ſuffering the horns of cattle to grow, is oftentimes highly diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, by the cattle's goring each other; and at the ſame time it renders them more unruly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable. For theſe reaſons a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in Pennſylvania has fallen upon a practice to prevent the horns of his cattle from growing. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is, when a calf is a month old and the horns begin to ſprout, he cuts off the knobs with a chizel, and with a ſharp gouge pares them clean from the bone; he then ſears the wound and fills it with hog's lard. He ſays he never loſt a calf by the operation, and that they did not ſeem to thrive the leſs for it; that the loſs of their offenſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſeemed to change the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his cattle in reſpect to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs; and on that account he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031718_0057_0FEE1AFED5B7E020"/>his cows gave more milk, and his cattle were eaſier raiſed and houſed in the winter. For he could drive them young and old into a cloſe yard or ſtable like a flock of ſheep, without difficulty or danger.</p>

               <p>The care of orchards and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good cyder is ſo very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it will neceſſarily draw the attention of every farmer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anderton, a gentleman in England, famed for good cyder, gives the following account of his approved method of making it.</p>
               <p>"I ſhould firſt tell you my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards are on a clay ſoil, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance I think conduces much to the ſtrength and goodneſs of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. I will be ſhort in my practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal account, making but few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and leave the curious to draw ſpeculative reflections from it. I permit my fruit to remain on the trees till a great part of them fall by ripeneſs; then gently ſhaking
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031718_0058_0FEE1B005E163D70"/>the trees, take in the apples in dry weather, laying them in heaps of equal ripeneſs in a loft over the preſs. There they remain till they have perſpired, and that perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceaſes. As ſoon as convenient afterwards, I preſs out the juice; if it caſts a pale colour I permit the pulp after it has paſſed the mill, to remain in vats or other open recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles for twenty-four hours, which will heighten the colour of the juice. As ſoon as it is impreſſed, I pour it into vats through a ſieve, where it remains about two days and a night, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the apple and the ſtate of the weather, (the longeſt when a froſt) till a thick head or ſcum riſes on it. Then I draw off a little in a glaſs to ſee if it is fine; and as ſoon as I catch it ſo, I fail not without delay to draw it off into open vats, if I have them, if not into hogſheads. If the juice be put from the preſs into veſſels wider at top than at bottom, and I draw it off as ſoon as fine, I need not take off the head firſt, as in going downwards, it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031718_0059_0FEE1B01E6777D08"/>will not, in that caſe, break and mix with the body of the liquor. But if my veſſel, in which it is, be of another conſtruction, or I have not been attentive to draw it off in the critical hour, I find I do better before I begin to draw, to take off the head with a wooden ſkimmer and throw it away, and then ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily draw off the cyder. Whenever I find the brown head begins to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the middle or elſewhere and a whiteneſs appear at the opening, I'm pretty certain it is high time to be buſy in drawing off. But I find from experience that the ſureſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is to obſerve its ſtate by what is drawn off in a glaſs, which is to be done by the help of a peg placed at a proper diſtance from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the vat, and this method of obſervation ſhould be cloſely attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; for I have drawn a glaſs of cyder out of a vat at eight o'clock, foul, another at ten, fine; almoſt candle-bright, without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the head's opening as above obſerved: at eleven, it was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloudy apace, without high
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031718_0060_0FEE1B0AE38356D0"/>winds or any extraordinary event which I could perceive, to occaſion it: and I found it abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not to looſe a moment in drawing it off. If then drawn off into other open veſſels, a freſh head may ariſe in twenty-four hours or thereabouts, when it may be racked into a cloſe hogſhead or other receiver, where it will begin to ferment after a day or two, according to the weather, the nature of the fruit, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I then permit it to ferment four or five days generally, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a week for the hardeſt fruit, ſuch as wildings, &amp;c. Then I fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a clean ſweet hogſhead or other cloſe veſſel, with a match or two made of coarſe cloth, dipped into melted ſtone-brimſtone, and rack the cyder into it as ſpeedily as poſſible, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again in the ſame manner, till I catch it very fine. When another ſuch racking often turns out the final one. I cover the bung with a tile or piece of thin wood only during the ſeaſon of racking; and when I put a bung-cork into the hole in the ſpring, I leave a peg-hole open juſt by it.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031718_0061_0FEE1B0C6C548E78"/>The foeces through the whole proceſs are conſtantly removed. I never ſeek to raiſe frequent fermentations, and often compleat the buſineſs by two or three rackings; but have had very good cyder, which has been ſo prone to ferment, that I have been obliged to ſtop it by racking it into fumigated veſſels ten, and even upwards of a dozen times. Many other, probably much better methods of ſtopping the fermentation, and bringing the cyder fine, I have heard of; but theſe are what I have in general hitherto uſed, and have the ſatisfaction of finding my cyder as good as moſt I meet with elſewhere. And though I am far from thinking my management unimprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will anſwer for its turning out well to thoſe, who being unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a better method, will attend to this."</p>
               <p>On a farm managed as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where there will neceſſarily be much food for bees, the care and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them will naturally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the attention of an intelligent farmer. The expence and trouble is ſo trifling, and the profit ſo great, that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031718_0062_0FEE1B0DF59EA388"/>he would be inexcuſable, if he did not add this to the profit of his farm. Bees will ſpare a conſiderable portion of their labours, and may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through the winter; and as the portion of wax and honey, which they can ſpare, may eaſily be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring them, I truſt the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practice will not be followed, of deſtroying whole ſwarms in order to enjoy the fruits of their labours.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral authors who have written on the ſubject of bees. Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and White are the moſt approved. A careful peruſal of them is therefore recommended to all who undertake the management of bees.</p>

               <head>Obſervations on the beſt method of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring worn-out ſoils, without manure: —from the 2d. vol. of the Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Book of the Society inſtituted at Bath, in England, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Agriculture, Arts, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and Commerce.</head>
               <p>THE firſt thing neceſſary on ſuch lands is, immediately after harveſt, to turn them up with the plough as
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031718_0063_0FEE1B1157288338"/>deep as poſſible. In order to do this effectually, it will ſometimes be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a ſecond plough to follow the firſt in the ſame furrow; which will throw the mould over, and bury the ſtubble and weeds. In this caſe there will be a new ſoil uppermoſt, which, being freſh to the air, will receive much greater and more laſting bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from the ſun, the rain, and the froſts, than it otherwiſe could do, as thereby it will attract a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the nutrition which theſe afford. The ſtubble and weeds, being by this method of ploughing buried deep, will much ſooner rot than when juſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In this ſtate the ridges will lie high, and if the land be wet or of the brick-earth kind, will be full of clods or large lumps.</p>
               <p>No time ſhould now be loſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying to render this newly turned-up ſoil, as fine as harrowing can make it. I know in this particular, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be called in queſtion by numbers. Common farmers will ſay, "To what purpoſe is all this expence and labour, when, if the land be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie in its rough ſtate through
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031718_0064_0FEE1B169D5097C8"/>the winter, the froſts and rains will do the work for you?" But this is the language of the ſluggard and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced huſbandman, only.</p>
               <p>I am convinced, by repeated expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, cloſe obſervations, and plain reaſoning on known facts, that lands which are made fine before the ſharp froſt and winter rains come on, will receive a much greater ſhare of their influence than any other.</p>
               <p>If the land be left in a rough ſtate, there is ſeldom time for the rains and froſt to affect more than the out-ſide of the large clods or lumps; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide will indeed be pulverized, but the middle of the lumps, wherever they are large, will be found nearly in the ſame hard ſtiff ſtate as when turned up by the plough. Hence it muſt appear to every one, that in this eaſe the benefit of air, winter rains, and froſts, on lands thus left, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and the conſequence is, that harrowing it in the ſpring, when theſe are over, is too late for its receiving the benefit which would have accrued from them; and the power of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſo vigorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:031718_0065_0FEE1B1A1A361158"/>
But to make winter fallows as fine as they can be in autumn, and then ridge them up in that pulver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized ſtate, is acting moſt agreeable to nature. The greateſt poſſible quantity of ſurface is by this means expoſed to the atmoſphere; and the land is left in a ſtate wherein the rains and the froſt are moſt eaſily admiſſible. They will then pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate and enrich the whole maſs to a greater depth.</p>
               <p>If the froſt penetrates a quantity of earth, formed into a large hard clod, partially, on account of its bulk and hardneſs (which is always ſound to be the caſe) it is evident that the ſame clod, broken into four parts, would be thereby pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated four times as much; or, in other words four times the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of earth would be affected by it, and on a thaw be pulverized. For we find that, after the breaking up of a ſevere froſt, all the ſmall clods crumble eaſily into powder; while the large ones are only made ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the crumbling of their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to a certain depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:031718_0066_0FEE1B1D6FE16A70"/>
By this deep ploughing which I have recommended, the worn-out foil being turned in, the ſecond ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum or freſh earth is now upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and having, by being made as fine as it can be in autumn, been expoſed to the air, the rain, and the froſt during winter, is thereby ſweetened and cleanſed of its impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; and thus becomes a new freſh fertilized earth, in the beſt poſſible ſtate, for vigorous vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Many farmers will probably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this method, on account of its being attended with a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra expence. But I wiſh them to conſider, firſt, that this expenſe is more in appearance than reality, for leſs labour is requiſite in the ſpring; and ſecondly, that it will be amply repaid by the goodneſs of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crops.</p>
               <p>About ſeven years ſince, I made a comparative experiment of this kind on a field of ten acres, the ſoil of which was equal as poſſible in goodneſs. The one half of this field I left after ploughing in its
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031718_0067_0FEE1B20D3A914C0"/>rough ſtate, the ſurface being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with large hard clods. The other half I made as fine as poſſible by harrowing with ox harrows, and beating in pieces the hardeſt and largeſt clods which the harrow would not break.</p>
               <p>In the ſpring, the part I had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed was much finer, without any additional labour, than I could ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other (which was left in its rough ſtate) by repeated harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for the rain and the froſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not penetrated the middle of the large clods, they had received no benefit therefrom, and were as hard as bricks, being only leſſened in ſize.</p>
               <p>I ſowed the whole field in barley the laſt week in April, and threw nine pounds of broad clover in with it. On harveſting it, I kept the crops ſeperate: the part left rough produced twenty-four buſhels per acre; the other thirty-one, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by much the fineſt ſample. The crop of clover next year was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour of the method I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending, being heavier by near half a ton per acre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:031718_0068_0FEE1B242F927780"/>
The extra expence on this part was only about eight ſhillings per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre; the extra produce yielded an extra profit of more than twenty ſhillings per acre.</p>

               <head>A method for preventing the deſtruction of Apple-trees, by Canker worms.</head>
               <p>THE inſects from which the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker worms are produced, are hid in the ground near the root of the tree, not far from the ſurface, and make their appearance as ſoon as the ſnow is off, and the top of the ground ſoft (which ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens as early as February.) The males have wings, and frequently fly directly to the limbs, without touching the body of the tree; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately the females have none, but are a very clumſy bug, and very eaſily ſtopped by tarring the tree. To do this with ſucceſs, it is very neceſſary, that the tar made uſe of be of a proper conſiſtence; if it be very thick it will be impoſſible to lay it on without firſt heating,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031718_0069_0FEE1B27D2B68ED0"/>which makes it form a hard ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face when cold, that ſuffers the bug to paſs over without difficulty; ſome endeavour to remedy this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by mixing train oil with the tar, but the thin kind of tar without oil is far preferable; if this be expoſed to the ſun through the day it will be ſufficiently ſoft to be laid on with a bruſh. It is beſt the rough bark ſhould be ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off with a hoe or ſome other convenient inſtrument, and the tar put round the tree about four inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wide; this operation muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every day, when the ſtate of the ground will permit them to move, until they have done going up. It is not common that the weather is ſuch as to permit them to ſtir until the middle, and often until the latter end of March; when that is the caſe, and the weather continues warm, they will be all out of the ground in about fourteen days; but as they are commonly interrupted with ſnow or cold, it will generally be neceſſary to tar as many as twenty times, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031718_0070_0FEE1B295C0A44B8"/>more. The time that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally choſen to begin is about two hours before ſun-ſet (which is the time the inſects begin to move) and if not finiſhed until an hour after the ſun is down (after the firſt time) it is immaterial, for the tar that is already on the tree, ſoftened by the warmth of the ſun, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtop them until that time. I am ſenſible there have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral objections to this method of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, viz. that it is attended with trouble and expence; that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the tree, and after all that it is ineffectual. As to the expence, a barrel of tar is ſufficient for an orchard that will make an hundred barrels of cyder; and four perſons in two hours will be able to tar the whole at once; allowing this to be repeated twenty times, the expence cannot be great, and experience has ſufficiently proved, that it does not injure the tree. I know of ſeveral orchards that have been tarred (as often as the worms viſited them) for twenty years, and could never perceive any injury done them; on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031718_0071_0FEE1B305EE2DC40"/>the contrary, I know of ſome others in the ſame neighbourhood, that have not been tarred, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the worms. If the tree be thrifty, it will be neceſſary ſome time in the ſummer following, to ſcrape off the tar, or make a few inciſions through it, to prevent the bark from being confined. That it has never proved ineffectual, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no one can produce an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where proper ſteps have been taken; but where it has fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it has been owing to improper management, or want of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

               <head>Observations on the management of Bees, with directions for taking their honey without deſtroying them.</head>
               <p>BEES, an induſtrious and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpecies of inſects. Rural eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy is incomplete, where bees are wanting. The coſt of keeping them is nothing, and the care that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about them is but trifling.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of bees in a hive: 1. The Queen bee, which
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031718_0072_0FEE1B31E728CF90"/>is larger, and of a brighter red than the reſt. Her buſineſs is to conduct the new ſwarms and lay eggs in the cells for a new brood: and her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility is ſo great, that ſhe brings forth many thouſands of young ones in a year. 2. The drones, which have no ſtings, are of a darker co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour than the reſt, and are ſuppoſed to be the males. 3. The honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, or working bees, which are by far more numerous than the other two kinds.</p>
               <p>A bee-houſe ſhould be ſituated at a good diſtance from the places where cattle are kept, eſpecially from hog-ſties, hen and dove-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and remote from filth and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills. It ſhould be defended from high wind on all ſides, ſo far as may be, conſiſtently with admitting the heat of the ſun. The houſe ſhould be open to the ſouth or ſouth-weſt, and the back-ſide ſhould be very tight; with a tight roof projecting, that driving rains may not injure the bees. If ſnow lodges upon or about the hives, it ſhould be bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off without delay. The bench
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031718_0073_0FEE1B336F969630"/>on which the hives ſtand, ſhould be a little canting outwards, that if wet ſhould fall on it, it may run off without entering the hives. Mr. Bromwick propoſes, "that a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe be boarded in front; and that the back-ſide ſhould conſiſt of three doors, which opened, give a full view of the hives, and give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to aſſiſt or lift them. All ſeams ſhould be ſtopped which would admit inſects, from which the houſe is often to be bruſhed.</p>
               <p>"If the houſe ſhould be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being too hot, when thus encloſed, it may be occaſionally ſhaded with boughs of trees. As winter approaches, all the ſeams of the houſe are plaiſtered with clay. In very cold climates, the houſe ſhould be filled with ſtraw, to keep the bees warm, watching againſt mice, and removing the ſtraw in the ſpring.</p>
               <p>"Cut a hole through the front, of the ſame ſize as the mouth of the lower hive, and directly againſt it. Under this paſſage, on a level with the floor, is a lighting board, at
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031718_0074_0FEE1B34F80840E8"/>the mouth of each hive, of about five inches long and three wide. It is a little ſhelf for the bees to land upon after their excurſions. Theſe being ſeparate, not in one piece of the length of the houſe, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent intercourſe between colony and colony; but more eſſentially to prevent mice, ſnails, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders. Theſe alighting boards are ſometimes painted of different colours, to direct each bee to his home more readily. A long ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving board ſhould be placed over the alighting boards, to ſhelter the bees in a rainy time. It ſhould be twelve inches wide, and placed nine inches above the mouths of the hives."</p>
               <p>Broom, clover, and muſtard, are ſaid to afford bees an excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they appear very fond of the flowers of poppies. Gardens, and any places where flowers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and eſpecially where there is a ſucceſſion of flowers through the greater part of the year, are the moſt favourable to them: for they undoubtedly draw the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031718_0075_0FEE1B3A2C511F90"/>part of their honey from the nectaria of flowers. Fields of buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheat are good, as they continue in bloom for a long time. In Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many they move their bee-hives in boats, to the neighbouring fields of buckwheat.</p>
               <p>Bees are wont to ſend out new ſwarms in May and June. Much has been written concerning the management of them on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But the new mode of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them renders all this unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.—It is this: let the bee-houſe be made ſo tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. The hives ſhould not be tall ſhaped, but rather broad and ſhort, that they may take up leſs room. A hive of ſuch dimenſions as to be equal to a cube of thirteen inches, will be ſufficiently capacious. Mr. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley directs that they ſhould be ten inches deep, and from twelve to fourteen broad in the inſide. If hives be made larger, the ſwarms will not multiply ſo faſt. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031718_0076_0FEE1B41314B5E98"/>diameter, covered with a ſliding ſhutter. Each hive or box ſhould have a paſſage at the bottom for the bees to paſs in and out, 4 or 5 inches long, and about one third of an inch deep. One of theſe hives ſhould be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſend out a new ſwarm. This will prevent the going out of a ſwarm, and ſave trouble and watching: for inſtead of ſwarming when the upper hive is full, they will build and depoſit their honey in the one that is below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it:—they will take poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the lowermoſt. It is their manner always to begin at the top, and build downwards. For ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method of management, ſee "Cohite's collateral Bee-boxes."</p>
               <p>When the top hive is well filled with honey, it may be diſcovered by lifting it, or more accurately by weighing it gently with a ſteelyard, in a cool morning, when the bees are ſtiff, and not apt to come out.</p>
               <p>When a hive is taken up, there
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031718_0077_0FEE1B42BA9901D0"/>is no need of murdering the poor infects with fire and brimſtone, as has been the uſual practice: only drive in the ſhutter, and run a thin long knife round, to part it from that which is below it; ſlip the hive off upon a ſmooth piece of board, or ſlide the board under, and carry the hive into your dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe, which you may do in a cool morning without any danger from their ſtings. Lay the hive upon its ſide, and have a window of the room open. As the ſun gets up, and the air grows warmer, they will quit the hive, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hive next to the place whence they were taken. When you take out the honey, which ſhould be done ſpeedily, the bees that are found among the honey, ſtiff and unable to fly, ſhould be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tub of water. They will ſoon recover their activity, and go after their companions.</p>
               <p>Some practiſe feeding bees. But ſays one, "There is but little uſe in it, becauſe thoſe which have not a good ſtock of honey to ſerve them through the winter, are not fit to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031718_0078_0FEE1B444677D2A0"/>keep."—He adds, "There are ſome ſtocks of bees in the ſpring time, that may ſeem worthy of our care to preſerve; ſuch as have but little honey, and a good number of bees, by means of a cold and dry ſpring, yet in all probability may prove an excellent ſtock, and may be worth conſideration."</p>
               <p>"The beſt method of ſupplying bees with food, is by ſmall canes, or troughs conveyed into their hives; and beginning in March when they begin to breed, and ſit on their young, it muſt be daily continued, till the ſeaſon affords eaſe and proviſion abroad.</p>
               <p>"Honey is not only the beſt, but the moſt natural of all food, and will go much farther mixed well with a moderate quantity of good ſweet wort. Some preſcribe toaſts of bread ſopped in good ale, and put into the hive, whereof they will not leave one crumb remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
               <p>Mr. Therley adviſes when ſtocks of bees are weak, to double them, which he thinks the moſt effectual way of preſerving them in common
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031718_0079_0FEE1B45CE372130"/>hives. He does it by the help of a fume, or opiate, which will ſo ſtupify them for a time, that they may be handled at pleaſure. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done this the queen muſt be ſearched for and killed. And exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whither the ſtock to which you intend to join the bees of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have honey enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bees of both: it ſhould weigh twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>"The narcotic or ſtupifying fume, is made with the large muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, commonly known by the name of bunt, puckfiſt, or froge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſe. It is of a brown colour, turns to powder, and is exceeding light. Put one of theſe pucks in a large paper; preſs it therein to two thirds, or half its former bulk, and tie it up very cloſe; then put it into an oven after the bread has been drawn, and let it remain there all night. When it is dry enough to hold fire, it is fit for uſe. The manner of uſing it is thus:</p>
               <p>"Cut off a piece of puck as large as a hen's egg, and fix it in the end of a ſmall ſtick ſlit for that purpoſe, and ſharpened at the other end,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031718_0080_0FEE1B4EB61517C0"/>which place ſo that the puck may hang near the middle of the empty hive. This hive muſt be ſet with the mouth upwarps, near the ſtock you intend to take. This being done, ſet fire to the puck, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately place the ſtock of bees over it, tying a cloth round the hives, that no ſmoke may come forth. In a minute's time, you will hear the bees fall like drops of hail, into the empty hive. You may then beat the top of the hive gently with your hand, to get out as many of them as you can. After this, looſing the cloth, lift the hive off to a table, knock it ſeveral times againſt the table, ſeveral more bees will tumble out, and perhaps the queen among them. She often is one of the laſt that falls. If ſhe is not there, ſearch for her among the main body in the empty hive, ſpreading them for this purpoſe on the table.</p>
               <p>"You muſt proceed in the ſame manner with the other hive, with the bees of which theſe are to be united. One of the queens being ſecured, you muſt put the bees of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031718_0081_0FEE1B50439A2E20"/>both hives together; mingle them thoroughly, and drop them among the combs of the hive which they are intended to inhabit. When they are all in, cover it with a packing or coarſe cloth, which will admit air, and let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhut up all that night, and the next day. You will ſoon be ſenſible they are awaked from their ſleep.</p>
               <p>"The ſecond night after their union, in the duſk of the evening, gently remove the cloth from off the mouth of the hive, and the bees will immediately ſally forth with a great noiſe, but being too late they will ſoon return. Then keep them confined for two or three days, after which the door may be leſt open."</p>
               <p>It is convenient to have a pane of glaſs in each hive, in order to watch the motions of the bees, and to know by inſpection when is the right time to take up a hive. The Rev. Mr. White ſays, "In the back part you muſt cut a hole with a rabbet, in which you are to fix a pane of the cleareſt and beſt crown
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031718_0082_0FEE1B51CB1E63C8"/>glaſs, about five inches in length, and three in breadth, and faſten it with putty. Let the top of the glaſs be placed as high as the roof withinſide, that you may ſee the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the combs, where the bees with their riches are moſtly placed. You will, by this means, be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge of their ſtate and ſtrength, than if your glaſs was fixed in the middle. The glaſs muſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a thin piece of board by way of ſhutter, which may be made to hang by a ſtring, or turn upon a nail, or ſlide ſideways between two mouldings. Such as are deſirous of ſeeing more of the bees' works, may make the glaſs as large as the box will admit, without weakening it too much. Or they may add a pane of glaſs on the top, which muſt likewiſe be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a ſhutter, faſtened down with pegs to prevent accidents.</p>
               <p>"Be careful to faſten the ſhutter ſo cloſe to the glaſs, that no light may enter; for the bees ſeem to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a light as a hole, or breach in their houſe, and on that account may not ſo well like their habitation."</p>
