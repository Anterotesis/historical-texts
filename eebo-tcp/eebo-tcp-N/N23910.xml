            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <dateline>Switzerland, <date>September 1794.</date>
               </dateline>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER ſo long a ſuſpenſion of our correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, after a ſilence like that of death, and a ſeparation which for ſome time paſt ſeemed as final as if we had been divided by the limits of <q>that country from whoſe bourn no traveller returns,</q> with what grateful pleaſure did I recognize your hand-writing, with what eagerneſs did I break the ſeal of your welcome letter, and with what ſoothing emotions receive the tidings of your welfare, and the aſſurance of your affection! Your letter was a taliſman that ſerved to conjure up a thouſand ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſorrows and of joys that are paſt, and which were obliterated by the turbulent ſenſations of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may and horror.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will not be unintereſting to you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me a ſketch of the ſcenes which have paſſed in Paris ſince the ſecond of June, an epocha to be for ever deplored by the friends of liberty, which ſeated a vulgar and ſanguinary deſpot on the ruins of a throne, till the memorable 28th of July 1794, when Liberty, bleeding with a thouſand wounds, revived once more. If the picture I ſend you of thoſe extraordinary events be not well drawn, it is at leaſt marked with the characters of truth, ſince I have been the witneſs of the ſcenes I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031634_0003_0FED6234F6EECE20"/>
and have known perſonally all the principal actors. Thoſe ſcenes, connected in my mind with all the detail of domeſtic ſorrow, with the feelings of private ſympathy, with the tears of mourning friendſhip, are impreſſed upon my memory in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that are indelible. They riſe in ſad ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion like the ſhades of Banquo's line, and paſs along my ſhuddering recollection.</p>
            <p>After having ſo long ſuffered without daring to utter a complaint, it will relieve my oppreſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to give you an account of our late ſituation; and, in ſo doing, I ſhall feel the ſame ſort of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy pleaſure as the mariner who paints the horrors of the tempeſt when he has reached the harbour, and ſheds a tender tear over his loſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions who have periſhed in the wreck—Ah! my dear friend, that overwhelming recollection fills my heart with anguiſh which only they who have ſuffered can conceive. Thoſe perſons in whoſe ſociety I moſt delighted, in whoſe cultivated minds and enlightened converſation I found the ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for what I had loſt in leaving my country and my friends—to ſee them torn from me for ever, to know the preciſe moment in which they were dragged to execution, to feel—but let me turn a while from images of horror which I have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but too deeply, and which have caſt a ſadneſs over my mind that can never, never be diſpelled. Whenever they recur, a funereal veil ſeems to me to be ſpread over nature; and neither the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of preſent, nor the aſſurance of future ſafety, neither the charms of ſociety, nor all the graces, nor all the wonder of the ſcenes I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating, can diſſipate the gloom.</p>
            <p>Not long after the reign of Robeſpierre began, all paſſports to leave the country were refuſed, and the arreſtation of the Engliſh reſiding in France was
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031634_0004_0FED61D3E5ADC850"/>
decreed by the national convention; but the very next day the decree was repealed on the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome French merchants, who ſhewed its impolicy. We therefore concluded that we had no ſuch meaſures to fear in future; and we heard from what we believed to be good anthority, that if any decree paſſed with reſpect to the Engliſh, it would be that of their being ordered to leave the republic. The political clouds in the mean time gathered thick round the hemiſphere: we heard rumours of ſeverity and terror, which ſeemed like thoſe hollow noiſes that roll in the dark gulph of the vulcano, and portend its dangerous eruptions: but no one could calculate how far the threatened miſchief would extend, and how wide a waſte of ruin would deſolate the land. Already conſiderable numbers were impriſoned as ſuſpected—<hi>ſuſpected!</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite word, which was tortured into every mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of injuſtice and oppreſſion, and became what the French call the <hi>mot de ralliement,</hi> the initiative term of captivity and death.</p>
            <p>One evening when Bernardin St. Pierre, the author of the charming little novel of Paul and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, was drinking tea with me, and while I was liſtening to a deſcription he gave me of a ſmall houſe which he had lately built in the centre of a beautiful iſland of the river that flows by Eſſonne, which he was employed in decorating, and where he meant to realiſe ſome of the lovely ſcenes which his fine imagination has pictured in the Mauritius, I was ſuddenly called away from this fairy land by the appearance of a friend, who ruſhed into the room, and with great agitation told us, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree had juſt paſſed in the national convention, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all the Engliſh in France to be put into ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtation in the ſpace of four-and-twenty hours, and their property to be confiſcated. We paſſed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031634_0005_0FED61FE8247A9F8"/>
the night without ſleep, and the following day in anxiety and perturbation not to be deſcribed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every moment the commiſſaries of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary committee and their guards, to put in force the mandates of the convention. As the day advanced, our terror increaſed: in the evening we received information that moſt of our Engliſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances were conducted to priſon. At length night came; and no commiſſaries appearing, we began to flatter ourſelves that, being a family of women, it was intended that we ſhould be ſpared; for the time was only now arrived when neither ſex nor age gave any claim to compaſſion. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with fatigue and emotion, we went to bed with ſome faint hopes of exemption from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral calamity of our countrymen. Theſe hopes were however but of ſhort duration. At two in the morning we were awakened by a loud knocking at the gate of the hotel, which we well knew to be the fatal ſignal of our approaching captivity; and a few minutes after the bell of our apartments was rung with violence. My ſiſter and myſelf hurried on our clothes and went with trembling ſteps to the anti-chamber, when we found two commiſſaries of the revolutionary committee of our ſection, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a guard, two of whom were placed at the outer door with their ſwords drawn, while the reſt entered the room. One of theſe conſtituted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities held a paper in his hand, which was a copy of the decree of the convention, and which he offered to read to us; but we declined hearing it, and told him we were ready to obey the law. Seeing us pale and trembling, he and his colleague endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comfort us; they begged us to compoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they repeated that our arreſtation was only part of a general political meaſure, and that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence had nothing to fear.—Alas! innocence was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031634_0006_0FED61966714AF38"/>
no longer any plea for ſafety. They took a procès-verbal of our names, ages, the country where we were born, the length of time we had lived in France; and when this regiſter was finiſhed, we were told that we muſt prepare to depart. We were each of us allowed to take as much clean linen as we could tie up in a handkerchief, and which was all the property which we could now call our own; the reſt, in conſequence of the decree, being ſeized by the nation. Sometimes, under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a great calamity, the moſt acute ſenſations are excited by little circumſtances which form a part of the whole, and ſerve in the retroſpect of memory, like certain points in a landſcape, to call up the ſurrounding ſcenery: ſuch is the feeling with which I recall the moments when, having got out of our appartments, we ſtood upon the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe ſurrounded with guards, while the commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries placed the ſeals on our doors. The contraſt between the priſon where we were going to be led, and that home which was now cloſed againſt us, perhaps for years, filled my heart with a pang for which language has no utterance. Some of the guards were diſpoſed to treat us with rudeneſs; which the commiſſaries ſternly repreſſed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to keep at ſome diſtance, made us lean on their arms, for they ſaw we ſtood in need of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in our way to the committee-room. We found this place crowded with commiſſaries and ſoldiers, ſome ſleeping, ſome writing, and others amuſing themſelves with pleaſantries of a revolutionary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to which we liſtened trembling. Every half-hour a guard entered, conducting Engliſh priſoners, among whom were no women but ourſelves. Here we paſſed the long night; and at eight in the morning our countrymen were taken to the priſon of the Madelonettes, while we were ſtill detained
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031634_0007_0FED61D7D99869F8"/>
at the committee. We diſcovered afterwards that this was owing to the humanity of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries who arreſted us, and who ſent to the municipality to know if we might not be taken to the Luxembourg, where we ſhould find good accommodations, while at the Madelonettes' ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bed could be procured. All that compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could dictate, all the lenity which it was in the power of theſe commiſſaries to diſplay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring ten years impriſonment, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty annexed to leaving us at liberty, we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. Humanity from members of a revolutionary committee! You will perhaps exclaim in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Jews, <q>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</q> It is certain, however, ſtrange as it may ſeem, that our two commiſſaries behaved towards us as if they remembered that we were defenceleſs women in a land of ſtrangers; that we were accuſed of no crime except that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born on the ſoil of England; and that, if we were puniſhed, we had only deſerved it by truſting with too eaſy a belief in that national faith which was now violated. By the way, when I tell you that we experienced compaſſion from revolutionary committees, you will not ſuppoſe I mean to aſſert that compaſſionate men formed the majority of their committees. The greater part of mankind in all ages, even when accuſtomed to the moſt elevated rank, have abuſed power: how then could it be hoped that unlimited power would not be abuſed, which was confided to men who were for the moſt part ignorant and unenlightened; men who, till that period, confined to their ſhops and their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al occupations, were ſuddenly tranſported into ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did hotels, with authority to unlock cabinets blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with jewels, to ſeize upon heaps of uncounted gold, and with a ſtroke of their pens to diſperſe as
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031634_0008_0FED61820B5CA160"/>
many warrants for impriſonment, as caprice, envy, or miſtaken zeal might prompt; who were made arbiters of the liberty, property, and even lives of their fellow-citizens: and who were incited, nay even compelled, to acts of violence under the penalty of being branded with the guilt of <hi>modera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tiſm?</hi> When ſuch was the new-eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, when it required the moſt daring courage to be humane, and when to be cruel was to be ſafe, can you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that among the revolutionary committees in general there was not <q>as much pity to be found as would fill the eye of a wren?</q> After paſſing the whole day as we had done the night, in the committee-room, orders arrived from the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality to ſend us to the former palace, now the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Luxembourg, where we were attended by two guards within each coach, while two walked on each ſide. What ſtrange ſenſations I felt as I paſſed through the ſtreets of Paris, and aſcended the ſteps of the Luxembourg, a ſad ſpectacle to the crowd! We were conducted to the range of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above the former rooms of ſtate, where we were received with the utmoſt civility by the keeper of the priſon, Benoit, a name which many a wretch has bleſſed, for many a ſorrow his compaſſion and gentleneſs have ſoftened. His heart was indeed but ill ſuited to his office; and often he incurred the diſpleaſure of thoſe ſavages by whom he was employed, and who wiſhed their victims to feel the full extent of their calamity, unmitigated by any detail of kindneſs, any attention to thoſe little wants which this benevolent perſon was anxious to remove, or thoſe few comforts which he had the power to beſtow. The barbarians thought it not enough to load their victims with iron, unleſs "it entered into their ſouls." But Benoit was not to be intimidated into cruelty. Without deviating
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031634_0009_0FED614F5A7F8DD8"/>
from his duty, he purſued his ſteady courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and may the grateful benedictions of the unhappy have aſcended for him to heaven!</p>
            <p>We had a good apartment allotted us, which a few weeks before had been inhabited by Valaze, one of the deputies of the convention, who was now transferred to the priſon of the Conciergerie. Our apartment, with ſeveral adjoining, had ſoon after the event of the 31ſt of May been prepared for the impriſonment of the deputies of the <hi>coté droit;</hi> and for that purpoſe the windows which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fine view of the Luxembourg-gardens had been blocked up to the upper panes, which were barred with iron. Mattraſſes were provided for us in this gloomy chamber, the door of which was locked by one of our jailors; and we had ſuffered too much fatigue of body, as well as diſturbance of mind, not to find a refuge from ſorrow in ſome hours of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep.</p>

            <p>THE next morning the ſun aroſe with unuſual brightneſs; and with the aid of a table on which I mounted, I ſaw through our grated windows the beautiful gardens of the Luxembourg. Its tall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic trees had not yet loſt their foliage; and though they were fallen, like our fortunes, <q>into the ſear, the yellow leaf,</q> they ſtill preſented thoſe rich gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of colouring which belong to autumn. The ſun gilded the Gothic ſpires of the ſurrounding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, which lifted up their tall points above the venerable groves; while on the back-ground of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031634_0010_0FED621B69132300"/>
ſcenery aroſe the hills of Meudon. It ſeemed to me as if the declining ſeaſon had ſhed its laſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting graces over the landſcape to ſooth my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſpirit; and ſuch was the effect it produced. It is ſcarcely poſſible to contemplate the beauties of nature without that enthuſiaſtic pleaſure which ſwells into devotion; and when ſuch diſpoſitions are excited in the mind, reſignation to ſufferings, which in the ſacred words of ſcripture <q>are but for a moment,</q> becomes a leſs difficult duty.</p>
            <p>The Luxembourg had lately been fitted up to receive the crowd of new inhabitants, with which it was going to be peopled, and every apartment obtained a particular appellation, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed on the outſide of the door. We were lodged in the chamber of Cincinnatus: Brutus, I think, was our next-door neighbour; and Socrates had pitched his tent at the diſtance of a few paces. The chamber of <hi>Indiviſibility</hi> was allotted to ſome perſons accuſed of <hi>federaliſm,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in broad characters over the door of a priſoner who was <hi>au ſecret</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In cloſe confinement.</note>. With reſpect to great names, it has been obſerved in Paris that almoſt all the illuſtrious characters of Greece and Rome have been led to the Guillotine—for inſtance, Brutus, who often, while we were in priſon, came from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipality with orders from Anaxagoras, was ſoon after doomed to an equal fate,
<q>
                  <l>"Alike in fortune, as alike in fame!"</l>
               </q>
together with Anacharſis, Agricola, Ariſtides, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, Sempronius Gracchus, Epaminondas, Cato the elder and the younger, and many other no leſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031634_0011_0FED62040F6A6940"/>
celebrated worthies, who fell in ſad ſucceſſion under the ſword of Maximilian<note n="*" place="bottom">The chriſtian name of Robeſpierre.</note>.</p>
            <p>Our priſon was filled with a multitude of perſons of different conditions, characters, opinions and countries, and ſeemed an epitome of the whole world. The mornings were devoted to buſineſs, and paſſed in little occupations, of which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſometimes complained, but for which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they had rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on to be thankful, ſince leſs lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was left them to brood over their misfortunes. Every one had an appointed taſk; in each chamber the priſoners, by turns, lighted the fires, ſwept the rooms, arranged the beds; and thoſe who could not afford to have dinner from a tavern, or, as the rich were yet permitted, from their own houſes, prepared themſelves their meals. Every chamber formed a ſociety ſubject to certain regulations: a new preſident was choſen every day, or every week, who enforced its laws and maintained good order. In ſome chambers no perſon was allowed to ſing after ten, in others, after eleven at night. This reſtriction would, perhaps, have been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in England in a ſimilar ſituation; but it was highly neceſſary here, ſince it prevented ſuch of the priſoners as were more light-hearted than the reſt from ſinging all night long, to the annoyance of others of their neighbours, who might think the muſic which reſounded through the priſon during the day fully ſufficient. The ſyſtem of equality, whatever oppoſition it met with in the world, was in its full extent practiſed in the priſon. United by the ſtrong tie of common calamity, the priſoners conſidered themſelves as bound to ſoften the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil by mutual kind offices; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and ſtrangers meeting in ſuch circumſtances ſoon became friends.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031634_0012_0FED61A4D54C3988"/>
The poor lived not upon the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table, but ſhared the comforts of the repaſt; and here was found a community of the ſmall ſtock of goods, which belonged to the whole without the neceſſity of a requiſition. One broom, which was the property of a counteſs, was uſed by twenty delicate hands to ſweep the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive apartments; and a tea-kettle with which a friend furniſhed my mother was literally, as Dr. Johnſon obſerved of his own, "never allowed time to cool," but was employed from morning till night in furniſhing the Engliſh with tea.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the priſoners met in an anti-chamber, which commanded a view of the gardens. Here they formed themſelves into groups: ſome converſed, others walked up and down the room; others gazed from the windows on the walks below, where, perhaps, they recogniſed a relation or a friend, who being denied the privilege of viſiting the priſon, had come to ſooth them by a look or tear of ſympathy. During the firſt days of our confinement, the priſoners were permitted to ſee their friends; and many a ſtriking contraſt of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and ſorrow did the anti-chamber then exhibit. In one part of the room, lively young people were amuſing their viſitors by a thouſand little pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries on their own ſituation; in another, a huſband who was a priſoner was taking leave of his wife who had come to ſee him, and ſhedding tears over his child who was clinging to his knees, or had thrown its arms around his neck and refuſed to be torn from its father. As the number of priſoners increaſed, which they did ſo rapidly, that in leſs than a week they were augmented from an hundred to a thouſand, the rules of the priſon became more ſevere, and the adminiſtrators of the police gave ſtrict orders, that no perſon whatever ſhould be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031634_0013_0FED616292E0A440"/>
admitted. After this period the wives of ſome of the priſoners came regularly every day, bringing their children with them to the terrace of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. You often ſaw the mother weeping, and the children ſtretching out their little hands and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their fathers, who ſtood with their eyes fixed on the objects of their affection: but ſometimes a ſurly ſentinel repreſſed theſe melancholy effuſions of tenderneſs, by calling to the perſons in the walk to keep off, and make no ſigns to the priſoners.—In the mean time, among the crowd that filled the public room were fine gentlemen and fine ladies, who had held the higheſt rank at court, ſome flirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, others making appointments for card parties or muſic in their own apartments in the evening, and others relating to us in pathetic lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage all they had ſuffered and all they had loſt by the revolution. It was impoſſible not to ſympathize in the diſtreſſes of ſome, or avoid wondering at the folly of others, in whom the ſtrong ſenſe of danger could not overcome the feelings of vanity; and who, although the tremendous decree had juſt gone forth, making "terror the order of the day," and knowing that the fatal pre-eminence of rank was the ſureſt paſſport to the guillotine, could not reſiſt uſing the proſcribed nomenclature of "Madame la ducheſſe," "Monſieur le comte," &amp;c. which ſeemed to iſſue from their lips like natural melodies to which the ear has long been accuſtomed, and which the voice involuntarily repeats. There were, however, among the captive nobility many perſons who had too much good ſenſe not to obſerve a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conduct, who had proved themſelves real friends to liberty, had made important ſacrifices in its cauſe, and who had been led to priſon by revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary committees on pretences the moſt trivial, and ſometimes from miſtakes the moſt ludicrous.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031634_0014_0FED6237BA0D5FB8"/>
Such was the fate of the former count and counteſs of—, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the beginning of the revolution by the ardour of their patriotiſm and the largeneſs of their civic donations. They had hitherto lived undiſturbed in their ſplendid hotel, and there they might probably have continued to live a little longer had not the Counteſs, in an evil hour, ſent down to her chateau a fine marble hearth, which by ſome accident was broken in the way. The ſteward ſent a letter, in which, among other things, he mentioned that the "foyer<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Foyer</hi> is the French name for hearth, and alſo for the central point of a ſyſtem.</note> muſt be repaired at Paris." This letter was intercepted and read by the revolutionary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. They ſwore, they raged at the dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ariſtocracy. "Here," ſaid they, "is a daring plot indeed! a <hi>foyer</hi> of counter-revolution, and to be repaired at Paris! We muſt inſtantly ſeize the authors and the accomplices." In vain the Counteſs related the ſtory of the hearth, and aſſerted that no conſpiracy lurked beneath the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: both herſelf and her huſband were conducted to the maiſon d'arrêt of their ſection, from which we ſaw them arrive at the Luxembourg with about ſixty other perſons at the hour of midnight, after having been led through the ſtreets in proceſſion by the light of an immenſe number of flambeaux, and guarded by a whole battalion. Theſe priſoners had at leaſt the conſolation of finding themſelves in the ſociety of many of their friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for all the polite part of the fauxbourg St. Germain might be ſaid to be aſſembled at the Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg in maſs. Impriſonment here was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no longer the excluſive diſtinction of former nobility, but was extended to great numbers of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031634_0015_0FED6228293B86D8"/>
former third eſtate. We had prieſts, phyſicians, merchants, ſhop-keeper, actors and actreſſes, French valets and Engliſh waiting-women, all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together in the public room; but in the private apartments Benoit's benevolent heart taught him the moſt delicate ſpecies of politeneſs, by plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe perſons together who were moſt likely to find ſatisfaction in each other's ſociety.</p>
            <p>Amidſt many an eloquent tale of chateaux level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ground, and palaces where, to borrow an image of deſolation from Oſſian, "the fox might be ſeen looking out at the window," we ſometimes heard the complaints of ſimple ſorrow unallied to greatneſs; but, like the notes of the ſtarling, "ſo true in time to nature were they chanted," that they ſeized irreſiſtibly on the heart. Of this kind was a ſcene which paſſed ſometimes between a poor Engliſh woman and her dog, which ſhe had brought to keep her company in her captivity. She had been houſe-keeper in a French family, and, ſome months before ſhe was impriſoned, had ſent her daughter, who was her only child, to her friends in England. The poor woman often exclaimed, while her face was bathed in tears, "Oh, Charlotte, Charlotte, I ſhall never ſee you again!" Whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the dog heard the name of Charlotte, he began to howl in ſo melancholy a note that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not to ſympathiſe in his lamention.</p>
            <p>The moſt frightful circumſtance which attended our arreſtation were the viſits of Henriot, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant of the military force of Paris. This wretch had been one of the executioners on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of September, and was appointed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of Paris on the 31ſt of May to take the command of the National Guard, to point the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non againſt the convention, to violate the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the people, and to act the prelude of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031634_0016_0FED6242E751A4B0"/>
that dark drama of which France has been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated ſcene, and Europe the affrighted ſpectator. Henriot performed his part ſo much to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his employers, that he was continued in his command; and it was a part of his office to viſit the priſons, and take care that they were properly guarded. The firſt time I ſaw him was the day after our confinement. He entered on a ſudden our apartment, brandiſhing his ſword, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by twelve of his officers. There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his look which did not give you ſimply the idea of the ferocity which is ſometimes to be found among civilized Europeans: his fierceneſs ſeemed to be of that kind which belongs to a cannibal of New Zealand; and he looked not merely as if he longed to plunge his ſabre in our boſoms, but to drink a libation of our blood. He poured forth a volley of oaths and imprecations, called out to know how many guillotines muſt be erected for the Engliſh, and did not leave our chamber till one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was preſent had fainted with terror. In this manner he viſited every apartment, ſpreading conſternation and diſmay; and theſe viſits were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated three or four times in a week. Whenever the trampling of his horſe's feet was heard in the court-yard, the firſt priſoner who diſtinguiſhed the well-known ſound gave the alarm, and in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the public room was cleared; every perſon flying with the precipitation of fear to his own apartment. Every noiſe was inſtantly huſhed; a ſtillneſs like that of death prevaded the whole dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and we remained crouching in our cells, like the Greeks in the cave of Polyphemus, till the monſter diſappeared. The viſits of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of police, though not ſo terrific as thoſe of Henriot, were nothing leſs than ſoothing. Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well as terror, was the order of day;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031634_0017_0FED61F264BEDC40"/>
and thoſe public functionaries, whoſe buſineſs it was not only to ſee that the police of the priſon was well regulated, but alſo to hear if the priſoners had any ſubject of complaint, uſed to make the enquiry in a tone of ſuch ferocity, that, whatever oppreſſions might hang on the heart, the lips loſt the power of giving them utterance. The viſits of the police generally produced ſome additional rigour to our confinement; and in a ſhort time all acceſs to us whatever was forbidden ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pt by letters, which were ſent open, and delivered to us after being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the ſentinels. There was ſometimes room for deep meditation on the ſtrange caprice and viciſſitudes of fortune. We found the ex-miniſter Amelot a priſoner in the Luxembourg; he, who during his adminiſtration had diſtributed letters de cachet with ſo much liberality. Tyranny had now changed its inſtruments, and he was become him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the victim of deſpotiſm with new inſignia; the <hi>blue ribband</hi> had given place to the <hi>red cap,</hi> and "de par le roi" was transformed into "par meſure de ſureté generale." By his order La Tude, whoſe hiſtory is ſo well known, had been confined thirty years in the Baſtille. He was now enjoying the ſweets of liberty; and, before the priſon-doors were ſhut againſt ſtrangers, came frequently to viſit ſome of his friends in the very room where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was impriſoned.</p>
            <p>Amelot, in a comfortable apartment and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſociety, did not bear his confinement with the ſame firmneſs as La Tude had borne the ſolitude of his dungeon, cheered only by the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſounds of his flute of reeds. He was in a ſhort time bereft of his reaſon; and, among the wanderings of his imagination, uſed to addreſs let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all the kings of Europe and all the emigrant princes, inviting them to ſumptuous repaſts, to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031634_0018_0FED61DF14151918"/>
which he ſometimes propoſed admitting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional convention, to ſhew that he was above bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malice.</p>
            <p>Whenever any new priſoners arrived, the reſt crowded around them, and haſtened to calm their minds by the moſt ſoothing expreſſions of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Not ſuch were the emotions excited by the appearance of Maillard, who was one of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers on the ſecond of September, and who had lately been appointed to a command in the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary army; from which, for ſome malverſations, he was now diſmiſſed, ſent to priſon, and ordered into cloſe confinement. He had taken a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part in the late tranſactions, and had a few days before his own arreſt, conducted to priſon two fine boys, who were the ſons of the ex-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter La Tour du Pin, together with their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who was a prieſt. They were ſtepping into a carriage, which was to convey them to ſchool, when they were ſeized upon by Maillard, who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the youngeſt, a child of eleven years of age, by the ſhoulder, ſaid to him in a ſtern accent, "Il faut dire la verité, toute la verité, et rien que la verité<note n="*" place="bottom">You muſt ſpeak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</note>." No ſooner was Maillard brought into the anti-chamber, while his room was preparing, than the little boy recognized his acquaintance, and running up to him cried, "Bon jour, citoyen Maillard—il faut dire la verité, toute la verité, et rien que la verité."</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more painful than the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions excited by reading the evening papers, which the priſoners were at this time permitted to receive, and which were expected with that trembling anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with which, under preſent evils, we long to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031634_0019_0FED325596173A48"/>
look into the promiſes of futurity. The evening paper ſeemed to us the book of our deſtiny; but there we could trace no ſoothing characters of hope, or mercy. Every line was ſtamped with conſpiracy, vengeance, deſolation, and death; and the reading the events of the day left impreſſions on our minds which often deprived us of ſleep. We ſometimes quitted the crowd in the public room, and, ſhutting ourſelves up in our own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, endeavoured, amidſt the evils of this world, like Sterne's monk, to look beyond it. If ſuch meditation was calculated to wipe away our tears, it ſometimes made them flow—"Let the ſighing of the priſoner come before Thee: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greatneſs of Thy power, preſerve Thou thoſe that are appointed to die."</p>

            <head>LETTER III.</head>
            <p>THE days of my captivity are often brought back to my remembrance, by circumſtances which ſeem ſufficiently remote from ſorrows; by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the paſt with the preſent, which Aken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide deſcribes ſo beautifully<note n="*" place="bottom">Pleaſures of Imagination, book iii.</note>: and you will perhaps think that my imagination is ſomewhat diſordered, when I tell you that the lake, from the luxuriant banks of which I ſend you this letter, recalls to my mind our apartment in the priſon. The walls of that apartment were hung with tapeſtry which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a landſcape of romantic beauty. On that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031634_0020_0FED61E5B06B7260"/>
landſcape I often gazed till I almoſt perſuaded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the ſcenery was alive around me, ſo much did I delight in the pleaſing illuſion. How often, while my eyes were fixed on that canvas which led my wounded ſpirit from the cruelty of man to the benignity of God—how often did I wiſh "for the wings of a dove, that I might flee away and be at reſt!" To be ſeated at the foot of thoſe ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hills which emboſomed ſome mimic habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or beneath a mighty elm which roſe majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically in the fore-ground of the piece, and ſpread its thick foliage over a green ſlope, appeared to me the ſummit of earthly felicity. Thoſe hills, the torrent-ſtream which rolled down their ſteep ſides, the ſhady elm, and all the objects on the tapeſtry, are indelibly impreſſed on my memory; and often when I am wandering through the charming ſcenes of Switzerland, a country which nature ſeems to have created more for ornament than uſe, where ſhe has ſpread over every landſcape thoſe laviſh graces which in other regions belong only to a few favoured ſpots, I have felt my eyes bathed in tears, while, amidſt views of overwhelming great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome minute object unobſerved by others has led <hi>my</hi> imagination to the tapeſtry and the priſon. A few days ſince I paſſed along the falls of the Teſſino, rolling through narrow clif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s under rocks of the moſt terrific form, in a ſucceſſion of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſweeping after each other down the abrupt deſcent, and broken in their courſe by enormous fragments torn from the cliffs; ſometimes raiſing their ſcattered ſurges into thin air, and ſometimes diſplaying the priſmatic colours on the foam. While I was ſtanding on one of thoſe daring bridges that are thrown acroſs the gulph, and that tradition calls the work of ſupernatural agency, after the firſt tranſport of admiration, in which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031634_0021_0FED325724AA69E0"/>
the mind loſes all traces of the paſt, or thought of the future, had ſubſided, the torrent-rill which ruſhed down the Luxembourg tapeſtry preſented itſelf to my memory, while amidſt the pendent groves of pine and fir, bending along the cliffs, and above the ſweeping birch which dipped its drooping branches in the ſurf, I diſcovered a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering elm, the form of which reſembled the friend of my captivity—But how far have I eſcaped from my priſon!—You will forgive this digreſſion: my mind is full of thoſe ſcenes of beauty and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur which have calmed my troubled ſpirit, and in which I have found a renovation of exiſtence.</p>
            <p>I have yet only given you a general outline of our priſon; but there was one ſcene of calamity which myſelf and my family were alone doomed to witneſs, and of which our fellow captives had no ſhare. Our apartment, with two others adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſeparated from the public room by a little paſſage, and a door which the huiſſiers carefully locked at night. It happened that theſe apartments were then occupied by two perſons in whoſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we had paſſed ſome of the moſt agreeable hours of our reſidence in France. Theſe perſons were Sillery and La Source, two of the members of the convention, who had been long in cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and who were now on the point of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before that ſanguinary tribunal whence, after the moſt ſhocking mockery of juſtice, they were inhumanly dragged to the ſcaffold. Sillery on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his infirmities, had with much difficulty obtained permiſſion from the police for his ſervant to be admitted into the priſon during the day, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an old female friend, who, on the plea of his illneſs, had implored leave to attend him as his nurſe, with that eloquence which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to affliction, and which ſometimes even the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031634_0022_0FED622CA4B2AF10"/>
moſt hardened hearts are unable to reſiſt. While men aſſume over our ſex ſo many claims of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, let them at leaſt beſtow on us the palm of conſtancy, and allow that in the fidelity of our attachments we have the right of pre-eminence. Thoſe priſons from which men ſhrunk back with terror, and where they often left their friends abandoned leſt they ſhould be involved in their fate—women, in whom the force of ſenſibility over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the fears of female weakneſs, demanded and ſometimes obtained permiſſion to viſit, in defiance of all the dangers that ſurrounded their gloomy walls. Sillery's friend and his ſervant being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go in and out of his apartment, the door was not kept conſtantly locked, although he and La Source were cloſely confined, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have any communication with the other priſoners. The ſecond night of our abode in the Luxembourg, when the priſoners had retired to their reſpective chambers, and the keeper had lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the outer door which encloſed our three apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, La Source entered our room. Oh! how different was this interview from thoſe meetings of ſocial enjoyment that were embelliſhed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e charms of his converſation, always diſtinguiſhed by a flow of eloquence, and animated by that enthuſiaſtic fervour which peculiarly belonged to his character! La Source was a native of Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc, und united with very ſuperior talents, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid warmth of imagination for which the ſouthern provinces of France have been renowned ſince the period when, awakened by the genial influence of thoſe luxuriant regions, the ſong of the Trouba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours burſt from the gloom of Gothic barbariſm. Liberty in the ſoul of La Source was leſs a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than a paſſion for his boſom beat high with philanthropy; and in his former ſituation as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031634_0023_0FED623082349B10"/>
miniſter he had felt in a peculiar manner the oppreſſion of the ancient ſyſtem. His ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was acute, and his deteſtation of the crimes by which the revolution had been ſullied, was in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his devoted attachment to its cauſe. La Source was polite and amiable in his manners: he had a taſte for muſic, and a powerful voice; and ſung, as he converſed, with all the energy of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. After the day had paſſed in the fatigue of public debates, he was glad to lay aſide the tumult of politics in the evening, for the converſation of ſome literary men whom he met occaſionally at our tea-table. Ah! how little did we then foreſee the horrors of that period when we ſhould meet him in the gloom of a priſon, a proſcribed victim, with whom this melancholy interview was beſet with danger!</p>
            <p>We were obliged to converſe in whiſpers, while we kept watch ſucceſſively at the outer door, that if any ſtep approached he might inſtantly fly to his chamber. He had much to aſk, having been three months a cloſe priſoner, and knowing little of what was paſſing in the world; and though he ſeemed to forget all the horrors of his ſituation in the conſolation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> derived from theſe moments of confidential converſation, yet he frequently lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this laſt gleam of pleaſure which was ſhed over his exiſtence was purchaſed at the price of our captivity. In the ſolitude of his priſon, no voice of friendſhip, no accents of pity had reached his ear; and after our arrival, he uſed through the lonely day to count the hours till the priſon-gates were cloſed, till all was ſtill within its walls, and no ſound was heard without, except at intervals the hoarſe cry of the ſentinels, when he haſtened to our apartment. The diſcovery of theſe viſits would indeed have expoſed us to the moſt fatal conſequences; but our ſympathy prevailed over
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031634_0024_0FED61AE37DF63F8"/>
our fears; nor could we, whatever might be the event, refuſe our devoted friend this laſt melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfaction. La Source at his ſecond viſit was accompanied by Sillery, the huſband of Madame de Sillery, whoſe writings are ſo well known in England. Sillery was about ſixty years of age; had lived freely, like moſt men of his former rank in France; and from this diſſipated life had more the appearance of age than belonged to his years. His manners retained the elegance, by which that claſs was diſtinguiſhed which Mr. Burke has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated "the Corinthian capital of poliſhed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety." Sillery had a fine taſte for drawing, and during his confinement diſplayed the powers of his pencil by tracing beautiful landſcapes. He alſo amuſed himſelf by reading hiſtory; and, poſſeſſing conſiderable talents for literature, had recorded with a rich warmth of colouring the events of the revolution, in which he had been a diſtinguiſhed actor, and of which he had treaſured up details precious for hiſtory. With keen regret he told me that he had committed ſeveral volumes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript to the flames, a ſad ſacrifice to the Omars of the day.</p>
            <p>The mind of Sillery was ſomewhat leſs fortified againſt his approaching fate than that of La Source. The old man often turned back on the paſt and wept, and ſometimes enquired with an anxious look, if we believed there was any chance of his deliverance. Alas! I have no words to paint the ſenſations of thoſe moments!—To know that the days of our fellow-captives were numbered—that they were doomed to periſh—that the bloody tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal before which they were going to appear, was but the path-way to the ſcaffold—to have the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taſk of ſtifling our feelings, while we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth the weakneſs of humanity by
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031634_0025_0FED616A33B5C718"/>
hopes which we knew were fallacious, was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of miſery almoſt inſupportable. There were moments indeed, when the taſk became too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be endured. There are moments when, ſhocked by ſome new incident of terror, this cruel reſtraint gave way to uncontrolable emotion; when the tears, the ſobbings of convulſive anguiſh would no longer be ſuppreſſed, and our unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate friends were obliged to give inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving conſolation.</p>
            <p>They had in their calamity that ſupport which is of all others the moſt effectual under misfortune. Religion was in La Source a habit of the mind. Impreſſed with the moſt ſublime ideas of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, although the ways of heaven never appeared more dark and intricate than in this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of guilt over innocence, he repoſed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence in that Providence in whoſe hand are the iſſues of life and death. Sillery, who had a feeling heart, found devotion the moſt ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuge of affliction. He and La Source com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed together a little hymn adapted to a ſweet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn air, which they called their evening ſervice. Every night before we parted they ſung this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dirge in a low tone to prevent their being heard in the other apartments, which made it ſeem more plaintive. Thoſe mournful ſounds, the knell of my departing friends, yet thrill upon my heart!</p>

            <p>La Source often ſpoke of his wife with tender regret. He had been married only a week, when he was choſen a member of the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and was obliged to haſten to Paris, while his wife remained in Languedoc to take care of an aged mother. When the legiſlative aſſembly was diſſolved, La Source was immediately elected a member of the national convention, and could find no interval in which to viſit his native ſpot, or his wife, whom he ſaw no more. In his meditations on the chain of political events, he mentioned one little incident which ſeemed to hang on his mind with a ſort of ſuperſtitious feeling. A few days after the tenth of Auguſt he dined in the fauxbourg of St. Antoine with ſeveral members of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative aſſembly, who were the moſt diſtinguiſhed for their talents and patriotiſm. They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031634_0028_0FED617707BD7DB8"/>
in the birth of the new republic, and the glorious part they were to act as its founders, when a citizen of the fauxbourg, who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to partake of the repaſt, obſerved, that he feared a different deſtiny awaited them. "As you have been the founders of the republic," ſaid he, "you will alſo be its victims. In a ſhort time you will be obliged to impoſe reſtraints and duties on the people, to whom your enemies and theirs will repreſent you as having overthrown regal power only to eſtabliſh your own. You will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ariſtrocacy; and I foreſee," he added with much perturbation, "that you will all periſh on the ſcaffold." The company ſmiled at his ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: but during the enſuing winter, when the ſtorm was gathering over the political horizon, La Source recalled the prophecy, and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Vergniaud of the man of the fauxbourg St. Antoine. Vergniaud had little heeded the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur; but a few days previous to the 31ſt of May, when the convention was for the firſt time beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, La Source ſaid again to Vergniaud, "Well, what think you of the prophet of the fauxbourg?" "The prophet of the fauxbourg," anſwered Verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaud, "was in the right."</p>
            <p>The morning now arrived when La Source and Sillery, together with nineteen other members of the convention, were led before the revolutionary tribunal. When the guards who were to conduct them arrived, the other priſoners crowded to the public room to ſee them paſs, and we ſhut our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up in our own apartment. They returned about five in the evening; ſoon after which their counſel arrived, and we had no opportunity of ſeeing them till midnight, when they related to us what had paſſed. The conduct of the judges and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031634_0029_0FED616D93F540C0"/>
the aſpect of the jury were calculated to baniſh every gleam of hope from the boſoms of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; the former permitted with reluctance any thing to be urged in their defence, and the latter liſtened with impatience, caſting upon their victims looks of atrocity in which they might eaſily read their fate: yet in ſpite of theſe unhappy omens our friends returned from the tribunal with their minds much elevated. La Source deſcribed in his eloquent language the noble enthuſiaſm of liberty, the ardent love of their country, the heroical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death which animated his colleagues, whom he had not ſeen for ſome time, ſince they had been transferred to the Conciergerie, while himſelf and Sillery had obtained permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the Luxembourg upon the certificates of their phyſicians, that they were too ill to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved without danger. La Source declared that ancient hiſtory offered no model of public virtue beyond that which was exhibited by his friends at the tribunal, and who in their priſon, blending with the fortitude of Romans the gaiety of French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and being confined in one apartment, paſſed the ſhort interval of life which was left in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and cheerful repaſts which were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concluded with patriotic ſongs. "You," ſaid Vergniaud to La Source when they met at the tribunal, "you perhaps will find ſomething to regret in the loſs of life. You have a glimpſe of the gardens of the Luxembourg, which may remind you that there is ſomething beautiful in nature: but we who live in human ſhambles, who every day ſee freſh victims dragged to execution, we are become ſo familiarized with death, that we look on it with unconcern.</p>
            <p>A few days before this ſanguinary trial ended, the adminiſtration of the police ſent orders that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031634_0030_0FED6229DDA660B8"/>
the Engliſh-women confined in the Luxembourg ſhould be removed the next day to a convent in the fauxbourg St. Antoine. With what keen regret La Source and Sillery received this intelligence! A thouſand and a thouſand times they thanked us for the dangers we had riſqued in receiving them, and for the ſympathy which had ſoothed the laſt hours of their exiſtence—a thouſand times they declared, that if it were poſſible their lives might be preſerved, they ſhould conſider themſelves for ever bound to us by the moſt ſacred ties of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and friendſhip: but they felt, alas! how ſmall was the chance that we ſhould meet again in this world. Sillery cut off a lock of his white hairs, which he begged I would preſerve for his ſake, and La Source gave me the ſame relic. They embraced us with much emotion. They prayed that the bleſſing of God might be upon us: we mingled our tears together, and parted to meet no more!—</p>
            <p>Let me, before I conduct you to our new pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, give you a ſhort account of the political events and their cauſes, which, after bringing thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the convention to the ſcaffold who were moſt fitted by their talents to defend liberty, and by their moral qualities to make it beloved, ended in ſuch a ſyſtem of cruelty and crimes, that it can be only by a long perſeverance in public virtue that France can make reparation to humanity, or retrieve her character among the nations.</p>

            <head>LETTER IV.</head>
            <p>THE republican party of the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had, it is well known, very early projected many alterations in the new conſtitution. They had obſerved with great inquietude the changes which had taken place at the cloſe of the firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly, when its labours underwent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion previouſly to the acceptance of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the executive power, and when they found that thoſe who had hitherto been the moſt ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opponents of the court ſuddenly became its moſt zealous advocates and friends.</p>
            <p>Though this party formed the minority of the legiſlative aſſembly, its influence by means of the popular ſocieties was very extenſive. But when the ſtruggle took place between the court and the republican party, both of which were at length agreed in the overthrow of the new conſtitution, with which each was for different reaſons equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſatisfied, the party was joined by many who in this deſtruction of the regal authority had no other end in view than the eſtabliſhment of their own.</p>
            <p>The ſociety of the Jacobins, which had been for a long time the rival and at length the conqueror of the throne, was deſerted immediately after the victory by almoſt all thoſe who had contributed to gain it. They imagined that every domeſtic ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was annihilated when the firſt decree of the convention changed the monarchy into a republic; and though ſymptoms of diſcontent diſcovered themſelves among ſome who thought that the change had been too haſtily decided on, and ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031634_0032_0FED613FC4619118"/>
of a more dangerous and fatal tendency to the welfare of the government had already appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among others, yet thoſe to whom the people had given their confidence were not ſufficiently aware of the inſtability of popular favour, and the precarious tenure by which they held it. The commune of Paris claimed an equal right to ſhare with the Jacobins the honours of the triumph over royalty; but diſſatisfied with the little credit given to the ſervices it had rendered during the ſtruggle, it took advantage of the imbecility of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſembly then expiring, and had already erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf into a rival power before the convention had opened its firſt debates. The pretence of making extraordinary exertions to oppoſe the march of the enemy towards Paris had led the commune, amidſt a multiplicity of other acts of rebellion, to arrogate the functions of the repreſentatives of the people; and having at the fatal period of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of September humbled the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the duſt, they thought that the ſame daring conduct would give them the ſame ſuperiority over the national convention. But in this calculation they were deceived. Robeſpierre and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who had hitherto directed their counſels, now aſpired to higher deſtinies; and, though ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to make the commune an auxiliary in their deſigns, were unwilling that it ſhould become their rival. In the new election of repreſentatives, all thoſe were excluded who had been influenced by the court, or who had oppoſed from purer motives the republican party. Although this party gained a conſiderable reinforcement by the new election, yet the dread of returning royalty, with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the old ſyſtem, had operated ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the minds of the people of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that many deputies were choſen whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031634_0033_0FED618678309908"/>
to this truſt aroſe more from the ſtrength of their lungs than of their talents, and whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues made up in noiſe what they wanted in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; while the ſtill greater dread of the return of thoſe horrors which the commune had juſt been exerciſing had ſo intimidated the citizens of Paris, that a part of their deputation to the convention, at the head of which was Robeſpierre, triumphing over the fears they had excited, took their feats rather as the conquerors than the repreſentatives of the people. The conduct of the officers of the municipality, however, called aloud for puniſhment. It was impoſſible for the convention to ſuffer the crimes they had committed, and the ſtill greater atrocities which they had meditated, to paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. The council-general of the commune were called to the bar, but eſcaped juſtice by diſſembled profeſſions of repentence, and the promiſe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up thoſe who had led them to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch enormities. Had the convention, while its rival was thus ſubdued, proceeded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between thoſe who had been the chiefs of the conſpiracy and thoſe who had been the dupes of their impoſture, they would have done a great act of national juſtice, and would have cruſhed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempts againſt the national honour. But as this humiliation of the commune was a contrivance to eſcape examination, of which the conſpirators who directed its operations, and who had been choſen ſince to the convention, were afraid; the aſſembly, deceived by this artifice, had no ſooner granted the pardon they implored, than the faction, emboldened by impunity, perceived that with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity and preſeverance they might yet attain the end to which they aſpired. While Robeſpierre ſat in the commune, his object was probably to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031634_0034_0FED62002D4F80A8"/>
frame a government of municipalities, of which Paris was to be the chief, and himſelf the dictator: but his enterpriſe being encompaſſed with difficulty, ſince the people had determined to have a national convention, he afterwards changed his meaſures, and began to meditate a plan of making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention itſelf, of which he was now a member, ſerve as the inſtrument of his uſurpation.</p>
            <p>With this view, he and his diſorganizing faction in the convention aſſumed the direction of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipality; and as the ſociety of the Jacobins was deſerted by the republicans, who thought its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices no longer neceſſary, the name and the place were ſeized on by the conſpirators, and filled with intriguing and ambitious men, whoſe hopes of ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the plunder or the power induced them to become accomplices in the guilt.</p>
            <p>While the municipality laboured to win over the ſections of Paris, the Jacobins made proſelytes to their ſyſtem of anarchy by their affiliations and correſpondence in the departments; and before the exiſting government was fully aware of the extent of the conſpiracy, or could collect ſufficient ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to counteract it, the faction had gained a moſt alarming aſcendency; and although they formed a very ſmall minority in the convention, their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both in the executive part of the government and amongſt the conſtituted authorities was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to outweigh that of the repreſentation itſelf. Every conceſſion made to the conſpirators ſerved only to increaſe the inſolence of their demands; and although the moſt eloquent members of the convention, Guadet, Vergniaud, Pethion, Louvet, Briſſot and La Source gave inceſſant warnings of the progreſs of the anarchiſts towards the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all order in the ſtate, yet like Caſſandra

                  </gap> La Source, "There exiſts a faction, which ſeeks to cruſh the convention and raiſe the dictatorſhip on its ruins. This is the faction which has iſſued its arbitrary mandates, which has ordered the arreſt of eight of my colleagues who ſat in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſembly, which has paid robbers to plunder and aſſaſſins to murder, and which has had the audacity to lay to the charge of the people the crimes which itſelf has perpetrated. Were I in going from this place to fall under the poniards of theſe traitors, I ſhould die ſatisfied in having lifted up the veil which conceals them: a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer and I will unmaſk them altogether." Guadet often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed the conſpiracy of the Jacobins and the municipality, and, with burſts of honeſt indignation againſt theſe ſhameleſs traitors, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the convention to ſave the republic by diſſolving the ſociety and re-electing the commune. Vergniaud with more than uſual eloquence pourtrayed the conſpirators. Louvet gave a clear and admirable detail of their attempts to aſſaſſinate the convention in the conſpiracy of 10th of March; and Briſſot unveiled their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not only in the convention and in his journal, but in different publications, of which his addreſs to his conſtituents publiſhed in May 1794 will furniſh intereſting matter for hiſtory.</note>.</p>
            <p>However criminal this band of conſpirators, who have exerciſed a deſpotiſm more hideous than hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has ever preſented, may appear, or whatever be the regrets we feel for thoſe virtuous friends of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty who fell the victims of their rage, the hiſtorian, more impartial than the friend, will not fail to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert on the negligence of which in ſome inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they were guilty, and above all in careleſsly throwing aſide, by the deſertion of the Jacobin ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the means which they had obtained of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public mind and directing its will.</p>
            <p>But before we carry our cenſures too far, we muſt recollect that they had to contend againſt men hardened in crimes and inacceſſible to ſhame, who found refuge from the detection of their guilt in the protection of their party, and who returned the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the patriots in the convention by their noiſy vociferations at the Jacobins and the commune.</p>

The firſt attempt made on the national repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the commune of Paris and the Jacobins, ought to have been puniſhed as an act of rebellion againſt the ſovereignty of the people. But an ill-judged application of the principles of individual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, a too delicate regard for the rights of perſons, led on the majority of the convention to the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offences, of which they took no meaſures to ſtop the progreſs, till the conſpiracy had acquired ſuch ſtrength as made every exertion againſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
            <p>The treaſon of Dumourier had furniſhed the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with new reſources for calumny againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican party, with ſome of whom he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been connected: for, as the faction was in the conſtant habit of denouncing indiſcriminately every agent of the republic, the completion of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy gave an air of credit to the reſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The conſpirators accuſed the republicans of being accomplices in Dumourier's treaſon; the republicans have retorted the charge on ſome of their adverſaries with the moſt unqueſtionable evidence. But we need not here recur to conſpiracies either of Jacobins or Girondiſts to diſcern the motives of Dumourier's conduct. He has endeavoured to explain it himſelf in his memoirs; to which if any credit ought to be given, the Girondiſts will be abſolved from all ſhare in his treaſon. But their innocence in this reſpect, as well as their political integrity in every other, is now eſtabliſhed beyond the reach of calumny and detraction.</note>. Although the conſpirators had acquired conſiderable influence from the aſſiſtance given them by the commune and the Jacobins, they perceived that the object which they had in view, would never fully be attained till they had gained ſo abſolute a controul over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as to make it, like the ancient parliaments, the regiſters of their imperial edicts. To this end all their efforts were directed: but while thoſe men ſtill ſat within its walls whoſe virtue and eloquence had hitherto warded off the blow which menaced
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031634_0037_0FED62334A17DCC0"/>
their country, there was little hope of ſucceſs. The prize ſet before theſe traitors was too great to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to heſitate about the means of ſeizing it; and having thrown aſide all regard to the laws, all reſpect for individual or political liberty, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the project of violating the national repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation itſelf, and tearing from it the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and intrepid defenders of its rights. To car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their plot into execution, it was neceſſary to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it with the veil of the wiſh of the people, of whom a few hired deſperadoes and other ignorant and ſeduced perſons became the repreſentatives, bearing petitions written by the conſpirators themſelves, praying the convention to drive from their ſeats a certain number whom they marked as unworthy of their confidence or that of the nation. The indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the convention being rouſed at theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, they inſtituted a commiſſion of enquiry to ſearch into the cauſes of this conſpiracy. This commiſſion, in purſuance of the powers it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, after mature examination, arreſted Hebert, one of the municipal chiefs, and gave notice to the convention that they were prepared to make their report. The conſpirators ſeeing that their crimes were on the point of being brought to light, the diſcovery of which would annihilate their project, threw off the maſk, and brought forward the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of Paris to demand not only the diſmiſſion of the commiſſion which the convention had created, but the arreſtation of the members who compoſed it, together with the twenty-two deputies of the convention the moſt eminent for their virtue and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. The convention for ſeveral days withſtood every effort that was made to ſhake its firmneſs. The preſident Iſnard, with all the warmth of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt indignation, threatened in the name of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public the liberticide factioners of the commune,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031634_0038_0FED618A58E8D0D8"/>
that if they dared to proceed to the execution of thoſe deſigns which their preſent meaſures indicated, if the national repreſentation ſhould be violated by any of thoſe conſpiracies of which they had been the accomplices, that Paris ſhould be blotted out from the reſt of its cities, and that the traveller ſhould wander on the banks of the Seine enquiring where it once ſtood.</p>
            <p>The chiefs of the conſpiracy had proceeded too far to be ſtopped in their career by ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe; but they found more intrepidity and firmneſs in the convention than they expected, and therefore determined to employ their laſt expedient. The ringing of the tocſin and the firing of alarm guns had excited the attention of the citizens of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris for two days, when on the third the beating to arms informed them that they were going to be put into inſurrection. The national guard being thus put into inſurrection, the cauſe of which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the whole body were conducted to the hall of the convention, where Henriot the commander of the military force, who had been created by the conſpirators for that purpoſe, had ordered them to aſſemble. The convention was ſurrounded till nearly midnight by the military force, nor was any member permitted to leave the hall; but although beſieged, the aſſembly was not yet conquered. The day paſſed in the moſt frightful tumult, and Rabaut de St. Etienne in vain ſtood at the tribune, holding in his hand the report of the commiſſion of twelve upon the conſpiracy of the commune, together with the proofs of its authenticity. His voice was loſt in the horrible vociferations of the tribunes, and the murmurs of the faction within the hall. At length finding all his efforts ineffectual, he left the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:031634_0039_0FED61CF76EC39F8"/>
The aſſault of the convention on the 31ſt of May, though it had produced the moſt horrible diſorder, had not forced from the aſſembly the decree of arreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But Robeſpierre with his commune, his Jacobins, and his body guard of revolutionary wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were in the van of the attack, and ſtood in the paſſages of the convention armed with poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, which they pointed at the boſoms of ſuch of the deputies as attempted to leave the hall, had gone too far to recede. The firſt of June they employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in preparations for a freſh attack; and on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond again the tocſin rung, again the whole city was under arms, and the convention was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted by ſixty thouſand men.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that all the adherents of the conſpirators, or rather the different factions in league with them, were acquainted with all the means which Robeſpierre, Marat, and the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, the original authors of the plot, meant to employ. La Croix, a member of the mountain, who had been repulſed in endeavouring to go out of the hall, proteſted with vehemence againſt this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their liberties; and when Henriot, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving orders from the preſident to draw off his troops, replied, that as ſoon as he had executed the orders of the people he would obey thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and threatened that if they refuſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up to juſtice the twenty-two deputies whom he called traitors, he would order the cannon to be ſired on the hall; Danton with great indignation imprecated vengeance on the head of the ruffian, which ſome months after, at the period of his own fall, was in the act of accuſation alleged againſt him as a crime. In vain did the convention, partaking Danton's indignation, hope to obtain their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by decreeing that the officers of the poſt next the entrance of the hall ſhould be called to the bar.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031634_0040_0FED61D23543B248"/>
Two of them had received no orders, and a third informed them that he was himſelf conſigned by a few ſtrangers who did not appear to him acquainted even with military forms. Theſe ſtrangers were ordered to the bar; but they refuſed to attend: and thus this aſſembly, which talked of nothing leſs than bringing princes and kings in chains to their feet, were made priſoners in their very ſanctuary by a few hirelings, of whom no other deſcription was given than that they were ſtrangers and wore muſtaches. This was an indignity not to be borne. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, therefore, propoſed that the aſſembly in a body ſhould go out of the hall: this was decreed, and the ſentinels ſeeing themſelves likely to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered gave way. The deputies paraded in the garden, expecting every moment to be maſſacred; but the conſpirators who directed their motions led them back again to the hall, obſerving that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, after ſo ſtriking a proof, could have no doubt of their being at liberty.</p>
            <p>Previouſly to this mock parade, Barrere, who had been weighing the probabilities of ſucceſs on either ſide, and examining which party would have the aſcendency, at length invited the proſcribed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, for the ſake of peace and for the good of the ſtate, to ſubmit, and devote themſelves to their country. To this admonition three of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded; but Barbaroux aſſerted, that he had no right to give in his diſmiſſion, nor could he obey any other mandate than that of the people, who having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him with the power had alone the right to take it from him. With more vehemence Lanjui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais exclaimed, that he would remain at his poſt to his lateſt breath, or till he was torn from it by force. His intrepidity provoked the conſpirators to rage and tumult. "Citizens," ſaid he, "we have beheld in barbarous countries the people leading hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031634_0041_0FED61AFE69DA2A8"/>
victims to the altar, after crowning them with flowers; but we never heard, that the prieſts who were about to ſacrifice them treated them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. I repeat, that I have no right to lay aſide the auguſt character with which the people have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; therefore, expect from me neither ſelf-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor voluntary ſuſpenſion for a moment." This courageous reply to their fury appalled the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; and had Vergniaud, Rabaut, Briſſot, and others whoſe names were in the conſpirators' liſt, been then at their poſt, had they ſeconded their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed colleagues at this critical moment with the thunder of their eloquence, the project of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators might eaſily have been defeated, and they might have ſaved both themſelves and the republic. While the conſpirators were perpetrating this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable deed, they were deliberating in the houſe of Gaudet about the means that ſhould be taken to avoid it, and deceived by a report which a friend unhappily ill-informed conveyed to them, that the blood of their colleagues was flowing; and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be too late to make any further ſtruggle, they ſuffered the decree of arreſtation to be carried without oppoſition<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Louvet relates the following ſingular anecdote: "We began to breathe again, when a man of Bourdeaux, who had been made priſoner at the battle of Nerwinden, and afterwards exchanged, related to Gaudet, his friend, that having had an opportunity of forming an intimate acquaintance with one of the officers of the Imperial army, he had learned from him that Cobourg's ſtaff-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers flattered themſelves that in a ſhort ſpace of time <hi>twenty-two beads</hi> would fall in the convention. Gaudet related to me this anecdote, with which we amuſed ourſelves; but judge of our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and the reflections to which it gave riſe, when ſome time after M. Pache came at the head of the pretended ſections of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, to preſent the famous petition which proſcribed twenty-two deputies.</p>
                  <p>"It is important to obſerve, that this firſt liſt of proſcription having been compoſed of <hi>twenty-two</hi> members, the ſecond liſt, brought ſome weeks after to the convention by the municipal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and adminiſtrators of Paris, was ſtill <hi>twenty-two,</hi> though all the names were not the ſame. At the time when the decree of accuſation paſſed, Marat made ſome changes by his own ſovereign authority. He took away ſome names, that of Lanthenas for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but he took care to replace them by others, and mark well, in equal number, ſo that the proſcribed were always <hi>twenty-two.</hi> Laſtly, when after the taking of Lyons the trial of the republican deputies came on, Pethion, Buzot, Gaudet, Salles, Valady, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroux, and myſelf were not in their hands. The liſt might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have been reduced a third; nevertheleſs it was ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and the victims led to the ſcaffold were, if not <hi>twenty-two,</hi> at leaſt <hi>twenty-one.</hi> This ſtrange identity of numbers, at four different periods, gave reaſon to preſume that the number of <hi>twenty-two</hi> heads, and always the ſame number, was what the <hi>mountain</hi> agreed to furniſh according to one of its private articles in its treaty with the coaleſced powers."</p>

Had the convention, when Henriot ſent them his mandate, ordered him to be inſtantly put to death, their orders, if they could have been promulgated out of the precincts of the hall, would undoubtedly have been obeyed; but the conſpirators had taken meaſures to prevent any ſuch tranſmiſſion, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning every officer to his poſt, by filling up every avenue with their agents, who had received orders to ſuffer no communication between the hall and the court or garden, and alſo by cloſing the gates of the latter, ſo that the people in general knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was paſſing.</p>
            <p>With many others I ſaw parts of the execution of this conſpiracy. I ſaw the armed force ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hall, but was ignorant, like the reſt, of what was paſſing within. I beheld from a window that overlooked the Tuilleries the convention in full proceſſion; but I could not account for this ſingular parade, nor was it till midnight that I learned the hiſtory of the day, which ſome of the deputies related to us; among whom was Barrere, who with eyes full of tears lamented to us the fate of his friends, and the total ruin of the republic—that

            <p>Liberty, however, did not ſee her principles and rights abandoned with impunity, but has been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly avenged. From that fatal decree may be dated all the horrors which have caſt their ſanguinary cloud over the glories of the revolution, which have given ſtrength to deſpots and arguments to ſlaves. The national convention has beheld its members dragged in ſucceſſive multitudes to the ſcaffold. The Pariſian guard, who ſubmitted to become the paſſive inſtruments of this atrocious faction; the citizens of Paris, who bent their necks tamely to the yoke; the departments, who, when they afterwards accepted the conſtitution, had the baſeneſs to make no conditions for their impriſoned repreſentatives: have ſeen their fellow-citizens, their friends, their relations, led to death, their property violated, all ſocial ties ſhaken, virtue every where depreſſed, vice every where trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and their country one wide ſcene of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, of which the long page of hiſtory preſents no ſimilar picture, even in the proſcriptions of Sylla or the caprices of Caligula<note n="*" place="bottom">Louvet, in his intereſting note, ſays: "On the 20th of May another plot was to have been executed againſt the republicans of the convention.

            <p>The tidings of the inſurrection in Paris occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much fermentation in the departments, who were expected to have demanded of the Pariſians, in a manner more ſerious than by addreſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, why the repreſentatives whom they
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031634_0045_0FED6207006E2B20"/>
had committed to their reſpect and protection were retained as priſoners and regarded as traitors. The Pariſians, who had been altogether paſſive during this ſtruggle, were not much moved by theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces. They had beheld with indifference the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the conteſt. Finding themſelves delivered from the oppreſſion of the former government; concluding that no tyrant exiſted except ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This fatal error has been the ſource of almoſt all the evils that have deſolated the republic; for had the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians attended to the political duties that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them in exchange for their enjoyment of political rights, they would never have ſeen their fellow-citizens dragged daily through their ſtreets to the ſcaffold, at the nod of tyrants whom they ought early to have cruſhed.</p>
            <p>During the progreſs of this conſpiracy, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the ſections where the citizens met to deliberate on public affairs, were either filled by the agents of the conſpirators, or governed by the conſpirators themſelves; and where neither of them had weight ſufficient to miſlead the citizens, they took advantage of their departure to propoſe and carry reſolutions among themſelves, which they proclaimed as the voice of the ſection. Though theſe practices were denounced in the convention, and though ſometimes the ſection of to-day came to diſclaim what the ſame ſection of yeſterday had ſaid, yet the diſcovery of the fraud had no tendency to awaken the citizens to greater vigilance. Had they known to what end all the artifices of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators tended, they would undoubtedly have been on their guard; but as they were made to ſerve the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031634_0046_0FED616BE3B649C8"/>
views of the traitors in demanding the expulſion of their repreſentatives, without believing that they had committed any crime; ſo they were alſo made the inſtruments of conſummating the treaſon by aſſiſting in the violation of the repreſentation itſelf in the arbitrary arreſt of the deputies, without knowing for what reaſon they were armed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. A long and mournful experience has at length ſhewn them, that it is not ſufficient to feel the love of liberty without making continual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to preſerve it; that ſo many and various are the enemies which it has to combat before its reign can be permanently eſtabliſhed, that as much vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance is required to guard it from the inroads of the aſpiring demagogue, as courage to ſhake off the yoke of deſpotiſm; and that when the ſacred code of freedom is violated in one point it leads to the deſtruction of the whole. When the nobles whom the law had confounded in the claſs of citizens were perſecuted as a <hi>caſt,</hi> when men of ſuperior abilities became proſcribed for "ariſtocracy of talents," thoſe who were diſtinguiſhed for neither deceived themſelves in believing they were ſafe.</p>
            <p>Although the citizens remained unmoved at theſe violations, a conſiderable number of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments felt the indignity, and prepared to avenge the national honour. Some made eloquent remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances at the bar of the convention; ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated on the convocation of the primary aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; ſome propoſed ſending no farther contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Paris, while others took arms to ſuppreſs the rebellion of the commune againſt the republic. For ſome time the arrival of the departmental force was expected; but the conſpirators, who foreſaw this formidable oppoſition to the accompliſhment of their deſigns, had the prudence to provide againſt it by ſending previouſly into the departments as
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031634_0047_0FED6198179742C8"/>
many of their emiſſaries as they could ſpare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakening their force at home, taken partly from among their accomplices in the convention, who carried with them the importance of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people.</p>
            <p>The conſpirators had alſo the advantage of being inveſted with the authority of government, as they had ſeized on the machine. They had poſſeſſion of the convention, who were compelled to follow the impulſe already given them; they were propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of the national wealth, and had the armies at their command. The departments, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, had no central point of union except the common indignation which the conduct of the conſpirators had excited. They had no treaſure at their diſpoſal but what aroſe from voluntary contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions; and while they were deliberating what ſteps they ſhould purſue, the conſpirators, clothed with the national power which they had uſurped, reduced the departments to the ſame ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as they had the convention and Paris. In the weſtern departments, where ſome of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who were accuſed had fled, and around whom the people had crowded partaking their indignation, the armies that had haſtily aſſembled as ſuddenly diſappeared; and the whole of the republic except the city of Lyons ſubmitted to the yoke. The cauſes of this defection, which have hitherto been involved in obſcurity, it being the intereſt of the conſpirators to keep them concealed from the world, have lately been developed by one of the principal actors in thoſe memorable ſcenes, Louvet, deputy of the department of the Loiret, who diſtinguiſhed himſelf early in the convention by his accuſation of Robeſpierre, who unmaſked the conſpiracy of the 10th of March, and who o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They had juſt ſent their commiſſaries to Caen, and their troops were at the point of arriving. Wimpfen the general of the whole force, had hitherto confined all his exploits to travelling about and talking, and under the moſt frivolous pretences delayed every kind of organiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As ſoon as I ſaw him I was convinced that he was a determined royaliſt, for he took no pains to conceal it. I aſked Barbaroux and Buzot what they could expect from ſuch a man, for the ſupport of our cauſe. One of them anſwered me, that Wimpfen was a man of honour, and incapable of breaking his engagements, and the other was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together captivated by his agreeable manners. Gaudet and Pethion, who had juſt arrived, did not feel my apprehenſions. They were aſtoniſhed at my readineſs in ſuſpecting every one that was not as much a republican as myſelf. From that time I ſaw that every thing was going the ſame way at Caen as it had done at Paris. Wimpfen was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the Normans; he had a conſiderable party among the adminiſtrators of Calvados, and had gained the confidence of the Bretons. In order to take the command from him, it was neceſſary to unite and make uſe of all our exertions; but I found myſelf altogether unſupported. Every thing therefore was likely to fail on the ſide of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Beſides, many Normans, who ſhewed the moſt favourable diſpoſitions towards us, becauſe in the credit of the news-papers they believed us to be royaliſts, changed their conduct in the moſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031634_0049_0FED61EA1E9B4420"/>
pointed manner when by our converſation, and particularly by our actions, they came to know us better. My firſt hopes were directed therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouth. If my wife had been at Caen, we ſhould have gone aboard ſome veſſel at Hon-fleur bound to Bourdeaux; and as it would have been very eaſy for us to have ſeen whether things went no better there than elſewhere, we ſhould have taken our paſſage aboard the firſt American veſſel, and have been at this time ſafe in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>
            <p>"Three weeks elapſed, while Wimpfen did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lead to Evreux the two thouſand men who had come up from the different departments. In the mean time report had ſo ſwelled this little troop, that it was ſaid at Paris to be thirty thouſand ſtrong. At this period, the patriots there had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from their fears, ſpoke their opinions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, and were preparing to overthrow the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble municipality. Many ſections had already ſent their commiſſaries to Evreux, who had carried back to Paris different publications explanatory of our true ſentiments, and particularly a piece which they called, but I know not for what reaſon, Wimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen's Manifeſto, and which was a declaration of the commiſſaries of the united departments; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which I had compoſed with great labour, which breathed only peace, fraternity and aſſiſtance to the Pariſians, but open war and exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſome of the mountain, to the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and the cordeliers; and this juſt diſtinction had produced the beſt poſſible effect in Paris. The commiſſaries beſides had ſeen and borne their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies againſt the baſe calumnies which had been uttered againſt this departmental army, when it was accuſed of having worn the white cockade, and expreſſed its wiſh for royalty. Every thing in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031634_0050_0FED623BA4F67E70"/>
ſhort was ſo diſpoſed, that if, at this moment, our arms had met but with the ſlighteſt ſucceſs, the revolution would have been effected in Paris, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interpoſition of the departmental army; but it was not in this kind of ſucceſs that Wimpfen was intereſted.</p>
            <p>"The mountain under great apprehenſions had at length raiſed in Paris 1800 foot ſoldiers, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half of which were praying for our ſucceſs, and alſo ſeven or eight hundred ruffians as cowardly as they were thieviſh: this collection had juſt entered Vernon. Then it was that Wimpfen talked of attacking this town; and here ſuddenly a Mr. Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, of whom we had never heard, was introduced to us by the general, as an officer full of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm and knowledge. He it was whom Wimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen ordered to attack Vernon, and certainly he very well obeyed his ſecret inſtructions.</p>
            <p>"In order to ſurpriſe the enemy, he went out in open day with drums beating. He marched dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extreme heat, and then made his ſoldiers, who had no tents, and who for the greater part had never been in a camp, paſs the night in the open air. He loſt the whole of the following day in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking a ſmall caſtle, which he had the honour of taking. The enemy having by this time been well and duly informed of all his manoeuvres, he, in order to give them ſtill greater advantage, made his troops halt at the entrance of a wood a league diſtant from Vernon; placed his cannon one piece behind the other along a wall; left all his little army in the greateſt diſorder; did not even place ſentinels; and went to ſleep at a cottage at half a league from the place. An hour after, a few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men ſuddenly made their appearance, who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed our men and fired three rounds of grape ſhot; but the guns in all probability were charged only
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031634_0051_0FED6160E2C50BF8"/>
with powder, for there is no doubt that it was but a farce well arranged. However that may be, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, not a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſlighteſt wound: the enemy did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thirty ſteps to follow up their eaſy victory. This adventure did not hinder Mr. Puyſay, whom the adminiſtration of the department of the Eure entreated not to abandon them, from declaring that Evreux was not tenable; and in reality the next day he withdrew himſelf ſixteen leagues, without ſtriking a blow, and abandoned a whole depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the enemy.</p>
            <p>"On the arrival of the courier who brought us theſe ſad tidings, Wimpfen did not appear at all diſconcerted. He moreover aſſured us that there was nothing unfortunate in this event: he talked of fortifying Caen, of declaring the city in a ſtate of defence, of organizing an army ſomewhat ſtronger, and of making paper-money which ſhould be current throughout the ſeven united depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>"Theſe obſervations afforded room for deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. Salles and myſelf, after having a long time converſed on the ſubject, were convinced that the general, ſo far from wiſhing to march to Paris, intended to keep us ſhut up with him in the city, where his party was prevalent, to eſtabliſh a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with England, and to commit us with that power if it were poſſible; in fine, to make uſe

of us according to circumſtances, either to make his peace with the mountain if the coalition of the ſouthern departments ſhould be diſſolved, or make his peace with the republicans if they ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the mountain. Our colleagues, to whom we communicated our ſuſpicions, thought us viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, and nothing leſs was neceſſary to convince them than what happened ſoon after.</p>
            <p>"The general requeſted to have a conference with all of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

He was going to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux to organiſe his army, and to form his camp in ſuch a manner as to make at leaſt for ſome time a proper defence. The future, however, required ſomething more permanent. He returned back to his projects reſpecting Caen, to his propoſals about the creation of paper-money, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and as he judged it neceſſary to ſupport his reaſoning by terror, though he ought to have known that ſuch a mode of proceeding would have little influence on men accuſtomed to brave daily the fury and the murders of the mountain, an officer, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had been inſtructed, ſuddenly entered, and with a frightened look informed the general that there was a riot; that the people had arreſted the convoys going to the army; and that they were making violent motions againſt the deputies. Wimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen affected to be angry at the precipitation with which he told him this alarming news. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaid he to the officer; go and talk calmly to the people, make them eaſy; give them a little money, if it be neceſſary. When this man left us, the general thought he might venture to make the great propoſition. Reflect maturely on all that I have ſaid, reſumed he: in order to execute great
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031634_0053_0FED6155EAAA16B0"/>
projects we muſt employ great means. But ſtay, I am going to ſpeak plainly: I ſee only one poſſible mode of providing ourſelves with men, arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, money, and help of every kind; <hi>that is, to negociate with England; and I myſelf have the means provided, but I muſt have your authority, your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</hi>

            <p>"The reader may be aſſured that I have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recollection of the lines I have written in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and I can alſo aſſure him that I have ſtated truly the ſcene of the preceding paſſage. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to paint the effect which theſe words produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on my too confiding friends. All of them at the ſame moment, ſtruck with indignation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous conſultation roſe up. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was inſtantly interrupted, though the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tried every means of renewing it.</p>
            <p>"Wimpfen, ſomewhat diſconcerted, left us without ſeeming to feel any reſentment. He only repeated to us that he was going to Liſieux, and inſinuated, that in order to reſtrain ſome malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent people who were endeavouring in Caen to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us unpopular, we ſhould all do better to remain in that place. I think that every perſon muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the infamous ſnare into which this worthy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the mountain wiſhed to draw us. Had fear or the deſire of vengeance prompted us to accede to this propoſition, the republic would have been loſt as well as our honour. The mountain would have had victorious proofs againſt us. It would have been they who were republicans, we that were royaliſts; and all the republicans perſecuted for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing royaliſts, would have been arreſted, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and guillotined. Our conſpiracy, they would have ſaid, extended to the ſouth. It would have been we, and not themſelves, who delivered Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon to the Engliſh. I know, indeed, that after
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031634_0054_0FED62256449A470"/>
their terrible triumphs they did not fail to make ſuch aſſertions; but they found no honeſt or enlightened man who gave them credit. They were, therefore, driven to their accuſation of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſm; an accuſation not leſs abſurd and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>"The next day Barbaroux and myſelf went to Liſieux. The general was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to ſee us, but he did not receive us with leſs courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. We learned, what he himſelf took care not to inform us, that he had juſt had a ſecret conference with one of the agents of the chiefs of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who for three weeks paſt were throwing away handfuls of aſſignats at Evreux, and every where on their paſſage; and who, ſoon after, probably ſure of powerful ſupport, came with the intention of continuing the ſame plan of corruption at Caen, even under our eyes. We found at Liſieux many people in arms, but no ſoldiers, no organization, no diſcipline, and the rage of making motions. A ſecret hand in a ſingle day diſorganized even the <hi>Breton</hi> battalions which had hitherto been firmly united. The general was at pains to make us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this diſorder, and to lead us to conclude from thence that he could not maintain his poſition there, but that he muſt march back with all his troops to Caen, and make this city the central point of reſiſtance, &amp;c. He nevertheleſs avoided repeating to us his Engliſh prepoſitions. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the retreat took place the following day: all my friends then acknowledged that our affairs were ruined in the weſtern departments. In vain did the general, after having gone back to Caen, where he was always deſirous of eſtabliſhing himſelf, ſhew diſpoſitions for a ſerious defence. In vain did he create ſtaff officers, arrange his troops, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf in ſearching for a convenient ſituation
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031634_0055_0FED617B75576928"/>
for encampment, eſtabliſh batteries of eighteen-pounders; all this parade no longer impoſed on our colleagues.</p>
            <p>"It appears clear, that Wimpfen, the evening before, had given notice by one of the couriers of the committee of public ſafety, to the mountain; and I hope that I am underſtood, when I ſay the mountain, that is not of the whole body, nor even all its leaders, that I ſpeak, but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>cordelier</hi> of the mountain, ſuch as La Croix, Fabre d'Eglantine, and, who were equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and ſhifting between the republicans, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thion, Guadet, &amp;c. and the dictator Robeſpierre—that Wimpfen had given information of the bad ſucceſs of his Engliſh overtures, and that it was uſeleſs to renew the propoſition. It alſo appears that the mountain then determined to diſperſe our little band, but without neglecting to throw on our party that colouring of royaliſm which was ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to effect our ruin; and it was without doubt at this period only that they determined to deliver, at leaſt to all appearance, Toulon to the Engliſh. What I am now ſaying will poſſibly aſtoniſh every one who is not well informed as to this buſineſs; but when the proper time ſhall come, I will explain myſelf fully with reſpect to this terrible farce of Toulon.</p>
            <p>"It is thought that Wimpfen had a ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from the mountain, and a ready opportunity of going into England; but I know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of Mr. Puyſay, who ſuffered himſelf to be ſo complaiſantly beaten at Vernon. The adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Calvados had given notice to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of their ſhameful defection. They had ſecretly made their peace with the mountain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving us any information. The third day on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they made it known to us; and the method
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031634_0056_0FED616551DA01E0"/>
they took was to ſend and poſt up at the gate of the <hi>intendance,</hi> where we lodged, the mountain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card, in which was the decree of our being out of the law."</p>
            <p>The counterpart of the ſcene acted at Paris, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſpirators and the convention, was attempted at Lyons, and the ſame day was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both cities for the accompliſhment of their purpoſe. At the head of this provincial conſpiracy was a man named Chalier, a Piedmonteſe by birth (for moſt of the agents of the conſpirators were foreigners) and a ſharper by profeſſion, having fled his own country on account of having committed fraudulent bankruptcies. He was ſent to Lyons by the commune of Paris, after the maſſacre of September, and opened his miſſion by the murder of nine perſons who had been committed to priſon by the municipality of Lyons for ſlight offences. Agreeably to the inſtructions he had received, and in conformity to the general plan which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of Paris and the conſpirators had formed, their apoſtle laboured inceſſantly to propagate the doctrines of robbery, rebellion and murder. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe exhortations had been attended with their due effects in Paris, "the needy villain's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral home," where the promiſe of riches without labour had allured all the idle and profligate to the ſtandard of the conſpirators, he was diſappointed that more proſelytes to this ſeducing ſyſtem had not honoured his embaſſy at Lyons, where ſociety was leſs diſunited, and where induſtry had eſtabliſhed a ſuperſtitious regard to property, altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Chalier's ſyſtem of reform. A few, however, he found who liſtened to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to thoſe he communicated his plan of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which conſiſted in placing a guillotine the following day on one of the bridges, where all
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031634_0057_0FED615A56B6A6C8"/>
the capital merchants, who were neceſſarily ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats, were to be executed, and their bodies thrown into the Rhone. Though this ſecret was imparted under the ſolemnity of an oath, yet there were ſome who touched with remorſe gave private notice of it to the citizens, who took meaſures to prevent its execution.</p>
            <p>Chalier, who ought inſtantly to have been put to death by the juſt indignation of the people, was ſuffered to continue his revolutionary projects, to the great annoyance of the wealthy citizens, againſt whom his attacks were continually directed. By perſeverance he had at length formed a ſet out of the profligate which are to be found in all large communities, and with their aid he was encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attempt once more the accompliſhment of his deſigns.</p>
            <p>He had been appointed procurer of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune; and as the municipality were compoſed of Jacobins, and of others as weak as thoſe were wicked, Chalier, ſupported by the faction of Paris, became its principal director. Knowing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the conſpiracy in that city, he prepared his friends for the ſame events at Lyons, by declaring openly in the popular ſociety on the 27th of May, that the preſidents and ſecretaries of the ſections, together with the rich <hi>egotiſts,</hi> ſhould be beheaded on the following day. The municipality on the 26th, influenced by Chalier, had levied a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary tax of ſix millions of livres on the rich, to be paid in twenty-four hours. This municipal le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy excited murmurs as was expected, and gave the anarchiſts pretences for raiſing tumults. The rich were deſtined to be the victims, and Chalier's band prepared themſelves to be the executioners. But the Lyonnais might have cruſhed this inſurrection in its birth, had not the narrow ſpirit of traffic,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031634_0058_0FED61416E9435A8"/>
which ſees nothing beneficial in ſociety except the accumulation of wealth, made them feel that their country was but a ſecondary object, and fitted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to employ the attention of thoſe whoſe time was of leſs mercantile profit than their own.</p>
            <p>Appriſed of the intentions of the conſpirators, who had made out the liſt of the proſcriptions, and arranged the plan of the maſſacre, the citizens flew to arms, and ſeized on the arſenal. The conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors kept poſſeſſion of the town-hall, and both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prepared for action; for Lyons now conſiſted only of thoſe who intended to murder, and thoſe who did not like to be murdered. The combat was vigorouſly ſupported on both ſides; for the conſpirators were aided by a party of military whom they had previouſly engaged in their intereſts. Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory remained doubtful for a long time, as the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was fought in the ſtreets of the city, one quarter being in the poſſeſſion of the conſpirators, while the republicans were maſters of the other. It was not till midnight that the citizens took the town-hall, which was the head quarters of Chalier's party. This event decided the conteſt, which had been ſevere and bloody. The conſpirators were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and their chief, after a long and formal trial, was condemned by the tribunal to death. Had the ſame reſiſtance been made to oppreſſion in other communes, that of Paris would have been compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſubmit to the general will; but as the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had declined the conteſt, Lyons was left to withſtand alone all the reſentment of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and was beſieged a few weeks after this period.</p>

            <p>THE chief point of accuſation againſt the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who were arreſted on the ſecond of June, was the continual oppoſition which they were accuſed of having made to the formation of a republican con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. This calumny was contradicted by the fact; the proſcribed deputies having, after the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſome months, preſented a plan of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the convention, which had been publiſhed by its order; but of which it was a part of the conſpirators' plan to interrupt and prevent the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>
            <p>As many believed that a conſtitution was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for every evil, moral and political, and even phyſical, that afflicted the ſtate; and that, when once prepared and adminiſtered, all its maladies would be cured; ſome of the departments were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed by the aſſurance that their preſent rulers would give them in a fortnight what they were made to believe their predeceſſors had ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
            <p>The appearance of this conſtitution within the appointed time tended greatly to allay the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and gave an air of popularity to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the conſpirators; for, as long as the people obtained the bleſſing, they were indifferent from what hand they received it. They were little aware of the purpoſes of their tyrants, who only giving them one ſhort glimpſe of this wiſhed-for conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having obtained their ſanction of it, threw it aſide, locked up this hallowed book of the law, ſhrowded with a dark veil the tables of the rights of man, and boldly proclaimed a new-invented ſpecies
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031634_0060_0FED623E6C975C08"/>
of tyranny, under the denomination of revolutionary government. That epithet has ſince juſtified every enormity, warranted the violation of every princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and theft and pillagè, noyades and fuſilades have all received the common appellation of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary meaſures.</p>
            <p>What contributed alſo to diſſipate the ſtorm that was going to be poured on Paris, was the dread which the departments themſelves had of extending the civil war, which then raged in the country ſouth of the Loire, when there was a poſſibility of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by milder means the objects they had in view, the re-eſtabliſhment of their repreſentatives, and confining the extravagant power of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of Paris within its juſt bounds. What alſo miſled them was, the ſubjection to which Paris itſelf was reduced, and which, deceived by addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the convention and the commune, they miſtook for the enjoyment of tranquillity; and what finiſhed the conteſt was the thunder of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hurled againſt the departments which had ſhewn moſt zeal in favour of the impriſoned deputies, the conſtituted powers of which were diſſolved by the convention, and its members declared guilty of acts of rebellion. It was fortunate for the uſurpers, that this almoſt general and ſpeedy acquieſcence took place; as, independently of the coaleſced pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they had a moſt formidable enemy to contend with in the royaliſts of the Vendée, who, while theſe ſtruggles for power convulſed Paris, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing a force that, but for the invincible ſpirit of liberty that inſpired the immenſe majority of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, was calculated to overwhelm every contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, and bring back the ancient deſpotiſm with all the avenging terrors of ſacerdotal and ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical rage.</p>

The country which was the ſcene of this inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in favour of prieſthood and royalty, is ſituated between the Loire and the Charente, ſtretching along the coaſts between the two rivers, and making part of the territory which was called, under the ancient government, the Province of Poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. It is a country fertile both in corn and paſture; and from its rich abundance diſtributed plenty to moſt of the neighbouring departments, and furniſhed even to the centre of France a conſiderable part of its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. Where nature had done ſo much to make this region the ſeat of plenty, the inhabitant was not ſolicitous to increaſe his riches by foreign traffic; ſo that commerce contributed but little to his opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and manufacturers were almoſt unknown. However innocent and paſtoral the life of a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and the huſbandman has been repreſented, and however productive of thoſe vices that corrupt and enervate mankind the commercial intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nations may have been found; this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication brings with it an interchange of knowledge and manners which improves and embelliſhes ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, while the permanent habitudes of the former ſerve to retain him in a ſtate which adds nothing to the common ſtock of knowledge, and contributes nothing to the progreſſive improvement of the world. The negative merit of exemption from vices to which we have never been tempted, may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this intellectual darkneſs, where it is placed beyond the reach of endangering more enlightened ſociety; but when ignorance becomes the ſport of fanaticiſm, and ambitious men make it the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their guilty deſigns, it becomes a calamity the moſt terrible in the liſt of human evils.</p>
            <p>The department of the Vendée, from its local ſituation, had little other intercourſe with the reſt of the republic than what aroſe from the export of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031634_0062_0FED61E75EBCB2B8"/>
ſuperfluity of its produce; and while the great and immortal principles which directed the revolution awakened in the boſom of every mechanic and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant throughout France the noble ſentiment that no man was ſuperior to him in his rights, the Vendéan, who had only heard of theſe things through the organ of the noble and the prieſt, remained the implicit believer and obedient vaſſal, while his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were rejoicing in their emancipation.</p>
            <p>In this inſulated department the feodal ſyſtem had been maintained in all its rigour. The provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial laws of Brittany, which, from the minuteneſs and ſingularity of their oppreſſion, would be rather ſubjects of ridicule than abhorrence, had they not contributed ſo much to the degradation of the human character in the tyrant who inflicted and the ſlave who ſuffered them, were incorporated with other laws equally barbarous, and peculiar to the country.</p>
            <p>As this part of the republic, from its geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical and moral ſituation, had received but a few faint rays of the light of that liberty which had burſt forth in France; and as already the ſeeds of diſcord had been plentifully ſcattered among the inhabitants by the fanatical clergy, it was fitted to become the retreat of all who were averſe to the new order of public affairs. Accordingly the nobles and the prieſts, who, in the firſt meetings of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſembly, diſcovered, that by the removal of thoſe factious barriers by which they had hitherto been ſeparated from the other claſſes of the people, they were now to mingle in the common maſs, found refuge in theſe departments, where they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thoſe diſtinctions might ſtill be reſpected which had elſewhere ſunk into contempt. Their influence was extenſive; and as their zeal was quickened by implacable reſentment, thoſe laws of which they could not hinder the promulgation, and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031634_0063_0FED61A324384338"/>
particularly thoſe which reſpected their own orders, were but imperfectly executed, or apparently obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having found that that enthuſiaſim which led the conſtituent aſſembly to overthrow theſe gigantic pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, had conſiderably evaporated towards its cloſe; and ſeeing alſo that the court, in ſtruggling to regain its loſt power, ſought their alliance; they grew bolder in their pretenſions, and became more active in their hatred towards the eſtabliſhment of the new government. At firſt an air of general diſcontent overſpread this part of the country—par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fermentations next ſucceeded, and the ſpirit of inſurrection at length became ſo general, that the conſtituent aſſembly was compelled to take meaſures to ſtop its alarming progreſs.</p>
            <p>The means employed by the legiſlature were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated rather to increaſe than prevent the evil; for, inſtead of ſending commiſſaries from their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to examine into its cauſes; inſtead of enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people, and unmaſking and puniſhing thoſe who had prompted them to rebellion; they entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the court with the execution of their decrees, and, as it might have been expected, the inſurrection obtained additional force, and even a ſort of royal ſanction.</p>
            <p>The authority of the next aſſembly was inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to repreſs ſo alarming an evil. Too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the ſpirit of party, and too much occupied in ſtruggles againſt the court, the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for a long time applied only palliatives to the diſeaſe; nor, till it wore an aſpect dangerous to the exiſtence of the revolution, was the aſſembly rouſed to the application of any effective remedy. The meaſure they firſt propoſed was the baniſhment of the prieſts who had refuſed adherence to the new conſtitution; but this meaſure appeared ſo alarming to the court, and ſo deſtructive of the ſyſtem it had
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031634_0064_0FED61579A877548"/>
adopted to regain its loſt influence, that the king was adviſed to make uſe of the repreſſive power which the conſtitution gave him, and to refuſe his royal ſanction. Though this refuſal haſtened the deſtruction of the court, already tottering, it gave new courage to the diſcontended, who, finding themſelves ſo zealouſly ſupported, burſt into open reſiſtance in the Vendée and the neighbouring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, which it required all the exertion of the departmental force to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p>The fall of the court ſuſpended for a time the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this inſurrection; but the unhappy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices under which the convention met, inſpired freſh ardour, and led the inſurgents to new exertions. In hopes of reſtoring the monarchy, a vaſt plan of inſurrection was formed, which not only compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Vendée and the adjoining departments, but extended itſelf through a great part of Brittany. The convention was too much occupied in reſiſting the conſpirators at Paris to attend to the progreſs of the royaliſts, who were ſuffered to take uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſſeſſion of the Vendée and the neighbouring departments. Before the end of March they had organized an army of 40,000 men, conſiſting chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of peaſants, ſervants of the former nobility, ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, poachers and game-keepers, men well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the uſe of arms, and had began their march towards Paris before the convention were formally adviſed that any inſurrection had taken place. Their army was commanded by experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced chiefs who had ſerved under the ancient govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but what gave the rebellion its fierceſt rage was the fanaticiſm which the prieſt inſpired, who marching at the head of their columns, bearing the crucifix in his hand, pointed out to his followers the road to victory or heaven. The progreſs which the royaliſts had made before any force was oppoſed to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031634_0065_0FED61A685D71E00"/>
them was ſo alarming, that at the period when the Jacobins had ſeized upon the government at Paris, the portion of the country which the Vendéens had ſubdued was ſo extenſive, that it ſeemed doubtful of which party France was deſtined to be the prey. The royaliſts had entire poſſeſſion of the Loire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as far as Paris, and menaced Rochelle on the one ſide while they beſieged Nantes on the other, and opened a paſſage into the departments which made part of the former province of Brittany.</p>
            <p>The faction at Paris did not fail to improve the events of the Vendée to their own advantage. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thion, Buzot, Rabaut St. Etienne, Iſnard, Lanjui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais, Barbaroux, Gaudet, Louvet and others of the proſcribed deputies having made their eſcape, the conſpirators declared, in an addreſs to the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the project of the deputies who were ſtill in arreſtation was evidently the ſame as that of their colleagues, who were gone to facilitate the march of the rebels, and aid them in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the royal power. This calumny, which was refuted by every addreſs received from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. II.</note>, formed the baſis of the accuſation which was framed againſt the Giroude; and the founders and moſt ſtrenuous ſupporters of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public were ſoon after dragged to the ſcaffold as the advocates and protectors of royalty.</p>
            <p>In proportion as the departments relaxed in their energy, the ferocity of the conſpirators increaſed. An event alſo happened at this period, which, from the calumnies to which it gave riſe, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences it produced, proved fatal to the arreſted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. This was the aſſaſſination of Marat. In the firſt dawn of the conſpiracy Marat became a principal inſtrument in the hands of the traitors,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031634_0066_0FED62167944FED8"/>
who found him well fitted for their purpoſes; and being ſaved from the puniſhment which uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows perſonal inſult by the contempt which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and diminutiveneſs of his perſon excited, he became the habitual retailer of all the falſehoods and calumnies which were invented by his party againſt every man of influence or reputation. He was the Therſites of the convention, whom no one would deign to chaſtiſe; for his extravagance made his employers often diſclaim him as a fool, while the general ſentiment he excited was the ſort of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy we feel for a loathſome reptile. His politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſentiments often varied; for he ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the choice of a chief, and ſometimes made declamations in favour of a limited monarchy; but what rendered him uſeful to the conſpirators was his readineſs to publiſh every ſlander which they fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to exhort to every horror which they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated.—His rage for denunciation was ſo great that he became the dupe of the idle; and his daily paper contains the names of great criminals who exiſted only in the imagination of thoſe who impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his credulous malignity.</p>
            <p>After this firſt preacher of blood had performed the part allotted to him in the plan of evil, he was confined to his chamber by a lingering diſeaſe to which he was ſubject, and of which he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſoon have died. But he was aſſaſſinated in his bath by a young woman who had travelled with this intention from Caen in Normandy. Charlotte Anne Marie Corday was a native of St. Saturnin in the department of the Orne. She appears to have lived in a ſtate of literary retirement with her father, and by the ſtudy of ancient and modern hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians to have imbibed a ſtrong attachment to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. She had been accuſtomed to aſſimilate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain periods of ancient hiſtory with the events that
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031634_0067_0FED61AC8C839530"/>
were paſſing before her, and was probably excited by the examples of antiquity to the commiſſion of a deed, which ſhe believed with fond enthuſiaſm would deliver and ſave her country.</p>
            <p>Being at Caen when the citizens of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were enrolling themſelves to march to the relief of the convention, the animation with which ſhe ſaw them devoting their lives to their country, led her to execute, without delay, the project ſhe had formed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Louvet ſpeaks of this extraordinary woman in the following terms:—"A young perſon came to ſpeak to Barbaroux at the Intendance where we all lodged. She was tall and well ſhaped, of the moſt graceful manners and modeſt demeanour: there was in her countenance, which was beautiful and engaging, and in all her movements, a mixture of ſoftneſs and dignity, which were evident indications of a heavenly mind. She came always attended by a ſervant, and waited for Barbaroux in an apartment through which we paſſed frequently. Since this young woman has fixed on herſelf the attention of the world, we have each of us recollected the circumſtances of her viſits, of which it is now clear that ſome favour ſolicited for a friend was only a pretence. Her true motive undoubtedly was to become acquainted with ſome of the founders of the republic, for which ſhe was going to devote herſelf; and perhaps ſhe was deſirous that at ſome future day her features ſhould be brought to their recollection.</p>
                  <p>"I declare and ſolemnly atteſt, that ſhe never communicated to us a word of her deſign; and if ſuch actions could be directed, and ſhe had conſulted us, would it have been againſt Marat that we ſhould have pointed her ſtroke? Did we not know that he was then languiſhing under a fatal diſeaſe, and had but a few days to live?"</p>
               </note>. Under pretence of going home, ſhe came to Paris, and the third day after her arrival obtained admiſſion to Marat. She had invented a ſtory to deceive him; and when he promiſed her that all the promoters of the inſurrection in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments ſhould be ſent to the guillotine, ſhe drew out a knife which ſhe had purchaſed for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and plunged it into his breaſt.</p>
            <p>She was immediately apprehended, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Abbaye priſon, from which ſhe was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031634_0068_0FED6208ACCDBDE8"/>
to the Conciergerie, and brought before the revolutionary tribunal.</p>
            <p>She acknowledged the deed, and juſtified it by aſſerting that it was a duty ſhe owed her country and mankind to rid the world of a monſter, whoſe ſanguinary doctrines were framed to involve the country in anarchy and civil war, and aſſerted her right to put Marat to death as a convict already condemned by the public opinion. She truſted that her example would inſpire the people with that energy which had been at all times the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed characteriſtic of republicans; and which ſhe defined to be that devotedneſs to our country which renders life of little comparative eſtimation.</p>
            <p>Her deportment during the trial was modeſt and dignified. There was ſo engaging a ſoftneſs in her countenance, that it was difficult to conceive how ſhe could have armed herſelf with ſufficient intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to execute the deed. Her anſwers to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories of the court were full of point and energy. She ſometimes ſurpriſed the audience by her wit, and excited their admiration by her elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Her face ſometimes beamed with ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and was ſometimes covered with ſmiles. At the cloſe of her trial ſhe took three letters from her boſom, and preſented them to the judges, and requeſted they might be forwarded to the perſons to whom they were addreſſed. Two were written to Barbaroux, in which with great eaſe and ſpirit ſhe relates her adventures from her leaving Caen to the morning of her trial. The other was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and ſolemn adieu to her father. She retired while the jury deliberated on their verdict; and when ſhe again entered the tribunal there was a majeſtic ſolemnity in her demeanour which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly became her ſituation. She heard her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with attention and compoſure; and after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031634_0069_0FED61C2B51DE298"/>
for a few minutes with her counſel and a friend of mine who had ſat near her during the trial, and whom ſhe requeſted to diſcharge ſome trifling debts ſhe had incurred in the priſon, ſhe left the court with the ſame ſerenity, and prepared herſelf for the laſt ſcene.</p>
            <p>She had concluded her letter to her father with this verſe of Corneille,
<q>
                  <l>"C'eſt le crime qui fait la honte, et non pas l'échafaud,"</l>
               </q>
and it is difficult to conceive the kind of heroiſm which ſhe diſplayed in the way to execution. The women who were called furies of the guillotine, and who had aſſembled to inſult her on leaving the priſon, were awed into ſilence by her demeanour, while ſome of the ſpectators uncovered their heads before her, and others gave loud tokens of applauſe. There was ſuch an air of chaſtened exultation thrown over her countenence, that ſhe inſpired ſentiments of love rather than ſenſations of pity<note n="*" place="bottom">She excited in this intereſting ſituation a very ſtrong and ſingular paſſion in a young man of the name of Adam Lux, a commiſſary from Mayence. He accidentally croſſed the ſtreet ſhe was paſſing in her way to execution, and became inſtantly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured not of her only, but, what was more extraordinary, of the guillotine. He publiſhed a few days after a pamphlet, in which he propoſed raiſing a ſtatue to her honour, and inſcribing on the pedeſtal, "<hi>Greater than Brutus,</hi>" and invoked her ſhade wandering through Elyſium with thoſe glorious perſonages who had devoted themſelves for their country. He was ſent to the priſon of the Force, where a friend of mine often ſaw him, and where he talked of nothing to him but of Charlotte Corday and the guillotine; which, ſince ſhe had periſhed, appeared to him transformed into an altar, on which he would conſider it as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to be ſacrificed, and was only ſolicitous to receive the ſtroke of death from the identical inſtrument by which ſhe had ſuffered. A few weeks after his impriſonment he was executed as a counter-revolutioniſt.</note>. She aſcended the ſcaffold with undaunted firmneſs, and, knowing that ſhe had only to die, was reſolved
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031634_0070_0FED6178B386E718"/>
to die with dignity. She had learned from her jailor the mode of puniſhment, but was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the detail; and when the executioner attempted to tie her feet to the plank, ſhe reſiſted, from an apprehenſion that he had been ordered to inſult her; but on his explaining himſelf ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with a ſmile. When he took off her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, the moment before ſhe bent under the fatal ſtroke, ſhe bluſhed deeply; and her head, which was held up to the multitude the moment after, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited this laſt impreſſion of offended modeſty.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the faction, who thought every meaſure good that could be made ſubſervient to their purpoſe, found this event too replete with favourable circumſtances to be neglected. Marat, whom they had thrown aſide to die at leiſure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perchance he ſhould have lived to ſhare the fate to which they afterwards condemned their other agents, was now reſtored to more than his antient honours, was proclaimed a martyr, and his death ordered to be lamented as an irreparable loſs to the republic. The conſpirators declared that no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt of the federaliſm of the departments remained. The death of Marat was the point of conviction. Every member of the mountain was to be aſſaſſinated in his turn, and the traitors of the departments had their accomplices in Paris who had whetted their poniards to involve the city in deſtruction. Though the Pariſians were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently credulous to believe theſe calumnies, the faction made them the pretence to proceed to the farther commiſſion of crimes; and while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to amuſe the people with what they called the inauguration of Marat and of Chalier, they were meditating the murder of the deputies whom they had driven from the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:031634_0071_0FED61705447A680"/>
It was impoſſible to contemplate without indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deſpair that glorious revolution, which had opened to mankind the brighteſt proſpects of happineſs, and which had promiſed the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial effects to the world, become the ſport of the cruel, and the prey of the rapacious; to ſee a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were called to liberty, bending their necks, like the votaries of the ſtoried aſſaſſin of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, at the nod of their tyrant; to ſee a nation which had poſſeſſed Rouſſeau, Mably and Voltaire, proſtrate in frantic enthuſiaſm before the ſhrine of Marat, like the idolaters of Montapa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a, whoſe devotion roſe in proportion to the hideouſneſs of their gods.</p>
            <p>Every day ſome pretended plot was diſcovered, ſome dark conſpiracy, attributed ſucceſſively to nobles, prieſts, bankers and foreigners, was drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to light; but the ſpecimens produced of theſe counter-revolutionary projects were often ſuch as did little honour to the invention of thoſe by whom they were exhibited. Sometimes letters were found from agents of the coaleſced powers; but they were generally ſo ill fabricated that they only deceived thoſe who could not read them.</p>
            <p>The departments having ſubmitted to the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they now began their meaſures of ſeverity againſt thoſe who had reſiſted their authority. The general denomination for diſaffection to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples was that of being ſuſpected; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a decree was iſſued to arreſt all thoſe who came under this title. The revolutionary tribunal not having all the energy neceſſary to carry into execution the plans that were meditating, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced for its <hi>moderantiſm,</hi> and the members of which it was compoſed, renewed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:031634_0072_0FED61A1743AA2D0"/>
A certain claſs of the women of Paris, who gave themſelves the title of revolutionary women, had been ſerviceable auxiliaries to the conſpirators, and had taken place of the poiſſards, who not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the energy which the preſent exigencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, had yielded the palm to their revolutionary ſucceſſors. Theſe female politicians held delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative aſſemblies, and afterwards preſented their views to the convention, while they influenced its debates by their vociferations in the tribunes, which they now excluſively occupied. On the days of tumult which preceded the 31ſt of May they had mounted guard in perſon at the convention, and prevented the execution of certain orders which they diſliked. They now preſented themſelves at the bar of the aſſembly, and demanded the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the former nobles from every function civil or military, the renewal of all the adminiſtrations throughout the republic, the examination of the conduct of the miniſters, the arreſt of every ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected perſon, the raiſing of the whole nation in a maſs, and obliging the women to wear red caps. The convention having ſhewn ſome diſinclination to comply with theſe modeſt requiſitions, theſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male politicians inſulted ſome of the members, and the ſociety was diſſolved by a decree.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the royaliſts had proceeded almoſt as far as Tours on their way to Paris. Lyons was in a ſtate of formidable reſiſtance. The Marſeillois were at Avignon. Mentz ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the Pruſſians. The province of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace was over-run by the Auſtrians.

               </gap>s was taken after a formidable ſiege, and Cambray was ſummoned to ſurrender. The Piedmonteſe had invaded the department of Montblanc, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Savoy, the Spaniards had inveſted Perpig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, and the Engliſh were maſters of Toulon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031634_0073_0FED614C9CEF6CC8"/>
More efficient meaſures became neceſſary than had hitherto been employed, and that which was now adopted was putting into requiſition every individual that could be made uſeful to his country in any ſituation in which his ſervices were claimed. That part of the community which was deſtined to the moſt active ſervice were the young men from 18 to 25 years of age, who under the name of the firſt requiſitions were immediately inveſted with the title of the defenders of their country, and, as ſoon as arms were procured, ſent to the frontiers.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the difference of political opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion reſpecting the events of the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there can be no diſſenting voice againſt the tribute of honour and applauſe which belongs to the armies of the republic. Amidſt all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commotions of contending chiefs, regardleſs of plain or mountain, of <hi>côté droit</hi> or <hi>côté gauche,</hi> they ſaw their country invaded, and bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the attack, leaving the arrangement of the internal concerns of the ſtate to the individuals who were left behind. They were not of that claſs which compoſes the uſual maſs of armies, the idle and the profligate, who ſeek a refuge from induſtry or want in the vocation of a ſoldier; and they were of that age when the love of military glory and the paſſion for liberty are felt with the greateſt ardour. This paſſion was nouriſhed by the conſciouſneſs that their ſections, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes, the convention, and their country were looking on them with fond and anxious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the decrees which declared that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well of the republic animated them with a more ardent deſire to merit the eulogium.</p>
            <p>One of the great ſprings which mechanically inſpired courage and reſolution, was the patriotic
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031634_0074_0FED61C46614A840"/>
ſongs and hymns which were continually reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through their camps. But the great moral motive that urged them to valorous deeds, was that contempt of death which men in all ages, who combat for liberty and their country, have felt, and this was a motive which their antagoniſts could not feel. The ſoldier was conſcious that, if he ſurvived, he ſhould partake of the honour he had laboured to acquire; and if he died, that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would enroll his name among thoſe of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers, and that his fate would inſpire that ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which our animated poet has ſo beautifully deſcribed in his ode on the glorious dead.</p>

            <p>"But the life of a modern ſoldier," Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has obſerved, "is ill repreſented by heroic fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands that periſhed in our late conteſt with France and Spain, a very ſmall part ever felt the ſtroke of an enemy.

            <p>From this devaſtation of diſeaſe the French have been exempted; for the evils which Dr. Johnſon enumerates moſt commonly proceed from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe conveniencies which money can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. But a great part of the firſt requiſition, which was taken from the claſs of the rich as well as of the poor, were enabled, by the attention of their friends, and the expenditure of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to procure not only the means of plenty to themſelves, but to contribute to the accommodation of their leſs wealthy companions.</p>

            <p>THE uſurpers ſaw that thoſe young citizens who had obeyed with alacrity the call of the convention againſt the common enemy were not fitted to be the inſtruments of theſe revolutionary projects. Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary committees had been eſtabliſhed in every commune of the departments, and in every ſection of Paris; but though the laſt were in general compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the creatures of the faction, they were not ſo ſecure of what they called the <hi>energy</hi> of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees in the country. For this reaſon, a certain number of what was termed the moſt ſanſculotti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031634_0076_0FED61F7ED33DA88"/>
and revolutionary citizens of each ſection of Paris who choſen by their reſpective committees to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a body of ſix thouſand men, which was called the revolutionary army, and which, accompanied by a<note n="*" place="bottom">A travelling guillotine.</note> guillotine ambulante, was to iſſue forth from Paris into the departments, to invite the people to raiſe themſelves to the height of the revolution.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the uſurpers framed an act of accuſation againſt the deputies whom they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the convention on the 31ſt of May, and arreſted the ſeventy-three members who had proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt that meaſure. At this period alſo the vague report of a ſpy, that Beauvais a deputy of the convention had been put to death by the Engliſh at Toulon, ſerved as a pretext to the uſurpers for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting twenty years impriſonment on whoever ſhould introduce Engliſh merchandize into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and for throwing into priſon and confiſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the property of all thoſe who had been born in the Britiſh dominions, except ſuch as were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in manufactures. This impolitic and ſavage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, in open violation of the rights of nations, and breach of that hoſpitality under the protection of which but a few months before they had invited the Engliſh then in France to remain among them, was put into execution; and though it met with univerſal reprobation, yet as terror was the order of the day, no one felt himſelf ſufficiently bold to demand its repeal; and as buſineſs of more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance lay before the conſpirators than the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the caſes of individuals, thoſe who had the credulity to truſt to their protection were left to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on their injuſtice.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep taken by the conſpirators was that of throwing aſide the incumbrance of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031634_0077_0FED62401DC38D78"/>
A report was accordingly prepared, ſhewing the impoſſibility of conducting the machine of the revolution without the uſe of extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the convention voted without diſcuſſion, that the conſtitution ſhould be ſet aſide, and that the government ſhould become revolutionary. The ſuperiority of a monarchical over a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been ſaid to conſiſt in the unity of its action, particularly in caſes of danger. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in time of great public calamity were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to throw a veil over the tables of the laws, and place in the hands of one of their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whom they called a Dictator, the whole ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the government, as long as the danger which threatened the ſtate ſhould exiſt. Rouſſeau admires this policy, and recommends it in ſimilar caſes to all free governments. Of whatever advantage the temporary abſence of liberty might have been, had the people of France, like the Romans, choſen thoſe to rule the ſtorm who had the greateſt ſkill or the moſt acknowledged virtue; thoſe ſanguinary and ferocious characters who now ſeized on the power, inſtead of making this temporary deſpotiſm a means of ſaving the country, like the malevolent genii who preſide over evil, filled it with horror, deſolation, and death.</p>
            <p>To reconcile the nation to the aſſumption of their new power, the conſpirators thought it neceſſary to ſhew their diſtinguiſhing attachment to what they called the people by the exerciſe of every kind of perſecution againſt what they called ariſtocracy, an appellation by no means confined to the adherents of the former court or the nobility. To the "ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy of talents" ſucceeded the "ariſtocracy of commerce," which ſignified that he who enriched himſelf while he enriched his country by the ſupply of its wants, was an object of ſuſpicion, or a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-revolutioniſt.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031634_0078_0FED620F447D5290"/>
They therefore conceived the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reducing every article of merchandize and ſubſiſtence to what they called the <hi>maximum,</hi> and obliged every merchant and ſhop-keeper to ſell his goods to the public at the preſcribed rate, whatever might have been the firſt coſt. Though it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the moſt ſuperficial obſerver, that ſuch a meaſure muſt be eventually deſtructive of commerce, and productive of the evil it was intended to prevent; yet, as it was an evil that but remotely affected the conſumer, it was calculated to pleaſe the lower claſs of people.</p>
            <p>The faction, armed with the abſolute power they had uſurped, fancied they could control all poſſible circumſtances; and though they could not but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the manufacturer muſt neceſſarily ceaſe his labour when the new materials exceeded the ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed price of the goods he expoſed to ſale, and that the merchant could no longer go on with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, when the cargo which he had purchaſed abroad was ſtruck with the revolutionary <hi>maximum</hi> on its entrance into port; though they could not but ſee that it was a law fraught with every evil, yet as it was a blow at the ariſtocracy of commerce, and a revolutionary meaſure, it was propoſed and adopted.</p>
            <p>While they were thus perſuading the people what intereſt they took in their welfare by the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of plenty, in the extinction of monopolies, and the reduction of the price of merchandize, they were equally ſolicitous to ſhow their regard for the public ſafety by the puniſhment of traitors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. For a long time the Jacobins had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the trial of Maria Antoinette, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence they declared endangered that of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. She was accordingly arraigned for having
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031634_0079_0FED621203F9FD78"/>
committed a ſeries of crimes, which in the language of the indictment comprehended not merely counter-revolutionary projects, but all the enormities of the Meſſalinas, Brunehauts, Fredegondes, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. A curious account of the evidence in ſupport of theſe charges, and the effect which her behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our produced upon Robeſpierre, is given by Vilate, a young man of the revolutionary tribunal. The ſcene paſſed during the trial, at a tavern near the Tuilleries, where he was invited to dine with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpierre, Barrere, and St. Juſt. "Seated around the table," he ſays, "in a cloſe and retired room, they aſked me to give them ſome leading features of the evidence on the trial of the Auſtrian. I did not forget that expoſtulation of inſulted nature when, Hebert accuſing Antoinette of having committed the moſt ſhocking crime, ſhe turned with dignity towards the audience, and ſaid, "I appeal to the conſcience and feelings of every mother preſent, to declare if there be one amongſt them who does not ſhudder at the idea of ſuch horrors." Robeſpierre ſtruck with this anſwer as by an electrical ſtroke, broke his plate with his fork. "That blockhead Hebert!" cried he, "as if it were not enough that ſhe was really a Meſſalina, he muſt make her an Agrippina alſo, and furniſh her with the triumph of exciting the ſympathy of the public in her laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</p>
            <p>Marie Antoinette made no defence, and called no witneſſes, alleging that no poſitive fact had been produced againſt her. She had preſerved an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form behaviour during the whole of her trial, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when a ſtarting tear accompanied her anſwer to Hebert. She was condemned about four in the morning, and heard her ſentence with compoſure. But her firmneſs forſook her in the way from the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031634_0080_0FED621D193D3A38"/>
court to her dungeon—ſhe burſt into tears; when, as if aſhamed of this weakneſs, ſhe obſerved to her guards, that though ſhe wept at that moment, they ſhould ſee her go to the ſcaffold without ſhedding a tear.</p>
            <p>In her way to execution, where ſhe was taken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the accuſtomed manner in a cart, with her hands tied behind her, ſhe paid little attention to the prieſt who attended her, and ſtill leſs to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding multitude. Her eyes, though bent on vacancy, did not conceal the emotion that was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring at her heart—her cheeks were ſometimes in a ſingular manner ſtreaked with red, and ſometimes overſpread with deadly paleneſs; but her general look was that of indignant ſorrow. She reached the place of execution about noon; and when ſhe turned her eyes towards the gardens and the palace, ſhe became viſibly agitated. She aſcended the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with precipitation, and her head was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held up to the people by the executioner.</p>
            <p>The trial of Marie Antoinette was followed by that of the accuſed deputies. Although thoſe guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the public weal, the Jacobins, had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly urged the convention to bring forward their trial, it had been long delayed from the difficulty of finding any proofs that wore the appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; and it remained long undecided what ſhould be the charges, and who ſhould be the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims. The ſubſtance of the accuſation was at length founded on a ſort of ſportive party romance written by Camille Deſmoulins on Briſſot and the Briſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins; and what was meant by the author merely to excite a laugh, was diſtorted to ſerve this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible purpoſe. Camille, it is ſaid, remonſtrated loudly on this perverſion of his intentions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed any participation in the guilt. He declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the charges were only extravagancies of his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031634_0081_0FED61B1972DB740"/>
own imagination, and that he could not ſupport any of them by evidence. This remonſtrance was inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and the romance formed part of the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was filled up with charges of royaliſm and federaliſm; which being preſented to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for their ſanction, the decree of accuſation paſſed without a diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>The witneſſes in ſupport of the charges conſiſted principally of the chiefs of the municipality of Paris, who were the original accuſers. But the defence which the priſoners made was ſo entirely deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the accuſation, that though the judges and the jury had bound up their nature to this execrable deed; though the audience, like the tribunes of the Jacobins and the convention, were hired to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud this crime, the eloquence of the accuſed drew iron tears down their cheeks, and convinced the whole tribunal of the infamy and falſehood of the charges. Imagine the remorſe with which the minds of the jury muſt have been wrung when their employment compelled them to dreſs out matter for condemnation from the abſurd and lying fables of the conſpirators, who were called as witneſſes to the indictment; while, to the demonſtration even of the moſt perverſe and ignorant, the priſoners refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every charge with triumph on their accuſers; and if any ſuſpicion had exiſted with reſpect to their patriotiſm or love of the republic, the proſecution would have ſerved to diſpel it.</p>
            <p>The judges, as well as the jury, although deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to execute their atrocious commiſſion, ſaw that the defence of the priſoners would carry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to the minds of the audience, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being hired by the accuſers, began to ſhew ſigns of compaſſion. The court, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wrote to the convention to inform them, that if the trials were permitted to proceed, the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031634_0082_0FED614AEC39DA88"/>
of the law would reduce them to extreme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; and obſerved, that in a revolutionary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs it was not neceſſary to be incumbered with troubleſome witneſſes, or a long defence. This humane epiſtle was ſupported by a deputation of the Jacobins, who ſpoke a ſtill plainer language, by demanding a decree, that the accuſed ſhould be condemned whenever the jury ſhould feel themſelves "ſufficiently inſtructed," without attending to the whole of the charge, or hearing what the priſoners might have to allege in their defence. To this meaſure the ſociety was urged by the municipal witneſſes, who were ſtung with ſhame at ſeeing their perjuries unveiled.</p>
            <p>The decree, empowering the jury to ſtop the proſecution at whatever period they thought proper, was virtually pronouncing the ſentence of death: and the tribunal, releaſing themſelves from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they were compelled to ſuffer, while their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were every hour more and more loaded with the conviction of the innocence of the victims whoſe judicial murder they were bound to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, loſt no time in declaring that they were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed.</p>
            <p>Alas! in what were "they ſufficiently inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" That the men they were going to condemn, were thoſe who were the moſt diſtinguiſhed for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and moſt devoted to the eſtabliſhment of the republic, of which they were the founders. Were not this ſanguinary jury ſufficiently inſtructed, that it was for their virtues, and not their crimes, that theſe victims had been dragged before them? and yet, with all this conviction on their minds, they coolly commanded the murder.</p>
            <p>This atrocious condemnation was remonſtrated againſt by the priſoners in vain. In vain they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that againſt ſome of them no evidence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031634_0083_0FED61F0B4724CD0"/>
had been heard; that their names had ſcarcely been mentioned at the tribunal; and that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretence the jury might have for calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently inſtructed reſpecting the reſt, they could not be informed of the crimes of thoſe againſt whom no witneſſes had appeared. The court, ſheltering themſelves under the ſanction of a decree, were little inclined to give the reaſons of their conviction; and therefore replied to the arguments of the priſoners, by ordering the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force to take them from the tribunal. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazé, in a tranſport of indignation, ſtabbed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the court. Briſſot, Vergniaud, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonné, La Source, Fonfrede, Sillery, Ducos, Carra, Duperret, Gardien, Duprat, Fauchet, Beauvais, Duchaſtel, Mainvielle, La Caze, Le Hardy, Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau, Anteboul, and Vigée, were led to execution on the following day. Vergniaud, having a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his impending fate, had early provided himſelf with poiſon; but finding that his young friends Fonfrede and Ducos, who he had ſome hopes would be ſpared, were companions of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he gave the phial to the officer of the guard, reſolving to wait the appointed moment, and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with them.</p>
            <p>They met their fate with all the calm of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and breathed their laſt vows for the ſafety and liberty of the republic. Thoſe who were the melancholy witneſſes of their laſt hours in priſon, love to relate how they ſpoke, and felt, and acted. I have been told by one who was their fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and friend, that their minds were in ſuch a ſtate of elevation, that no one could approach them with the common-place and ordinary topics of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Briſſot was ſerious and thoughtful, and at times an air of diſcontent clouded his brow; but it was evident that he mourned over the fate of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031634_0084_0FED61F52C2DA588"/>
his country and not his own. Genſonné, firm and ſelf-collected, ſeemed fearful of ſullying his lips by mentioning the names of his murderers. He did not utter a word reſpecting his own ſituation, but made many obſervations on the ſtate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and expreſſed his ardent wiſhes for its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Vergniaud was ſometimes ſerious, and ſometimes gay. He amuſed his fellow-priſoners at times with the recital of poetry which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his memory, and ſometimes indulged them with the laſt touches of that ſublime elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which was now for ever loſt to the world. Fonfrede and Ducos relieved the ſombre of the piece by the habitual livelineſs of their characters, although each lamented the fate of his brother to their reſpective friends, and ſometimes ſhed tears over the diſtreſs and ruin of their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for both had young families and immenſe fortunes. Their courage was the more exemplary, as their fate was altogether unexpected.</p>
            <p>Previouſly to the impriſonment of the deputies, while they were yet under arreſt in their own houſes, I frequently viſited thoſe who were in the number of our friends. Vergniaud had long told me that he ſaw no juſt foundation for hope, and that he would rather die, than live a witneſs of his country's ſhame. Fonfrede and Ducos had the full enjoyment of their liberty till the act of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation appeared, in which they had not the leaſt ſuſpicion that they ſhould be included. The day previous to the reading of this murderous proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the convention, Fonfrede had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us to Montmorenci, about four leagues from Paris, where we had wandered till evening, amidſt that enchanting ſcenery which Rouſſeau once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and which he had ſo luxuriantly deſcribed.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031634_0085_0FED615F32EA39B8"/>
Alas! while the charms of nature had ſoothed our imaginations, and made us forget a while the ſcenes of moral deformity exhibited in the polluted city we had left; while every thing around us breathed delight, and the landſcape was a hymn to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; the aſſaſſins were at their bloody work, and plotting the murder of our friends. The next day Fonfrede was ſent to the Conciergerie, and we ſaw him no more. A week after we were our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves arreſted. He conveyed to us, from his dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, his ſympathy in our misfortunes, and, after his condemnation, wrote to bid us a laſt farewell; but the letter was carried to the committee of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſafety, and never reached us.</p>
            <p>They were condemned at midnight. When they returned to their priſon, they gave the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſignal of their fate to their fellow-priſoners, whoſe ſecluſion afforded them no other means of knowing it, by ſinging a parody of the chorus of the Marſellois hymn—
<q>
                  <l>Contre nous de la tyrannie</l>
                  <l>L'étandard ſanglant eſt levé.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſpending the few hours of life that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, in converſation, now and then enlivened by the ſallies of the young and gay amongſt them, they bade adieu to their fellow-priſoners, whoſe minds were ſo raiſed by the heroiſm which theſe patriots diſplayed, that it was ſome time before they became ſenſible of their loſs.</p>
            <p>The dungeon which they inhabited was ſhewn with profound veneration to every priſoner who afterwards arrived at this preparatory ſcene of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A ſuperſtitious reſpect was paid to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable matraſs of Vergniaud; and thoſe who felt neither the force of their patriotiſm, nor ſhared in
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031634_0086_0FED618EC78DCEB0"/>
their love for their country, were taught to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with religious awe the names of theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of liberty.</p>
            <p>Had theſe lamented patriots known all the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the crimes which the conſpirators were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating againſt them, it would have been eaſy to have withdrawn themſelves from their vengeance, as many of their proſcribed colleagues did. Some, indeed, fell under the murderer's hands, but ſome have happily eſcaped—Lanjuinais, Iſnard, Louvet, and ſome others, appear again on the ſcene. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroux and Buzot, I am told, are alive; and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thion, who but a few months before was hailed as the ſupport of his country, may again deſerve the appellation—but the reſt are gone for ever; and there is no one who has any taſte for literature, or feeling for liberty, but will ſigh at the remembrance of Rabaut, Guadet, and Condorcet.</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE my laſt letter was written, I have left Switzerland, and returned to Paris, and have had the unſpeakable joy of embracing my family again. I have not yet mentioned to you (for till the Jacobins were deſtroyed it was too ſoon to relate) that I forſook home to return no more while Robeſpierre exiſted; and Robeſpierre was then in poſſeſſion of ſuch eſtabliſhed dominion, the ſpirit of liberty had
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031634_0087_0FED61EDF5F9BFC0"/>
ſo bowed itſelf beneath the axe of the guillotine, from the paſtoral hills of Normandy to the orange-groves of Nice, from the enſanguined banks of the Loire to the mourning waters of Vaucluſe, that when my mother, while ſhe gave me her laſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace at parting, told me ſhe ſhould ſee me no more, my deſponding heart aſſented to the ſad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Upon the fall of the deputies who were proſcribed the 31ſt of May, and who were well known to have honoured us with their friendſhip, we became a ſubject of diſcuſſion at the committee of public ſafety, and a mandat d'arrêt would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been iſſued againſt us if we had not already been impriſoned in conſequence of the law againſt the Engliſh. By ſharing the general mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of our countrymen in France, we were ſheltered from any particular mark of vengeance. We afterwards obtained our liberty by means of the municipality, to whom we were unknown; and when the murderers had ſatiated their vengeance in the blood of our friends, my family had no longer any peculiar danger to fear. But my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was far different. During the ſpring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the fatal 31ſt of May, when the deputies of the Gironde, and Barrere, paſſed moſt of their evenings at our houſe, I had not concealed that I was employed in writing ſome letters which have ſince been publiſhed in England, in which I had drawn the portrait of the tyrant in thoſe dark ſhades of colouring that belonged to his hideous nature; and Barrere, in whoſe power my life was placed, was now the lacquey of Robeſpierre, and the great inquiſitor of the Engliſh at Paris. He had now ſeared his conſcience with crimes, and bathed his hands in the blood of the innocent. What ſtill increaſed my danger was, that Barrere could not but recollect, with the conſciouſneſs of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031634_0088_0FED61C7C646FAB8"/>
his preſent vileneſs in our eyes, the political ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which he had expreſſed in thoſe hours of ſocial confidence, when had he been told that he ſhould become the accomplice of unrecorded hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, he would have anſwered with the feelings of Hazael, "Is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this thing?" He could not but recollect that on the third of June, the day after the inſurrection, he came to our houſe with looks diſordered and haggard, with eyes filled with tears, and a mind that ſeemed burſting with indignant ſorrow; repeatedly declaring that, ſince the national repreſentation was violated, liberty was loſt; deploring the fate of the Gironde, above all of Vergniaud, and execrating the Jacobins, and the commune of Paris. A thouſand times he wiſhed that he could tranſport himſelf to the foot of his native mountains, the Pyrenées, bid adieu for ever to the polluted city of Paris, and wander for the reſt of his life amidſt that ſublime ſcenery which he deſcribed with melancholy enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>It was not a little dangerous to have heard ſuch ſentiments from the lips of one who afterwards ſaid boaſtingly in the convention, "Il n'y a que les morts qui ne reviennent pas;"—of one who became the leader of aſſaſſinations; and who, mounting the tribune with the light ſtep of gaiety, dreſſed up with point and epigram thoſe atrocious edicts of the committee to which his bleeding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try anſwered with her groans. Barrere alſo knew that there was no danger of my declaring theſe things at the revolutionary tribunal, ſince thoſe who were tried were not permitted to ſpeak: and he had no longer any ties of acquaintance with us which might have reſtrained him from ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; ſince very ſoon after the 31ſt of May, upon our refuſing to receive ſome deputies of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031634_0089_0FED6174458BAD80"/>
whom he aſked leave to introduce to us, he abandoned us altogether.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Engliſh newſpapers came regularly to the committee of public ſafety, in which paſſages from my letters were frequently tranſcribed, and the work mentioned as mine; and thoſe papers were conſtantly tranſlated into French for the members of the committee. Two copies of the work had alſo reached Paris; and although one was at my requeſt deſtroyed, the other might, by means of thoſe domiciliary viſits which were ſo often repeated, have been thrown into the hands of revolutionary commiſſaries.</p>
            <p>Thus I paſſed the winter at Paris, with the knife of the guillotine ſuſpended over me by a frail thread, when a ſingular opportunity of eſcape preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I fled to Switzerland, with a heart almoſt broken by the crimes I had witneſſed, and the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities I had ſhared. I forſook thoſe who were moſt dear to me on earth, with no other conſolation than that I left them expoſed only to the common danger of every individual in the country, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the cruel apprehenſions they had felt on my account.</p>
            <p>I proceeded on my journey haunted by the images of gens d'armes, who I fancied were purſuing me, and with a ſort of ſuperſtitious perſuaſion that it was impoſſible I ſhould eſcape. I felt as if ſome magical ſpell would chain my feet at the frontier of France, which ſeemed to me a boundary that was impaſſable. As I approached the frontier the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my ſpirits increaſed, and when I reached Bourg-Libre, the laſt French poſt where commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were appointed to examine the paſſports and thoſe who preſented them, my heart ſunk within me, and I tried to reſign myſelf to a fate which
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031634_0090_0FED621EC79934A8"/>
ſeemed to my diſordered mind inevitable. But I found that I had diſquieted myſelf in vain: revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary government had relaxed its iron nerve at this diſtance from the ſeat of tyranny; and the commiſſaries on the frontiers, after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their office with the mildeſt urbanity, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us to proceed to Baſil, which is only half a league further.</p>
            <p>Some tall ſtakes driven into the earth at certain diſtances mark the limits of France and Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. We drove rapidly paſt them, and were then beyond the reach of revolutionary government, and the axe of the guillotine.</p>
            <p>At Baſil, now almoſt the only ſocial ſpeck on Europe's wide ſurface, where men meet for any other purpoſes than thoſe of mutual deſtruction, I was in ſafety: but I was an exile from my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily—from the only friends I had left—my friends in England, to whom I had written immediately on my arrival, in the fulneſs of my heart, and with the fond perſuaſion that they had trembled for my ſafety and would rejoice in my deliverance, having (with few exceptions indeed!) returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to my letters. With what overwhelming ſenſations did I receive the tidings of the fall of Robeſpierre, which was to change the colour of my life, and give peace and conſolation to ſo many millions of my fellow-creatures! After waiting till the ſtruggle maintained by the Jacobins againſt the national repreſentation had happily ended, I returned to Paris. On entering again that polluted city, a thouſand fatal recollections ruſhed upon my mind, a thouſand local ſenſations overwhelmed my ſpirit. In driving along the Rue Honoré, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palling proceſſion of the guillotine aroſe before my troubled imagination—I ſaw in the vehicles of death the ſpectres of my murdered friends. The
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031634_0091_0FED61E2EBB38000"/>
magnificent ſquare of the revolution, with all its gay buildings, appeared to me clotted with blood, and incumbered with the dead. Along the ſilent and deſerted ſtreets of the fauxbourg Germain, I ſaw inſcribed in broad letters upon the gate of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hotel, "propriéte nationale," while the orphans whoſe fathers and mothers have periſhed on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and who lived upon the alms of charity, paſs in ſilence by the dwellings which are their rightful inheritance.—The red flag waving above the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of their forfeited manſions, reminded me of an image of horror in De Foe's hiſtory of the plague at London, where, he ſays, every houſe that was infected was marked with a bloody ſign of the croſs.</p>
            <p>Yet at leaſt we are no longer condemned to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of finding juſtice on earth. Every day is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized by ſuch acts of retribution, that it ſeems as if heaven viſibly deſcended to puniſh the guilty, while at the ſame time mercy and humanity are binding up the wounds of the afflicted, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the captive free. We ſeem to live in regions of romance. Louvet, Iſnard, and others of our proſcribed friends ſo long entombed in ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dungeons, wandering over deſert mountains, or concealed in the gloom of caverns unviſited by day, now reſtored to ſociety and to their country, recount to us the ſecrets of their priſon-houſe, their "hair-breadth 'ſcapes" to which we liſten with eager anxiety, and tremble at their paſt dangers.—But I muſt not thus anticipate. Let me lead you to the convent in the fauxbourg St. Antoine, to which we were transferred in order to make room at the Luxembourg for priſoners whom it was thought expedient to guard more ſtrictly. We were taught by the adminiſtrators of the police to conſider our removal as a mark of particular indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence towards us, ſince we ſhould have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031634_0092_0FED61CA8ABC8CE8"/>
of ſeeing our friends through the grate, and of walking occaſionally in the garden of the convent. Our countrymen were condemned to remain in the Luxembourg, at which they repined and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in vain. Wives were ſeparated from their huſbands, daughters from their fathers; and as far the greater part of the Engliſh were in confined circumſtances, and lived by their reſpective occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, their reſources being ſtopped by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, the little ſtore of aſſignats which they had ſaved from ſequeſtration they were now forced to divide, and, inſtead of ſharing their frugal meal together, their expences were doubled. Many were reduced to the moſt cruel difficulties, who had been accuſtomed to maintain their families reſpectably by their induſtry, and felt that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of receiving alms was no ſlight aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſeries of captivity<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot reſiſt mentioning that Monſ. and Madame Du F—, with whoſe misfortunes and whoſe virtues you are acquainted, no ſooner heard that our property was confiſcated in France, and that in conſequence of an act of parliament our reſources were ſtopped from England, then they wrote to tell us that their fortune was at our diſpoſal. Thoſe generous friends, together with a few others, endeavoured to atone for the injuſtice of their countrymen by the ſtedfaſt fidelity of their attachment. Such moments of trial and of danger are indeed fitted to be the teſt of friendſhip, and call forth the real character: in thoſe reſpects, the experience of a year of revolutionary government is equivalent to that of fifty years of ordinary life.</note>. That part of the convent which the municipality had allotted for our priſon conſiſting only of bare walls, we were each of us permitted to return to our reſpective houſes, in order to provide ourſelves with beds, and what furniture and clothes we thought proper. We were attended thither by an inſpector of the police and guards, together with one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries of our own ſection, who had put the ſeals on our apartments, and who on removing them
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031634_0093_0FED619189450C00"/>
examined our papers, conſiſting now only of a few poetical ſcraps which had eſcaped the flames. Odes, elegies, and ſonnets were inſtantly bundled up and ſent to the municipality, notwithſtanding my aſſurances that the muſes to whom they were addreſſed, far from being accomplices in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt liberty, had in all ages been its warmeſt auxiliaries. With what melancholy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations did we re-viſit that home from which we were again to be torn in a few hours! How often did my eyes wander over every object in our apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The chairs and tables, which we found in the ſame poſition as we had left them on our firſt impriſonment, ſeemed like mute friends whom it was anguiſh to leave, and whoſe well-known atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes recalled the comforts of the paſt. With aching hearts we were once more led through the ſtreets of Paris to our new priſon. This convent, called Les Anglaiſes, was ſtill inhabited by twenty-three Engliſh nuns, and, as it was their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, had not ſhared the general fate of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic edifices. While the French monks and nuns had for more than a year before this period been driven from their retreats, the religious houſes both of men and women, which belonged to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, had been reſpected, and their inhabitants left undiſturbed. The Engliſh or rather Iriſh monks had, however, long ſince thrown off their habits, and conformed as well as they were able to the new ſyſtem of opinions. But this was not the caſe with thoſe religious ſiſters, whoſe enthuſiaſtic attachment to the external ſigns of their profeſſion was greater, and their worldly wiſdom leſs. The inhabitants of the fauxbourg St. Antoine, where they reſided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed from infancy to revere them, to have the wants of the poor ſupplied at the gate of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and, while under the former government they
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031634_0094_0FED6213B0D023B8"/>
were treated with neglect or diſdain by others, to be there received with evangelical humility, felt that their eſteem and veneration for the nuns had ſurvived their own ſuperſtitious belief. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of the Baſtile, the terror of ariſtocracy, and the vanguard of revolutions, laying aſide their bloody pikes and bayonets, humbled themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe holy ſiſters, whom a ſort of viſible ſanctity ſeemed to encompaſs, and whom they ſuffered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the general regulation, to wear the cheriſhed ſymbols of their order, the veil and the croſs, and ſeven times a day to ring the bell for prayers. When we had paſſed the ſentinels who guarded the convent, the gate was unlocked for our admiſſion by a nun in her habit. She embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us with affectionate warmth, and, addreſſing us in Engliſh, begged we would be comforted, ſince ſhe and the other nuns who were to have the charge of us were our countrywomen and our ſiſters. This ſoothing ſympathy, expreſſed in our native language, formed ſuch a contraſt to the rude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of inſpectors of police, that it ſeemed as if ſome pitying angel had leaned from heaven to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us. The kindneſs with which we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by our amiable country-women, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to reconcile us to our chamber, which might more properly be called a paſſage to other rooms, where the glowing tapeſtry of the Luxembourg was exchanged for plaiſtered walls, and where we had to ſuffer phyſical as well as moral evils, the weather being intenſely cold, and our wretched gallery having neither ſtove nor chimney. One circumſtance tended to make our ſituation tolerable, which was that true ſpirit of fraternity that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in our community, conſiſting of about forty female priſoners beſides the nuns. Into how happy a region would the world be transformed, if that
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031634_0095_0FED6199C7CDD938"/>
mutual forbearance and amity were to be found in it which had power to cheer even the gloom of a priſon!</p>
            <p>In addition to the tie of common calamity was the tie of a common country; and in our preſent ſituation this bond of union appeared ſo ſtrong, that it ſeemed, as Dr. Johnſon ſaid of family relations, that we were born each others friends. It was the general ſtudy of the whole community to prevent each others wiſhes. There were no rich amongſt us. The rich had made themſelves wings, and vaniſhed away before the promulgation of the law againſt the Engliſh; but thoſe who had ſtill any reſources left, ſhared all their little luxuries and indulgencies with thoſe that had none. The young ſuccoured the old, the active ſerved the infirm, and the gay cheered the dejected. There were indeed among us a few perſons, who born of French parents, having paſſed their whole lives in France, and not ſpeaking one word of our native language, ſeemed aſtoniſhed to find by their impriſonment that they were Engliſh women. They had no trace or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of that country which in evil hour chanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give them birth, and did not eaſily reconcile themſelves to the grated convent, while their French ſiſters were enjoying perfect liberty.</p>
            <p>When ſuch of the former nobility who were our fellow-priſoners at the Luxembourg heard that we were going to be transferred to the fauxbourg St. Antoine, they gathered round us to expreſs their fears for our ſafety in that frightful quarter of the city. I was perſuaded, on the contrary, that we had much more to fear while ſhut up in this ſtate priſon with themſelves, than in the fauxbourg St. Antoine, the inhabitants of which were chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of workmen and mechanics, who in the courſe of the revolution had acted too much in
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:031634_0096_0FED61442DA55938"/>
union to be led to perpetrate any partial miſchief; ſince thoſe immenſe numbers which had power to overthrow government could not be bribed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit maſſacres.</p>
            <p>The adminiſtrators of the police, when they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered preparations to be made for our reception, announced us to the ſection as being all the wives and daughters of milords anglois. This was no auſpicious introduction: accordingly our firſt care was to lay aſide the honours and dignities conferred upon us by the officers of the police, and which certainly would not have been confirmed by the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald's office. The only diſtinction we now envied was that of belonging to the privileged claſs who gained their bread by the labour of their hands, and who alone were exempted from the penalties of the law. We would thankfully have conſented to purchaſe at the price of toil the ſweets of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when bereaved of which the ſickening ſoul grows weary of exiſtence. In vain we tried to twine the flowers of ſocial pleaſure around the bars of our priſon; in vain we "took the viol and the harp, or endeavoured to rejoice at the ſound of the organ." That good which alone gives value to every other, was wanting; and muſic was diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and converſation joyleſs.</p>
            <p>Having repelled the calumnious report of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the revolutionary committee of our ſection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe inſpection we were placed, and who viſited us in ſucceſſion every day, began to look upon us with a more propitious eye; and leſt our health ſhould be impaired by confinement, they unlocked the garden gate, of the key of which ſince our arrival they had taken poſſeſſion, to prevent any attempts to ſcale the walls, and permitted us to walk two hours every day accompanied by themſelves. During theſe walks we found means to convince them that we had been
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031634_0097_0FED61FBC0276DC0"/>
guilty of no other offence againſt the ſtate, than that of being born in England; and the common principles of juſtice taught theſe unlettered patriots to lament the ſeverity of our fate, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſoften by every mark of honeſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The viſits of the adminiſtration of police were far leſs agreeable than thoſe of our good commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The firſt time they came, Brutus, one of their ſecretaries, fired with uncontrolable rage at the ſight of the nun who unlocked the gate for his admiſſion, rudely ſeized her veil, which he was with difficulty prevented from tearing off her face. This ferocious pagan threw down the croſs which was erected in the garden, and trampled it under foot; and having poured forth a volley of impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the great bell, which ſtill hung at the ſteeple inſtead of being transformed into a cannon, he left the diſmayed nuns trembling with horror, and haſtened to denounce the veils, the croſſes, and the great bell at the municipality. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pache, the mayor of Paris, ſent orders for the bell to be taken down, the croſſes to be removed, and the nuns to throw off their habits immediately. Nothing could exceed their deſpair upon receiving this municipal mandate. The convent reſounded with lamentations, and the veils which were now to be caſt off were bathed with tears.</p>
            <p>There was, however, little time to be allowed to the indulgence of unavailing ſorrow. Brutus might return, and it was neceſſary to proceed to action. Accordingly, a council of caps was called in the room of the ſuperior; and after a delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes interrupted by ſighs and ſometimes by pleaſantry, we all went to work, and in a few hours ſweeping trains were converted into gowns, and flowing veils into bonnets. One charming
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031634_0098_0FED6147FB979998"/>
young nun, who was a penſive enthuſiaſt, begged that, if it were poſſible, her bonnet might ſhroud her face altogether; while another, whoſe regards were not entirely turned away from this world, hinted that ſhe ſhould have no objection to the decoration of a bow.</p>
            <p>My chief conſolation during my confinement aroſe from the ſociety of ſiſter Thereſa, that amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nun who ſo much wiſhed to hide a face which nature had formed to excite love and admiration. It was impoſſible to converſe with her without feeling that the revolution was a bleſſing, if it was only for having prohibited vows which robbed ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of thoſe who were formed to be its delight and ornament. I never met with a human creature who ſeemed to approach nearer to the ideas we form of angelic purity, who poſſeſſed a more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected ſpirit, or a more tender heart. Devotion was her firſt delight, her unfailing ſource of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and ſometimes, inſtead of regretting her fate, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> her feelings, and was tempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim with Pope,

            <p>We were allowed the melancholy indulgence of ſeeing our friends through an iron grate; and there were ſtill among the French ſome perſons whoſe courageous friendſhip, undiſmayed by all the frowns of power, and the increaſing terrors of revolutionary meaſures, did not abandon us in our priſon. The
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031634_0099_0FED6277D2201360"/>
greater part of the Engliſh who were yet in France, having been eſtabliſhed in that country for years, had acquired ſome friends who lamented their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and who riſqued their own perſonal ſafety by making unwearied efforts for their deliverance. The dreſs of our viſitors was indeed not a little gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque, the period being now arrived when the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigns of patriotiſm were dirty linen, pantaloons, uncombed hair, red caps, or black wigs, and all, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſalind ſays, "denoting a careleſs diſorder." The obſolete term of <hi>muſcadin,</hi> which means a ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fop, was revived; and every man who had the boldneſs to appear in a clean ſhirt was branded with that appellation, and every woman who wore a hat was a <hi>muſcadine;</hi> for the period was ſtill remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when a round cap was the badge of roture, nor were the ariſtocratical pretenſions of the hat yet bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in oblivion. It is remarkable enough, that at this period Robeſpierre always appeared not only dreſſed with neatneſs, but with ſome degree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and, while he called himſelf the leader of the ſans-culottes, never adopted the coſtume of his band. His hideous countenance, far from being involved in a black wig, was decorated with hair carefully arranged, and nicely powdered; while he endeavoured to hide thoſe emotions of his inhuman ſoul which his eyes might ſometimes have betrayed, beneath a large pair of green ſpectacles, though he had no defect in his ſight.</p>
            <p>At this period one of the moſt accompliſhed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that France has produced periſhed on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. This lady was Madame Roland, the wife of the late miniſter. On the 31ſt of May he had fled from his proſecutors, and his wife who remained was carried to priſon. The wits obſerved on this occaſion, that the body of Roland was miſſing, but that he had left his ſoul behind. Madame Roland
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031634_0100_0FED62C527FB2350"/>
was indeed poſſeſſed of the moſt diſtinguiſhed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and a mind highly cultivated by the ſtudy of literature. I have been acquainted with her ſince I firſt came to France, and had always obſerved in her converſation the moſt ardent attachment to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the moſt enlarged ſentiments of philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy; ſentiments which ſhe developed with an eloquence peculiar to herſelf, with a flow and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of expreſſion which gave new graces and new energy to the French language. With theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary endowments of mind ſhe united all the warmth of a feeling heart, and all the charms of the moſt elegant manners. She was tall and well ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her air was dignified, and although more than thirty-five years of age ſhe was ſtill handſome. Her countenance had an expreſſion of uncommon ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and her full dark eyes beamed with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rays of intelligence. I viſited her in the priſon of St. Pelagie, where her ſoul, ſuperior to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, retained its accuſtomed ſerenity, and ſhe converſed with the ſame animated cheerfulneſs in her little cell as ſhe uſed to do in the hotel of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. She had provided herſelf with a few books, and I found her reading Plutarch. She told me ſhe expected to die; and the look of placid reſignation with which ſhe ſpoke of it, convinced me that ſhe was prepared to meet death with a firmneſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her exalted character. When I enquired after her daughter, an only child of thirteen years of age, ſhe burſt into tears; and at the overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recollection of her huſband and her child, the courage of the victim of liberty was loſt in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wife and the mother.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the murder of the Gironde ſhe was ſent to the Conciergerie, like them to undergo the mockery of a trial, and like them to periſh.

When brought before the revolutionary tribunal ſhe preſerved the moſt heroical firmneſs, though ſhe was treated with ſuch barbarity, and inſulted by queſtions ſo injurious to her honour, that ſometimes the tears of indignation ſtarted from her eyes. This celebrated woman, who at the bar of the national convention had by the commanding graces of her eloquence forced even from her enemies the tribute of applauſe and admiration, was now in the hands of vulgar wretches, by whom her fine talents, far from being appreciated, were not even underſtood. I ſhall tranſcribe a copy of her defence taken from her own manuſcript<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. III.</note>. With keen regret I muſt add, that ſome papers in her juſtification, which ſhe ſent me from her priſon, perhaps with a view that at ſome happier period, when the voice of innocence might be heard, I ſhould make them public, I was compelled to deſtroy, the night on which I was my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf arreſted; ſince, had they been found in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, they would inevitably have involved me in her fate. Before I took this reſolution, which coſt me a cruel effort, I employed every means in my power to preſerve thoſe precious memorials, in vain; for I could find no perſon who would venture to keep them amidſt the terrors of domiciliary viſits, and the certainty, if they were found, of being put to death as an accomplice of the writer. But her fair fame ſtands in no need of ſuch teſtimonials: her memory is embalmed in the minds of the wiſe and good, as one of thoſe glorious martyrs who have ſealed with their blood the liberties of their country. After hearing her ſentence, ſhe ſaid, "Vous me jugez digne de partager le ſort des grands hommes que vous avez aſſaſſinés. Je tâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherai

            <p>On the day of her trial ſhe dreſſed herſelf in white: her long dark hair flowed looſely to her waiſt, and her figure would have ſoftened any hearts leſs fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than thoſe of her judges. On her way to the ſcaffold ſhe was not only compoſed, but ſometimes aſſumed an air of gaiety, in order to encourage a perſon who was condemned to die at the ſame time, but who was not armed with the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>When more than one perſon is led at the ſame time to execution, ſince they can ſuffer only in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, thoſe who are reſerved to the laſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to feel multiplied deaths at the ſound of the falling inſtrument, and the ſight of the bloody ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. To be the firſt victim was therefore conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a privilege, and had been allowed to Madame Roland as a woman. But when ſhe obſerved the diſmay of her companion, ſhe ſaid to him, "Allez le premier: que je vous epargne au moins la dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur de voir couler mon ſang<note n="†" place="bottom">"Go firſt; let me at leaſt ſpare you the pain of ſeeing my blood ſhed."</note>." She then turned to the executioner, and begged that this ſad indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might be granted to her fellow-ſufferer. The executioner told her that he had received orders that ſhe ſhould periſh firſt. "But you cannot, I am ſure," ſaid ſhe with a ſmile, "refuſe the laſt requeſt of a lady." The executioner complied with her demand. When ſhe mounted the ſcaffold, and was tied to the fatal plank, ſhe lifted up her eyes to the ſtatue of Liberty, near which the guillotine was
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031634_0103_0FED62C9A5029C00"/>
placed, and exclaimed, "Ah Liberté, comme on t'a Jouée<note n="*" place="bottom">"Ah liberty! how haſt thou been ſported with!"</note>!" The next moment ſhe periſhed. But her name will be recorded in the annals of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as one of thoſe illuſtrious women whoſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior attainments ſeem fitted to exalt her ſex in the ſcale of being.</p>
            <p>She had predicted that her huſband would not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her loſs, and her prediction was fulfilled. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who had concealed himſelf till this period, no ſooner heard the fate of his wife, whoſe influence over his mind had often been a ſubject of reproach amongſt his enemies, than, feeling that life was no longer worth poſſeſſing, he put an end to his exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. His body was found in a wood near the high-road between Paris and Rouen: the papers which were in his pocket-book were ſent to the committee of general ſafety, and have never ſeen the light. His unhappy daughter found an aſylum with an old friend of her proſcribed parents, who had the courage to receive her at a period when it was imminently dangerous to afford her protection. But the time probably now draws near when this child will be adopted by her country, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable proviſion will be made for her, as a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of national gratitude towards thoſe who gave her birth.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the extraordinary changes which were paſſing in France, the convention now changed time itſelf, and decreed the new calendar. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was made on it, ſo philoſophical and ſo pleaſing to the imagination, that, amidſt the ſanguinary meaſures of thoſe days, it ſeemed to the oppreſſed heart what a ſolitary ſpot of freſh verdure appears to the eye amidſt the craggineſs of louring rocks, or the gloom of ſavage deſerts. Love of change is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoon learnt to count the days of my captivity by the new calendar, which was highly neceſſary, ſince, if a reclamation for liberty had been dated on Monday inſtead of <hi>Primidi,</hi> or on Tueſday to the neglect of <hi>Duodi,</hi> the police would not only have paſſed to the order of the day, but declared the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſuſpect.</hi> After two months impriſonment we obtained our liberty, in conſequence of the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried efforts which were made for that purpoſe by a young Frenchman whom my ſiſter has ſince mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. He was at Rouen in Normandy when the decree againſt the Engliſh arrived, and a few hours after ſaw a long proceſſion of coaches paſs through the ſtreets filled with Engliſh priſoners, who, juſt torn from their families and their homes, were weeping bitterly. Deeply affected by his ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, he flew to Paris with the reſolution of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our liberty, or of ſharing our priſon.

            <p>With what delicious emotions did we return to our own habitation! After paſſing two months in priſon at ſuch a period, we felt the bleſſedneſs of home in its full extent. To range through our own apartments without being purſued by guards or jailors, to return to domeſtic comforts and domeſtic peace, excited ſenſations the moſt delightful. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety had indeed vaniſhed, and home was but a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der priſon, where we lived in voluntary ſecluſion, trembling at every knock at the gate, leſt it ſhould bring the mandate of a new arreſtation; and afraid to venture out, leſt we ſhould be found guilty of an Engliſh phyſiognomy, by ſome of the numerous ſpies of the police, who were continually prowling through the ſtreets of Paris. Theſe indeed were the only perſons we had to fear; for even at the very moment when the permanent order of the day at the Jacobins was the crimes of the Engliſh, far from receiving the ſmalleſt inſult from the people of Paris, they diſplayed the utmoſt ſympathy for our ſituation, and our releaſe from priſon ſeemed to diffuſe general ſatisfaction through our whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>

            <p>A FEW weeks after our releaſe from priſon, Rabaut de St. Etienne was put to death. He was one of the moſt enlightened and virtuous men whom the revolution had called forth, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired general eſteem by his conduct as a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and conſiderable reputation by his talents as a writer. He was the preſident of the famous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of twelve, which was appointed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, previouſly to the 31ſt of May, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the conſpiracies which threatened its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and which, as I have already related, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened its partial diſſolution. Rabaut, as often as he preſented himſelf to make the report, was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the interruptions of the conſpirators and their agents to retire from the tribune, until that moment arrived, when he, together with the members of the commiſſion, and the deputies of the Gironde, were expelled, or torn from the convention! I ſaw him on this memorable day (for he took ſhelter for a few hours at our houſe) filled with deſpair, not ſo much for the loſs of his own life, which he then conſidered as inevitable, as for that of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his country, now falling under the vileſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031634_0107_0FED632CF8849CD8"/>
deſpotiſm. He eſcaped arreſt on the 2d of June, from not having been preſent at the convention when the conſpirators conſummated their crime by means of the military force of Paris, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf in the houſe of a friend, with his brother, one of the ſeventy-three deputies who had ſigned the proteſt.</p>
            <p>They encloſed part of a room for their place of ſhelter, and built up the wall with their own hands, placing a book-caſe before the entrance, ſo that there was not the leaſt appearance of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They employed a carpenter, in whom they had great confidence, to make the door, and the wretch betrayed them. Rabaut de St. Etienne was immediately brought before the revolutionary tribunal to have his perſon identified, for he was now outlawed, which in France is the ſentence of death. He was led to execution; and his wife, a moſt amiable women, unable to ſupport the loſs of a huſband whom ſhe tenderly loved, put an end to her exiſtence. His brother was taken to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciergerie, where he languiſhed with three other victims, for many months in a ſubterraneous dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; and there being only one bed allotted for four perſons, he lay upon the damp floor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſuch violent diſorders, that his life was long deſpaired of. He has now taken his ſeat in the convention. The generous friend and his wife, who had given the brothers an aſylum, were alſo dragged to priſon; and ſome time after were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for this noble act of friendſhip, to periſh on the ſcaffold.</p>
            <p>If France, during the unrelenting tyranny of Robeſpierre, exhibited unexampled crimes, it was alſo the ſcene of extraordinary virtue; of the moſt affecting inſtances of magnanimity and kindneſs. Of this nature was the conduct of a young man,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031634_0108_0FED63368F0F5CA8"/>
who being a priſoner with his brother, happened to be preſent when the names of the victims were called over, who were ſummoned to appear the next day before the ſanguinary tribunal. The young man found the name of his brother, who at that moment was abſent, upon the fatal liſt. He pauſed only an inſtant to reflect, that the life of the father of a large family was of more value than his own; he anſwered the call, ſurrendered himſelf to the officer, and was executed in his brother's ſtead. A father made the ſame ſacrifice for his ſon; for the tribunal was ſo negligent of forms, that it was not difficult to deceive its vigilance.</p>
            <p>The increaſing horrors which every day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, had at length the effect of extinguiſhing in every heart the love of life, that ſentiment which clings ſo faſt to our nature. To die, and to get beyond the reach of oppreſſion, appeared a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and perhaps nothing appalled the ſouls of the tyrants ſo much as that ſerenity with which their victims went to execution. The page of hiſtory has held up to the admiration of ſucceeding ages, thoſe philoſophers who have met death with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But had they been led among the victims of Robeſpierre to execution, they would have found themſelves, in this reſpect, undiſtinguiſhed from the crowd. They would have ſeen perſons of each ſex, of all ages, and all conditions, looking upon death with a contempt equal to their own. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates expiring ſurrounded by his friends, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca and Lucan ſinking gently into death, have perhaps leſs claim to admiration than thoſe bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauties, who in all the firſt freſhneſs of youth, in the very ſpring of life, ſubmitted to the ſtroke of the executioner with placid ſmiles on their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, and looked like angels in their flight to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:031634_0109_0FED628AC2709E58"/>
Among the victims of the tyrants, the women have been peculiarly diſtinguiſhed for their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable firmneſs in death. Perhaps this aroſe from the ſuperior ſenſibility which belongs to the female mind, and which made it feel that it was leſs terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to die, than to ſurvive the objects of its tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When the general who commanded at Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy on its ſurrender to the Pruſſians was condemned to die, his wife, a beautiful young woman of four-and-twenty years of age, who heard the ſentence pronounced, cried out in a tone of deſpair, "Vive le roi!" The inhumane tribunal, inſtead of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting her conduct to diſtraction, condemned her to die. Her huſband, when he was placed in the cart, was filled with aſtoniſhment and anguiſh when he ſaw his beloved wife led towards it. The people, ſhocked at the ſpectacle, followed her to the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, crying, "Elle n'a pas mérité la mort." "Mes amis," ſaid ſhe, "c'eſt ma faute; j'ai vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lu périr avec mon mari<note n="*" place="bottom">"She did not deſerve death."—"My friends, it is my own fault; I was reſolved to periſh with my huſband."</note>."</p>
            <p>The fury of theſe implacable monſters ſeemed directed with peculiar virulence againſt that ſex, whoſe weakneſs man was deſtined by nature to ſupport. The ſcaffold was every day bathed with the blood of women. Some who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, but had been reſpited on account of their pregnancy, were dragged to death immediately after their delivery, in that ſtate of weakneſs which ſavages would have reſpected. One unfortunate woman, the wife of a peaſant, had been brought to Paris, with nineteen other women of the ſame claſs, and condemned to die with her companions. She heard her ſentence without emotion; but when they came to carry her to execution, and take
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031634_0110_0FED6358891DADE0"/>
away the infant who was hanging at her breaſt, and receiving that nouriſhment of which death was ſo ſoon to dry up the ſource, ſhe rent the air with her cries, with the ſtrong ſhriek of inſtinctive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the piercing throes of maternal tenderneſs—But in vain! the infant was torn from the boſom that cheriſhed it, and the agonies of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mother found reſpite in death.</p>
            <p>Fourteen young girls of Verdun, who had danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a ball given by the Pruſſians, were led to the ſcaffold together, and looked like nymphs adorned for a feſtival. Sometimes whole generations were ſwept away at one moment; and the tribunal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited many a family-piece, which has almoſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the heart of humanity. Maleſherbes, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Louis XVI. was condemned to die, at eighty years of age, with his daughter, and ſon-in-law, his grand-daughter and grand-ſon.</p>
            <p>His daughter ſeemed to have loſt ſight of every earthly object but her venerable parent: ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him a thouſand times on the way to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; bathed his face with her tears; and when the miniſter of death dragged her from him, forgetting that the next moment put an end to her own, ſhe exclaimed, "Wretch, are you going to murder my father?"</p>
            <p>Theſe proſcribed families ſeemed to find the ſweeteſt ſource of conſolation in dying together, and to conſider the momentary paſſage which they were going to make, as ſo much the leſs painful, ſince they ſhould undergo no ſeparation, but enter at the ſame inſtant into another ſtate of exiſtence. A young lady, the former marchioneſs of Bois-Berenger, was impriſoned in the Luxembourg with her whole family. When her father, mother, and younger ſiſter received their act of accuſation, and ſhe found herſelf alone exempted, ſhe ſhed a flood
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031634_0111_0FED62FB06280CC0"/>
of tears, her heart was overwhelmed with anguiſh. "You will die without me," ſhe cried; "I am condemned to ſurvive you; we ſhall not periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether!" While ſhe abandoned herſelf to deſpair, her act of accuſation arrived: a ray of tranſport was inſtantly diffuſed over her countenance, ſhe flew into the arms of her parents, and embraced them. "My dear mother," ſhe exclaimed, "we ſhall die together!" When the family was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Conciergerie, ſhe never left her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a moment, but watched over her with unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried tenderneſs; and while ſhe tried to ſooth her ſufferings by her filial endearments, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to inſpire her with courage by the example of her own heroic fortitude. It was the picture of a ſort of Roman charity. The unfortunate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was mute, and her whole ſoul ſeemed petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with horror. She ſeemed another Niobe. Her admirable daughter died with the moſt noble reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle Maleſi, her younger ſiſter, when condemned to die, ſaid to her father with naïveté, "Je me ſerrerai tant contre vous, mon bon pere, vous qui êtes ſi honnête homme, que Dieu me laiſſera paſſer malgré mes pêchés<note n="*" place="bottom">"I will cling ſo faſt to you, my dear father, you, who are ſo good, that God will ſuffer me to paſs in ſpite of my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions."</note>."</p>
            <p>In the priſon of the Force, the men were allowed to breathe the air in a court-yard ſeparated by a wall from the habitation of the women. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſewer was the only means of communication. At that ſpot, an unhappy ſon preſented himſelf every morning and every night, to enquire after his mother, who was condemned to die, but reprieved becauſe ſhe was pregnant, and after her dilivery executed. That pious child, in his early age al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031634_0112_0FED62C6D60E35B0"/>
the victim of misfortune, knelt down before the infectious ſewer, and, with his mouth placed upon the hole, poured forth the feelings of his filial tenderneſs. His younger brother, a lovely child of three years of age, and who was ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with his mother till the laſt moments, was often placed at the oppoſite end of the fewer, and anſwered for his mother when ſhe was too ill to undertake that taſk herſelf. A perſon of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance heard him ſay, "Mama a moins pleure cette nuit—un peu repoſee, et te fouhaite le bon jour; c'eſt Lolo, qui t'aime bien, qui te dit cela<note n="*" place="bottom">"Mama has not cried ſo much to-night—She has ſlept a little, and wiſhes you a good morning: it is Lolo who ſpeaks to you, who loves you very much."</note>." At length this unfortunate mother, when going to execution, tranſmitted to her ſon, by the ſewer, her long and graceful treſſes, as the only inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhe had to give. She then bade her infant a laſt farewell, and was led to the ſcaffold, where her huſband had periſhed ſome months before.</p>
            <p>One of the perſons moſt diſtinguiſhed by their noble contempt of death was Girey Dupré, with whom I was well acquainted. He was the writer of a paper called the Patriote François, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Briſſot: he had acquired a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of literary reputation, and maintained his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a widow, by the labours of his pen. He was twenty-four years of age, and his countenance was one of the moſt agreeable I ever ſaw. To theſe perſonal advantages he united the moſt frank and pleaſing manners, and diſtinguiſhed powers of converſation. He had defended the deputies of the Gironde with too much energy not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in their fate, and he was alſo connected by the ties of friendſhip with Briſſot. Dupré was forced to fly from his perſecutors, and ſeek refuge
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031634_0113_0FED62FF8519C940"/>
at Bordeaux, where he was ſeized and brought back in irons to Paris. Far from being depreſſed by his approaching fate, the natural gaiety of his diſpoſition never forſook him a ſingle moment. When interrogated at the tribunal with reſpect to his connection with Briſſot, he anſwered only in theſe words<note n="*" place="bottom">"I knew Briſſot; I atteſt that he lived like Ariſtides, and died like Sydney the martyr of liberty."</note>, "J'ai connu Briſſot; j'atteſte qu'il a vécu comme Ariſtide, et qu'il eſt mort comme Sydney martyr de la liberté." He preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the tribunal with his hair cut off, the collar of his ſhirt thrown open, and already prepared for the ſtroke of the executioner. On his way to the ſcaffold he ſaw Robeſpierre's miſtreſs at the window of his lodging, with her ſiſter, and ſome of their ferocious accomplices. "A bas les tyrans et les dictateurs<note n="†" place="bottom">"Down with tyrants and Dictators!"</note>!" cried Dupré, repeating this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic exclamation till he loſt ſight of the houſe. While going to execution, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ung in a triumphant tone a very popular patriotic ſong which he had himſelf compoſed, and of which the chorus was "Plutôt la mort que l'eſclavage<note n="‡" place="bottom">"Rather death than ſlavery!"</note>." That che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed ſentiment he fondly repeated even to his laſt moment, and death left the half-finiſhed ſentence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his lips:</p>
            <p>Claviere, who had been contemporary miniſter with Roland, and who was impriſoned in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciergerie, upon receiving his act of accuſation, ſaw that the liſt of witneſſes againſt him was compoſed of his moſt implacable enemies. "Theſe are aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins," ſaid he to a fellow-priſoner; "I will ſnatch myſelf from their rage." He then repeated theſe lines of Voltaire,
<q>
                  <l>Les criminels tremblans ſont trainés au ſupplice;</l>
                  <l>Les mortels généreux diſpoſent de leur ſort:</l>

               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:031634_0114_0FED62D0947F3528"/>
and after deliberating with his companion upon the moſt effectual manner of ſtriking himſelf ſo that the dagger might reach his heart, he retired to his cell, where he was found a few minutes after breathing his laſt ſigh. Madam Claviere, upon receiving the tidings of his death, ſwallowed poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, after having embraced her children, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her affairs. Notwithſtanding his ſuicide, the property of Clavierre was confiſcated, as if he had been regularly condemned. A law had lately been paſſed to conſtrue an act of ſuicide into a counter-revolutionary project, when the father of a family who knew that his life was devoted, had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily put an end to his exiſtence in the hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his children from want. Robeſpierre and his financial agents found nothing more preſſing than to baffle thoſe conſpiracies againſt the revenues of their government; for confiſcation was ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the leading motive for the great maſs of their judicial aſſaſſinations, that the guillotine, amongſt other numerous titles, was moſt generally called the "miniſter of finance." The tribunal now began to uſe the language of the orator<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Sheridan's eloquent ſpeech on Mr. Haſtings's trial.</note>, "to look into their caſh account for delinquency, and found the offenders guilty of ſo many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds worth of treaſon.

            <p>On ſome occaſions the genuine feelings of nature burſt forth amidſt the ſtupefied terror that had fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen every heart. A law had lately paſſed, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every merchant to inſcribe on his door the ſtock of merchandize in his warehouſe, under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031634_0115_0FED62D518B1A7C0"/>
of death. A wine-merchant, whoſe affairs had called him haſtily into the country, entruſted the buſineſs of the inſcription to his ſon, who from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or negligence, for it was clearly proved that there exiſted no intention of fraud, had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to affix the declaration in the preciſe words of the law. The conſcientious jury of the revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary tribunal condemned him to death, preſuming on the counter-revolutionary intention in this caſe from the act, though they were in general accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, for want of other evidence, to find the act by gueſſing at the intention. The innocent priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had prepared himſelf for death, when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of juſtice, informed of the caſe, wrote to the convention, demanding a reſpite. His letter had not been half read before the hall reſounded with the cry of "reprieve, reprieve!" and fearing that the act of parliament would arrive too late, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, diſpenſing with the uſual formalities, not only ſent its officers and part of the military force, but great numbers of the deputies ruſhed out to ſtop the execution. The officer who received the order firſt, with which he flew towards the place of the revolution, told me that on his coming out of the convention he ſaw the ſcaffold reared and the crowd aſſembled. He had ſcarcely reached the firſt tree of the viſta when he ſaw the fatal knife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; he redoubled his ſpeed, but before he got to the end of the walk another head had fallen: a third perſon had mounted the ſcaffold, but the voice of the meſſenger was too weak, from the efforts he had made to reach the ſpot, to be noticed by the multitude. The fourth had aſcended when he gained the place, ruſhed through the crowd, called to the executioner, and leaped on the ſcaffold. The priſoner had been ſtripped, his ſhoulders were bare, and he was already tied to the plank; when the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031634_0116_0FED62DBDB86EFA0"/>
cry of "reprieve" burſt forth. The officer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his name, which the young man told him. "Alas! you are not the perſon," he replied. The priſoner ſubmitted calmly to his fate.</p>
            <p>The bearer of the reprieve, who is a perſon of a very benevolent diſpoſition, declared that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt ſo acute a pang as when he was compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn away from this unfortunate victim. He haſtened, however, to the priſon, where he found the perſon who was reprieved awaiting the return of the cart and the executioner, his hair cut and his hands tied, to be led to death at another part of the city where his houſe ſtood. A wife and nine children were deploring the miſerable loſs of a huſband and a father, when the officer who had brought the tidings of life to the priſoner, went at his requeſt to carry them to his diſtracted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. I need not deſcribe what he related to me of the ſcene—your heart will readily fill up the picture.</p>
            <p>That claſs of men who were peculiarly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the tyrant's rage-were men of letters, with reſpect to whom the jealouſy of the rival mingled with the fury of the oppreſſor, and againſt whom his hatred was leſs implacable for having oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his tyranny, than for having eclipſed his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It is a curious conſideration, that the unexampled crimes of this ſanguinary uſurper, and the conſequent miſeries which have deſolated the fineſt country of Europe, may perhaps, if traced to their ſource, be found to ariſe from the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a diſappointed wit. Robeſpierre, for the misfortune of humanity, was perſecuted by the moſt reſtleſs deſire of diſtinguiſhing himſelf as an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and nature had denied him the power. He and his brother were born at Arras, and left orphans at an early age. The biſhop of Arras had beſtowed on them the advantages of a liberal education. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpierre
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031634_0117_0FED6290F9580DC0"/>
diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his application to his firſt ſtudies, and obtained many literary prizes. At the age of ſixteen, elated by the applauſe he had received, he fancied himſelf endowed with ſuch rare power of genius as would enable him to act a ſplendid part on the theatre of the world, and his friends indulged the ſame fond expectation. He applied to the ſtudy of the law, and already in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination contemplated himſelf diſputing with the firſt orators of the age the palm of eloquence. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, however, convinced his friends, and at length himſelf, that they had indulged a vain illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He diſcovered no taſte or aptitude for the profeſſion for which he was deſigned, became wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſtudy, was checked by the ſlighteſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and being found deſtitute of thoſe talents which were neceſſary to his ſucceſs as a public ſpeaker, his benefactor, after a trial of ſufficient length, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſupport him any longer at a conſiderable and fruitleſs expence at Paris, but ordered him to return to Arras, where in an humble ſphere, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to the mediocrity of his abilities, he might purſue his profeſſion as a lawyer. Robeſpierre was compelled to return to Arras; which, after the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did dreams he had indulged of fame and honours in the capital, was an humiliation he felt keenly, but which he brooded over in ſilence: for he never on any occaſion diſplayed his ſenſibility to mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was in proportion to his exceſſive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but concentered within his vindictive ſoul his diſgrace, his reſentment, and his projects of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. From the period of his return to Arras may be dated his abhorrence of men of talents. From that moment, inſtead of admiring genius, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined at its exiſtence. The ſame feelings clung to his baſe and envious ſpirit when he had uſurped his dictatorial power. He made it pain of death to be
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031634_0118_0FED62E44F1D3B70"/>
the author of what he called ſeditious publications, by which means it was eaſy for him to involve men of letters in a general proſcription. He ſuppreſſed every dramatic piece in which there were any allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he diſliked, or wherein the picture or hiſtory held up to view any feature of his own character. And it was his plan to aboliſh theatrical entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments altogether; for he conſidered the applauſe beſtowed on fine poetry as ſomething of which his harangues were defrauded. He held up men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the people as perſons hoſtile to the cauſe of liberty, and incapable of raiſing themſelves to the height of the revolution; and to make them ſtill greater objects of miſtruſt and ſuſpicion, he had long inſtructed his agents to declaim unceaſingly againſt them as <hi>ſtateſmen;</hi> the meaning of which word, in the dictionary of theſe conſpirators, was counter-revolutioniſt. Their ſyſtem had even ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſome maturity, when Briſſot, in his ſpeech for an appeal to the people on the trial of the late king, thus pourtrays them:</p>

            <p>One of the objects of Robeſpierre's reſentment was M. Bitauby, a Pruſſian, well known in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary world by his elegant tranſlation of Homer into French. He was a member of the academy at Berlin, from which the king of Pruſſia ordered his name to be ſtruck out, and the penſion with which the great Frederic had rewarded his merit to be diſcontinued, on account of his avowed attachment to the principles of the revolution. M. Bitauby had fixed his reſidence at Paris ſeveral years previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to that event. I have been acquainted with him and his lady ſince my firſt arrival in France, and have never met with perſons who blended with the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031634_0120_0FED632B4D2F6978"/>
wiſdom and ſeriouſneſs of age, ſo much of all that is amiable in youth. M. Bitauby, in the firſt days of the revolution, had been perſonally acquainted with Robeſpierre, who frequently dined at his houſe; but he was not long in diſcovering the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary and fanatical ideas of liberty which filled the ſoul of the tyrant, and which ſo much diſguſted him that he gave up his acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Robeſpierre did not forget the affront, which he had now the power to avenge. M. Bitauby and his wife were dragged to priſon in the beginning of the winter, where they languiſhed ten months; and deprived of thoſe cares which their age and their infirmities required, they had almoſt ſunk beneath their weight. Madame Bitauby's indiſpoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired medical aſſiſtance; but ſo many formalities were neceſſary before a phyſician could be admitted into the priſon, that, if the diſorder was not of a lingering nature, the patient expired while the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice were arranging the ceremonials previous to his relief. During the laſt months of Robeſpierre's uſurpation, the priſoners were refuſed the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being attended by their own phyſicians. Profeſſional men were appointed by the police; and as ſelections were made among thoſe who were able to give clearer proofs of their Jacobin principles than of their medical ſkill, theſe revolutionary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſometimes robbed the revolutionary jury of their prey. A few however of theſe "officers of health" poſſeſſed the negative merit which Dr. Franklin aſcribed to old and experienced phyſicians, "<hi>they let</hi> their patients die," for the remedies they adminiſtered were of too harmleſs a nature to be capable of doing miſchief. The phyſician of the Conciergerie had as ſtrong a predilection for tiſanne as Dr. Sangrado for hot water. Tiſanne was the vivifying draught which was deſtined to ſooth all
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031634_0121_0FED6251DEEEDE78"/>
pains, and heal all maladies. One day the doctor, after having felt a patient's pulſe, ſaid to the jailor, "He is better this morning." "Yes," anſwered the jailor, "<hi>he</hi> is better, but the perſon who lay in this bed yeſterday is dead." "Eh bien," reſumed the doctor coolly, "qu'on donne toujours la tiſanne."</p>
            <p>M. and Madame Bitauby had an advocate in their diſtreſs whom it was difficult indeed to reſiſt. This was an old ſervant of eighty years of age. His fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was ſo intereſting that Sterne's pencil only could ſketch in well; and had Sterne ſeen him, he would not have failed to draw his portrait. He pleaded me cauſe of his maſter with ſuch pathetic eloquence, that at the revolutionary committee he ſometimes "drew iron tears from Pluto's cheek." But the old man was eloquent in vain, and was ſinking with deſpair into the grave when the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the 9th of Thermidor reſtored his maſter and miſtreſs of liberty.</p>

La Harpe was thrown into priſon, and was deſtined to periſh on the ſcaffold. The author of the Travels of the younger Anacharſis, notwithſtanding his advanced age, was the object of continual perſecution. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who was himſelf impriſoned, and condemned to ſee his deareſt friends periſh, had not ſufficient fortitude to ſuſtain ſuch trials.

            <p>ONE of the particular objects of Robeſpierre's rage was general Miranda, a native of Peru, well known in Europe by that philanthropic ſpirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture which led him to paſs many years in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling through various parts of the globe, with the view of being uſeful to his own country; which, ſince the period of the ſanguinary Spaniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, has groaned beneath the yoke of the moſt abject ſlavery. If this philoſophical enthuſiaſt ſhould not accompliſh the purpoſe for which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook his cruſade of patriotiſm, it has at leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031634_0124_0FED6254A992C6C8"/>
him to furniſh his mind with ſuch acquiſitions of knowledge, ſuch ſtores of obſervation, and ſuch a diſtinguiſhed taſte for the fine arts, as render his ſociety in the higheſt degree inſtructive and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; while with an underſtanding of the firſt order he unites that perfect ſimplicity of manners which uſually belongs to great minds<note n="*" place="bottom">Dumourier, in his Memoirs, while he does juſtice to Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's talents, complains of his "<hi>haughtineſs</hi> and <hi>hardneſs</hi> of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter." Miranda has certainly more of the ſedate dignity of a Spaniard, than the briſk air of a Frenchman; and if that eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul which ſcorns to make any compoſition with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be <hi>haughtineſs,</hi> and that inflexibility which ſtedfaſtly purſues the ſtraight path of integrity and honour be <hi>hardneſs of character,</hi> Dumourier is in the right.</note>.</p>
            <p>When the Pruſſians were on their march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Paris, Miranda accepted a command in the army of Dumourier, who was then retreating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. After the defeat of the Pruſſians, and on the entrance of the republican army into the Low Countries, Miranda added to the high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he had already acquired through Europe, by the gallant manner in which he executed that part of the conqueſt of thoſe countries which was allotted him. When Dumourier came to Paris, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole army devolved on Miranda; and when the campaign began, and Dumourier was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Holland, the attack of Maeſtricht, and the army on the Meuſe, were committed to his care. The ſucceſsful march of the Auſtrians on Aix-la-Chapelle obliged him to raiſe the ſiege; and he was joined ſoon after by Dumourier, who had left his conqueſt in Holland to repair the misfortunes of the army commanded by Valence. The ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which Dumourier had brought with him from Paris, where the Jacobins had already begun their ſyſtem of miſrule and anarchy, was not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031634_0125_0FED633F14A73370"/>
by ill ſucceſs; and goaded by the pang of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and of diſappointed ambition, he formed the criminal deſign of betraying the republic. This ſpirit of rebellion found the moſt inflexible oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Miranda, whoſe perſonal friendſhip for Dumourier did not lead him to forget that his firſt duty was towards that country which had entruſted him with its defence. The event of the battle of Nerwinden, fought againſt the repeated advice of Miranda, and in which this general loſt a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the troops he commanded, having been forced to ſuſtain the whole ſhock of the enemy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Dumourier the means of getting rid of an opponent ſo hoſtile to his deſigns; and Miranda was ſent by the commiſſaries La Croix and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, without being previouſly heard by them, to give an account of his conduct at the bar of the convention. He underwent the moſt ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the committees of war and general ſafety, who declared, that not the ſlighteſt doubt remained of his military conduct, or his fidelity to the republic. But this report was ſtifled by the intrigues of La Croix, Danton, and others of their party; and he was ſent, in defiance of all decency, to the revolutionary tribunal.</p>
            <p>His trial took place in the beginning of May, before juſtice had for ever fled from that ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary court. The hour of carnage was not yet arrived: the tribunal, though from its inſtitution terrible, and cruel in its forms, which placed the life of the accuſed upon a caſting voice, had not yet become a ſhrine conſecrated to infernal deities, and reeking with the daily ſacrifice of human vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims. The voice of innocence was not yet ſtifled by the ſavage vociferations of monſters thirſting for its blood; and Miranda pleaded his cauſe with ſuch ſublime energy, as proved that his powers as

an orator were not inferior to his talents as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He covered himſelf with glory, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with confuſion; and overſtepping the uſual forms, the jury made their verdict the vehicle of eulogium upon his conduct.</p>
            <p>After his trial he retired to a ſmall diſtance from Paris, where he lived in literary leiſure, amidſt his books and paintings, and where I viſited him frequently. His repoſe was however of ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He was too diſtinguiſhed a character to eſcape the tyranny which the conſpiracy of the 31ſt of May had eſtabliſhed; and after having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by domiciliary viſits on various pretences, he was again thrown into priſon, charged with being the chief defender and abettor of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronde and Girondiſm. The real cauſe of Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre's animoſity towards him is not well known, but may be reſolved into that general hatred which he bore towards all men of talents; and as he knew that the eminent abilities of Miranda were improved by advantages which had fallen to the lot of few, he might naturally think that the exiſtence of ſuch a man was dangerous to his own.</p>
            <p>Twice, in the zenith of his tyranny, he accuſed Miranda to his ſubjects the Jacobins; and when we heard that the name of Miranda had iſſued from thoſe peſtilential lips, we conſidered his murder as inevitable. One obſtacle was found ſufficient to ſhield him from the tyrant's vengeance; and this was a feeling of ſhame which lurked in the mind of the public accuſer, who, covered as he was with blood, did not dare to meet the look of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa, and bring forward a ſecond accuſation, after having once joined the general voice of applauſe upon his acquittal. This ſentiment led Fouquier Tainville to put off the ſecond trial required by Robeſpierre, till the tyrant would hear of delay
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031634_0127_0FED62B02F381AB0"/>
and excuſes no more; and himſelf inſcribed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa's name on the fatal liſt for the twelfth of Thermidor. The revolution of the tenth reſtored him to liberty.</p>
            <p>Miranda ſubmitted to an impriſonment of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, under the continual expectation of death, with that philoſophical ſtrength of mind which he poſſeſſes in a moſt emiment degree. He had indeed determined not to be dragged to the guillotine, and had therefore provided himſelf with poiſon. Thus armed, he ſent for a conſiderable number of books from his library, and placed them in his little chamber, of which he found means to keep the ſole poſſeſſion. Here he told me, that he endeavoured to forget his preſent ſituation in the ſtudy of hiſtory and ſcience. He tried to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelf as a paſſenger on a long voyage, who had to fill up the vacuity of time with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of knowledge, and was alike prepared to periſh or to reach the ſhore. During his long confinement, the only perſon with whom he aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated was the former marquis Achille Du Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet, who poſſeſſed all the accompliſhments of literature, and whom the tyrants had dragged to priſon while the wounds were yet unhealed which he had received in defending his country. He and Miranda uſed to meet every evening, take their tea together, and talk over the books they had read during the day, avoiding as much as poſſible the ſubject of politics, which affected them too deeply, nor could Du Chatalet bear to pronounce the names of the decemvirs. Tidings, however, of the horrible ſcenes which were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Paris reached him in the gloom of his priſon; and the emotions of his mind, together with the irritation of his wound, produced a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Miranda attended him day and night alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031634_0128_0FED631D079F2048"/>
with another priſoner; and he was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering from this diſorder, when he heard that ſome of his deareſt friends had periſhed on the ſcaffold. The next morning, when Miranda went to his room to relieve a fellow-priſoner who had watched him during the night, he obſerved that his whole face was violently inflamed. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired eagerly what was the matter. Du Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet preſſed his hand, and bade him farewell. This unfortunate young man, unable to ſupport the ſhock occaſioned by the murder of his friends, and grown weary of exiſtence, reſolved not to wait till the aſſaſſins called him to the ſcaffold, but had recourſe to poiſon, with which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided himſelf. A phyſician had furniſhed Verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaud, Du Chatelet, and ſeveral other martyrs to their country, with this lethean remedy, which they called<note n="*" place="bottom">The pill of liberty.</note> la pillule de la liberté. A note was found in Du Chatelet's chamber, in which he declared that he had ſold his books and all that belonged to him in the priſon, to Miranda. This was the only mode in which he could leave his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to his friend, or prevent their being ſeized by the nation.</p>
            <p>Miranda found a memorial among his papers, which he has put into my hands, where he traces the hiſtory of his political life. It contains an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable liſt of the ſacrifices he had made, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours he had atchieved, and the perils he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered in the public cauſe, from the period when in 1789 he contributed in the baillage of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne to the union of the nobles with the third eſtate, till the middle of the year 1793; when, although his wounds were not cloſed, he deſired leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the army, and obtained the command of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031634_0129_0FED62D90A2C6A78"/>
the diſtrict of Aire. But he ſoon found that his infirmities did not permit him to fulfil the duties of his ſtation:—he was obliged to return; and though his fortune was now loſt, he refuſed to accept his pay as a general officer, ſince he was no longer able to ſerve his country. At the very moment when he was preparing to return home, he was arreſted by the revolutionary committee at Aire, as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of "<hi>general ſafety,</hi>" and conducted with guards to the committee of general ſafety of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, with the ſame tender regard for public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, inſtead of declaring that this gallant young officer had merited well of his country, ſent him to the priſon of the Force, and refuſed to let his ſervant enter for a few minutes in the day to dreſs his wound. His priſon ſix months after became his grave, and he was placed beyond the reach of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Miranda was then left to abſolute ſolitude; but he had ſtill the courage to live, and at length the hour of deliverance arrived.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps think, dear ſir, that the ſketch which I have given you of public and private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity is ſufficiently gloomy. But, alas! the ſcene blackens as we advance, and wears a deeper horror. We have now arrived at that period when the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, grown bolder by ſucceſs, intoxicated with power, and throwing aſide all regard even to forms, reaching the climax of his crimes, and accelerated the moment of his fall. You will view him and the agents of his iniquity no longer ſatisfied with victims in detail: they now murder in <hi>maſs,</hi> and, in the words of Racine,
<q>
                  <l>"Lavent dans le ſang leurs bras enſanglantés."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall in the courſe of a fortnight ſend you a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the aſt ſcenes of this foul tragedy, and give
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031634_0130_0FED62A4DD1FFA78"/>
you ſuch a detail; as can only be learnt on the ſpot, of the events which produced the revolution of the 9th of Thermidor, and of the incidents which on that memorable night determined the fate of the French republic.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, you will not exclaim as the Roman poet did with reſpect to religion, "Of ſo many evils could Liberty have been the cauſe!" It is, alas! the condition of our uninſtructed nature, that nations like individuals ſhould acquire wiſdom only in the ſchool of experience; and though the page of hiſtory, which according to Lord Boling-broke is "philoſophy teaching by example," be open before us, we are too preſumptuous, or too careleſs, to heed or apply the leſſon. I need not make uſe of any reaſoning to convince you that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is innocent of the outrages committed under its borrowed ſanction; for though we might from ſome momentary impulſe blaſpheme its name, as Lucretius did that of religion, we muſt be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that neither religion nor liberty is chargeable with the crimes committed by tyranny or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As no weeds are more pernicious than thoſe which ariſe in that ſoil from which good fruit alone ſhould have ſprung, ſo no crimes have exceeded thoſe which the tyrant and the fanatic have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the name of Freedom, the guardian angel of the happineſs of mankind, and in that of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "whoſe tender mercies are over all his works."</p>
            <p>I muſt not conclude without informing you, that the dark picture which you have been contemplating is relieved by a bright and ſoothing perſpective. The paſt ſeems like one of thoſe frightful dreams which preſents to the diſturbed ſpirit phantoms of undeſcribable horror, and "deeds without a name;" awakened from which, we hail with rapture the cheering beams of the morning, and anticipate the

The love of public virtue in the people of France is now blended with all the ſympathies and affections of their natures: it is heard in the ſighs of general mourning; it ſpeaks in the tears of the widow and the orphan; and is not only imprinted by every argument that can render it ſacred and durable on the underſtanding, but clings to every feeling of the heart.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHILE far along the moral horizon of France the tempeſt became every hour more black and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, the ſpring, earlier and more profuſe of graces than in the climate of England, aroſe in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied freſhneſs, and formed a contraſt at which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſickened. The lovely environs of Paris are
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031634_0132_0FED627BC4801980"/>
not, like thoſe of London, ſo encumbered with houſes and buildings that you muſt travel ten or twelve miles from town to find the country, but, the moment you have paſſed the barriers of the city, preſent you with all the charming variety of vine-clad hills, and fields, and woods, and lawns. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after our releaſe from priſon we quitted our apartments in the centre of the town, and tried to ſhelter ourſelves from obſervation in an habitation ſituated in the moſt remote part of the fauxbourg Germain. From thence a few minutes walk led us to the country. But we no longer dared, as we had done the preceeding year, to forget awhile the horrors of our ſituation by wandering occaſionally amidſt the noble parks of St. Cloud, the wild woods of Meudon, or the elegant gardens of Bellevue, all within an hour's ride of Paris. Thoſe ſeats, once the reſidence of fallen royalty, were now haunted by vulgar deſpots, by revolutionary commiſſaries, by ſpies of the police, and ſometimes by the ſanguinary decemvirs themſelves. Often they held their feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive orgies in thoſe ſcenes of beauty, where they dared to caſt their polluting glance on nature, and tread with profane ſteps her hallowed receſſes. Even the revolutionary jury uſed ſometimes on a decadi, the only day of ſuſpenſion from their work of death, to go to Marly or Verſailles; and, ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were to the very lips in blood, without being haunted by the mangled ſpectres of thoſe whom they had murdered the preceding day, they ſaw nature in her moſt benign aſpect, pleading the cauſe of humanity and mercy, and returned to feaſt upon the groans of thoſe whom they were to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the morrow.</p>
            <p>Thoſe regions of decorated beauty being now forbidden ground, we confined our walks to ſome paſturage lands near the town, which were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031634_0133_0FED631FD5155E90"/>
with a few ſcattered hamlets, and ſkirted by hills, and were ſo unfrequented, that we heard no ſounds except the ſheep-bell, and the nightingales, and ſaw no human figure but an old peaſant with a white beard, who together with a large black dog took care of the flock. It was in theſe walks that the ſoul, which the ſcenes of Paris petrified with terror, melted at the view of the ſoothing land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and that the eye was lifted up to heaven with tears of reſignation mingled with hope. I have no words to paint the ſtrong feeling of reluctance with which I always returned from our walks to Paris, that den of carnage, that ſlaughter-houſe of man. How I envied the peaſant his lonely hut! for I had now almoſt loſt the idea of ſocial happineſs. My diſturbed imagination divided the communities of men but into two claſſes, the oppreſſor and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and peace ſeemed only to exiſt with ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of Germinal (the beginning of April,) the committee of public ſafety, or rather of public extermination, cauſed a law to be paſſed, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all the former nobility and ſtrangers to leave Paris within ten days, under the penalty of being put out of the law; which meant, that if found in Paris after that period, they were to be led to the ſcaffold without a trial, as ſoon as their perſons were identified. This law, to which my family and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were ſubject, was a part of the plan of general proſcription that Robeſpierre had formed againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and foreigners; and which he was now impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to put in force. We were ordered by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, after chooſing the place of our retreat, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ourſelves at the revolutionary committee of our reſpective ſections, who delivered to each of us not a paſſport, but what was called a paſs, on which was written a declaration that we left Paris
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031634_0134_0FED6343935F3A80"/>
in conformity to the law of the 26th of Germinal. Thus we were condemned to wander into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with this paſs, which was the mark of Cain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our foreheads, and which under pain of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment we were to depoſit at the municipality where we bent our courſe; and we were alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to preſent ourſelves every twenty-four hours before the municipality, and inſcribe our names on a liſt, which was to be diſpatched every decade to the committee of public ſafety. And leſt the country municipalities ſhould miſtake the intentions of the committee, and treat particular individuals with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon their producing teſtimonies of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the cauſe of the revolution, theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted victims were ordered by a decree to burn every certificate of civiſm of which they might happen to be in poſſeſſion. We choſe for the place of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a little village half a mile diſtant from Marly, and with hearts overwhelmed with anguiſh bade adieu to my ſiſter, who, being married to a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was exempted from the law; and we were once more driven from our home, not to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of death. Our neighbours came weeping to our gate to take leave of us; and the poor, who were the only claſs which now dared to utter a complaint, murmured loudly at the injuſtice of the decree. We were obliged to paſs the ſquare of the revolution, where we ſaw the guillotine erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the crowd aſſembled for the bloody tragedy, and the gens d'armes on horſeback, followed by vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims who were to be ſacrificed, entering the ſquare. Such was the daily ſpectacle which had ſucceeded the painted ſhows, the itinerant theatres, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank, the dance, the ſong, the ſhifting ſcenes of harmleſs gaiety, which uſed to attract the cheerful crowd as they paſſed from the Thuilleries to the Champs Eliſées.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:031634_0135_0FED632455358CD8"/>
When we reached the barrier we were ſtopped by a concourſe of carriages filled with former no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and were obliged to wait till our paſſes were examined in our turn. The proceſſion at the gate was ſingular and affecting. Moſt of the fugitives having, like ourſelves, deferred their departure till the laſt day, and it being the forfeiture of our heads to be found in Paris the day following, the demand for carriages was ſo great, and the price exacted by thoſe who let them out, and who knew the urgency of the caſe, ſo exorbitant, that a coach or chariot was a luxury which fell only to the lot of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed few. The greater number were furniſhed with cabriolets, which ſeemed from their tottering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſomewhat emblematical of decayed nobility; and many who found even theſe crazy vehicles too coſtly, journeyed in the carts which tranſported their furniture, ſeated upon the chairs they were convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their new abodes.</p>
            <p>We reached our little dwelling at the hour of ſun-ſet. The hills were fringed with clouds, which ſtill reflected the fading colours of the day; the woods were in deep ſhadow; a ſoft veil was thrown over nature, and objects indiſtinctly ſeen, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated by imagination with thoſe graces which were moſt congenial to the feelings of the moment. The air was full of delicious fragrance, and the ſtillneſs of the ſcene was only diſturbed by ſounds the moſt ſoothing in nature, the ſoft ruſtling of the leaves, or the plaintive notes of the wood-pigeon. The tears which the ſpectacle of the guillotine had petrified with horror, now flowed again with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly luxury. Our habitation was ſituated within a few paces of the noble park of Marly; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted alleys overgrown with long graſs—the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbering fragments of rock, over which once fell the mimic caſcades, whoſe ſtreams no longer mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur—
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031634_0136_0FED624C543D84C0"/>
the piles of marble which once formed the bed of cryſtal baſons—the ſcattered machinery of the jets d'eaux, whoſe ſources are dried—the fallen ſtatues—the defaced ſymbols of feudality—the weeds ſpringing between the ſtone ſteps of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the deſerted palace—the cobwebbed win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the gay pavillions, were all in union with that penſiveneſs of mind which our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances naturally excited. And here, where we could ſee nothing of Paris but the diſtant dome of the Pantheon, we ſhould have been leſs unhappy, if we had not too well known that the committee of public ſafety had not ſent nobles and foreigners into the country to enjoy the freſhneſs of rural gales, or the beauty of the opening ſpring, but as the firſt ſtep towards a general proſcription; and as we paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every evening through the park of Marly, in order to appear before the municipality, that appal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling idea "breathed a browner horror over the woods." We were again reſcued from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral danger by the two benevolent commiſſaries of the revolutionary committee of our ſection, who when they came to conduct us to priſon had treated us with ſo much gentleneſs, who had afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed us of the adminiſtration of police, and who now, unſolicited and even unaſked, went to the committee of public ſafety, declared they would anſwer for us with their lives, and cauſed us to be put into requiſition; a form which enabled us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Paris, and thus ſnatched us from the claſs of the ſuſpected and the proſcribed. To their huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we probably owe our exiſtence; and I ſhall ever recollect with gratitude that noble courage which led them amidſt the cruel impulſe of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary government, the movement of which was accelerated as it went on, to pauſe and ſuccour the unfortunate. I have the ſatisfaction of adding, that
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031634_0137_0FED624873F6A878"/>
thoſe commiſſaries are now at liberty on account of their general good conduct, while ſcarcely any other members of revolutionary committees have eſcaped impriſonment. Our benefactors have indeed a right to this honourable exception; who, although appointed the immediate agents of terror, the order of the day, regulated their actions by the eternal code of humanity.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time before our departure from Paris, the guillotine, upon which ſo many innocent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims had been ſacrificed, for once ſtreamed with the blood of the guilty:
<q>
                  <l>" The guilty only were of life bereft:</l>
                  <l>" Alas! the guilty only then were left!"</l>
                  <bibl>LUCAN's PHARSALIA.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One of the ſecrets of Robeſpierre's government was to employ as the ſtep-ladders of his ambition men whoſe characters were marked with opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or ſtained with crimes. Such men were beſt ſuited to his purpoſe; ſince they were not likely to pauſe in the execution of his orders, depending upon his favour, perhaps, for ſhelter from legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when they had fulfilled the part he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them, and he no longer ſtood in need of their agency, he had ſufficient addreſs to lead them to make ſome extravagant propoſition, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>ultra-revolutionary,</hi> and for which he ſent them to the ſcaffold, even with the approbation of the public. Such was the ſentiment excited by the execution of Hebert, one of the chiefs of the municipality of Paris, whoſe arreſt by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of twelve, previouſly to the thirty-firſt of May, had ſerved the conſpirators as the ſignal for ringing that fatal tocſin which was the knell of liberty. Hebert was the man who upon the trial of Marie
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031634_0138_0FED632185E1B4F0"/>
Antoinette outraged all the feelings of nature, by an accuſation which wrung from her burſting heart that affecting appeal to every mother who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It was he who loaded her with the indignity of groſs abuſe, and poured the bitterneſs of inſult into the cup of death. He ſoon after acted again at the revolutionary tribunal the part of evidence againſt the twenty-one; thoſe virtuous patriots, the Sidneys and the Ruſſels of their country, whoſe martyrdom has been avenged, not as they wiſhed, but as they predicted, by ſcenes of univerſal deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpair.</p>
            <p>Hebert was commonly called Pere du Cheſne, on account of a daily paper he publiſhed, bearing that title. In this paper he profeſſed to tread in the ſteps of Marat, and indeed he proved himſelf worthy to be his lineal ſucceſſor. He had the ſame inſatiable thirſt of blood; he demanded with the ſame vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the heads of all conſpirators, nobles, bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, writers and merchants, the faction of federa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and the faction of Pitt and Cobourg. Thoſe mild demands were breathed in the language of the loweſt vulgar: every line was enforced by an oath, and every period rounded by an imprecation. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille Deſmoulins, after drawing the character of this journal, concluded by ſaying that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten "pour faire les délices de Coblentz, et le ſeul eſpoir de Pitt<note n="*" place="bottom">To form the delight of Coblentz, and the only hope of Pitt.</note>." Such was Hebert! who having ſucceeded with his colleagues of the municipality in accompliſhing what they called the revolution of the 31ſt of May, felt with indignation that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary genius was forced to bend before the genius of Robeſpierre, and determined to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize the month of Ventoſe by a new revolution.</p>
            <p>They had hitherto met with ſuch ſplendid ſucceſs
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031634_0139_0FED62643B7DD3F0"/>
in inſurrection, that they began to think it was no very difficult enterpriſe, now that the routine was known. It was but to ring the tocſin, beat the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerale, put the city under arms, take the direction of the military force, overthrow the committee of public ſafety, and ſeize the reins of government. The ideas of March, however, proved as fatal to the dominion of the red cap, as they had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done to that of the purple robe. In vain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert mounted the tribune at the Cordeliers, aſſerted that tyranny exiſted, and cauſed a black veil to be thrown over the table of the rights of man—in vain the ſection of Marat declared itſelf in inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the other ſections of Paris were of opinion, that to go from the committee of public ſafety to the municipality was flying from Scylla to Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis; and though all France groaned under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the committee, there was little hope that the wounds of the bleeding country would be healed by men who were the leaders of maſſacre, and the preachers of the agrarian law. The Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians therefore applauded the decree which ſent Hebert and twenty of his co-adjutors in revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary crimes to that ſanguinary tribunal, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a mockery of trial, ordered them to execution, "and bade the cruel feel the pains they gave." There appeared ſo much of retribution in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attended the death of Hebert and his colleagues, that it ſeemed as if Heaven were viſibly ſtretching forth its arm to puniſh the guilty. For it is remarkable enough, that they were not tried for any of the multiplied crimes they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but for having aſſerted that tyranny exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: a ſacred truth which every heart ſwelled to acknowledge, though no lips but theirs had dared to give it utterance.—The behaviour of Hebert and his aſſociates upon the approach of death was
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031634_0140_0FED62735C0D1B48"/>
far different from that of the innocent ſufferers who had conſciences void of reproach. Along thoſe ſubterraneous galleries where all the light which entered was "darkneſs viſible," terrific phantoms covered with blood ſeemed to purſue their ſteps, and with menacing looks prepare to drag them to abyſſes of deeper horror: they fancied they ſaw the headleſs trunks of murdered victims encumbering the ground; they heard human groans and ſhrieks founding hollow through the vaulted paſſages; while the knife of the guillotine, like Macbeth's aërial dagger, hung ſuſpended before their affrighted ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Anacharſis Clootz, a Pruſſian baron and a member of the national convention, known by the title which he conferred upon himſelf, of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the human race, ſuffered death with this band of ruffians. He was alſo a preacher of blood; but, cruelty being the order of the day, what moſt diſtinguiſhed him from others was not the ferocity of his principles, but the chimeras of his imagination. His publications which were numerous, were always dated "<hi>Paris, chef lieu du globe</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Paris, capital of the globe.</note>;" and he ſeriouſly propoſed, that as ſoon as all the potentates of the earth were overthrown, an event of which he had a bird's eye view from the beginning of the French revolution, the people of every nation ſhould ſend their repreſentatives to Paris, who ſhould be honoured with ſeats in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly of France, and there form an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal republic, of which France ſhould be the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the other kingdoms of the world the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. He propoſed for inſtance, that as ſoon as the deputies of the Engliſh nation arrived, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhould take the name of le departement de la Tamiſe<note n="†" place="bottom">The department of the Thames.</note>.</p>

Soon after the memorable 10th of Auguſt, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charſis marched to the bar of the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at the head of a number of men he had hired to repreſent the natives of every quarter of the globe; and who were clad in the reſpective dreſſes of the people they perſonated. This embaſſy of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race declared, by the organ of their common orator Anacharſis, their admiration of the French republic, and their attachment to its cauſe. The concluſion of this drama however was leſs ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did than the opening ſcene at the bar of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for the next morning the door of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charſis was beſet with Italians, Germans, Swedes, Poles, Jews, Turks and Ruſſians, clamorouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to be paid: but none were more noiſy in their vociferations than a Calmuck Tartar, and an Indian of the banks of the Ohio, who menaced their orator with the vengeance of the whole faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg of St. Antoine, if he refuſed to pay them for the loſs of their day's labour, and the hire of their dreſſes. Anacharſis, after much altercation, came to a compromiſe with the deputation of the human race, who departed not very well ſatisfied with their Champion.—Clootz met death with more firmneſs than might have been expected from his general character, and his atheiſtical principles. Hebert and his colleagues paſſed their time, when together, like the fallen ſpirits in Milton, in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual accuſation, till Clootz with a loud voice recited to them thoſe well known lines:
<q>
                  <l>Je revois cette nuit, que de mal conſumé,</l>
                  <l>Côté à côté d'un gueux on m'avoit inhumé;</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This citation had the effect he wiſhed: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came reconciled to each other; and Clootz, whoſe
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031634_0142_0FED632FCC787970"/>
only apprehenſion was leſt any of them ſhould die in religious belief, preached atheiſm to them till their laſt ſigh.</p>
            <p>The death of Hebert was the ſignal for throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the hideous maſquerade of ſanſculottiſm, in which all the world had been arrayed during the winter, in ſubmiſſive deference to his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of equality. Immediately after his execution, the ſcene ſuddenly changed: black wigs, red caps, ſailor's jackets, and pantaloons were caſt aſide; and the eye was refreſhed with the ſight of combed locks, clean linen, and decent apparel;—while the women, who for ſome months had reluctantly bound up their hair beneath the round cap of the peaſant, now unfolded their treſſes, perfumed and powdered, to the vernal gales, and decorated in whatever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they thought proper, provided the national cockade formed one of their ornaments.</p>

            <p>THE execution of Hebert and his colleagues was ſoon followed by that of a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the mountain deputies, among whom were Danton and Camille Deſmoulins, names not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to fame in the annals of the revolution. Danton had acted a diſtinguiſhed part on the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical theatre, before Robeſpierre had been heard of; and Camille Deſmoulins, on the day preceding the taking of the Baſtille, had the glory of being the firſt man in France who placed the national cockade in his hat, and called upon his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031634_0143_0FED62A05CA45620"/>
to ſhake off the fetters of deſpotiſm. And ſurely it was glorious to be a leader of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, although the ſun of liberty, like the orb of day when ſeen through oppoſing miſts, has been turned into blood, its dawning beams were radiant, and it will again ſhake off the foul vapours that have hung around it, and ſpread that inſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied light which exhilarates all nature.</p>
            <p>Robeſpierre was not deterred from marking Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Camille Deſmoulins as his victims, by the conſideration that Danton had ſaved him at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when Louvet's repreſentation of his crimes on the 2d of September had ſo ſtrongly excited the indignation of the convention, that a decree of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation was on the point of being hurled againſt him; and that Camille Deſmoulins had been his ſchool-fellow and his friend. But the tyrant felt that Danton was too "near the throne;" and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille Deſmoulins had awakened all his fury by an appeal which he made to the people, in a paper called the "Old Cordelier," and which found an echo in every heart. The exceſſive ſeverity of the revolutionary law againſt the ſuſpected had excited Deſmoulin's indignation; and in a happy parallel between the capricious tyrannies of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and thoſe of the committees of government<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. IV.</note>, he expanded the glowing preciſion of Tacitus into charges ſo extremely ludicrous, that they honoured lord Shafteſbury's axiom, that ridicule is the teſt of truth. This publication made ſome atonement to humanity for the miſchiefs which his former writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had produced; above all, that cruel pleaſantry upon the party of the Gironde, on which their act of accuſation was founded. The atonement came too late; tyranny was eſtabliſhed; and Camille
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031634_0144_0FED62592364DE08"/>
Deſmoulins periſhed, to uſe his own words, "for having ſhed one tear over the unhappy."</p>
            <p>Several other deputies ſuffered at the ſame time; and Camille Deſmoulins obſerved when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſcaffold, "Robeſpierre fait des coups percés de la convention," alluding to the mode of cutting down the foreſts in France by portions, which are marked to be hewn at certain periods. The perſon moſt regretted among the deputies who now periſhed was Philipeaux, who having been ſent on a miſſion to the Vendée, made known at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the horrors of which he had been a witneſs, and was dragged to the ſcaffold for having dared to lift up the veil which the conſpirators had thrown over their crimes. Fabre d'Eglantine, who had been one of the founders of the revolutionary government and auxiliary of Robeſpierre, periſhed unlament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He poſſeſſed fine talents for literature, and had written a celebrated comedy, entitled Philinthe. It was obſerved, that he had carried the ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue which prevailed in his comedy into the part he had acted as legiſlator. The love of fame, the prevailing paſſion of authors, he felt ſtrong in death; and all his thoughts ſeemed fixed upon a comedy of five acts, which he had depoſited at the committee of public ſafety, and of which he was afraid Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laud Varennes would take the credit. Fabre d'Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantine was alſo the author of the new French ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar. Danton, while at the Conciergerie, often converſed with the priſoners acroſs the bars of his dungeon. He ſeemed aſhamed of having been duped by Robeſpierre, with whom, by means of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend, he had an interview a few days before he was arreſted, in order that they might come to an explanation. Danton, after a long converſation, finding that he was unable to move the implacable Robeſpierre, who liſtened to him with a look of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031634_0145_0FED6284AFBDFC20"/>
inſulting malignity, ſhed ſome tears, and left the room, ſaying, "Je vois que mon ſort eſt décidé, mais ma mort ſera votre ruine<note n="*" place="bottom">"I ſee that my fare is decided, but my death will be your ruin.'</note>." This prediction was fulfilled; for no ſooner had Robeſpierre rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all his rivals than he preſſed forward with a more rapid courſe towards his own deſtruction. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his dungeon expatiated continually on the charms of nature, on the beauties of rural ſcenery, and the peace of rural ſhades. "In revolutions," cried he, "the power always remains in the hands of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains. It is better to be a poor fiſherman than to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern men. Thoſe fools! they will cry 'Long live the republic!' on ſeeing me paſs to the ſcaffold.—This day laſt year I cauſed the revolutionary tribunal to be inſtituted. I aſk pardon of God and of men; it was not that it ſhould become the ſcourge of humanity; it was to prevent the renewal of the maſſacres of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember." Camille Deſmoulins and Danton, who had both poſſeſſed conſiderable powers of eloquence, defended themſelves at the tribunal with ſo lofty a ſpirit, and treated their judges with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that at length irritated by their contempt and the ſallies of their wit, and impatient at their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in vindicating themſelves when it was determined they ſhould die, the public accuſer ſent a letter to the convention, informing them that the priſoners were in a ſtate of revolt againſt the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The committee of public ſafety cauſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to be paſſed which put them out of the law, and ſent inſtantly to execution all ſuch of the accuſed as dared to inſult their judges. In vain Danton called upon Barrere, upon Billaud Varennes, and upon other members of the committee of public ſafety to appear in evidence. Danton was left to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031634_0146_0FED625FC5F92CC0"/>
his fate, and ſent with his colleagues to execution. At the gate of the Conciergerie, while the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was placing the condemned deputies in the carts, Danton amuſed the crowd who were looking on by many ſportive obſervations. He ſaid to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre d'Eglantine, who was a poet, "Eh bien, nous deviendrons tous poetes, nous allons tous faire des vers<note n="*" place="bottom">An equivoque on the word <hi>vers,</hi> which in French ſignifies worm, as well as verſes.</note>." On his way to the ſcaffold his head was bare, and many perſons were ſtruck with its reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the medals of Socrates. He behaved with remarkable firmneſs, converſing with thoſe who were placed in the ſame caſt, and ſometimes anſwering the cries of the populace by looks of ſtrong indignation. When he was tied to the plank he caſt his eyes upwards to the fatal knife, and his countenance and figure aſſumed an expreſſion of magnanimity with which the ſpectators were deeply penetrated.</p>

A week after the death of Camille Deſmoulins, his wife, a charming woman of twenty-three years of age, was led to the ſcaffold. For her fate no eye except thoſe of her barbarous judges refuſed a tear. Her execution forms an epocha in the annals of the revolutionary government; ſince on that occaſion, for the firſt time, a conſpiracy ſuppoſed in a priſon became the pretext for murder, and multitudes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards periſhed the victims of that fatal inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Camille Deſmoulins was in habits of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Arthur Dillon, an Iriſh general, who had bravely defended the paſs in the foreſt of Argonne againſt the Pruſſian army, and who held the higheſt rank in the ſervice of the republic. Soon after the the 31ſt of May, he was arreſted with multitudes <hi>ſoupçonnés d'être ſuſpects</hi>

His hopes of regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his liberty reſted upon the influence of his friend Camille Deſmoulins, and he was deeply affected by the intelligence of his being ſent to the revolutionary tribunal. In his affliction he made uſe of ſome imprudent expreſſions to a fellow priſoner, and ſeemed to flatter himſelf with the hope that the people would not ſuffer ſuch a patriot as Deſmoulins to periſh. The wretch to whom Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon confided theſe ſentiments had the atrocity to write a denunciation againſt him to the committee of general ſafety, with the view of purchaſing his own freedom by the life of his unfortunate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Dillon had alſo, a few days before Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulins periſhed, written a letter to his wife, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his ſympathy in her misfortunes, and his hope that the innocence of her huſband would yet triumph. In this letter Dillon encloſed three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand livres. All theſe circumſtances were made known to the committee; and a few days after the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031634_0148_0FED62DD8B9DD4C8"/>
execution of Deſmoulins, Dillon, the turnkey to whom he had offered the letter, and Madame Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulins in the firſt tranſports of grief upon the loſs of a huſband whom ſhe tenderly loved, were ſent by an order of the committee to the Concier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie to take their trial at the revolutionary tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It appeared upon the trial that the turnkey had refuſed to take the letter; upon which Dillon had ſlipt it into his pocket; which the turnkey perceiving, returned it to him immediately, and Dillon tore it in pieces. Madame Deſmoulins, it was therefore clear, had never received the letter or the three thouſand livres encloſed. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the interrogatories of her judges with the candour of innocence, and the ſweet complacency of her manner ſenſibly affected the ſpectators. Thoſe aſſaſſins in the robes of juſtice condemned Dillon to die as the author of a conſpiracy in the priſons againſt the ſecurity of the French people; the turnkey was ſent to death for having had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient humanity not to make a declaration to the police of Dillon's propoſition reſpecting the letter; and the unfortunate Madame Deſmoulins was dragged to the ſcaffold becauſe a letter was written to her which it was clearly proved had never been ſent. In the firſt anguiſh of ſeparation from the object of our affections, death ceaſes to be an evil; and Madame Deſmoulins deplored her huſband too tenderly to regret that they were going to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united in a happier ſtate of exiſtence. She dreſſed herſelf in white, and with ſome care; and went with a placid ſmile upon her countenance to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, converſing with her companions in the cart, particularly with the wife of Hebert, who was put to death at the ſame time, and met her fate with equal firmneſs. It was one of the ſingular chances of theſe revolutionary moments, that Camille Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulins
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031634_0149_0FED62F0E2B289B0"/>
who with the pointed ſhafts of his wit had overthrown the idol of the populace Hebert, periſhed himſelf but a fortnight later; and that his own wife and the wife of Hebert, ſeated on the ſame ſtone in the Conciergere, deplored their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual loſs, and were led together to the ſcaffold. The people, as Madame Deſmoulins paſſed along the ſtreets to execution, could not reſiſt uttering exclamations of pity and admiration. "Comme elle eſt belle! elle a l'air ſi doux! quel dommage qu'elle va périr<note n="*" place="bottom">"How beautiful ſhe is! how mild ſhe looks! what a pity ſhe ſhould periſh!"</note>!" At the foot of the ſcaffold ſhe embraced the wife of Hebert, bade her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the cart farewell, and reſigned herſelf to the executioner with the ſerenity of an angel. Dillon went to death with great compoſure, and, as he paſſed to execution, bowed to a friend of his and mine whom he ſaw in the ſtreet. Far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the meek and placid reſignation with which Madame Deſmoulins made the ſacrifice of life in all its bloom and freſhneſs, was the behaviour of Chaumette procureur of the commune, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet the archbiſhop of Paris, who periſhed at the ſame time. Their aſpect teſtified that death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to their perturbed ſpirits, not in the form he wears to ſuffering innocence, to whom he comes the meſſenger of peace, but armed with all his ſtings, and clad in all his terrors.</p>
            <p>Chaumette, one of the leaders of the conſpiracy of the 31ſt of May, ſaw himſelf dragged to the ſcaffold by the man whom he had powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to raiſe to ſupreme eminence, and for a meaſure by which he expected to confirm his own popularity, which was overthrowing the altars of the catholic church. And Gobet, the archbiſhop
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031634_0150_0FED628040271FA0"/>
of Paris, a weak old man, whom Chaumette and Anacharſis Clootz had perſuaded to go with the municipality to the bar of the convention, and at ſixty-ſeven years of age declare that the profeſſion of his life had been impoſture, that he renounced the chriſtian faith and his eccleſiaſtical dignity, and demanded that the churches conſecrated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip ſhould henceforth become the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon, was puniſhed for his apoſtacy with death. Robeſpierre embraced the new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine till the church was deſpoiled of all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with which ſuperſtition had enriched it, and ſoon after aboliſhed the <hi>decadary</hi> feaſts of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs Reaſon, and ſent her high prieſts Gobet and Chaumette to the guillotine. One of the few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of fortitude in death exemplified by perſons who had neither the conſciouſneſs of innocence nor the ſentiment of ſympathy to ſooth their minds in ſo ſevere a trial, was that of the former duke of Orleans, in whoſe life nothing was worthy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe except his manner of leaving it. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the vote he had given againſt his unfortunate relation Lewis XVI. from motives of perſonal vengeance and ambition, could not but gnaw upon his heart, and depreſs his ſpirit, and muſt have been mingled not only with a feeling of indignation againſt the wretches who made him ſuffer upon falſe pretences, but with all the anguiſh of remorſe for having joined their party; by which act of debaſement he had incurred not only guilt, but its ſpeedy puniſhment. Yet notwithſtanding ſuch reflections could not fail to embitter his laſt moments, he went to execution with a calm dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity worthy of a better mind. Nor did he gratify the populace by betraying any emotion when the cart in which he was placed ſtopped for ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before the gate of the Palais-Royal, the ſcene
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031634_0151_0FED3265975EA698"/>
of a life of luxurious pleaſures. He looked at the building with apparent unconcern; and whatever pangs of recollection might ſtruggle at his heart, his behaviour expreſſed no ſentiment but that of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity till he expired.</p>
            <p>The reſignation and courage with which the victims of this cruel tyranny in general reſigned life were truly admirable. Many young perſons, after receiving their act of accuſation, compoſed verſes written with a pencil at the table where they partook their laſt repaſt with their fellow-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.

            <p>Among the crowds who were led to the guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, two perſons only diſplayed ſtrong marks of diſmay and terror. One of theſe perſons was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Barry, the miſtreſs of Lewis XV. She had been induced to leave England, where ſhe paſſed ſome time after the revolution, and return to France, in order to ſecure her property; and ſoon after the 31 of May was led from her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful pavillion at Lucienne, to a priſon in Paris, by one of the agents of <hi>terroriſm,</hi> who, I am ſorry to add, was an Engliſhman. The priſons, to uſe a French mode of expreſſion, in a ſhort time became the anti-chambers of the ſcaffold; and Madame du Barry's mind was impreſſed ſtrongly with a preſage of her fate. Whenever the door of her chamber
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031634_0153_0FED628C6C0BFC58"/>
in the priſon opened, ſhe was ſeized with violent trembling, and ſometimes with fainting fits. At length the fatal ſummons to the revolutionary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal arrived. The chief evidence againſt her was a negro ſlave, whom ſhe had reared from an infant, and to whom ſhe was ſo much attached, that he was generally to be found in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and one day Lewis XV. ſportively cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him governor of Lucienne, with a penſion of ſix hundred livers a year, which this viper, who ſtung the boſom that cheriſhed him, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt flagrant teſtimonies which were produced of Madame du Barry's counter-revolutionary principles was Mr. Pitt's picture, which ſhe ſaid had been given to her the night before her departure from London by Lord Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This unfortunate woman was condemned to die; and a perſon of my acquaintance who was at that time a priſoner in the Conciergerie told me, that ſhe was deluded with the promiſe of pardon provided ſhe would diſcover the ſpot where ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that ſome treaſures were concealed; but no ſooner were they found, than ſhe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to execution. During her paſſage thither ſhe appeared almoſt dead, and leaned her head upon the ſhoulder of the executioner. But when ſhe reached the ſquare of the revolution, the ſight of the inſtrument of death rallied her ſinking ſpirits, and called forth the moſt cruel agonies of reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant nature. She rent the air with her ſhrieks, and was deaf to the expoſtulations of Noil, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of the Gironde who periſhed at the ſame time, and who encouraged her to reſign herſelf to a fate which was inevitable. Her convulſed frame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired extraordinary ſtrength: ſhe ſtruggled with her executioners, and, after a conflict at which
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031634_0154_0FED6294E4E0CFA8"/>
humanity ſhudders, was forced to undergo the fatal ſtroke, and releaſed from frantic deſperation.</p>
            <p>With Madame du Barry periſhed the banker Vanderuyver, and his two ſons, accuſed of being her accomplices in ſending money into England, and alſo of having aided the knights of the poniard, as they were called, in the chateau of the Thuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries on the memorable 10th of Auguſt, although twenty-five witneſſes attended to prove that Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deruyver had not quitted his houſe during the whole of that day. But thoſe who firſt appeared in his favour being arreſted as they went out of court, the others made their eſcape, and left this unhappy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to their fate.</p>
            <p>Their real crime was their great wealth, which it was thought expedient to ſeize, On this account bankers were the objects of particular proſcription: for although the great revolutionary financier Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon had one day called them all together, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them with an harangue of conſiderable length upon the value of paper money, and the worthleſſneſs of gold, which he aſſerted every real lover of his country ought to deſpiſe as droſs, and of which he exhorted them to rid themſelves as faſt as poſſible; it was feared that in ſpite of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious morſel of eloquence, an obſtinate attachment to metallic coin ſtill lurked in the hearts of the bankers, who were for the moſt part puniſhed for this groveling predilection with death. Of this number was Laborde, once the banker of the court, and now guilty of a revenue of two millions of livres. This reſpectable old man was dragged to the ſcaffold at ſeventy-ſix years of age, although ſince the firſt epocha of the revolution he had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable proofs of his attachment to its cauſe, and the magnificence of his donations were more than proportionate to his wealth. His firſt patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031634_0155_0FED6311B99512D8"/>
gift was twenty thouſand louis; he had ſent all the fine horſes with which his ſtables were filled to the municipality; he had lodged troops of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional guards at his houſe; and above all, he had been the father of the country where his fine ſeat of Meriville was placed. The year before his death I had paſſed ſome very agreeable days at that noble manſion, where ſtrangers properly recommended were received and entertained with the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did hoſpitality. The pleaſure-grounds had been formed in a flat ſituation unfavourable to beauty. With immenſe labour and expence paſtoral hills aroſe, and jutting rocks hung over cryſtal waters, or were worn into fragments by the fall of laviſh caſcades. A beautiful Grecian temple reared its Corinthian pillars upon a broad green aſcent, and amidſt the deep receſſes of ſpreading oaks a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was erected to Captain Cook. Perhaps the decorated ſcenes of Meriville are ſomewhat too richly hung with ornaments, but in creating this blooming Eden, which was the work of years, Monſ. Laborde had given employment to the whole country. For a great extent of ſpace round his dwelling no wants were felt which his munificence was not eager to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eve; and when the eye ſaw him, it bleſſed him. Nor was the good he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred confined to the precincts of his own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Paris markets were often ſupplied with ſuch articles of living as were moſt wanted, at the very time when its owner was languiſhing in priſon. With tears and lamentations his tenants heard of his confinement. Whole villages and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipalities crowded to the bar of the convention, and claimed the enlargment of their common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, but in vain. The rich ſpoils of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau were too tempting to be reſiſted, the ſeizure of his immenſe property was an expedient of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031634_0156_0FED62C378AE73C8"/>
and as a preliminary ſtep to its confiſcation he was put to death.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned among the multitudes who periſhed, that Madame du Barry and one other perſon only were remarked for having betrayed ſymptoms of weakneſs and terror in their laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You will be ſurpriſed to hear that this perſon was general Cuſtine.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Who combats bravely is not therefore brave:</l>
               <l>He fears a death-bed like the meaneſt ſlave.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This unfortunate general, although accuſtomed to look upon death with intrepidity in the ranks of battle, ſhrunk from it in a form of horror for which he was unprepared. His ſon, an amiable and accompliſhed young man, who ſuffered a few months after as the accomplice of his father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had given proofs of filial affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with admirable courage. I ſhall tranſcribe a letter which he ſent to his wife on the day of his execution<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. V.</note>.</p>
            <p>This intereſting young woman had the courage, during the trial of her father-in-law the general, to ſit at his feet at the tribunal, to wipe the damps from his brow, to animate his failing ſpirits, and calm the agitation of his mind by her ſoothing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. After ſeeing her huſband dragged to the ſcaffold, ſhe was thrown into priſon, from which ſhe was one of the laſt perſons releaſed.</p>
            <p>Early in the ſpring Madame Elizabeth was brought before the revolutionary tribunal. The only crime that could be imputed to her was that ſhe was the ſiſter of a king, and had ſhewn that ſtedfaſt fidelity to her brother, which in generous
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031634_0157_0FED629995E1A388"/>
minds, whatever might be their political opinions, would have excited ſentiments of eſteem and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. She had taken no part in thoſe fatal ſchemes of crooked policy, which, by ſeeking to ſeize once more that deſpotic power which the will of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nation had torn from its graſp, loſt that limited empire, and that circumſcribed dominion of which it might ſtill have held poſſeſſion. But whatever were the errors of Louis XVI. or the vices of Marie Antoinette, no blame was by any party im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the princeſs Elizabeth. She had neither ſhared in the intrigues or the licentiouſneſs of the court. All that was known of her in proſperity was her virtuous manners, and her charitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and in adverſity, her unſhaken friendſhip for her brother, and her piety and reſignation to God. She had ſuffered not only the moſt ſevere extremes of calamity, but all thoſe indignities, wants, and hardſhips, which could give misfortune a keener edge; for, during the tyranny of Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre, the forms of decency which had till then been obſerved were altogether diſregarded. She, who had been uſed to the long train of attendants of the moſt ſplendid court of Europe, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to perform the moſt menial offices herſelf; to dreſs her ſcanty meal, and to ſweep the floor of her priſon. In ſuch circumſtances, with no ray of hope to cheer the gloomy towers where ſhe was immured, except that hope which was fixed on a better ſtate of exiſtence—ſhe probably looked upon death as her moſt ſoothing refuge, and therefore met it with tranquillity and firmneſs. I ſhall tranſcribe her examination at the revolutionary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, not only as a proof of the calmneſs and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with which ſhe anſwered the interrogatories of her barbarous judges, but alſo as a ſpecimen of the manner in which the trials at this ſanguinary court
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031634_0158_0FED63136DA78FA0"/>
were conducted even before the period arrived when all enquiry, all form was laid aſide.</p>

                           <p>It is difficult to reconcile theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of humanity to which you pretend, with that barbarous joy which you diſcovered, when you ſaw ſtreams of blood flowing on the 10th of Auguſt.

only towards the aſſaſſins of the people, and that you have all the ſavageneſs of the moſt blood-thirſty beaſts towards the defenders of liberty. So far were you from giving any aſſiſtance to the laſt, that you provoked the maſſacre by your applauſes: ſo far were you from diſarming the murderers of the people, that you laviſhed on them handfulls of inſtruments of death, by means of which you flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered yourſelf, you and your accomplices, with the re-eſtabliſhment of deſpotiſm and tyranny.

                           <p>The priſoner Elizabeth, whoſe defence conſiſts in denying every charge brought againſt her, will ſhe be honeſt enough to agree that ſhe has fed little Capet with hopes of ſucceeding to his father's throne, and that by theſe means ſhe has provoked to royalty?</p>

                           <p>This is ſaying in other words, that you fed little Capet with thoſe projects of vengeance which you and yours have never ceaſed forming againſt liberty, and that you flattered yourſelf with building up again the wrecks of a broken throne by deluging it with the blood of the patriots."—Here the trial ended, no witneſſes were called, and the priſoner was condemned without farther exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                           <p>Madame Elizabeth betrayed ſome emotion at the ſight of the guillotine; but ſhe recovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately, and waited calmly at the foot of the ſcaffold, till twenty-five perſons who periſhed

                           <p>Sometimes amidſt theſe horrors, the moſt ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous violations of the laws of nations took place; and we might have ſmiled at the abſurdities of our tyrants, if they had been mingled with leſs atrocity. The revolutionary committee of Cette, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of Harault, with a noble defiance of all ordinary forms and obſervances, thought fit to put in requiſition not only ſome mules belonging to the conſul of a northern court, and a cart which was his property, but the conſul himſelf to be their driver. The requiſition was ſigned by William Tell, Brutus, Marat, Cato, and Ceſar. Whether the conſul was of opinion, that ſuch great names were not to be trifled with, or whether he thought that driving mules was a ſafer occupation than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with tigers, is uncertain; but it is well known that he ſubmitted himſelf with paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this ſans-culotte edict, till the 9th of Thermidor; after which period he ſent to Paris to complain of the indignity he had ſuffered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the chaſtizement of William Tell and his colleagues.</p>

            <p>IT would require the pencil of a maſter to trace in all its dark colouring that picture of calamity and horror which Paris preſented at this period. A deep and ſilent gloom pervaded that city, where heretofore every heart bounded with gaiety, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031634_0164_0FED62E71F63FAF0"/>
eye ſparkled with delight. The citizens in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſaw with ſtupefied terror thoſe proceſſions of death which daily encumbered the ſtreets, and the feelings of ſympathy and indignation were repelled by the ſenſe of that perſonal danger from which no individual was ſecure. Even in his own habitation, and in the boſom of his family, no man dared to utter a complaint but in anxious whiſpers, leſt a ſervant ſhould over-hear the forbidden expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humanity, and denounce him as a counter-revolutioniſt. Many perſons wearied of ſpectacles of horror put an end to their exiſtence; and ſome who deſired to die, but ſhrunk from giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſtroke of death, took meaſures to be ſent before the revolutionary tribunal, where they knew aſſaſſins were ever ready. The uſual means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for this purpoſe was the cry of "Vive le <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Well might the people of France have exclaimed in the words of our divine poet,</p>
            <p>"Alas poor country, almoſt afraid to know it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! It cannot be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once ſeen to ſmile; where ſighs and groans and ſhrieks that rend the air are made, not marked where vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſorrow ſeems a modern ecſtaſy: the dead man's knell is there ſcarce aſked for whom; and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dying or ere they ſicken."—MACBETH.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the month of Prairial, a man of the name of Admiral formed the deſign of aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinating Robeſpierre and Collot d'Herbois: he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the attempt, was ſeized, and ſent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciergerie. A few days after Amée Cecile Renaud,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031634_0165_0FED62684840A008"/>
a girl of nineteen years of age, whoſe ſenſibility it appears was ſingularly affected by the ſcenes which were paſſing before her, and whoſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perhaps was ſomewhat diſordered by thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impreſſions, had the courage, while an armed nation bowed before its aſſaſſins, to enter alone and unarmed the monſter's den, and, as it would ſeem, with the intention, at the expence of life, to point out to her countrymen the tyrant under whom they groaned. Cecile Renaud went one morning to Robeſpierre's houſe, and enquired if he was at home. She was anſwered in the negative; and being aſked what ſhe wanted, replied that ſhe came to ſee what ſort of thing was a tyrant. Upon this declaration ſhe was inſtantly led to the committee of general ſafety, and went through a long examination. She again declared with the ſame ſimplicity, that ſhe had only gone becauſe ſhe wanted to ſee a tyrant; and upon being ſearched, no offenſive weapon was found upon her, and all that was contained in a little bundle which ſhe held under her arm was a change of linen, with which ſhe ſaid ſhe had provided herſelf, knowing ſhe ſhould want it in priſon. The conduct of this heroic young woman furniſhed the tyrants with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of murder too favourable to be neglected. They inſtantly proclaimed that a vaſt plan of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the lives of thoſe renowned patriots Collot d'Herbois and Robeſpierre had been formed by traitors within the priſons, and traitors without.</p>
            <p>The father, mother and aunt of Cecile Renaud were led with herſelf to the Conciergerie, where ſhe was again interrogated, and threatened that her whole family ſhould periſh with her, if ſhe did not confeſs her intention of aſſaſſinating Robeſpierre. She repeated what ſhe had ſaid at the committee; and added, that they might put her to death if they
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031634_0166_0FED634661EE9988"/>
thought proper, but, if ſhe deſerved to die, it was not for any intention to aſſaſſinate, but for her anti-republican ſentiments. Cecile Renaud, who was very young and handſome, was dreſſed with ſome care, and perhaps coquetry. Her appearance led her ſavage judges to invent a new ſpecies of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order to bring her to confeſſion. By their directions ſhe was ſtripped of her own clothes, and covered with ſqualid and diſguſting rags, in which condition ſhe was made to appear in the council-chamber and undergo a new interrogatory, where the ſame menaces were repeated, and where ſhe anſwered as ſhe had done before; and with great ſpirit rallied her judges upon the abſurdity of trying to ſhake her purpoſe by a mode of puniſhment ſo contemptible. Notwithſtanding no proof of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to aſſaſſinate Robeſpierre could be brought againſt her, ſhe together with her whole family was put to death. Her two brothers, who were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the battles of the republic on the frontiers, were ordered to be conducted to Paris, that they might ſhare her fate; but the tyrants were too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient for blood to wait their arrival, and owing to this circumſtance they eſcaped.</p>
            <p>With Cecile Renaud periſhed not only her own family, but ſixty-nine perſons were brought from different parts and different priſons of Paris, who had never ſeen or heard of each other till they met at the Conciergerie, and were together dragged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal, and declared guilty of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſpiracy. Their trial only laſted a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent length of time to call over their names; none of them were permitted to make any defence; the jury declared themſelves ſatisfied in their ſouls and conſciences; and the devoted victims, covered with the red cloaks worn by aſſaſſins on their way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution were led to death. Among thoſe who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031634_0167_0FED63064B989508"/>
on this occaſion were madame Sainte Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranthe, her daughter, who had married Monſieur Sartine the ſon of the ex-miniſter, and who was now only in her nineteenth year, and one of the moſt beautiful women in France, and her brother, who was but ſeventeen years of age. A friend of mine was confined in the ſame priſon with this family. A ſervant from the outſide of the walls had made madame Sainte Amaranthe underſtand by ſigns that her ſon-in-law, who had been confined in another priſon, had periſhed, and that ſhe herſelf was in danger. She went immediately to her daughter, and ſaid to her, "Your huſband is no more, and it is very probable that we ſhall follow him to-morrow to the ſcaffold—No tears—this is no time for ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—we muſt prepare to meet with courage a fate that is inevitable." The next day paſſed, and no ſummons to the Conciergerie arrived; but on the night following at eleven o'clock a huiſſier entered madame Sainte Amaranthe's chamber, and told her ſhe was wanted below. The call was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. "And are not we too wanted?" cried her ſon and daughter. "Certainly," anſwered the huiſſier. They both flew to their mother, threw their arms round her neck, and exclaimed, "We ſhall die together!" The next day they periſhed. Fouquier Tainville, the public accuſer, that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, "horribly trick'd with blood of fathers, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, daughters, ſons, bak'd and impaſted with the parching ſtreets," placed himſelf at a window of the Conciergerie cloſe to the gate through which the priſoners paſſed, in order to aſcend the carts which were to carry them to execution. There he feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his atrocious ſoul with the ſight of ſixty-nine victims, covered with aſſaſſin's cloaks; and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them ſome young women, particularly the lovely madame Sartine, walking towards the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031634_0168_0FED62565C0003B8"/>
vehicles of death with that firmneſs which belongs to innocence; "How bold thoſe women look!" cried Fouquier, enraged at their calmneſs; I muſt go and ſee if they ſhew the ſame effrontery on the ſcaffold, even if I ſhould loſe my dinner!"</p>
            <p>Robeſpierre had now attained nearly the ſummit of his hopes; and his ignorance being equal to his vanity, he did not perceive that the few ſteps he had to climb before he could graſp at abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, muſt be trodden with cautious prudence; ſince he had advanced ſo far, that, if he was now compelled to deſcend, it could only be by a deſcent which would lead to death. He had deſtroyed his moſt powerful rival Danton; but his ſpies and emiſſaries, and above all his guilty conſcience, told him that more of his colleagues muſt fall to give him perfect ſafety. He read in the countenances of the deputies, in the ſilent gloom with which his edicts were ſanctioned, that new ſtorms gathered over his head; and he prepared in conjunction with Couthon, the means of putting the lives of all thoſe who oppoſed him more abſolutely in his power. In the mean time he thought fit to amuſe the people by a feſtival in honour of the Supreme Being, whoſe exiſtence he had lately proclaimed, and whoſe name he had dared to utter with his unhallowed lips. The plan of the feſtival was arranged by the celebrated painter David; he, whoſe mind the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the finer arts has had no power to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; who, not ſatisfied with diſplaying on canvaſs thoſe ſcenes of ſanguinary guilt which from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors they excite furniſh fit ſubjects for the pencil, has contributed to give them in his bleeding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try "a local habitation and a name;" who, inſtead of cheriſhing that ſacred flame of enlightened liberty which is connected with the ſublimer powers of the imagination, was the lacquey of the tyrant
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031634_0169_0FED62B9D5838D98"/>
Robeſpierre, and the friend of the man of blood, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat; who, ambitious of recorded diſgrace, of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ignominy, debaſed the nobleſt gift of heaven, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and employed his degraded pencil in tracing the hideous features of the monſter Marat, while a groaning people were compelled to bow the knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the image he had ſet up; and who, at the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the national convention, inſulted all common ſenſe and decency by a compariſon which, from its audacious abſurdity, excites as much ridicule as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. "Cato, Ariſtides, Socrates, Timoleon, Fabricius, and Phocion," exclaims the panegyriſt David, "ye whoſe venerable lives I admire, I have not lived with you—but I have known Marat!" (bleſſed compenſation!) "I have admired him like you, and poſterity will do him juſtice!" Yes, David, repoſe with your idol upon the civic crowns, the palms and laurels won by revolutionary meaſures, and doubt not that poſterity will do am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple juſtice both to you and Marat. Poſterity will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be ſpared the taſk of overthrowing his altars, ſince they are already in the duſt; and while the offences of many of our vulgar tyrants will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with their ignoble names, David's ſhame will be as durable as his celebrity.</p>
            <p>While I am upon the ſubject of Marat and his friend, I cannot help obſerving that nothing appears more ſtrange to us in this country than the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are formed in England of the public characters of France, not by the enemies but by the friends of the French revolution. That Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot, Gaudet, Vergniaud ſhould receive no incenſe of applauſe from thoſe who perhaps lament that the king's caſtle of the baſtile was overthrown, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; but when we hear Mr. Sheridan ſpeak in the houſe of commons of the <hi>faction of the Gironde,</hi> and when we read in Mr. Gilbert Wakefield's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031634_0170_0FED62EA79D4FE20"/>
to Mr. Paine's pamphlet his remark upon the <hi>Briſſotine faction,</hi> we are filled with aſtoniſhment. They might with as much propriety talk of the faction of Sidney, of Ruſſel, and of Hampden. Such obſervations are blaſphemies indeed from the lovers of liberty; they who ought to pronounce with veneration the names of thoſe illuſtrious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who, after the moſt honourable ſtruggles for their country, ſhed their blood upon the ſcaffold in its cauſe, with heroiſm worthy of the proudeſt days of Greece or Rome. But though the iron ſceptre of revolutionary government has reſtrained the groans, the lamentations, of a mourning nation for the fall of its beſt defenders; and though the ſlaviſh pen of the <hi>Moniteur,</hi> from which Europe received French intelligence, applauded the aſſaſſins of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though Briſſot, it was aſſerted, had filled his coffers with Engliſh gold, while his widow was languiſhing with an infant at her breaſt, with no other nouriſhment than bread and water, in one of the dungeons of Robeſpierre, and at this moment exiſts with three children "ſteeped in poverty to the very lips;" yet with becoming pride diſdaining to ſolicit ſupport, till the memory of her huſband has received, as it ſhortly will do, ſome mark of public atonement and public honour; hiſtory will do juſtice to his character—hiſtory will judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Briſſot and Robeſpierre, between the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronde and the Mountain. Hiſtory will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoſe ſanguinary and ambitious men who paſſed along the revolutionary horizon like baneful meteors, ſpreading deſtruction in their courſe, with thoſe whoſe talents formed a radiant conſtellation in the zone of freedom, and diffuſed benignant beams over the hemiſphere till extinguiſhed by ſtorms and darkneſs.</p>

               <pb n="172" facs="unknown:031634_0171_0FED626B0D52EF38"/>
Perhaps it will not be diſpleaſing to you to read the following ſketch of Briſſot, traced by Madame Roland, who was intimately acquainted with him, and who was ſo admirable a judge of character.</p>
            <p>"Briſſot came to viſit us: I know nothing more pleaſant than the firſt interview of thoſe who, though connected by correſpondence, have never ſeen each other. We look with earneſtneſs to ſee if the features of the face bear any reſemblance to the phyſiognomy of the ſoul, and if the figure of the perſon confirms the opinion which we have formed of the mind.</p>
            <p>"The ſimplicity of Briſſot's manners, his frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his natural negligence, ſeemed to me in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony with the auſterity of his principles: but I found in him a ſort of lightneſs of mind and character which was not very conſiſtent with the ſeriouſneſs of a philoſopher. This diſpoſition always gave me uneaſineſs, and his enemies always took advantage of it. The more I became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, the greater was my eſteem. It is impoſſible for any one to unite a more perfect diſintereſtedneſs to a more ardent zeal for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice, or feel with ſo perfect a forgetfulneſs of his own intereſt a greater deſire of doing good. But his writings are more fitted than his perſon to effect it, becauſe they have all the authority which reaſon, juſtice and knowledge give to literary works, while his figure, from its want of dignity, inſpires no reſpect. He is the beſt of human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; a good huſband, a tender father, a faithful friend, a virtuous citizen. His converſation is as mild as his character is eaſy. Confident even to imprudence, gay and ſprightly as a youth of fifteen, he was formed to live with the wiſe, and to be the dupe of the wicked. As a well-informed politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and ſtudying during his whole life the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031634_0172_0FED62F29238FE48"/>
relations of ſociety, and the means of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt quantity of happineſs for the human race, he was well acquainted with the nature of man, and altogether ignorant of the characters of men. He knew that vice exiſted, but he never could believe him to be a vicious man who ſpoke to him with an open countenance; and when he diſcovered ſuch perſons he treated them as fools whom he ought to pity, without taking any precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them. He could not hate: his mind, though very ſuſceptible, had not ſolidity enough for ſo vigorous a ſentiment. His knowledge was ſo extenſive, that all literary labour was to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely eaſy: and he compoſed a treatiſe with the ſame facility as another would copy a ſong: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced eye will therefore diſcern in his works, together with an excellent fund of information, the haſty touches of a rapid and ſometimes a ſlight mind. His activity, his good humour, never refuſing to join in any thing which he thought uſeful, have given him the air of meddling in every thing; and have ſubjected him to animadverſions as an intriguer by thoſe who were eager to find fault. A curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of intriguer indeed! a man who never thought of himſelf, or even the intereſt of his friends; who is as incapable as he is averſe to look after his own concerns; who is no more aſhamed of poverty than he is afraid of death, conſidering both as the uſual reward of public virtues.</p>

            <p>"Briſſot had made a voyage thither, and they were on the point of their departure when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution fixed him in France. As he was born at Chartres, and was the ſchool-fellow of Pethion, who is a native of the ſame city, Briſſot formed a ſtill ſtronger attachment to him in the conſtituent aſſembly, where his knowledge and his labour were of eſſential ſervice to his friend. He brought us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, as well as with many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties whom former acquaintance or conformity of opinion and zeal for the public good frequently call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to converſe on the ſubject. It was even agreed that they ſhould aſſemble four hours a week in the evening at my houſe, becauſe I was always at home, had good apartments, and was ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated that it was not far from any of thoſe who compoſed our little circle."</p>

Alas, if my blood could furniſh abundance and extinguiſh all diviſions, I would ſhed it myſelf in an inſtant. In order to excuſe this ſanguinary phraſeology, you pretend that I am forming conſpiracies in priſon; you pretend that I have declared, that before my head fall, many in the convention would fall.</p>

I abhor blood: I would not even demand that of my proſecutors, who would willingly drink up mine. Philoſophy, juſtice, good order, and humanity, are the true foundations of a republic. It is well known, my only crime is that I have oppoſed all other means of eſtabliſhing it. This is the conſpiracy which I ſtill continue to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in my priſon.

At this ſpot by David's command, the mothers are to embrace their daughters—at that, the fathers are to claſp their ſons—here, the old are to bleſs the young, and there, the young are to kneel to the old—upon this boulevard the people are to ſing—upon that, they muſt dance—at noon they muſt liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſilence, and at ſun-ſet they muſt rend the air with acclamations.</p>
            <p>Ah, what was then became of thoſe civic feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals which hailed the firſt glories of the revolution! What was become of that ſublime federation of an aſſembled nation which had nobly ſhaken off its ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious fetters, and exulted in its new-born freedom! What was become of thoſe moments when no emotions were pre-ordained, no feelings meaſured out, no acclamations decreed; but when every boſom beat high with admiration, when every heart throbbed with enthuſiaſtic tranſport, when every eye melted into tears, and the vault of heaven reſounded the burſts of unpremeditated applauſe!</p>
            <p>But let us not even now deſpair of the cauſe of liberty. Let us not abandon a fair and noble regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on filled with objects which excite the thrill of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs or the glow of admiration, becauſe along the path which France has choſen ſerpents have lurked beneath the buds of roſes, and beaſts of prey have iſſued from the lofty woods: let us diſcover, if we can, a leſs tremendous road, but let us not renounce the land of promiſe.</p>
            <p>The citizens of Paris had been invited, and the invitation amounted to a command, to decorate their houſes in honour of the feſtival. Accordingly Paris on that morning, lighted up by brilliant ſun-ſhine, preſented the moſt gay and charming ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle imaginable. Woods had been robbed of their ſhade, and gardens to the extent of ſome leagues rifled of their ſweets, in order to adorn the city.
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031634_0176_0FED631A3529ECA0"/>
The walls of every houſe were covered with luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant wreaths of oak and laurel, blended with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; civic crowns were interwoven with national ribbands; three-coloured flags waved over every portal; and the whole was arranged with that light and airy grace which belongs to Pariſian fancy. The women wore garlands of freſh-blown roſes in their hair, and held branches of palm or laurel in their hands: the men placed oaken boughs in their hats, and children ſtrewed the way with violets and myrtle. The repreſentatives of the people had large three-coloured plumes in their hats, national ſcarfs thrown acroſs their ſhoulders, and noſegays of blended wheat-ears, fruits, and flowers in their hands, as ſymbols of their miſſion.</p>
            <p>From this profuſion of gay objects, which in happier moments would have excited delightful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, the drooping ſoul now turned diſtaſteful. The ſcent of carnage ſeemed mingled with theſe laviſh ſweets; the glowing feſtoons appeared ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood; and in the back ground of this feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſcenery the guillotine aroſe before the diſturbed imagination. I thought of that paſſage in Mr. Burke's book, "In the groves of <hi>their</hi> academy, at the end of every viſta I ſee the gallows!" Ah Liberty! beſt friend of mankind, why have ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary monſters profaned thy name, and fulfilled this gloomy prediction!—</p>
            <p>A great amphitheatre was raiſed in the garden of the Thuilleries immediately before the palace, now the ſeat of the convention. Upon a tribune in the centre of the theatre, Robeſpierre as preſident of the convention appeared; and having for a few hours diſencumbered the ſquare of the revolution of the guillotine this high-prieſt of Moloch, within view of that very ſpot where his daily ſacrifice of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031634_0177_0FED626CB8B6E3F0"/>
human victims was offered up, covered with their blood, invoked the Parent of univerſal nature, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the charms of virtue, and breathed the hope of immortality. When the foul fiend had finiſhed this impious mockery, he deſcended from the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, and walked with great ſolemnity towards a groteſque kind of monument that was raiſed upon the baſon in the front of the palace, which had been covered over for that purpoſe. On this monument was placed a miſhapen and hideous figure, with aſs's ears, which for ſome hours ſerved as an enigma to the gazing crowd, who knew not how to account for this ſingular appearance; till Robeſpierre having ſet fire to this image of deformity, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the ſymbol of atheiſm, its cumbrous drapery ſuddenly vaniſhed, and a fair and majeſtic form was diſcovered, emblematical of wiſdom and philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Atheiſm being thus happily deſtroyed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, attended by a numerous proceſſion of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and preceded by triumphal cars and banners, marched to the Champ de Mars, where with much toil and coſt a rocky mountain had been reared, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe lofty ſummit the tyrant and his attendants climbed, and from whence he once more harangued the people; and the feſtival cloſed with hymns and choral ſongs in honour of the Supreme Being.</p>
            <p>Robeſpierre on this day, intoxicated with his power, loſt ſight of his uſual prudence, and diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the littleneſs of his vanity. He cauſed a line of ſeparation to be made between himſelf and the other deputies of the convention, and marched at ſome diſtance before them, like a captain at the head of his band. He had the folly to diſplay his importance by keeping the convention and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled multitude waiting, and the ceremony ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031634_0178_0FED62B70209AEC8"/>
for two hours, while he was ſought for in vain. During the proceſſion his creatures attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe the cry of "Vive Robeſpierre!" but it was faintly re-echoed by the ſpectators, many of whom followed him with "curſes, not loud but deep, which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not."</p>
            <p>Two days after this feſtival in honour of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme being, Robeſpierre, the ſcourge of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, compelled the enſlaved convention to paſs a law, which permitted the revolutionary jury to condemn thoſe who were brought before them, from their own internal conviction, without any proof whatever, or hearing any witneſſes; and which alſo ſuppreſſed the ſuperfluous office of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial defender, or counſel; a privilege that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, who made the report in the name of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of public ſafety, aſſerted conſpirators by no means deſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">Amidſt the definitions of ariſtocracy, when the law paſſed againſt ſuſpected people, Couthon ingeniouſly obſerved, that any good citizen was authoriſed to arreſt every man in the ſtreet as an ariſtocrate, who held his head too much up or too much down, and alſo all thoſe who looked on one ſide, inſtead of looking you in the face.</note>. In other words, the jury were now authoriſed to paſs ſentence without even the forms of a trial. From this period, till the fall of Robeſpierre, all the judicial ſolemnities of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary tribunal conſiſted in reading over the names of the accuſed, who were immediately after declared by the jury to be guilty of a conſpiracy againſt the ſafety of the French people, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibility of the French republic.</p>
            <p>If any of the unhappy perſons thus proſcribed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpeak in their defence, they were thus ſilenced by the preſident: "Tu n'a pas la parole<note n="†" place="bottom">"It is not your turn to ſpeak."</note>" and if they perſiſted in declaring their innocence,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031634_0179_0FED631644210990"/>
they were put what was called "hors de debats;" that is, ordered immediately out of the court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their abſence, and ſent to execution. "I was not in priſon when this conſpiracy took place," cried the viſcounteſs de Noailles, madame de la Fayette's ſiſter. "But you would have been in the conſpiracy if you <hi>had</hi> been there," anſwered the preſident; and this unfortunate lady, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three children, periſhed with her own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and grandmother. Madame de la Fayette be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another priſon was, in the hurry of forming the liſts of death, forgotten when her family ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and ſtill lives. From this period the priſonſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became the ſcenes of unexampled horror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Till now, the crowds by which they were inhabited had ſubmitted to their fate with that cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſignation, and often with that careleſs gaiety which is buoyant at a Frenchman's heart in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that would altogether overwhelm the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits of the people of other countries. The houſes allotted for the priſons of the ſuſpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were for the moſt part hotels of emigrants, which were placed in the moſt agreeable ſituations of Paris, with extenſive gardens, and commanding beautiful views of the country. Such habitations had nothing of that gloom and darkneſs which we uſually aſſociate with the idea of a priſon, and they were peopled with the beſt ſociety of Paris.</p>
            <p>The ladies were attentive to the duties of the toilette, the gentlemen were polite and aſſiduous, and the court-yard of the Luxembourg, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of St. Lazare, and ſome other priſons, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited of an evening almoſt as much brilliancy and gaiety as the Thuilleries or the Champs Eliſées. Muſic and literature had their amateurs. At the Luxembourg, ſelect circles were formed to hear lectures from men of letters, ſometimes on chemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031634_0180_0FED627E903E6AB0"/>
ſometimes on aſtronomy. At St. Lazare, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſent invitations to dinner from the corridor of Frimaire to the corridor of Floreal, with the fame formalities as formerly from their reſpective ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. Sometimes cards, ſometimes bout-rimés, charades, and epigrams beguiled the evening of its length, and thus the days of captivity rolled on<note n="*" place="bottom">The maiſons d'arrét were now ſo multiplied that almoſt every ſtreet of Paris had its priſon, and in ſome of the ſmaller hotels the revolutionary laws were leſs rigorouſly obſerved than in thoſe which contained a greater number of priſoners. Inſtead of giving a ſketch myſelf of one of theſe milder abodes of captivity, I ſhall tranſlate a letter written to me on that ſubject by M. Maron, the proteſtant miniſter at Paris.</note>. They were indeed embittered by one hour of mournful melancholy, and one of trembling terror: the firſt when the evening paper arrived, and the liſt of the victims of the revolutionary tribunal was read over, among whom the priſoners ſeldom failed to find ſome friend or acquaintance to lament. But this was a ſenſation of gentle ſadneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that turbulent diſmay excited by the hoarſe voice of the turnkey ſounding at midnight through the long galleries the knell of ſome devoted vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, who was called upon to riſe, in order to be led to the Conciergerie by gendarmes ſent for that purpoſe from the revolutionary tribunal. Still, however, amidſt the tears which the priſoners ſhed over their loſt companions, many of them cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fond hope that they themſelves ſhould eſcape. But the law of the 22d of Prairial tore away every illuſion of the imagination or the heart, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the general proſcription of the priſoners in all its extent of horror. It was no longer a ſolitary individual who was called to death; multitudes were ſummoned at once. Every returning night, long covered carts drawn by four horſes entered ſucceſſively the court yards of the different priſons.
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031634_0181_0FED6333B83E6830"/>
Whenever the trampling of the horſes' feet was heard, the priſoners prepared themſelves for their doom. The names of the victims marked for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution the following day were called over, and they were inſtantly hurried into theſe gloomy hearſes. The huſband was ſcarcely allowed time to bid his wife a laſt farewell, or the mother to recommend her orphan children to the compaſſion of ſuch of the priſoners as might ſurvive the general calamity. At the priſon of the Luxembourg, an hundred and ſixty-nine victims were in one night torn from their beds, and led to the grated dungeons of the Conciergerie, that priſon over the gates of which might with equal propriety have been written, the ſame as over that of the infernal region of Dante,"<note n="*" place="bottom">"Let him loſe all hope who enters here."</note> Laſciate ſperanza voi ch'entrate;" for here it might literally be ſaid, "hope never came, that comes to all." I have ſeen the Conciergerie, that abode of horror, that anti-chamber of the tomb. I have ſeen thoſe infectious cells, where the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners breathed contagion, where the walls are in ſome places ſtained with the blood of the maſſacres of September, and where a part of the ſpacious court-yard, round which the grated dungeons are built, remains unpaved ſince that period, when the ſtones were taken up for the purpoſe of burying the dead. I have ſeen the chamber, where the perſons condemned by the revolutionary tribunal ſubmitted to the preparatory offices of the executioner; where his ſciſſars cut off the laviſh treſſes of the youthful beauty, and where he tied her tender hands behind her waiſt with cords. Merciful Heaven! and among thoſe who have thus ſuffered were perſons to whom my heart was bound by the ties of friendſhip and affection.—But though I have ſurvived ſuch ſcenes,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031634_0182_0FED62BB85691220"/>
they have left upon my heart that ſettled melancholy which never can be diſſipated—For me, the world has loſt its illuſive colouring; its fairy ſpells, its light enchantments have vaniſhed; and death, the idea moſt familiar to my imagination, appears to my wearied ſpirit the only point of reſt.</p>
            <p>The uſual pretext for thoſe murders <hi>in maſs,</hi> which were practiſed at this period, was that of a conſpiracy in the priſons; a vague and wide term which the tyrants might interpret at their pleaſure, and which gave them the power of including what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſons and whatever numbers they thought proper. Spies were placed in every priſon, who, after making out their liſts of proſcription as they were directed by the tyrants, declared that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy exiſted, of which thoſe marked on the liſts were the authors, or accomplices. Perſons who had never ſeen or heard of each other till that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were often brought together from different priſons to take their trial for the ſame conſpiracy: and when the decemvirs wiſhed to get rid of any particular individual, he was without any heſitation added to what was called the <hi>fournée,</hi> the <hi>batch;</hi> for ſuch was the appellation given to the crowds dragged together to the guillotine, and with ſuch terms of jocular familiarity was mourning humanity inſulted. Sometimes the perſons accuſed only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their act of accuſation as they were led up to the tribunal. Sometimes in the hurry, confuſion, and careleſſneſs with which theſe indictments were made out, one perſon was miſtaken for another. The ducheſs of Biron among other inſtances, went to the tribunal with an act of accuſation which was deſtined for her ſteward. The indifference of the tribunal with reſpect to ſuch errors, enabled monſ. Loiſerolles, at ſixty years of age, to deceive his barbarous judges, by dying for his ſon, a youth in
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031634_0183_0FED634A5474D8D0"/>
his twenty-firſt year. It was obſerved, that this generous parent, who thus a ſecond time gave life to his child, anſwered with uncommon alacrity when his name was called upon, and went with a look of exultation to the ſcaffold. Perhaps hiſtory does not offer a more affecting inſtance of parental tenderneſs, making the voluntary ſacrifice of life to ſave the object of its affection. But this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary epocha called forth the lights and ſhades of the human character in all their ſtrongeſt colouring. The laſt exceſſes of ferocious crimes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted by the ſublime enthuſiaſm of the virtuous affections, ſhedding their ſweetneſs like ſolitary flowers over the wilderneſs where ſerpents hiſs, and beaſts of the foreſt howl; and by the nobleſt efforts of heroical philanthropy bidding us ceaſe to deſpair of humanity, and converting the throb of indignant horror into the glow of ſympathetic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;—bidding us turn from the tribunal of blood, from Robeſpierre and his jury of aſſaſſins, to Loiſerolles dying for his child; to Madame Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renger, led in the bloom of life to execution with her parents, and, altogether forgetful of herſelf, ſeeking only to ſupport the ſinking ſpirits of her mother;—to madame Bouſquet, the ſiſter-in-law of Gaudet, ſcorning the impious laws which puniſhed humanity with death, affording ſhelter to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed friends, and dying with them on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold for having done ſo.</p>
            <p>Among the multitudes who periſhed at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, all were not armed with the ſame fortitude; and ſometimes even when tyranny ſpared the life of its victim, its cruel perſecutions bereaved the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer of reaſon. Of this mademoiſelle—was a melancholy inſtance. This unfortunate young lady ſaw her father, her mother, and ſeveral of her relations dragged to the ſcaffold: ſhe alone
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031634_0184_0FED633B111C7670"/>
was ſpared, and remained a priſoner at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciergerie. Along the gloomy vaults of that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic priſon, by the dim light of ſickly lamps, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw the mangled ſpectres of her murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parents, and in a ſhort time became entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of reaſon. She obſtinately refuſed all ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and remained motionleſs as a ſtatue, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her boſom her parrot, whom ſhe had inſiſted on bringing with her to her dungeon. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the other priſoners to take ſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe only anſwered, "<note n="*" place="bottom">"I want nothing.—No, he wants nothing.—My parrot is like me, he wants nothing."</note> Je n'ai beſoin de rien." "But your parrot," ſaid they, "your poor parrot is hungry." "Non," ſhe conſtantly repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "non, il n'a beſoin de rien—Mon paroquet eſt comme moi—il n'a beſoin de rien." The tyrant has fallen, and the dungeon of this unfortunate young lady is thrown open—but alas! for her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and freedom have come too late—her reaſon is gone for ever!</p>
            <p>The Poliſh princeſs Lubomirſka united with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior talents all the charms of early youth and diſtinguiſhed beauty. She had been travelling through different countries of Europe, and two years ſince was compelled to leave Berne in Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, on account of the attachment ſhe had avowed to the cauſe of the French revolution. She came with her huſband to Paris, and cultivated the ſociety and friendſhip of Vergniaud and of other deputies of the convention, who were the moſt eminent for their talents and their zeal for liberty. This democratic princeſs, to whom a true repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican would have offered a <hi>civic</hi> crown, became an object of reſentment to the vindictive Robeſpierre, on account of her friendſhip for ſome members of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031634_0185_0FED62ACD45A5B90"/>
the Gironde: ſhe was thrown into priſon, from thence ſent to the revolutionary tribunal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the jury of aſſaſſins to die. Being in a ſtate of pregnancy, her execution was deferred. In the mean time her friends gave information of her danger to Koſciuſko, the Poliſh general, and deſired his interpoſition in her behalf. Koſciuſko inſtantly diſpatched a letter to Robeſpierre, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the princeſs Lubomirſka had ever ſhewn the moſt devoted attachment to the principles of liberty, and conjuring Robeſpierre to ſpare the life of a zealous friend to the common cauſe in which France and Poland were engaged. Robeſpierre, after reading the letter, exclaimed, "<note n="*" place="bottom">"What! pardon for a princeſs!—Ah, Koſciuſko!—let her be guillotined."</note> Quoi! grace pour une princeſſe!—Ah, Koſciuſko!—qu'on la guillotine." The unhappy princeſs, having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, was immediately ſent to execution.—Two days before the fall of Robeſpierre, eight women who had been reſpited having declared themſelves pregnant, were dragged to the ſcaffold. Among this number was the princeſs of Monaco. As ſhe paſſed along the court of the priſon, ſhe ſaid to the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who were aſſembled to ſee the ſad proceſſion, and bid a laſt farewell to the companions of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, "I go to death with the calmneſs which innocence inſpires, and wiſh you from my ſoul a better fate." Then addreſſing herſelf to one of the turnkeys who was leading her towards the chamber where the executioner waited to bind the victims, "I have one favour to aſk you," ſaid ſhe, taking a pacquet from her boſom, "will you promiſe to grant it? This pacquet contains my hair: I implore your compaſſion, I conjure you in my own name, in the name of all who hear me, ſend it to my ſon, to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031634_0186_0FED6355B1509E58"/>
whom it is directed; ſwear to me in the preſence of thoſe virtuous perſons, whom the ſame deſtiny as mine awaits, that you will render me this laſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which I require of humanity." The diſmay and terror of one of her women who was involved in the proſcription, formed a ſtriking contraſt to the firmneſs ſhe herſelf diſplayed. "Take courage, my dear friend," cried the princeſs, "take courage, it is the guilty only who ought to fear."—The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Port Libre offered an affecting ſpectacle of filial piety. Madame Lachabeauſſiere, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a malignant denunciation made againſt her by her ſon-in-law, was not only dragged to priſon, but placed in a dungeon in cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the moment arrived when ſhe was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the tribunal. Her daughter, madame Maleſſi, who was already confined in another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, procured leave to be transferred to that where her mother was immured, whom by tears and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications ſhe obtained permiſſion to ſee. Madame Lachabeauſſiere was taken out of her dungeon, and led to her daughter, who flew towards her, and, throwing her arms round her neck, remained a long time preſſing her mother to her boſom, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power to articulate a word. After this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly interview, madame Lachabeauſſiere was led back to her dungeon. Her ſituation affected her daughter ſo deeply, that ſhe became bereft of her reaſon. Sometimes ſhe took up her needle-work for a few moments; then throwing it aſide, roſe with precipitation, and flew along the galleries of the priſon, till ſhe reached her mother's cell. She uſually ſeated herſelf at the door, and liſtened at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively: when ſhe could hear nothing, ſhe uſed to weep bitterly, and repeat again and again in a tone of deſpair, "Oh my mother! Oh, my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, my unfortunate mother!" She often remained
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031634_0187_0FED625BE7CA5720"/>
many hours together, ſeated upon the ſtone-floor, and ſhe was in a ſtate of pregnancy. Her hair hung diſhevelled over her ſhoulders, her eye ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bent on vacancy, her cheeks were ſometimes fluſhed with deep red, and ſometimes of a deadly paleneſs, and ſhe was often ſeized with convulſive faintings. Every day ſhe carried the greateſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her food to her mother, who without this ſuccour would have often wanted ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her ſupport. It is ſoothing to add, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Lachabeauſſier was ſnatched from death by the fall of the tyrant, and that her tender and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous daughter is reſtored to reaſon.</p>
            <p>While the tyrants, far from finding any ſatiety of blood in their daily murders, were erecting new ranges of ſeats in the hall of the revolutionary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, ſufficient to contain an hundred inſtead of fifty accuſed perſons, death now hovered in a new form over the priſons. The adminiſtrators of the police went to each priſon attended by a ſtrong guard, and ordered the priſoners to be ſhut up in their reſpective chambers, and not ſuffered to have any communication till the purpoſe of the viſit was effected. They then went ſucceſſively to every apartment, and demanded of the priſoners their knives, ſciſſars, razors, buckles, watches, and all the money they had in their poſſeſſion. Theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy perſons, being altogether ignorant of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the viſit, had no time to conceal any thing, and were ſtripped of all they had except fifty livres in paper, which each priſoner was ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in order to pay for his ſubſiſtence. But from this day famine ſcowled along theſe gloomy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, adding to the pangs of mental ſufferings thoſe of debility and diſeaſe. The priſoners were no longer permitted to receive their daily meals from their own houſes, or from a tavern; but were
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031634_0188_0FED634D236124E8"/>
ordered from henceforth, in conformity to the laws of equality, to eat à la gamelle<note n="*" place="bottom">Out of one diſh at a common table.</note>. Their food was provided for them at the rate of fifty ſous a day, by a cook placed in the priſon. Their nouriſhment conſiſted of one meal in twenty-four hours, often too ſcanty to ſatisfy the calls of hunger, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times compoſed of ſuch nauſeous diet as the greater part of the priſoners were unable to eat.</p>
            <p>Age and infirmity were denied every indulgence neceſſary to ſupport the diſordered frame, or raiſe the ſinking ſpirits. A little bread ſaved from this wretched meal, and water, was all that could be obtained during the reſt of the day<note n="†" place="bottom">Even the priſoners of war ware compelled to ſubmit to this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous treatment. General O'Hara has ſince told me, that after having avoided the gamelle for ſome weeks on the plea of illneſs, he was at length forced to ſhare the common evil. His friends in England will be glad to hear that he is now releaſed from his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a priſon, and from a gendarme when he walks out, and is gone on his parole to Chantilly.</note>. To this meal the priſoners at the Luxembourg, where nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons were confined, were ſummoned in a ſucceſſion of three hundred at a time, by a great bell, which called them to a hall, at the door of which ſtood the jailor, who had been an execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er under Collot d'Herbois at Lyons<note n="‡" place="bottom">The keeper of the priſon at the time we were in confinement, Benoit, diſtinguiſhed in Paris by the epithet of the bon Benoit, had long before this period been turned out of office, being unfit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the purpoſes of his maſters.</note>. This man was remarkably tall, big, and muſcular; his arms were bare to the elbow; he wore a fierce red cap, which had now become the ſymbol of blood, and looked as if he were prepared for a maſſacre. He only ſuffered twenty perſons at a time to enter the hall, and then flinging the door in the faces of the others, obliged them to remain in the paſſages till
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031634_0189_0FED630AF2AD4440"/>
thoſe within were ſeated at the table. The hour of dinner paſſed like the other hours of the day, in gloomy and unbroken ſilence; for even the ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercourſe of converſation was now forbidden, under the penalty of being dragged immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal, ſince the ſpies placed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whenever they obſerved two or three perſons talking together, inquired ſternly if they were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſpiracy. What moſt occupied the minds of the priſoners at this period was contriving the means of eſcaping from their tyrants by a voluntary death, which was now become difficult, ſince they had been ſtripped of every inſtrument which could have ſerved that purpoſe. Such was the ſituation of theſe unhappy victims of tyranny, when on the night of the 9th of Thermidor the tocſin ſounded, and the city was called to arms. Many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which I ſhall afterwards relate, led the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to believe that theſe ſounds were the ſignal of a general maſſacre. But the tocſin now rung the joyful, the triumphant peal of liberty. Before I give you a detail of the ſcenes which paſſed on the 9th of Thermidor, I muſt trace the political events which led to that memorable epocha, and reſcued France from a ſtate which was the aſtoniſhment and ſhame of human nature; from a ſtate more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than all which the moſt cunning tyrant could have inflicted upon ſlaves whom he had previouſly diſarmed. And all this was ſuffered by a nation which called itſelf free, which had taken up arms to aſſert its freedom, and gained the moſt glorious vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in its defence. France, covered with all the laurels of heroic valour, and the terror of combined Europe, held out her neck to vulgar aſſaſſins and executioners, inſtead of crumbling them into duſt.—Such are the ſtrange contradictions of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031634_0190_0FED62A7B07EA470"/>
The effects reſulting from the terrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of revolutionary government upon the moral world, may perhaps be compared to thoſe produced upon the natural ſcene by the tremendous tempeſts which ſometimes ſweep along the weſtern iſlands; when the mingled elements ruſh forth in irreſiſtible fury, when the deluging waters bear away vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, trees, and rocks, and the ſhrieking whirlwinds ſhake the dwellings of man to their foundations.—The ſtorm is paſt—the enormous vapours have rolled away—a ſoft light hovers on the horizon, and we are now left at leiſure to ſigh over the ruins that ſurround us, and lament the victims laid proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate by the blaſt. But let us hope that this ſtormy revolution will at leaſt produce ſome portion of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to ſucceeding generations, who have not, like us, felt the tumultuous horrors of this convulſion of the paſſions, who will owe their happineſs to the ſtruggles of a race that is paſſed away, and whom they have never known; while we, who have been ſpectators of the cruel conflict—we, who have loſt the friends we loved and honoured, are often unable, amidſt the tears we ſhed over their tombs, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, "all partial evil as univerſal good."</p>

I cannot however promiſe you any very intereſting detail: the hotel Talaru, converted into a maiſon d'arrêt of the ſection Lepelletier, has been the ſcene of no very remarkable events. It never was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the number of thoſe fatal depôts which were called the antichambers of the guillotine. But it is probable that it would have had its turn alſo. There
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031634_0192_0FED62A32DD04D50"/>
is even room to believe that it would not have been long delayed, if the ninth of Thermidor had not, for our good fortune, deranged certain <hi>anthropopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> meaſures announced by Barrere in the ſitting of the convention previous to that day. But I am anticipating facts; and as I have to write a journal, and not an epic poem, I ſhall keep within chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical order.</p>
                  <p>Though my reſidence in Paris does not exceed twelve years, I have witneſſed the building of the hotel Talaru, in the rue Richelieu, now rue de la Loi, near the national library, by the marquis of that name; who was firſt maitre-d'hôtel to the queen. Conſiderably reduced in his fortune by the new order of things, the citizen Talaru took laſt year the reſolution of leaving his hotel, and of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing into the adjoining houſe, which alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, and which was called the little hotel Talaru. He let the great hotel to one Gencé, a tavern-keeper, who intended to make it a furniſhed hotel. Gencé, on reflection, thought that it was not probable that any conſiderable number of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners would come to Paris under the preſent circumſtances, or that the citizens of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would now find Paris a very pleaſant abode; and fearful that he had made a bad ſpeculation, he was anxious to rid himſelf of the affair. We had now reached that diſaſtrous period when maiſons d'arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t ſprang up in every quarter; when every ſection in Paris had its excluſive priſons at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of its revolutionary committee; and Gencé propoſed the hotel Talaru to the revolutionary committee of the ſection Lepelletier, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this patriotic purpoſe. His propoſal was accepted, and the agreement made; but I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt what were the conditions. A German
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031634_0193_0FED6307F95932B8"/>
porter was put into this new priſon, and the mine became worth the digging.</p>
                  <p>In reality, all whom their evil deſtiny led hither were made to pay for their lodging a moſt exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant price. Such was in a ſhort time the fate of Talaru himſelf. He expreſſed a wiſh, on account of his age and infirmities, to have a room to himſelf; and he obtained this ſpecial favour at the rate of 18 livres a day, that is, paying almoſt as much for his ſmall apartment as he himſelf was paid for the whole houſe.</p>
                  <p>I was the eighth perſon who was lodged in a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſaloon on the ground floor towards the garden. We each paid four livres a day. This ſaloon therefore brought in three hundred livres a decade, nine hundred and ſixty livres a month, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and fifty livres a year; and the whole hotel was let by the proprietor for ſeven thouſand livres. What became of this exorbitant rent, and among whom were the ſpoils divided, as I have never been in the ſecret, I can give no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on that head.</p>
                  <p>On the 10th of Thermidor we were about two hundred priſoners.</p>
                  <p>If any perſon complained of theſe extortions, he was anſwered, "Citizen, you are at liberty to leave this place, and if you like you may be transferred elſewhere." But the fear of being thrown into ſome one of thoſe houſes which were premature graves, made us bear with reſignation the ills we had.</p>
                  <p>It was on the 19th of Prairial that I exchanged my own modeſt apartment for the fine ſaloon in queſtion. The order of the committee of public ſafety by which I was arreſted, did not expreſs in what priſon I ſhould be confined. I aſked therefore the agent of the committee, who was the bearer of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:031634_0194_0FED634ED3CFD2B8"/>
the warrant, conjointly with two members of the revolutionary committee of my own ſection, if I might be allowed to chooſe my priſon? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courteouſly, that he did not wiſh for any thing more than to oblige me.</p>

I ſaw ſome receive their wives and children, others their friends and miſtreſſes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both ſexes met together; every one amuſed himſelf as he thought proper, and fared as he liked. If it was not the image of <hi>liberty,</hi> it was at leaſt that of <hi>equality</hi> and <hi>fraternity;</hi> and I ſaid to myſelf, "Well! if we muſt build our tabernacles here, ſo let it be!" How many perſons whom I knew were much more to be pitied than myſelf! The art of contentment is to look not at what is better, but what is worſe than our own ſituation.</p>

                  <p>The very day of its proclamation (21ſt Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1792, O. S.) I was arreſted at Seves, for twenty-four hours, from having met the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and the military force of the place, at the houſe of one of my friends whom they were come to take to priſon, and who was then gone to Paris to confound the calumny of his perſecutors before the committee of general ſafety.

                     </note>, embittered my exiſtence more than the rigours of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; tempered, I allow, by a great number of unhoped-for-comforts, and by a ſtoical tranquillity of which I did not think myſelf capable. Society was become to my feelings the Cape of Storms, my priſon was the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                  <p>My firſt regrets were beſtowed on the feſtival of the following day; that which was celebrated in
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031634_0197_0FED63100DA4A918"/>
honour of the Supreme Being. My abſence from this national ſolemnity gave me pain. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that has been ſaid of the decree of the convention expreſſing the adheſion of the French nation to the immutable principles of all morality and all worſhip, I cannot help obſerving that this decree is one of thoſe propoſed by Robeſpierre which I diſapproved the leaſt. Atrocious diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſocial order, by carrying to their utmoſt length the moſt impious abominations, had thrown on republican France a general odium. Juſtice had overtaken theſe perſons; but the coaleſced pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were not leſs careful to take advantage of this delirium, and diſcredit the cauſe of liberty with their own people, by treating as <hi>atheiſts,</hi> that is to ſay, as univerſal <hi>diſorganizers,</hi> its partiſans and friends. The national repreſentation was willing to give an authentic and formal denial to this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; and it is true that in this point of view the decree had a good effect. The convention never entertained the abſurd idea of decreeing that God exiſted, that the ſoul was immortal, and that the French ought to believe this becauſe ſuch was the good pleaſure of the legiſlature. It meant, by a declaration of a kind as new as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were in which it was placed, to abſolve and exculpate a great nation from thoſe calumnious imputations ſeized on by its enemies to ſerve their views; and I repeat it, all the friends of principle have applauded the decree, and I confeſs that I was enthuſiaſtic in its favour.</p>
                  <p>It was for its object, and not the mode of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the feſtival of the 20th of Prairial, that I regretted my abſence from it. The mode I had judged beforehand would be a ſeries of pantomimes and <hi>harlequinades;</hi> and during a long walk I had taken in the country a few days before, I had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031634_0198_0FED627621E3A0F0"/>
the devaſtation made in the woods, and in particular among the young trees around Paris; a devaſtation which extended over the whole ſurface of the republic, and of which our ſons as well as ourſelves will feel the ſad effects.</p>
                  <p>I compoſed, two or three days after my arreſt, the following couplets, in which I attempted to deſcribe my moral ſituation, and which I ſent to a few friends to comfort them on this point. They are ſet to the air of the "vaudeville de la Soirée orageuſe," which the affecting adieus of Mountjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din to his wife and his friends have ſo much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to make the faſhion.</p>

It was common enough, however, to have a news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper ſmuggled in, and then it was privately hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and ſought after with anxious curioſity, for we never failed learning the death of ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance or friend; but we were informed alſo of the ſucceſs of our armies; and their victories

ſometimes compenſated for our individual pains and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort time had elapſed, when in the chamber where I lodged we had a precious reſource for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. The firſt ſecretary of the liquidation office, the citizen Dutilleul, was one of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-priſoners. He was ſo neceſſary in his office, that the director-general Denormandie was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed <hi>to put him in requiſition</hi> every time he ſtood in need of him, and this happened almoſt every day. At ſeven o'clock, Dutilleul was ſent for at the maiſon d'arrèt, and conducted by a gendarme to his office, where he paſſed the whole day at work; and the grateful republic put him under lock and key every evening. Judge how well he was queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on his entrance; and it happened pretty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>through inadvertence</hi> he had left the "jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of debates and decrees" at the bottom of his pocket. In the meanwhile we killed the preſent time, and ſhut our eyes on the future, by play and bodily exerciſe; ſuch as battledore and ſhuttlecock, and fives: we feaſted, read, and made <hi>bout-rimés.</hi> I frequently partook of the two laſt amuſements with a very amiable young man named R—n, and we had a Muſe, who daily amuſed herſelf in ſetting up ſome prize, which my antagoniſt, I own, generally obtained. Till then we had neither of us had any idea of our talent for poetical compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition<note n="*" place="bottom">I was one day employed in the exerciſe of a talent of another kind than that of making <hi>bout-rimés,</hi> and which I alſo acquired in priſon, and that was waſhing the diſhes; when the boy who made our beds, being alone at that moment with me, looked at me at firſt with an embarraſſed air, and then ſtared with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment while he aſked me half a dozen ſucceſſive queſtions. "Pray, ſir, are you a proteſtant?" "Yes" "Did you know any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Niſmes?" "Yes." "Rabaut St, Etienne?" "Yes."—His eyes gliſtened—"Are you a miniſter, ſir?" "Yes." "Of the Dutch embaſſy formerly?" "Yes." "And now at St. Thomas de Louvre?" "Yes."—The boy burſt into tears—. "Good God! ſir, is it poſſible that it can be you?—What! you here! I can ſcarcely believe my own eyes!"—And then wiping away his tears, he told me who he was, and talked to me of Niſmes, and my reſpectable friend Paul Rabaut, and his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate brother Rabaut St. Etienne. "No, no, ſir," added he, "you ſhall waſh no more diſhes; I will take care of that, and I beg your pardon for not having known you ſooner." I thanked the good lad, and informed my compannions of his offers. He rendered each of us the ſame ſervice, which was worth fifteen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres to him a decade; and I was afterwards indebted to him for many little acts of kindneſs.</note>.

                  <p>Thus paſſed away the long days of Prairial and Meſſidor; Thermidor came. Till this time we had been ſoothed with the conſoling idea, that the hotel Talaru was only a depôt of priſoners detained

as a meaſure of general ſafety, and not of thoſe who were termed ſuſpected; and that there was little apprehenſion of any thing more than captivity. The fourth of this month robbed us of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

How long he ſeemed to us in returning! He came at laſt; but his return was accompanied by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that appeared extraordinary.

He came the next day to viſit his old companions, and impart to us the good news. He informed me on this occaſion, that a Dutchman called Van Hooff had been dragged to the guillotine at the moment when he (Rouſſelin) entered the Conciergerie, and that he lay down on the bed yet warm of this unfortunate man, who had juſt left it. Van Hooff was my friend; and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy cataſtrophe affected me extremely. I was
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:031634_0207_0FED635A322094A0"/>
ſo much the more ſtrongly perſuaded of the death of Van Hooff, as it was announced in ſeveral of the public papers: and you may imagine without much difficulty what was my aſtoniſhment, when a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or three weeks after, I received a letter from Van Hooff, in which he congratulated me on the juſtice which had been done me, and begged me to uſe my intereſt to procure him his liberty. I haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the priſon of Pleſſes to ſee him, where he had been juſt transferred. He cleared up the myſtery of his reſurrection, by informing me that the canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals had guillotined, from a miſtake in the name, a poor Brabanter, who was called Van Hove, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of himſelf. Not having had it in his power to repair this error till it was too late, he had taken advantage of it, and acted the dead man till far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders.</p>

            <p>THE ſurrender of Lyons, which took place ſome-days previous to the murder of the deputies of the Gironde, contributed to haſten the execution of that atrocious deed. The Lyonnais had long ſtruggled againſt the commiſſaries of the mountain faction, who, under the pretence of an ardent zeal for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were diligent in ſeeking opportunities for riot and plunder; and however ſtrongly this detachment of conſpirators were ſupported by thoſe who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their motions from Paris, they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the indignation and vengeance of the citizens of Lyons, who, rouſed by the dangers with which
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:031634_0208_0FED63F74663F898"/>
they were threatened, cruſhed their oppreſſers, the chief of whom, Chalier, they ſent to the ſcaffold. The Lyonnais had proceeded too far to hope for any mercy from the faction, who had now accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their treaſon at Paris: and ſeeing the cauſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty abandoned by the departments, who had made their peace with the traitors, they were driven ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer patiently the weight of their wrath, or prepare to oppoſe it. Of this dreadful alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive they choſe the latter; but finding themſelves unſupported in the project they had at firſt formed of marching to Paris, they determined to defend their own city. In the mean time they employed the moſt honourable means to explain to the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their reſiſtance aroſe neither from diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the republic, nor from any wiſh to form a federal government, of which they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; that they had ſworn fidelity to the republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can conſtitution, and had iſſued orders to aſſemble the primary aſſemblies for its acceptance. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for any cauſe was now a crime, and this conceſſion of the Lyonnais only ſerved to increaſe the inſolence of their oppreſſors, who decreed that the city was in a ſtate of rebellion, and that all who had reſorted thither from the neighbouring depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be treated as emigrants: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators eaſily perceived that this city might form a central point of oppoſition, by collecting together all thoſe perſons in the ſouthern provinces who were averſe to the revolutionary order of things. An army was immediately levied, and ordered to march againſt Lyons; and it was believed that when the Lyonnais were informed that the affair was about to became ſo ſerious, they would make no farther oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The general who commanded the conventional army, endeavoured by proclamations to conciliate
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031634_0209_0FED63B34A53C898"/>
the parties, but in vain. His propoſals of pardon were rejected by thoſe who thought themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and who know by fatal experience what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence was to be placed in the offer of tender mercies from the cruel. The Lyonnais were allowed three hours to deliberate on the gracious propoſitions of the general, but a diſcharge of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non returned their anſwer before the firſt had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; and though new proclamations were iſſued, and on the anniverſary of the 10th of Auguſt both parties ſent deputations to celebrate that event to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Lyonnais continued their warlike oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and prepared to make an obſtinate reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the department of Mont-Blanc, formerly Savoy, was recovered by the Piedmonteſe, who took advantage of the abſence of the army which had been called off for the purpoſe of reducing Lyons; and the repreſentatives who conducted the operations of the ſiege wrote to the convention to repeal the decree which the conſpirators in their wrath had poured out againſt that city. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnais were as deaf to theſe conceſſions as they had been to the proclamations of the generals, who now proceeded to extremities, and began the bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the city, which was ſet on fire in ſeveral places, and a great number of the inhabitants pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. Other proclamations followed this act of hoſtility, which met with the ſame reception. The black flag continued floating on the towers, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating reſiſtance till death; and though the city, being unfortified, had nothing to defend it but the bravery of its inhabitants, no impreſſion could be made except by bombardment. The conſpirators therefore ſent their emiſſaries into the adjoining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments to raiſe the people <hi>in maſs;</hi> and, if any credit is to be given to the reports of thoſe who were employed, the beſieging army was reinforced
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:031634_0210_0FED63BBC871BA58"/>
by other armies amounting to fifty thouſand men With this reinforcement the attack began afreſh the city was ſurrounded, all communication cut off, and the convention was informed that famine would ſoon effect what the obſtinacy of the Lyonnais had hitherto prevented. During three months theſe brave republicans contended againſt the numerous armies that the conſpirators had aſſembled; and had not their ardor been checked by their commanders, they would all have witneſſed againſt the cowardice and baſeneſs of their countrymen, by whom they were left unſupported, with the laſt drop of their blood. After having performed prodigies of valour, till they were overpowered by numbers, and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance became no longer poſſible, they endeavoured to effect their retreat, by forcing their way through the beſiegers; for according to the diſpatches ſent to the convention they were entirely ſurrounded. In this retreat ſome ſucceeded; but a great part were cut to pieces, and the conventional army entered the city in triumph.</p>
            <p>With the ſavage joy of the famiſhed cannibal, when he ſeizes on ſome ſhip-wrecked wretch whom the waves have unkindly ſpared from the fate of his companions, the mountain conſpirators heard of the reduction of Lyons. The committee of public ſafety, through the organ of Barrere, in congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the convention on the news, informed them that meaſures were taken to exterminate every fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; that no weakneſs, no mercy ſhould be ſhewn; and that this den of conſpirators muſt make ample reparation, and that this reparation muſt conſiſt in burying this rebel city under its own ruins. And leſt this moment of wrath ſhould be tranſient, leſt the indignation which had filled their capacious ſouls ſhould evaporate, theſe guardians of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic weal methodized their vengeance by a decree,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031634_0211_0FED636C861C0E70"/>
which the convention ſanctioned, that Lyons ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d be razed on the ground, and ſtruck out of the cities of the republic. This "great and vigorous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the total deſtruction of the city, was the only one that had eſcaped us," the deputies in miſſion at this devoted place echo to their colleagues of the committee. They had already created military tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals to judge the inhabitants; but complete ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination had not been within the reach of their comprehenſion: and left this example of vengeance ſhould be loſt to the world by ſome miſplaced heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſome ſentiment of weak humanity, the committee diſpatched one of its own members to direct and ſuperintend the execution.</p>
            <p>What had hitherto paſſed was ſcarcely the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of horrors. Collot d'Herbois, a comedian, who had been driven from the ſtage for his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional incapacity, but who had acted a conſiderable part in the conſpiracy, was gone thither to give tragedy ſome original ſtrokes. "Alas," ſays the eloquent reporter on the correſpondence of Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre and the extent of his enormities, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>"O Lyons! city celebrated for thy commerce, who is this new Gengis<note n="*" place="bottom">Gengis, unknown and deſpiſed under the name of Themu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, returned as a conqueror to avenge the inſults which he had received.

            <p>It is unneceſſary to aſk of the unfortunate inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as I have ſometimes done, the hiſtory of their woes—their tyrants blazon themſelves their crimes to the open day, and invite you to read the black catalogue of their enormities. "In deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031634_0213_0FED64231F81C008"/>
a rebel city," ſays Collot, "we ſhall conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the reſt. We muſt leave nothing but aſhes. We demoliſh with cannon balls, and with explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions like thoſe of mines." When ſuch were his principles, his projects, and his exploits, it would be trifling to ſtop to talk of individual diſtreſſes—to relate how he ordered three ladies, who had thrown themſelves at his feet to implore his mercy, to be tied for ſix hours to the ſcaffold where their huſbands were to be executed; or to ſpeak of the execution of a young heroine, who had ſhewn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of valour during the ſiege. Theſe were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interludes in this great tragedy, one of whoſe languiſhing actors, in his exiſting correſpondence writes, that ſince the guillotine has been at work, his health has been eſtabliſhed; that every thing goes well, and is expected to go better; "ſince it is found," continues he, that the guillotine is not ſufficiently expeditious, and in a few days three or four hundred will be diſpatched at a time; and the houſes are faſt demoliſhing."</p>
            <p>This was no empty menace—the tragedian exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted what this ſavage had promiſed.—"The guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotine and fuſillade do not go amiſs," ſays he; "ſixty, eighty, two hundred at once are ſhot, and every day care is taken to arreſt a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo as not to leave the priſons empty." But ſtill theſe were ordinary means. This new Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneus was not contented with the inſignia of the god, he panted to imitate his deſtroying power; and accordingly ſome of the miſerable inhabitants were placed before batteries of cannon; and while they were ſhattered and torn in pieces by the artillery, though the greater part were left to be diſpatched the following day by the ſpades of thoſe who came to bury them, Collot amuſed himſelf in beholding the operation.</p>

               <pb n="215" facs="unknown:031634_0214_0FED642E88CD0D40"/>
During this waſte of life, that of the property of the unfortunate victims was not more reſpected. "It coſts four hundred thouſand livres each decade for <hi>demolitions,</hi>" writes one of theſe demons, who talks of re-colonizing the country. "More heads every day, more heads are falling. What ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thou wouldſt have felt," adds the monſter to his correſpondent, "if thou hadſt ſeen this national juſtice executed on two hundred and nine raſcals! What cement for the republic! We have knocked off five hundred; and when we have diſpatched twice as many, which we ſhall do, things will go forward."</p>
            <p>Where then, it might be aſked, was the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while theſe horrors were executing? Where? Alas! this convention, ſent by a free people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate their liberty, was in chains. Had it been leſs enſlaved, the decree, that Lyons ſhould no longer exiſt, would have juſtified the executioners.—Collot was not willing that this decree of devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould remain a figure of rhetoric—he ſays ſo: "The revolutionary army arrives the day after to-morrow, and then," continues he, "I ſhall be able to perform great things. Theſe conſpirators muſt ſoon be diſpatched—Lyons muſt exiſt no longer—and the inſcription thou haſt propoſed," for this letter is addreſſed to Robeſpierre, "contains a great truth, for hitherto the decree has been but an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi> It will be your buſineſs to make it what it ought to be, and we will prepare the amendments before hand."</p>
            <p>This was the private correſpondence of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with Robeſpierre. But let us not conceal his language to the convention itſelf. "We are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened," ſays he, "againſt the tears of repentance—Indulgence is a dangerous weakneſs—The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molitions are too ſlow—We muſt employ means

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion of the mine, the devouring activity of the flame alone can expreſs the omnipotence of the people: its will cannot be impeded like that of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; it ought to have the effect of thunder."

               </gap> in the aſſembly.—It was the plan of Collot to baniſh thoſe whom he did not deſtroy; for he found it difficult to carry his purpoſe into full execution; and after having murdered a part, and exiled the reſt, he diſcovered that he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his commiſſion, and ſhould be able on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ſay with truth, that Lyons exiſted no longer.</p>
            <p>"What ideas! what fury!" exclaims the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter: "it ſeems as if the moral world was fallen back into chaos. And theſe are legiſlators! Alas! if the Erebus of the ancients had had its legiſlation alſo, it would undoubtedly have been more conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and more humane."</p>
            <p>We are at firſt tempted to believe, in paſſing in review theſe ferocious characters, that all the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the deſert had quitted their dens to ruſh in on our cities; or rather, to adopt more natural ideas, we cannot help diſcovering the end of theſe horrible levellers, which was the deſtruction of commerce, and the eſtabliſhment not of an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of happineſs, but of an equality of miſery, throughout the republic.</p>
            <p>It will ſcarcely be thought poſſible, yet it is very generally believed, that Collot was led to this ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the people of Lyons for having hiſſed him when he acted on their ſtage. Thouſands of victims have atoned for the inſult offered to a wretched comedian; and this great city, which from the time of Auguſtus had been the centre of the commerce of Gaul, where he laviſhed his favours,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031634_0216_0FED640F96E69C20"/>
and for three ages received the tribute of gratitude in the honours that were rendered him, had now fallen under the ſtroke of the moſt vulgar of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. Had theſe monſters looked for precedents for their cruelties, they might have found them in their prototype Caligula, for in this very city that tyrant once reſided: and the reſemblance of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula and Collot is ſo far ſtriking, that they both exerciſed their deſpotiſm over the ſame claſs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; though the motives of Caligula appear to have been more natural than thoſe of Collot, and his cruelty more diſcriminate.</p>
            <p>While this tragic ruffian was acting his part at Lyons, others with principles as atrocious, though they were leſs ſteeped in blood, were carrying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation into other parts of France. Bourdeaux, which had been raiſing itſelf to the height of the revolution, was now a prey to the caprice of a young monſter who had not yet counted twenty years, and who was the valet of Robeſpierre in the commiſſion of crimes. The republican patriots having long ſince fallen under the proſcription, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien's inſtructions and plan ſeem to have been the eſtabliſhment of <hi>ſancul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His correſpondence is as ſilly as it is atrocious, and of its atrocity we may judge when he condemns the meaſures of blood already taken as being moderate and almoſt counter-revolutionary. It appears that he was one of the firſt who had denounced the enormities of Carrier; but ages of puniſhment or repentance will not atone for the murder of Salles and Gaudet, who were executed at Bourdeaux dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Julien's adminiſtration, together with Gaudet's father, mother, ſiſter and her huſband, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's brother, and one of his aunts; in ſhort, the whole family, excepting Gaudet's wife, whoſe

            <p>NO claſs of men were more intereſted in the preſervation of the abuſes of the ancient govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the prieſts. When the conſtituent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly leſſened the influence of the higher clergy, by ſtripping the church of its domains, and making the ſalaries of its miniſters more equal, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional wealth was not only increaſed, but the great maſs of the prieſthood were ſatisfied with the diſtribution. The majority of thoſe who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto directed the machine of the revolution were fully perſuaded that the prieſthood ſhared but little in its ſpirit; and, knowing that whatever does not keep pace with his career, retards its progreſs, had ſought at different times to diſſolve the alliance of the church and ſtate altogether. They felt indeed that the article in the declaration of rights, which ſays, "that no one ſhall be diſturbed in his religious opinions," muſt be eventually ſubverſive of the eſtabliſhed religion; ſince whoever believed it to be not only unneceſſary and expenſive, but hoſtile to the great principles of liberty, would murmur at contributing to its ſupport.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable part of the clergy refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to the civil conſtitution which the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſembly had formed, alleging that in matters of religion, or in the regulations of the church, no one ought to guide their faith, or receive their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but the perſonage who, in conſtant ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031634_0218_0FED63F8F17B3C80"/>
from the great author of chriſtianity, had held the delegated power. This claſs had by their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity loſt their employment, but they were not the leſs cheriſhed on that account by thoſe who thought with themſelves, that man was made for the ſabbath, and not the ſabbath for man. The zeal of theſe non-jurors for the faith which they contended was once delivered to the ſaints, was too ardent to ſuffer this humiliation of the church in ſilence; nor was the vigilance of the friends of the revolution leſs awake to counteract their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. The majeſty of the church, of which they believed themſelves to be the only true ſupporters, would not permit them to bow before the majeſty of the people; and when the legiſlative aſſembly undertook to be the interpreters of the law, and enacted decrees for the baniſhment of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional clergy, they ſought refuge in the majeſty of the throne, the cheriſhed ally hitherto of the church, whoſe power was at this time ſcarcely more confirmed than its own.</p>
            <p>The protection given by the court to the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring clergy haſtened the ruin of both<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the ſecret hiſtory of that eventful period which overthrew both the monarchy and the church in France, madame Roland has left us many curious particulars. The principal actors are now no more, except Servan and Dumourier—all the reſt having periſhed on the ſcaffold. See Appendix, No. VI.</note>. The king refuſed at firſt to ſanction the decree of the legiſlative aſſembly, who however at length prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and when the royal power was annihilated, which happened not long after, the prieſts were compelled to ſeek aſylums of charity in foreign countries, of thoſe whoſe anceſtors had fled from the bloody perſecutions of their order, but whoſe injuries the ſons had forgotten; or if ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031634_0219_0FED641267D19698"/>
they perhaps anſwered as Guiſe did to Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot, "If your religion enjoins you to murder, ours compels us to forgive."</p>
            <p>The diſpoſition of the national convention was ſtill more unfavourable than that of the legiſlative aſſembly to the civil eſtabliſhment of the clergy. The truth is, that the enlightened part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had conſidered religion as a perſonal thing. Thoſe who believed, of which the number was not very great, thought the protection of the ſtate no addition to its dignity; and thoſe who diſbelieved, or, which was the ſame, confounded the doctrines of chriſtianity and the eſtabliſhed church, thought that its alliance was not only burdenſome, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. The great diviſions of the contending parties for the government gave the prieſthood reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite. But no ſooner was this queſtion decided, and the reign of Robeſpierre eſtabliſhed, than the men of reaſon, as they called themſelves, renewed the attack againſt the men of the church, who were unable to make any farther reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The conſtitutional clergy had no protection but that which was given them by the conſtitution now proſcribed, and had inſpired no intereſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees, who conſidered them rather as apoſtates from religion, than defenders of the faith; and treacherous guides in the road of ſalvation, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their compliance with the law.</p>
            <p>A ſtrict adherence to the ceremonies and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Romiſh church was not the only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition that darkened France. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a more terrible nature and more deſtructive of ſocial order, which was atheiſm. Voltaire has obſerved, that a reaſoning atheiſt is a greater ſcourge to mankind, than the moſt ſanguinary fanatic. The commune of Paris had aſſumed this character; and, having twice contributed to overturn the civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:031634_0220_0FED639C9119A7B0"/>
of the country in the ſpace of a few months, imagined that the kingdom of the next world was to be taken by force as well as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſent. This formidable project was conceived, and brought to maturity in modeſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The good people of Paris, who had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves but little about religion, but who imagined that there might be ſomething good in it, as there is in the worſt of vocations, were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed to ſee the archbiſhop of Paris, with his clergy, preſent themſelves at the bar of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, attended by the conſtituted powers of the department and the municipality, "to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;" that is, to abjure their former belief, and make their new confeſſion of faith, in which they declared that there was no other duty than liberty, no other goſpel than the republican conſtitution, and no other worſhip than equality. This illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not the reſult of the deep ſtudies either of the archbiſhop or his vicars. The ſecret was imparted to him by Chamette, the procurer of the commune, to whom it was diſcovered by one Clootz commonly called Anacharſis, a Pruſſian by birth, and an atheiſt by profeſſion, whoſe hiſtory I have already related. Clootz had written a book, which he told the convention on preſenting it was the fruit of fifteen hours labour every day during the courſe of four years. He alſo inſtructed them, that this work, ſingular in its method and curious in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, overturned at one ſtroke all ſects, antient or modern, of natural or revealed religion.—Of this work, which "proved the nothingneſs of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion," the convention decreed the acceptance, and honourable mention; and, thus armed, Anacharſis ſet out on his travels to convert the world to athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. There was ſomething maſterly in his firſt
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:031634_0221_0FED63B7CE1DA9A8"/>
attempt; and had he been ſatisfied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the archbiſhop and the commune, whom he brought to the bar of the convention, he might have enjoyed his triumph in ſecurity; but when he attempted to proſelyte the convention itſelf, Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre oppoſed the invader with his doctrine of the Supreme Being, and Anacharſis was ſent to the priſon of the Luxembourg. There a friend of mine found him in daily controverſy with Thomas Paine, who had juſt written "The Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," for his credulity in ſtill indulging ſo many religious and political prejudices. Soon after, this vain enthuſiaſt was ſent by his polemic antagoniſt Robeſpierre to the guillotine, where many of his converts in ſucceſſion followed him, and among his pupils was the archbiſhop.</p>
            <p>Many of the biſhops and prieſts who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in the aſſembly, and ſome of the miniſters of the proteſtant faith, animated by the example of the archbiſhop, made their public recantation. Of this laſt ſect one obſerved that, though his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of faith inculcated, more than any other, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligations, yet, as the great day of judgment was arrived, the reign of reaſon, the triumph of philoſophy, he muſt diveſt himſelf of his ſacerdotal character, and become regenerated alſo, ſince, as he confeſſed, "tous les pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tres dans tous les cultes ont toujours un peu de charlataniſme<note n="*" place="bottom">All prieſts of all religions have a little ſpice of the mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank.</note>."</p>
            <p>The ingenuouſneſs in the members of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion provoked the ſame candour in thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The prieſts having confeſſed that there was a little quakery in their adminiſtration of the next world, the phyſicians crowded to the bar of the commune, to acknowledge that they had been "un
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031634_0222_0FED63675B279960"/>
peu prêtres" alſo, and that a little ſpice of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank dealing entered into their adminiſtration of this. Admitting that nature and reaſon were the beſt remedies, they made offerings of their diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas by which they had been authoriſed to cure <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum artem,</hi> in direct contradiction to both; and this virtuous dereliction of their former practice was rewarded with applauſes and civic inſertion.</p>
            <p>Reformation, as well as terror, was the order of the day: the ſearching eye of the commune left nothing unexplored. To the epuration of the prieſts and phyſicians, ſucceeeded that of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians, who had no profeſſional ſins to confeſs, ſince they had acted their parts on the ſtage of the world without any diſguiſe. However, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune thought that thoſe who had been in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of perſonating princes, and nobles, and queens, and counteſſes, could little reliſh habits of equality, and therefore ſent to priſon both actors and actreſſes as ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of reform did not ſtop at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the ſpoils of the church to the ſervices of the ſtate. It ſeized on thoſe privileges which in all countries, and under every eſtabliſhment of religion, have been accorded with the common conſent of mankind, and on the exerciſe of which much of the order and happineſs of the world has been thought to depend. On our entrance into the world it is the prieſt who confers on us our moral exiſtence; in riper days it is he who hallows our affections; and without his diſmiſſion we have been taught to think that our road to heaven was not altogether ſecure. Of the two firſt of theſe func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the legiſlative aſſembly had taken poſſeſſion—the fathers brought their children to be regenerated at the municipal font, and the lover led his bluſhing miſtreſs before the altar of Hymen, and received
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:031634_0223_0FED636F59A03228"/>
her from the hand of the civil officer, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their union "in the name of the law." The care of diſpoſing of the citizens at death yet remained to the church, and the funerals continued to darken the way in long proceſſions, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune ſeized on this laſt prerogative of the clergy, and decreed, that gay revolutionary colours of the nation ſhould take place of the funeral pall—the prieſts ſhould be changed into municipal officers, and the cemetery ſhould be called the place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where, inſtead of the hope of being troubled with a reſurrection, the citizens ſhould have the privilege of ſleeping for ever.</p>
            <p>The church of Notre Dame was changed into the temple of Reaſon; and the commune, with the divinity herſelf, attended by a ſplended train, came to requeſt the convention to ſanctify with their preſence the conſecration. The Goddeſs of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was a fine blooming damſel of the opera-houſe, and acted her part in this comedy alſo to the entire ſatisfaction of her new votaries. From her impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial throne, in which ſhe was borne by four por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhe deſcended to the right hand of the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the convention, and by a decree received the fraternal kiſs, as ſoon as the procureur of the commune, who attended as high prieſt, or maſter of the ceremonies, had announced her negative and poſitive character; "firſt, that ſhe was not, like the objects of the ancient worſhip, a cold and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate image; and next, that ſhe was a maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of nature; and that her ſacred form had ſo enflamed every heart, that only one univerſal cry was heard, "No more prieſts, and no other gods!"</p>
            <p>When the deputies arrived at the temple, the Goddeſs of Reaſon introduced them to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Liberty, who came out of the houſe of Philoſophy, to receive their homage, and beſtow
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:031634_0224_0FED63AC6A9CD810"/>
her benediction. The enemies of the revolution encouraged theſe follies, which the patriot diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and lamented: and the philoſopher would only have ſmiled at theſe tranſient puerilities, had they not been mixed with atrocity and crimes. Alas! the reſpect for Reaſon was as fleeting as the reſpect for other ſtrange gods; for her altars were ſoon deſerted, and her high prieſts, and the divinity herſelf, were ſoon after conducted amidſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the people to the guillotine. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the regeneration of the metropolitan, thoſe who felt the ſame conviction of its neceſſity made confeſſion of their ſins, and applied for the conventional bleſſing. This conviction neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was far from being general in either profeſſion; for though the conſtitutional clergy were attached to the cauſe of liberty, and rejoiced in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their country, they did not imagine that the belief of reward in a future ſtate would make a leſs virtuous citizen of the preſent. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-revolutionary obſtinacy was held in great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Though the commune had called on Reaſon, like the prieſts of Baal, "from morning until noon," the votaries at her ſhrine were few and ſolitary, and it became neceſſary for the honour of the goddeſs, that more revolutionary meaſures ſhould be purſued. Accordingly, attended by the committees of the ſections, and the popular ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Paris, the municipality appeared a ſecond time at the bar of the convention, where, after a philippic againſt the unrecanting clergy, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſuppreſſion of their ſalaries, and that thoſe who believed in "the tales of augurs ſhould pay them." The convention, who probably had as little faith in augurs as the commune, had how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever more charity, and deferred the ſentence of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which the municipality had decreed. The
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:031634_0225_0FED6387A345D8A0"/>
commune, though it did not ſucceed in the attack on the prieſthood, was more ſucceſsful in its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks on the church. The word of order was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and the ſtreets of Paris were filled with mock religious proceſſions. The moſt ludicrous maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querades preſented themſelves in every quarter; pioneers and artillery-men led the march, clothed in the ſurplices of the inferior clergy; the national guard were arrayed in the habits of the prieſts; the revolutionary citizens of the ſection were veſted in garments ſtill more coſtly; the revolutionary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and the prieſteſſes of Reaſon had ſanctified themſelves with the dreſſes belonging to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and St. Frances and St. Bridget; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary committee had reſerved for their own decoration, with great prudence, all the garments of fine gold, embroidery and jewels, while the caps of the prieſts and the mitres were placed on the heads of the horſes employed in dragging theſe weighty ſpoils, which were to be preſented to the convention. Theſe offerings conſiſted of croſſes, ſuns, vaſes, chandeliers, and chaſes, apoſtles and ſaints in gold and ſilver, St. Anthony and his pig, St. Roche and his dog, and all the other ſaints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered in the calendar who were found to be of the ſame metallic worth. From the convention, after undergoing the ſentence of condemnation for ariſtocratical and counter-revolutionary principles, they were ſent to be regenerated at the mint, and make expiation for the long ſeries of impoſitions they had been practiſing on the world, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a new form, the protectors of liberty and the republic.</p>
            <p>The wooden ſaints, who in moral and religious eſtimation were equal, and oftentimes ſuperior, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſaical rank to their brethren, though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in theſe moments of irreligious phrenſy
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:031634_0226_0FED63E9306B6E78"/>
was infinitely leſs, were committed, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, to the flames at the place of execution. And into the ſame unhallowed fire were thrown thoſe ineſtimable treaſures which had been for ages the conſolation of the ſuffering believer, and the refuge of the faithful and pious. Amid the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious pile lay three eyes of the evangeliſts; a blue jacket, bedaubed with paint, taken from the wardrobe of St. Luke; a piece of ragged tent cloth, that had been purchaſed from the warehouſe of St. Paul, and his cloak, which had been left with Carpus; a few of the coats and garments of St. Dorcas, which the weeping widows had ſhewn to St. Peter; all which, with other relics ſtill more precious, ſuch as ſome of the moveables belonging to the holy Virgin, with parts of her apparel; the ſpoon and pap-diſh of the holy child; the head of ſome renowned ſaint of St. Genevieve's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the bones of the patroneſs of Paris herſelf, with her linen, and other property found in her chapel<note n="*" place="bottom">This holy ark had been regarded with religious awe, as the palladium of Paris, and a ſecurity for the protection of St. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevieve. It had been eſtimated at millions: but whatever might have been its worth in former times, it was now conſiderably diminiſhed, ſince the precious ſtones with which it was orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented had been diſplaced by other ſtones of little value. The figures engraved on this ſacred utenſil were ſingular enough for a ſaint. On one ſide was Mutius Scaevola, in the heroic act of putting his hand into the flames, with Conſtantine the Great, and Jupiter and Hebe; while Venus and Cupids were ſporting on the other. The ſaint had ſurely paid little attention to the outſide of the dwelling.</note>, of which age had obliterated the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with arms, legs, toes, and little fingers of illuſtrious martyrs, became the prey of revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary flames, kindled with bundles of the real wood of the croſs.</p>
            <p>But theſe civic ſacrifices were not confined to the worſhippers of the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem; the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:031634_0227_0FED637108F9E1D0"/>
alſo burnt with the ſame patriotic zeal; the followers of Moſes and of Calvin applauded theſe votive offerings of their catholic brethren. They beheld with ſecret ſatisfaction the downfall of a power, of which they had been for ages the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, while they depoſited the precious ornaments and utenſils of their own worſhip, but without complimenting the ſtate with the abjuration of their religious belief. In this madneſs againſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition ſome method was obſerved. Almoſt every monument that bore the mark of genius, every relic that could contribute to the progreſs of the arts, was preſerved with care, and depoſited in places of ſafety. Many a ſaint owes his reſcue from deſtruction to the chiſel of the ſculptor or the painter's ſkill; and except in a few of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nothing was deſtroyed that was worth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving.</p>
            <p>The great depoſitory at St. Denis nevertheleſs ſuffered from this reforming rage. The crowns of Dagobert and Clovis; the ſceptres of Philip the beautiful, and Henry the fowler; the ſilver helmet and golden ſpurs of Charlemagne; and the rich variety of treaſure ariſing from the munificence of ſovereigns to the tutelary ſaint of France, were mingled together in the crucible of the mint. The bodies of theſe monarchs and heroes were not treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with equal reſpect; for, as the edict had gone forth againſt every veſtige of royalty, and every mark or remnant of ariſtocracy, the tombs in which they had been for ages quietly inurned were forced to open their ponderous jaws; and thoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Jacobins, worſe than "the helliſh rout that tore the Thracian bard in Rhodope," had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to ſee the bones and aſhes of the long line of their Charles's Henries, and Louis; of their Condés, Montmorencies, and Turennes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:031634_0228_0FED6424CE922DC8"/>
whoſe loweſt valets they would have trembled in ſubmiſſive ſilence, become the prey of famiſhed dogs, and the ſport of the winds.</p>
            <p>One of the pretences for this violation of the dead, which was general around Paris, and in ſome of the neighbouring departments, was the want of the coffins that encloſed them to make bullets for the uſe of the army. The cemeteries were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the revolutionary lead-mines. If the ramblings of imagination might be indulged amidſt the horror which this ſort of plunder inſpired, we might purſue theſe revolutionary inſtruments of death to their deſtination, and ſee many an emigrant laid proſtrate with the former covering of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents' duſt. On many a countenance doomed to long night, the ſun once again ſhone, and many met its beams, whoſe features preſerved all their original force and character. Among others, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Sevigné was found entire, with the unfading bloom of healthy and virtuous old age: but as the edict againſt ariſtocracy and privileges comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed talents as well as birth, the wiſe as well as the mighty ſuffered in the general proſcription againſt lead coffins; except Deſcartes, whoſe bones were put into a baſket, and carried to the Pantheon, where he is fated to repoſe with the "immortal and divine Marat."</p>

            <head>LETTER XV.</head>
            <p>WHILE Paris was delivered up to the moſt execrable factions, of which I ſhall hereafter give you a detail, the weſtern departments became the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:031634_0229_0FED63C9DDEBB6B8"/>
theatre of calamities infinitely more tremendous. The ſtruggles which took place previouſly to the 31ſt of May between the republicans and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, together with the defeat of the northern armies, and the defection of Dumourier, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the attention of government from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by which they were menaced in the Vendée. Of this war we yet know but little, and what we do know is only the hiſtory written by the party which perſecuted.</p>
            <p>Of all the evils which infeſt mankind, thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by war are the moſt deſtructive. The hurricane, the earthquake, and the volcano, thoſe convulſions in nature which ſhake the earth to its baſis, and ſeem to threaten it with annihilation, are not to be compared with the ſcourges of war. We read of cities beſieged and taken by ſtorm, without ſympathizing very deeply in the hiſtory. We ſee neither the inſidious mine which ſhatters a thouſand limbs at one blow, nor hear the cannon and the bomb, which perform the work of deſtruction more openly. The ſoldier climbing precipices, or ſcaling walls, to fall with indiſcriminate rage on the old, the infant, and the defenceleſs, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert flouriſhing cities into one vaſt cemetery, is only a being of romance to thoſe who have lived at a diſtance from ſuch ſcenes, and the terror of whoſe days has glided away in tranquillity. When the laws of war according to the regulations of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized ſociety are obſerved, the miſeries are ſtill tremendous: the laws of nature are perverted; it is the young, not the old, that deſcend firſt to the tomb, and all the dear and tender relations of life are broken—the father laments his ſon—the wife the huſband torn from them to ſerve the purpoſes of ambition or cruelty—whole countries are depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:031634_0230_0FED63C044CE31B0"/>
fields lie uncultivated, and famine produces deſpair.</p>
            <p>If ſuch are the evils attendant on war when men murder each other without provocation and without reſentment; when they ſcarcely know either the cauſe of the diſpute which brought them into the field, or for whom they are going to ſhed their blood; what muſt be the horror of that conflict where every regulation of humanity is conſidered as conſpiracy and treaſon, where every action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes laudable in proportion as it becomes fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, where murder is the only mark of bravery, and where extermination alone is conqueſt!</p>
            <p>The progreſs of the royaliſts after the events of the 10th of Auguſt to the epocha of Dumourier's defection, had remained unnoticed; nor was it till they had raiſed a moſt formidable camp and menaced Nantes, Angers, and other cities, and iſſued their formal manifeſtoes demanding the re-eſtabliſhment of the prieſthood, nobility, and royalty, that any effective meaſures were taken to repreſs them. The firſt generals that were ſent againſt them, who were Berruyer, Marie, and Ligonier, acted, it is ſaid, as if they were their allies, rather than their enemies; and Quetinau, who ſucceeded them, is accuſed of having ſurrendered Touars, with the magazines which it contained, and an army of four thouſand men.</p>
            <p>Theſe defections on the one ſide, and the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the royaliſts on the other, at length rouſed the convention, who decreed that an army of three hundred thouſand men ſhould be raiſed to ſuccour what they called the patriots in the Vendée, who were oppoſed by the robbers. As this ſeemed to be an extra-ſervice, great rewards were given to thoſe who would enliſt to go and aſſiſt "their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;" but moſt of theſe heroes, who were paid
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:031634_0231_0FED6417927328E8"/>
enormous ſums to perform this act of charity, went and increaſed the armies of the malcontents, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fighting againſt them. A ſhort time after the 31ſt of May, Saumur was taken by the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and a number of other important places, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>irs, Partenay, Breſſuire, and Fontenay the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the department, fell into their power. The armies of the convention fled continually before numbers greatly inferior, and abandoned their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, baggage, and cannon; ſo that the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déan troops were furniſhed completely with ſtores, of every kind from the cowardice of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional forces, or the treachery of their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. While theſe diſgraces befel the armies on the weſtern ſide, Nantes, which was beſieged by an army of forty thouſand men, was defended with five thouſand, by Canclaux, who by the prudence and vigour of his operations ſaved the province of Brittany, and gained ſeveral important victories. Other generals who appeared to have the means as well as the intention of finiſhing the war expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, among whom was the former due de Biron<note n="*" place="bottom">Madame Roland was a priſoner with Biron in the Pelagie, "At this moment," ſhe ſays, "Biron is my fellow priſoner. Biron came to Paris at the latter period of Pache's adminiſtration, to denounce him to the convention, provided with papers to prove the miniſter's dilapidations. Biron ſaw him, was ſeduced by his ſeeming frankneſs, and was perſuaded that there was more of ignorance than of ill intention in his conduct. He felt how cruel it would be to ſend a man to the ſcaffold who might only have been deceived: he abandoned his intention, of which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Pache himſelf. Pache comes to an explanation, gets into his own hands the papers and proofs of the complaints againſt him, and ſends Biron to the army in Italy [the Vendée ſhe ought to have ſaid] where he leaves him in want of every thing. He gains a few advantages, nothing is ſaid about them; he makes reclamations, no attention is paid; the time runs on, the evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes; he inſiſts, and is ordered to Paris, where he arrives, and is ſhut up in the Pelagie. He now knows the hand of Pache in the tyrant who oppreſſes him."</note>,

                  </gap>
               </hi> generals, were loaded with eulogiums by the conſpirators of Paris, in proportion as they were defeated by the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
            <p>The royaliſts, encouraged by their ſucceſſes, and finding themſelves ſo well ſeconded by theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, marched on the 27th of July towards Angers, and to a bridge which was an important paſs, called the bridge of Cé. Orders were given to evacuate this poſt, as had been done in preceding inſtances. But contrary meaſures being taken by a deputy in miſſion, and other diſpoſitions being made by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tune, both places were ſaved, and for the firſt time a victory was obtained. This general gained a ſtill greater advantage, and a fortnight after he was broke.</p>
            <p>The evacuation of Cholet by the royaliſts would have been the conſequence of their defeat; but when general Rey was propoſing to take advantage of his victory, an imperial edict of the ſame ſanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culotte general forced him to a retreat. As a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſucceſſes which Rey afterwards gained, he alſo was broke; and his adjutant, who came to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to plead for him, was thrown into the dungeon of the Conciergerie.</p>
            <p>Theſe plans of military operations were not likely to be attended with much ſucceſs, and have appeared at all times myſterious. Phillipeaux, in his ſtrictures on this war, calls it a ſtrange pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon for hiſtory, that the government ſhould have looked calmly on, whilſt thoſe who gained victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were diſgraced, and thoſe whoſe only proweſs had conſiſted in converting whole armies compoſed of ſome of the braveſt and beſt diſciplined troops in the republic, into heaps of carcaſes, were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed and continued in command. Phillippeaux,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:031634_0233_0FED6377DB8618C8"/>
in his letter to the committee of public ſafety, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them that the two generals Ronſin and Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignol had butchered from forty to fifty thouſand patriots.</p>
            <p>But time reveals moſt myſteries. At this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the conſpirators in Paris were more in dread of the reſentment of the departments than they were of the army of the royaliſts. Of the various calumnies which they invented againſt the deputies who had fled from Paris, that of joining the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts was the moſt induſtriouſly propagated; and while the proſcribed deputies were held up to the public as the ſupporters and actors in a cauſe which all parties agreed to call rebellion, the conſpirators found themſelves juſtified in taking the meaſures beſt fitted to exterminate the only rivals they had to dread. Had the royaliſts been defeated, and the rebellion cruſhed, the calumny would have been diſcovered, and all pretence for puniſhment taken away. It was the intereſt therefore of the uſurpers to menace the people with the vengeance of royaliſm and federaliſm united; and none were better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to fulfil their intentions, than thoſe inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and profligate men, who had the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable talents for procuring the defeat of the armies they commanded.</p>
            <p>Whether or no this be the real explanation of that which has been deemed ſo myſterious, muſt be left to the conſideration of thoſe who wiſh to penetrate into this labyrinth. When we ſee the hiſtory of the war of the Vendée written by the royaliſts themſelves, it is probable that they will ſay, that their own valour, and the goodneſs of the cauſe in which they were engaged, gave them theſe victories. In yielding its full force to this expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſuppoſing that the conventional armies were defeated by braver troops, it will yet remain
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031634_0234_0FED637AAF3E5470"/>
unexplained, why, of two claſſes of conventional generals, thoſe who beat and thoſe who were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the former ſhould have found either impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the ſcaffold, and the others prodigality of favours.</p>
            <p>The uſurpers having ſucceeded in their criminal deſigns againſt the republican party, now found it neceſſary to rid themſelves of the royaliſts, whom they had hitherto made uſeful to their deſigns. The latter end of Auguſt they formed a different plan for the remainder of the campaign, which conſiſted in attacking at once the royaliſts from every point, and finiſhing the conteſt as it were at a ſingle blow. The army on the northern ſide was committed to Roſſignol and Ronſin, and the revolutionary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and the army on the weſtern coaſt were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to Lechelle. However well this plan might have been combined, the firſt ſpecimen thoſe who were to execute it gave of obedience to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions was to ſuffer the inſurgents to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the iſland of Noirmoutier, Machecoul, and other places, and evacuate Montaigu, where they abandoned immenſe magazines of every ſort, and the army was reduced to ſleep in the open air; while their ignorant or treacherous leaders kept at a convenient diſtance, ſurrounded by actreſſes, courteſans, and all the licentiouſneſs of an eaſtern camp, with all the vulgarity of the loweſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</p>
            <p>This defeat was followed by many others, and by the capture alſo of ſeveral towns. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which Lechelle made was ſo contrived, that his troops had not the means of effecting a retreat. The protection of the city of Nantes was entruſted to him, and he ſuffered a body of ſome hundred royaliſts to cut off its proviſions for ſeveral days in the face of his whole army; and when the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031634_0235_0FED63CB8C08E308"/>
of the people requeſted him to ſend a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to reſcue a convoy of flour which had fallen into the enemy's hands, he treated the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with contempt.</p>
            <p>While this general was diſpoſing of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional armies on the weſtern ſide, his colleagues Roſſignol and Ronſin, the latter of whom having ſeen ſome ſervice took the title of <hi>miniſter-general,</hi> were preparing to execute the plan of the campaign on the other ſide. Inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to attack the enemy, they halted for ſome time at Saumur and Tours, ſo as to let the royaliſt army acquire its proper conſiſtency. To ſurround the enemy was the great object; and orders were ſent to the commanders of the ſouthern armies at Niort, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon, and Partenay, to co-operate. The event of this arrangement was, conformably to the ordinary ſyſtem, the total defeat of theſe diviſions; and on the 18th of September ſo admirably were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions obeyed, that fifty thouſand men at Coran and near the paſſage of the Loire at Cé, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ronſin and Roſſignol, were attacked by an army conſiſting of three thouſand royaliſts only; and what could appear ſcarcely credible, the <hi>ſanſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte</hi> generals had ſo ingeniouſly arranged their troops, that they were not only defeated by this inconſiderable detachment, but the ſlaughter was immenſe.</p>
            <p>This extraordinary defeat will not, I am told, ſurpriſe any military man, when he hears that the conventional army was arranged for battle in a ſingle column, in the defiles of Coran, with eight men in front, and preſenting a flank to the enemy, who had poſſeſſion of the heights, of nearly twelve miles in extent. The artillery, inſtead of being placed on thoſe heights, under the protection of a ſtrong detachment, as was propoſed by the guides,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031634_0236_0FED637F3100EC00"/>
and thoſe who knew the country, was placed at the head of this long column, and of courſe fell into the hands of the royaliſts, who turned it againſt the conventional troops, and made great carnage. In the mean time, detachments of the enemy gained poſſeſſion of the heights without difficulty and without reſiſtance, maſſacred the troops below, taking them in flank, and made them, from the confuſion into which they were thrown, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minators of each other.</p>
            <p>The generals who commanded this expedition were, in the mean time, regaling themſelves at a diſtance, with their miſtreſſes, ſome of whom were afterwards goddeſſes of reaſon; but they had the prudence to deſtroy their magazines, inſtead of leaving them as uſual at the diſpoſition of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The harveſt of that part of the country was juſt then gathered in, and would have ſufficed them for a whole year, had they ſecured it agreeably to the orders of the convention.</p>
            <p>This new plan of a campaign was not attended with more happy ſucceſs than the former, and the myſtery which embarraſſed Phillippeaux became ſtill more inexplicable. It would be difficult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to define what could be the motive which led the government to look with ſo much complacency on this continued ſyſtem of defeat and carnage, did we not ſee what combinations of crooked policy were put into execution to ſecure the purpoſes of ferocious ambition. The party of the Gironde, being completely cruſhed, gave them no longer any inquietude, and it became now the intereſt of the uſurpers to bring the war to a ſpeedy iſſue. The two former plans not having ſucceeded, the committee of public ſafety publiſhed another. Theſe conſpirators had ſeen how efficacious their decrees had been in ſeveral inſtances, and therefore
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:031634_0237_0FED642678790BE8"/>
imagined a mode of putting an end to this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conteſt by decreeing that it ſhould finiſh on the 20th of October, and that the generals ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the triumphal crown on the firſt of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following. We ſhould be inclined to ſmile at this exceſs of folly, if that diſpoſition were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by indignation and horror at the atrocious orders which were given for this purpoſe to their armies, "that deſolation and indiſcriminate deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt now become the order of the day."</p>
            <p>The decree having ſtated in expreſs terms, "that all the retreats, mills, and ovens of the robbers ſhould be deſtroyed and burnt, and that the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of war ſhould be ordered to ſend combuſtible matter for that purpoſe;" and the proclamation of the convention having invited the ſoldiers of liberty to exterminate all theſe robbers, before the end of October; "the ſoldiers of liberty," and all thoſe who were invited to the accompliſhment of this new plan of the campaign, prepared to put it into execution. Neither the committee of uſurpation, nor the convention had been nice in the definition of their terms, and therefore the ſoldiers of liberty undertook to conſtrue them at their pleaſure. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, every houſe of the peaceful inhabitant came within the definition of the retreat of a robber, ſince every inhabitant of the Vendée was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a robber, and conſequently his dwelling muſt be a retreat.</p>
            <p>Whether or no the inſtruments of this barbarous and execrable policy reaſoned after this manner, they certainly became practical logicians; and the army, in addition to their hundred thouſand bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, were armed with a hundred thouſand torches; and having been pronounced by the uſurpers the executors of their juſt vengeance, the property of the armed royaliſt and the peaceable republican be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:031634_0238_0FED63C82E6198A0"/>
alike objects of their rapacity and fury; and indiſcriminate maſſacre and plunder were literally the order of the day.</p>
            <p>In the firſt days of the revolution, when liberty and philoſophy went hand in hand together, what a moral revolution was inſtantly effected throughout Europe, by the ſublime and immortal principles which this great change ſeemed about to introduce into government! But what eternal regrets muſt the lovers of liberty feel, that her cauſe ſhould have fallen into the hands of monſters ignorant of her charms, by whom ſhe has been transformed into a Fury, who, brandiſhing her ſnaky whips and torches, has enlarged the limits of wickedneſs, and driven us back into regions of guilt hitherto unknown!</p>
            <p>So unexampled are the crimes which have been committed, that it will require ſtronger evidence than the hiſtorian is commonly bound to produce, to perſuade future generations of their reality. Alas! but a faint outline has been drawn of this terrifying picture, over which the friend of liberty would, if it were poſſible, like the recording angel, drop a tear, that might blot it out for ever.—"If ſome ſweet oblivious antidote" could drive from my brain the remembrance of theſe things, and from my heart the feelings that oppreſs it, as well as from the knowledge of the world, I ſhould be tempted to ſnatch from the enemies of Liberty the triumph they aſſume from this mournful hiſtory. But theſe horrors muſt ſtain the page of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for ever. The bloody characters muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main indelible on the wall, a dreadful, but inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive leſſon to future ages, and to thoſe countries, which are deſtined to labour through revolutions, and who will learn, while they contemplate this
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:031634_0239_0FED64044F026840"/>
terrific chart, how to avoid the rocks on which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has been nearly wrecked.</p>
            <p>Dreadful indeed has been the criſis we have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed! yet it is ſome conſolation, amidſt this mighty maſs of evil, that France is at length beginning to learn wiſdom from the things ſhe has ſuffered. France no longer looks around to find apologies for the crimes that have been committed: ſhe herſelf holds up the criminals to the world. She boaſts not of her victories over Europe armed againſt her rights; but ſhe triumphs in the conqueſts ſhe has made over herſelf. It is ſome relief, while I am ſtruggling through the gloomy hiſtory of theſe horrors, that I ſee again the dawn of that glorious light which will chaſe them away. The laſt ſtroke has been given to that vile and degrading ſyſtem, which ignoble uſurpers had framed: we may now approach the altar of Liberty with confidence and hope; the hideous ſpectres that haunted it have fled for ever; and its incenſe in future will riſe grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to heaven, and ſpread fragrance over a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated land.</p>

               <p>Conſidering that at this laſt epocha they beat to arms, rung the tocſin, and fired the alarm guns; that the barriers of the city were ſhut, all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication cut off, the ſecrecy of letters violated, the hall of the convention blockaded by an armed force of more than 60,000 men; that a formidable artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was ſtationed at every avenue of the national palace, that furnaces were fixed to ſerve the guns with red hot balls, and that every preparation was made for an attack; that the battalions enrolled for the Vendée, but detained for this purpoſe in the neighbourhood of Paris, were amongſt the number of the beſiegers; that ruffians in the pay of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and fitted for the execution of their bloody projects, occupied the moſt important poſts and the paſſages of the hall; that they were openly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their zeal by diſtributions of proviſions and money; that at the moment when the national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention preſented itſelf in full aſſembly at the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the national palace to enjoin the military to withdraw, the commander, inveſted by the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators with the moſt abſolute dictatorſhip, had the audacity to inſiſt that the proſcribed deputies ſhould be delivered up to the vengeance of the people; and that on the refuſal of the convention he had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to call to arms, and put in danger the lives of the repreſentatives of the French people:</p>
               <p>Conſidering, finally, that it is by machinations ſuch as theſe that they have forced from the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather from a ſixth part of the members who compoſe it, a decree which pronounced the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary ſeizure and deprived of their functions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accuſation, without evidence, in contempt of all forms, and through the moſt criminal violation
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031634_0243_0FED638E74FBF318"/>
of the rights of man and the national ſovereignty, thirty-two repreſentatives marked out and proſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſpirators themſelves:</p>
               <p>They declare to their conſtituents, to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of every department, and to the French peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe rights and ſovereignty have been thus ſhamefully violated, that from the moment in which the unity of the national repreſentation has been broken by an act of violence, of which the hiſtory of nations has never yet furniſhed an example, they have neither been able nor have they thought it their duty to take any part in the deliberations of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly:</p>
               <p>That driven by theſe unhappy circumſtances to the impoſſibility of oppoſing by their individual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions the ſlighteſt obſtacle to the ſucceſs of the conſpirators, they can only proclaim to the whole republic the hateful ſcenes of which they have been both the witneſſes and the victims.</p>

               <p>REPUBLICANS, you are acquainted with the dangers which threaten the public weal. They are ſo great that we muſt either take arms and die in the field of honour, or ſubmit to the ſtroke of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin in our homes. We muſt ſave the republic, or periſh with it: we muſt crouch to anarchy or deſtroy it. We muſt reſume our rank among the nations, or yield the precedence to the ſlave of the Aſiatic deſpot, or the uncivilized Tartarian horde.</p>
               <p>When the national repreſentation, by loſing its unity, becomes virtually diſſolved; when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:031634_0244_0FED63D99B0F6DE0"/>
whoſe deputies are ſhamefully arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſider themſelves in reality as no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; when the majeſty of the people is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the attempts committed againſt its manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; when the faction which is longing for the return of royalty inſolently domineers over that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted city by which we are menaced, there is no longer any room for heſitation.</p>
               <p>Shame and ſlavery, or let us fly to Paris! You waſte the precious moments which are yet left to apply the remedy, in deliberating on the diſeaſe. Your country, your liberties, your honour as French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yourſelves, your wives, and children, are loſt. Neither public nor private fortunes any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger exiſt: you loſe four years of toil, of care, of labour, of watchings, of battles, and torrents of blood ſhed in defence of the moſt glorious of cauſes. Theſe will be inevitably loſt, and it is but a vile handful of factious traitors who are deciding on the liberty of twenty-five millions of men.</p>
               <p>In this critical and deſperate ſituation one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral voice is heard from the centre to the confines of the republic. It proclaims that the nation is rouſed, to conquer or die. The nation is rouſed; let us march! Marſeilles calls on you; Marſeilles which has unqueſtionably ſo much right to your confidence, and ſo deep a concern in the ſupport of this revolution, of which ſhe has given ſo noble an example. This appeal is the laſt uſe which ſhe wiſhes to make of the liberty of ſpeech in order to promulgate the great reſolutions ſhe has adopted, and the deciſive meaſures ſhe has taken. Far from a warlike people, far from a nation of ſoldiers, who wait only the ſignal for battle, be the vain tinſel of words! To dare, and to act, is all we have to do.</p>
               <p>Let us ſtrike; and let Frenchmen, ſo long cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed as frivolous, ſhew the world, that if they
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031634_0245_0FED639147060110"/>
deſerved the imputation while under the controul of kings, they have now reſumed their antient habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and are become independent and formidable like the Gauls and the Franks, from whom they glory in being deſcended.</p>
               <p>Republicans, who pant for liberty and deteſt licentiouſneſs, who abhor royalty, and deſire the eſtabliſhment of the republic united and undivid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, league yaurſelves with the Marſeillois, who breathe the ſame vows already made by a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of departments. They declare that the preſent political ſtate of Paris is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a declaration of civil war againſt the whole republic.</p>
               <p>They accuſe, and preſent to you as guilty of all the diſorders that afflict France, Philip d' Orleans and his faction; the frantic monſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Marat.</note> whoſe venal howlings are his purchaſe, and whoſe name would ſully this declaration; the den of the Jacobins of Paris; the ſeditious and factious men who are ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves throughout the republic, and excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to commotion. Marſeilles points them out as common enemies, who have been wiſhing to lead us to the brink of the precipice, to adulterate their monſtrous but meaſured ſyſtem of anarchy with a king of their own creating: and this king would have been the moſt diſhonoured being in exiſtence; a man overwhelmed with debt, rich in diſgrace, debauchery, and baſeneſs; a man whom no virtuous citizen would admit among his ſervants, and who would be driven by themſelves from their ſociety; a man, in ſhort, who is impriſoned within our walls, and of whoſe ſpeedy and ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are equally deſirous.</p>
               <p>We invite you to ſign with us this juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable covenant which we propoſe for the
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:031634_0246_0FED64072185CD68"/>
public ſafety, and to wipe off the ſtain of ſo many injuries.</p>
               <p>Marſeilles, therefore, declares, that it is in a legal ſtate of reſiſtance to oppreſſion, and that it is authoriſed by the law to make war againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious:</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it can no longer acknowledge a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whoſe unity is violated, to be the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; and that at that period only, when the deputies of the people ſhall be fully and freely reinſtated in their functions, the nation will obey its orders with confidence and ſubmiſſion:</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the throne of anarchy has been raiſed on the wrecks of the throne you have overturned, and that tyranny is deteſtable in proportion to the corruption of thoſe who are prompted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it:</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the conſpirators have already proceeded to diſſolve the national convention by reducing and diſorganizing it, and exciting it to acts of folly, raſhneſs, and diſorder; and that the French nation can conſider thoſe acts which are promulgated by a portion of its repreſentatives who yet keep their ſeats, only as evidences of the tyranny exerciſed over ſome by the perfidy and wickedneſs of others:</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the impriſonment of a great number of deputies of the convention is an attempt made in the delirium of guilt, an act which poſterity will ſcarcely believe, if its authenticity were not proved by the record of the juſt vengeance we have ſworn to take, and which you will aid us in inflicting:</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the good citizens who ſtill inhabit Paris are invited to aſſiſt, as much as lies in their power, the united efforts which we are going to make for the public welfare, and to let the whole weight of the reſponſibility reſt on the heads of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which we declare are forfeited by their crimes:</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:031634_0247_0FED63A3F2B2AB10"/>
7. That the domineering faction at Paris has compelled the departments to lead into that city, ſo long the prey and ſport of ambitious men, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force which is the laſt reſource of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign people; declaring at the ſame time that the united force under the direction of the departments, and in conformity to their wiſhes, is deſtined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripate thoſe whoſe criminal hands have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in effecting the ruin of their country:</p>
               <p n="8">8. That every man capable of bearing arms is ſummoned, in the name of the law, in that of his own and the public intereſt, and in the name of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to join his efforts in ſtrengthening the dyke which we are oppoſing to this deſolating torrent; that he may avoid being ſwept away into that abyſs which the anarchiſts and infamous plunderers have opened before us:</p>
               <p n="9">9. That by decreeing a levy of a ſtated number of men ready to join in maſs to deſtroy utterly every faction in its ſtrong-hold, the Marſeillois, who are ſolicitous to finiſh a revolution which they began, and make the example which they have juſt given an object of imitation, call upon every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to join them who is anxious to deſerve well of mankind.</p>
               <p>They have taken this preliminary ſtep only in conſideration of the urgency of the meaſures to be adopted, ſubmitting them to the examination and the approbation of the whole ſovereign body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to ſet bounds to the zeal of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous defenders of their country, who ſhall volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily come forward to ſtrengthen the phalanx of liberty. They hope that it will increaſe in its march, and that every citizen anxious for the public weal will bear a part:</p>
               <p n="10">10. That in the colours of this army the ſoldiers of the country ſhall read inſcribed the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031634_0248_0FED63A7EBAA3CE8"/>
of every good law: "The republic united and undivided, reſpect for perſons and property;" words of conſolation already graven on every heart:</p>
               <p n="11">11. That we appeal to God, and to our arms, againſt the attempts that have been made on the unity of the national repreſentation, againſt the violence which has been exerciſed on the perſonal liberty of our ſpecial deputies, againſt the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies deſtructive of liberty, from which the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendance of Providence has delivered us, of which Marſeilles is purſuing the accomplices who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to execute the moſt horrible deeds within its walls. A popular tribunal, the guardian of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and well regulated order, is carrying on the proſecution of the conſpirators, notwithſtanding the obſtacles with which it is ſurrounded. Inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the confidence of the people, and by them ſupported, the moſt imperious law, that of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, determines the activity of its operations; and the people of Marſeilles, far from deſerving to be conſidered as diſobedient to the law, in making uſe of the ſword to puniſh the guilty, fulfil the firſt of ſocial duties, which conſiſts in the diſtribution of the moſt exemplary juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is thus that the city of Marſeilles, in addition to the motives ariſing from the general danger of the republic, joins the detail of the particular griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances which affect its tranquillity, and explains the neceſſity it is under of ſilencing its calumniators, who, in deſpair at not having ſucceeded in kindling the torch of diſcord among us, have dared to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to the convention as the light of truth.</p>
               <p>Republicans, the ſignal is given. The moments are precious, and the meaſures are deciſive. Let us march, let the law enter with us into Paris! and if you are unacquainted with the way, follow the
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:031634_0249_0FED63E0642F59F8"/>
traces of the blood of your brethren, which will lead you to the feet of its walls, from whence have iſſued forth thoſe murderous ſcourges, thoſe ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſpiracies, and that conſuming traffic of finance, the ſource of all our miſery.</p>
               <p>There you will give liberty to good citizens, dignity to the national convention, the ruffians will diſappear, and the republic will be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Taken into conſideration in the general commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the 32 ſections of Marſeilles, the 12th of June, 1793, the ſecond year of the French republic.</p>

               <p>THE accuſation againſt me is founded wholly on the ſuppoſition of my being an accomplice with men called conſpirators. My friendſhip for a few of thoſe perſons is prior to the political circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which form the charge againſt them. The corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſpondence I held with them by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate channel, at the time of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Paris, is altogether foreign to ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. I have had in truth no political correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and in this reſpect I might abſolutely deny the charge; yet, although I cannot be called upon to give an account of my private affections, I may
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:031634_0250_0FED63D51EB61750"/>
glory in them, as I do in the whole of my conduct, and I have nothing to conceal from the world.</p>
               <p>I declare then, that I have received teſtimonies of regret on account of my impriſonment, and was informed that Duperret had two letters for me; but whether written before or after my friends had left Paris, whether from one or two of them, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant, ſince theſe letters have never reached me. At another time, I was earneſtly conjured to eſcape from my priſon, and received offers of aſſiſtance in the attempt, and to convey me to whatever place I ſhould think proper. I was deterred from accepting theſe offers, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations both of duty and honour; of duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not injure thoſe to whoſe care I was committed; of honour, ſince in all caſes I ſhould prefer expoſing myſelf to the conſequences of every poſſible vexation, rather than incur the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of guilt, by a flight unworthy of my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I ſhould not have been ſo careleſs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my ſafety on the 31ſt of May, had I had an intention of effecting my eſcape at a later pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. This is the extent of my connections with my friends who fled. Undoubtedly if the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication had not been interrupted between us, or if I had not been reſtrained by my impriſonment, I ſhould have endeavoured to procure information concerning them, for I know of no law that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it. Alas! in what age, or amongſt what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were thoſe ſentiments of eſteem and fidelity which bind men to each other, ever accounted a crime? I do not pretend to decide upon the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures taken by thoſe who were proſcribed: but I never will believe that thoſe men have intended ill, whoſe intregrity, patriotiſm, and generous devotion to their country I have ſeen ſo clearly diſplayed. If they have erred, their errors are thoſe of virtue;
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031634_0251_0FED6419416E5928"/>
they are overcome without being degraded; they are unfortunate in my eyes, without being guilty. If I am criminal in offering vows for their ſafety, I declare myſelf ſo to the whole world. I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no concern for their glory, and I willingly ſhare in the honour of being oppreſſed by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I have known theſe generous men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are accuſed of having conſpired againſt their country. They were firm but humane republicans; they were perſuaded that good laws were neceſſary to make the republic beloved by thoſe who had no confidence in its ſtability: but this was indeed a more difficult taſk than to murder them. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all ages has proved that great talents are neceſſary to lead men to virtue by good laws, while violence alone has been ſufficient to reſtrain them by terror, or annihilate them by death. I have heard my friends maintain that plenty, like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, could only reſult from an equitable govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the omnipotence of bayonets might produce fear, but not bread. I have ſeen them animated by the warmeſt enthuſiaſm for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people, diſdaining to flatter them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to fall rather the victims of their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than deceive them. I own that theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and this conduct have appeared to me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different from thoſe of tyrants and ambitious men, who amuſe the people only to enſlave them. It is for theſe reaſons that I am filled with eſteem for theſe generous men. This error, if it be one, will go with me to the grave, and I ſhall glory in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe whom I could not accompany thither.</p>
               <p>My defence, I may venture to aſſert, is more neceſſary to thoſe who are deſirous of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, than it is to myſelf. Conſcious of having fulfilled my duties, I look to the future with ſecurity and confidence. My taſte for ſtudy and
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031634_0252_0FED63CD370DD770"/>
my habits of retirement have kept me at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance both from the follies of diſſipation, and from the buſtle of intrigue. Enamoured of liberty, the value of which I learnt from reflection, I viewed the revolution with tranſport, perſuaded that it was the epocha of the ſubverſion of deſpotiſm, which I deteſt; of the reformation of abuſes, under which I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the fate of the unhappy and oppreſſed hung upon my heart. I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the progreſs of the revolution with ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I have expreſſed myſelf on the ſubject with warmth; but I have never overpaſſed the limits preſcribed me by my ſex. Some talents perhaps, a little philoſophy, a greater degree of courage, and which in times of danger did not weaken that of my huſband, are probably what thoſe who knew me have imprudently aſcribed to me, and which may have contributed to make me enemies amongſt thoſe by whom I was not known. Roland ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times employed me as his ſecretary; and the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated letter to the king, for inſtance, was copied wholly by me. This would be a good paper enough to frame part of my indictment, if the Auſtrians were my proſecutors, and thought proper to extend the reſponſibility of the miniſter to his wife. But Roland had long ſince diſplayed his ſentiments, and his love of great principles. The evidence of this exiſts in the numerous books which he has publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during theſe fifteen years paſt. His knowledge and his integrity are eminently his own; and he had no need of a wife to become a wife and faithful miniſter. Neither conferences nor cabals have ever been held at his houſe. His friends, his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, whoever they were, and his acquaintances met at his table once a week, where in very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic converſation they diſcourſed openly on thoſe topics in which every one was intereſted. On the
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031634_0253_0FED638325FF2088"/>
whole, the writings of this miniſter breathe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the love of order and peace, explaining in the moſt affecting manner the beſt principles of morality and policy. They will for ever bear witneſs to his wiſdom, as the accounts he has given in bear witneſs to his integrity.</p>
               <p>I return to the crime imputed to me. I obſerve that I had no intimate acquaintance with Duperret. I had ſometimes ſeen him, while my huſband was miniſter, but he had not viſited me during the ſix months that have elapſed ſince Roland quitted the adminiſtration: and I might make the ſame remark reſpecting the other deputies who were our friends; which certainly does not tally with the accuſation of conſpiracy and ſecret underſtanding imputed to us. It is clear from my firſt letter to Duperret, that I wrote to this deputy, only becauſe I found it difficult to write to any other, with the idea that he would be inclined to render me ſervice. My cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him, therefore, was not a thing projected; it was not the ſequel of any preceding connections; and it had no political view. It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with an opportunity of receiving intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of thoſe who were abſent, and with whom I was in habits of friendſhip, altogether independent of political conſiderations. Such conſiderations form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no part of the correſpondence which I held with them in the firſt moments of their abſence. No me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to this effect is brought in evidence againſt me. Thoſe which are produced, only intimate that I ſhare in the opinions of thoſe who are called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. This induction is founded, I own it to the world, and I glory in this conformity of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I have never publiſhed theſe ſentiments in any manner that can be imputed to me as a crime. In order to eſtabliſh the being an accomplice in any project, it muſt be proved that advice has been given,

and means furniſhed. I have done neither; I am therefore not guilty in the eyes of the law; there is none which can condemn me; there exiſts no fact for the application of any.</p>
               <p>I know that in revolutions, law as well as juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is often forgotten; and the evidence of this is, that I am at this bar. I am indebted for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution only to thoſe prejudices and that violent hatred which burſt forth amidſt great convulſions, and which, in general, fix upon thoſe who are placed in conſpicuous ſituations, or who are known to poſſeſs energy of character. It would have been eaſy for me to have avoided this trial which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw; but I thought it more becoming to meet it: I thought that I owed this example to my country: I thought that if I ſhould be condemned, I ſhould leave to my tyrants the odium of ſacrificing a woman who had no other crime than perhaps ſome talents of which ſhe ſeldom availed herſelf, great zeal for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of mankind, courage to adhere to her unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate friends, and to render homage to truth at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of her life. Thoſe who have true greatneſs of ſoul throw away ſelfiſh feelings, remember that they belong only to the ſpecies, and look to futurity for their reward. I belong to the virtuous and perſecuted Roland. I was in habits of friendſhip with men whom ignorance and the jealous hatred of low, vulgar minds have proſcribed and murdered. I am to periſh alſo, becauſe it is conſiſtent with the principles of tyranny to ſacrifice thoſe whom it has cruelly oppreſſed, and annihilate every witneſs of its crimes. Under both theſe titles you ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me to die, and I await my ſentence. When innocence mounts the ſcaffold to which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by error or wickedneſs, it reaches the goal of triumph. May I be the laſt victim that ſhall be ſacrificed! I ſhall leave with joy this unhappy land,

It was not formed for thoſe profligate men, who, riſing from their beds of debauchery, or creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from a ſink of wretchedneſs, run and bathe themſelves in the blood that ſtreams from the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds. But it is the guardian of a wiſe and humane people who practiſe juſtice, deſpiſe flatterers, know their true friends, and revere truth. As long as you ſhall not form ſuch a people, O my fellow-citizens! you will talk in vain of liberty; you will live only in a ſtate of licentiouſneſs, of which each of you will fall the victim in your turn; you will aſk for bread, but you will find only mangled carcaſſes, and you will end in being ſlaves.</p>
               <p>I have concealed neither my ſentiments, nor opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. I know that a Roman lady was ſent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution under Tiberius, for having lamented her ſon.

               <p>AFTER the ſiege of Peruſia, ſay the hiſtorians, in ſpite of the capitulation, the anſwer of Auguſtus was; "You muſt all periſh." Three hundred of the principal citizens were dragged to the altar of Julius Caeſar, and there on the day of the ides of March were murdered: after which the remainder of the inhabitants were put without diſtinction to the edge of the ſword; and the city, which was one of the fineſt in Italy, was reduced to aſhes, and as much effaced as Herculaneum from the ſurface of the earth.</p>
               <p>There was formerly a law in Rome, ſays Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, which defined ſtate crimes and high treaſons, and which decreed the puniſhment of pain of death. Theſe crimes of high treaſon, under the republic, were reduced to four ſorts: namely, if an army had been abandoned in an enemy's country; if ſedition had been excited; if the members of the conſtituted bodies had miſmanaged public affairs, or miſapplied the public money; and if the majeſty of the Roman people had been degraded. The emperors wanted but a few additional articles to this law to involve both the citizens and whole cities in a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Auguſtus was the firſt to extend this law of high treaſon, in which he comprehended writings which he called <hi>counter-revolutionary.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſucceſſors, the extenſion of this law became unbounded.

Nero had ſo thoroughly extirpated all good and virtuous men, that after having got rid of Thraſea and Soranes, he boaſted that he had aboliſhed even the name of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the earth. When the ſenate had condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, the emperor wrote a letter of thanks for their having put to death enemies of the republic. The tribune Clodius erected an altar to Liberty in the place where Cicero's houſe had been raſed to the ground, and the people ſhouted, "Vive la Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berté!"</p>
               <p>One was executed on account of his name, or that of his anceſtors, and another on account of a beautiful houſe at Alba.

               <p>Foranius, the tutor, the old friend of Auguſtus, was proſcribed by his pupil without any apparent cauſe, except that he was an honeſt man, and loved his country. Neither age nor innocence could ſhield Quintus Gellius from the bloody hands of the executioner; and this ſame Auguſtus, whoſe cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency has been ſo much boaſted, tore out his eyes with his own hands. You were betrayed and poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded by your own enemies or ſlaves; or if you had no enemy, your hoſt, your friend, your ſon became your aſſaſſin.</p>
               <p>In one word, under three reigns the natural death of a celebrated man was ſo rare a thing, that it was put into the gazette as a ſort of epocha, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

by hiſtorians to the remembrance of ages, "Under this conſulate," ſays our annaliſt, "the pontiff Piſo died in his bed, which appeared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what miraculous."</p>
               <p>The death of ſo many excellent citizens appeared a leſs calamity than the inſolence and ſcandalous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of their murderers and denunciators. Every day the ſacred and inviolable informer made his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant entry into the palaces of the dead, and ſeized on ſome rich inheritance. All theſe denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators aſſumed the moſt reſpectable names, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves Cotta, Scipio, Regulus, Caſſius, Severus. Denunciation was the only means of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at honours, and Regulus was made conſul three times on account of his informations.</p>
               <p>In this manner every one threw himſelf in the way of arriving at dignities, ſince the road was ſo eaſy; and the <hi>marquis</hi> Serenus, in order to make his firſt appearance with <hi>éclat,</hi> and gain reputation as an informer, began a proſecution againſt his aged father as a <hi>counter-revolutioniſt;</hi> after which he deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated himſelf with the ſounding name of Brutus.</p>
               <p>The judges reſembled the accuſers: the tribunals, which ought to have been the protectors of life and property, were become butcheries; and robbery and murder bore the names of confiſcation and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>If there were no means of ſending a man to the tribunal, he was aſſaſſinated or impriſoned. Celer AElius, the famous Locuſta, the phyſician Anice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, were poiſoners by profeſſion, privileged men, travelling in the ſuite of the court, and a kind of lords of the bed-chamber to the crown. When theſe half-meaſures were not found ſufficient, the tyrant had recourſe to a general proſcription. Thus it was that Caracalla declared all his friends and the partiſans of Sejanus enemies of the republic, to the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031634_0262_0FED63FAA18ABF08"/>
number of thirty thouſand. Thus it was that Sylla in one day forbade the uſe of fire and water to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand Romans. If a lion-emperor had a praetorian guard of tigers and panthers, they would not have torn in pieces a greater number than the common informers, the freedmen, the poiſoners, and the cut-throats of the Caeſars; for the cruelty cauſed by hunger ceaſes with hunger, while that cauſed by fear, by the avarice and the ſuſpicions of tyrants has no bounds.

               <p>"THE ſituation of affairs, and the diſcontented ſtate of the public mind, alarmed the court. The miniſters ſoon became the object of general ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion, and their conduct did not appear at all favourable to the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution, which the king had ſworn to maintain contrary to his will and feelings, and which he was determined not to ſupport.

It was ſaid openly and loudly, that, if the king was ſincere, he would chooſe his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters amongſt men whoſe reputation for patriotiſm was not doubtful. The king had hitherto decided

as cowardice or fear dictated; ſometimes with the hopes of gaining over thoſe who were named, or with the reſolution, if this plan did not ſucceed, of driving them altogether from the court. At length the king ſeemed determined to chooſe his miniſters amongſt thoſe who were called patriots, for then the appellation was not diſhonoured. How that came to paſs I never have been informed. Intelligent men reflected how important it was to direct the choice of the court towards men of talents and of reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character; for it was poſſible that it might have taken a malignant pleaſure in making a ſelection of a ſet of wrong-headed Jacobins, whoſe blunders and exaggerations would have juſtified complaints, and brought diſgrace on the whole body of patriots.

               <p>This project was communicated to us only three days before the new miniſtry was formed. Briſſot came to me one evening when I was alone, and told me that Roland was thought of as miniſter. I ſmiled, and aſked him what he meant by his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry? He anſwered me, that he was in earneſt, informed me of what I have juſt related, and added,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031634_0266_0FED643B86E94D68"/>
that he was come to know if Roland would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the charge. I promiſed to ſpeak to Roland on the ſubject, and give him an anſwer the next day. Roland was as much aſtoniſhed as myſelf at the event. A multiplicity of affairs to one of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind was no cauſe of objection; and he told me, that as he had always obſerved placemen to be beings of a very middling rank with reſpect to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and yet public buſineſs went forward, he was not himſelf afraid of the undertaking; that the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was indeed critical, on account of the diſtinct intereſt of the court and the uncertainty of the king's intentions; but that whoever attended only to his duty, and was careleſs about the loſs of his place in executing it, had nothing to fear: beſides which, a zealous man, who was conſcientious in the means he made uſe of, could not be without hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eſſential ſervice to his country. Roland therefore determined to accept the office, and made known his intentions to Briſſot, who came the next evening at eleven o'clock at the breaking up of the council, accompanied by Dumourier, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to him officially that the king had juſt made choice of him as miniſter for home-affairs. Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, who had been miniſter for ſome little time, ſpoke of the king's ſincere diſpoſitions to ſupport the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and his hopes of ſeeing the machine go on with ſucceſs, when the whole of the council ſhould be animated by the ſame ſpirit: he teſtified alſo to Roland his particular ſatisfaction in ſeeing ſo vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and enlightened a patriot named to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government.</p>
               <p>Briſſot obſerved that the department for home-affairs was the moſt delicate and the moſt intricate of all, and that it was a conſolation to the friends of liberty to ſee it entruſted to pure and firm hands. The converſation turned ſlightly on theſe heads,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031634_0267_0FED640DE7A6A280"/>
and the hour was fixed on for Roland the next day to be preſented to his majeſty, to take the oath, and his ſeat at the council.</p>
               <p>I found in Dumourier the manly air of a ſoldier, the addreſs of an able courtier, the ſtyle of a man of wit, but no trace of truth. In comparing this man with his new colleague, whoſe auſterity and frankneſs ſometimes border on rudeneſs, I aſked myſelf if they were made to go on long together? "Here is a man," ſaid Roland, after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "who poſſeſſes talents." "Yes," replied I, "and againſt which you muſt be on your guard; for I think him capable of caſting you all off, if you do not keep to his pace: we ſhall ſee." The firſt time Roland appeared at court in his ordinary ſimple dreſs, which he had for a long time worn for the ſake of convenience, a few ſcattered hairs, combed over his venerable head, a round hat, and his ſhoes tied with ſtrings, thoſe valets of the court who placed the higheſt importance in the etiquette on which their own exiſtence depends, looked at him with diſdain, and with ſome aſtoniſhment. One of them approached Dumourier, and, knitting his brows, whiſpered him, while he pointed out with his eyes the object of his ſurpriſe, "Sir! ſir! ..... no buckles in his ſhoes!" Dumourier, putting on an air of affected gravity, exclaimed, "Ay, ſir, it is all over, we are all ruined." The ſtory went round, and thoſe laughed at it who had the leaſt diſpoſition to be diverted.</p>
               <p>Lewis XVI. behaved to his miniſtry with the greateſt good-humour. This man was not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a perſonage as he has been induſtriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by thoſe who were intereſted in degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. He was neither that ſtupid ſot which he has been held out to be for the purpoſe of excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt, nor that polite, good and affectionate
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031634_0268_0FED63DD91BDA040"/>
character for which his friends have extolled him. Nature had formed him in a common kind of mould: he would have acted well in an obſcure ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; but he was depraved by a royal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and loſt his moderation at a critical period, in which his ſafety could have been effected only by the aſſiſtance of genius or virtue. A common mind, educated at court, and taught from the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the art of diſſembling, acquires many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in its commerce with mankind. The art of diſcovering to each no more than he would wiſh him to know, is only a habit, to which conſtant exerciſe gives the appearance of addreſs; and a man muſt be born an ideot, in order to appear a fool in a ſimilar ſituation. Lewis XVI. had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a good memory, and a great ſhare of activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he never was a moment unemployed, and read a good deal. He had the moſt perfect and minute knowledge of all the treaties made by France with the neighbouring powers; he was well acquainted with its hiſtory, and was the beſt geographer in his kingdom. Knowledge of names; the juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them to the phyſiogomies of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the court to whom they belonged; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all their private anecdotes, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him to every individual, who had at all diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the revolution; and no one of any quality or deſcription could be mentioned to him, of whom he could not give ſome kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation founded on their private hiſtory. But Lewis XVI. without ſtrength of character, was confined in his views, and had twiſted as it were his feelings by ſuperſtitious prejudices and jeſuitical principles. The great ideas of religion, the belief of a God, and the aſſurance of immortality, are perfectly in harmony with philoſophy; and while theyr ear its column on thoſe moſt ſolid of all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,

Wretched are the legiſlators who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe theſe powerful means of inſpiring political vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and of forming the morals of a nation. If they were even illuſions, we ought to cheriſh them, for the conſolation of mankind: but the religion of our prieſts preſented us only with objects of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fear, and miſerable mummeries, inſtead of good works; and alſo conſecrated the whole code of deſpotiſm, on which the authority of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church is founded. Lewis XVI. was literally afraid of hell, the horns and hoofs of the devil, and excommunication, and with all this it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould be any thing but a poor creature of a king. If he had been born two hundred years earlier, and had had a reaſonable wife, he would have made no more noiſe in the world than other princes of his line, who have paſſed acroſs the ſtage without doing either much good or evil: but aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the throne amidſt the diſſoluteneſs of the court of Lewis XV. and the diſordered ſtate of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and ſurrounded by corrupted men, he was drawn on by a giddy woman, who joined to Auſtrian inſolence the forwardneſs of youth, and to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of grandeur the intoxication of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the careleſſneſs of levity; and who was herſelf ſeduced by all the vices of an Aſiatic court. Lewis XVI. too weak to hold the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was now falling headlong into ruin, and crumbling to deſolation, haſtened his own by faults without number. Neckar, who always act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pathetic in politics as well as in writing; a man of moderate abilities, but of which the world entertained a high opinion, becauſe he had formed a high opinion of them himſelf, which he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to make known; without foreſight; a ſort of a retail financier, who could only calculate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031634_0270_0FED635D06417C78"/>
of a purſe, and was talking continually of his reputation, as women of intrigue talk of their chaſtity; Neckar was but a ſorry pilot for the ſtorm that was gathering. France was, as it were, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted of men: it is a thing highly ſurpriſing that they ſhould have been ſo ſcarce in this revolution: it has brought forth ſcarcely any but pigmies. It is not becauſe there was any want of wit, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, of knowledge, of philoſophy: theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients had never been more common: it was the blaze of the torch juſt expiring. But that energy of ſoul which J. J. Rouſſeau has ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably defined as the firſt characteriſtic of the hero, ſupported by that ſolidity of judgment which knows the juſt value of every thing; with that foreſight which penetrates into futurity, the re-union of which conſtitutes character, and forms the ſuperior man; we have looked for it every where, but it has been no where to be found.</p>
               <p>Lewis XVI. continually floating between the fear of irritating his ſubjects, and his wiſh to keep them within bounds, and unable to govern them, convened the ſtates-general, inſtead of reforming the expences, and regulating his court. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf unveiled the ſpring, and ſhewed the way to innovation, he hoped to ſtop its progreſs, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a power againſt which he had furniſhed arms, and againſt which he had himſelf given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>No other means were left him, than to ſacrifice with a good grace a part of his authority, in order, by means of the other, to ſeize the whole, on a proper occaſion, which he was not however likely to do; ſince he gave himſelf up to the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſort of intrigues, the only ſort familiar to thoſe whom he choſe for his adviſers, under the protection and patronage of his wife. He
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:031634_0271_0FED6431E2FA5498"/>
had certainly preſerved under the conſtitution ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means both of power and of happineſs, if he had had the wiſdom to keep himſelf within bounds. Want of ability had diſabled him from preventing the eſtabliſhment of the new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but honeſty alone would have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have ſaved him, if he had been ſincere in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, when he had accepted the conſtitution. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily for himſelf, on one hand to ſupport what he was overthrowing with the other, was his crooked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; and this perfidious conduct firſt excited miſtruſt, and then finiſhed by kindling general indignation.</p>
               <p>When he had made choice of patriotic miniſters, he was particularly anxious to inſpire them with confidence; and he ſucceeded ſo well, that for three weeks, I ſaw Roland and Clavieres, enchanted with the king's diſpoſitions, thinking only of the happy order of things, and flattering themſelves that the revolution was finiſhed.—"Good God!" I ſaid to them, "every time I ſee you come from the council with this great confidence, I always think that you are about to commit ſome act of great folly." "I aſſure you," anſwered Clavieres, "that the king is perfectly convinced that his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is intimately connected with the obſervance of the laws which have been juſt eſtabliſhed: he reaſons about them too feelingly not to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conviction of this truth." "If," added Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, "he be not an honeſt man, he is the moſt arrant cheat in the kingdom: diſſimulation can hardly go ſo far." "And for my part," I replied, "I have no great confidence in any man's regard for the conſtitution, who has been educated in the prejudices of deſpotiſm and habits of diſſipation, and whoſe conduct latterly has exhibited a total want both of genius and virtue. Lewis XVI. muſt be a man very much above the common ſtandard, to have any
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:031634_0272_0FED641C9CD5D9E8"/>
ſincere regard for a conſtitution which narrows the limits of his power; and if he had been ſuch a man, he would not have ſuffered thoſe events to have taken place which have brought about this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." My great argument for his inſincerity was founded on his flight to Varennes.</p>
               <p>There was a council four times a week. The miniſters agreed to dine together at each other's houſes by turns every council day. I received them on Fridays. De Grave was the miniſter of war. He was a ſlight man in all reſpects; nature had made him mild and timid; his prejudices would have made him haughty, but his heart forced him to be gentle; and from his embarraſſment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe different parts of his character, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in reality nothing. I think I ſee him march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his courtier-like air, his head quite aloft from his feeble frame, ſhewing the white of his blue eyes, which he could ſcarcely keep open after dinner, without the help of two or three cups of coffee; ſpeaking but little, as if he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but which ſilence proceeded only from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of ideas: in fine, he was ſo bewildered amidſt the buſineſs of his department, that he aſked leave to retire. Lacoſte was a true clerk of office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old ſyſtem, with an inſignificant mien, a cold look, and a dramatical tone, with talents for the ordinary run of affairs: but his formal phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy concealed a violence of character which, in diſcuſſions where he met with contradiction, made him ridiculous: he had no comprehenſive views, nor the activity neceſſary for a miniſter. Duranthon, who had been brought up from Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux to be miniſter of juſtice, was honeſt, as they ſay, but very indolent: he had an air of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and always appeared to me an old woman, from his timorous character and his conſequential
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:031634_0273_0FED641AEC7C9878"/>
babble. Clavieres was appointed miniſter of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from the reputation he had gained for his knowledge in that branch, but of which I am no judge. He was laborious and active, iraſcible and obſtinate, as thoſe men generally are who live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their deſks; punctilious and difficult in his diſcuſſions, and often in contradiction with Roland: theſe two men eſteemed without ever loving each other, but never diſagreed in the great leading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their duties.</p>
               <p>Dumourier had a greater ſhare than any of theſe in what is called wit, and leſs of morality. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and brave, a good general, a thorough-paced courtier, a good writer, a ready ſpeaker, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great undertakings; he was deficient only in firmneſs of character, and wanted a cooler head to execute the plans he had conceived: good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with his friends, and ready to cheat every one of them; aſſiduous to the ladies, but no way fitted to ſucceed with thoſe who were to be won only by tenderneſs; he was altogether formed for the miniſterial intrigues of a corrupted court. His ſplendid qualities, and his love of glory, led us to think that he might be uſefully employed in the armies of the republic; and perhaps he would have acted well if the convention had acted wiſely; for he had too much good ſenſe not to behave as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, when his reputation and his intereſt were ſo intimately concerned.</p>
               <p>At this time De Grave was about to be diſmiſſed. The miniſters and the patriot deputies were at a loſs on whom to fix for his ſucceſſor, ſince the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary men who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves were almoſt all of them hoſtile to the conſtitution. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land thought of Servan, who had been long in the ſervice, and had obtained the croſs of St. Lewis; and whoſe principles were not equivocal, ſince
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:031634_0274_0FED63E2139179C8"/>
he had publiſhed them previouſly to the revolution in an excellent work called "The ſoldier a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen." We knew him perſonally from having ſeen him at Lyons, where he had the deſerved reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wiſe and induſtrious man; and where he retired after having loſt his place at court as gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the pages, his politics not being ſuitable either to thoſe of M. St. Prieſt, or the palace.</p>
               <p>Servan is an upright man in the full extent of the term, of an ardent mind, pure morals, with all the auſterity of a philoſopher, and all the goodneſs of an affectionate heart; an enlightened patriot, a brave ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: he wanted only perhaps a little more coolneſs of temper, and more energy of character; but he had a degree of merit rare to find, and we ſhould have been too happy to have had many men of this ſtamp.</p>
               <p>The ſittings of the council might be called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in compariſon with what they became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but they were at that time puerile, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great intereſts which were at ſtake. Each of the miniſters who had <hi>bons</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bons</hi> are orders for certain operations, moſt commonly for the delivery of money.</note> to ſign, or other papers belonging to his office, went to the king on the council day to arrange this particular buſineſs before the council began. They all went afterwards into the council hall; where, after the decrees had been ſigned, which the miniſter of juſtice preſented, debates took place reſpecting the operations of government, internal order, relations with foreign powers, peace or war, &amp;c. With reſpect to the proclamations of the day, they had only to examine the decree and apply it, which was always a ſhort buſineſs. The king ſuffered his miniſters to talk: in the mean time he read the
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:031634_0275_0FED639AE0F0E450"/>
gazette, the Engliſh news-papers in their own language, or wrote letters. The ſanction of the decrees, however, fixed his attention: he did not give his ſanction readily, but never refuſed. When a decree was preſented for the firſt time, he put off ſanctioning it till the following council, when he came with his mind made up.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to objects of great political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, he often eluded examining them, by turning the converſation on different ſubjects, or on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters peculiar to each of the miniſters. If the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs turned on war affairs, he talked about tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; if it was a diplomatic diſcuſſion, he began a hiſtory of the manners of the country in queſtion, or made enquiries about its ſituation and produce; if the examination of the ſtate affairs led him into details of agriculture and rural oeconomy, he queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Roland about his works, talked to Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier about his anecdotes, and ſo with the reſt. The council in ſhort was little elſe than a coffee-houſe, where every one learnt the news of the day, and amuſed himſelf with trifles: there was no regiſter kept of the deliberations, no ſecretary to minute them. After three or four hours converſation the council broke up, without having done any thing, except putting ſome ſignatures, and this took place three times a week. "But this is pitiful!" I could not help exclaiming with ſome ill humour when, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Roland's return, I aſked him what had paſſed. "You are all of you too courteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you meet with no oppoſition, becauſe you are treated with affability and politeneſs, becauſe you have the appearance of doing each of you in your reſpective departments juſt what you pleaſe. I am much afraid that you will all be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="unknown:031634_0276_0FED644008FF5458"/>
"But nevertheleſs," ſays Roland, "buſineſs goes on."—"Yes, but time is loſt; for in the torrent of affairs that is overwhelming you, I would rather ſee you employ three hours in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary meditation on thoſe great combinations of events before you, than waſte them in uſeleſs talk."</p>
               <p>The enemy were now forming their plans, and it became abſolutely neceſſary to declare war; a meaſure which brought on warm diſcuſſions, and which the king aſſented to with extreme repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: he had delayed the deciſion as long as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and appeared to yield only when he ſaw that the majority of the aſſembly were of that opinion, and that his council was unanimous.</p>
               <p>The continuance and multiplicity of religious troubles reſpecting which the miniſter for home-affairs had continually but in vain ſolicited him for ſome time paſt to take ſtrong and repreſſive mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, now compelled him to do ſo. On the other hand, the bold ſteps taken by the foreign troops being formidable and menacing, had given the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of war, Servan, an idea of a military project, which the aſſembly ſeized on with enthuſiaſm, and inſtantly decreed.</p>
               <p>It is very true that theſe two decrees, one for forming a camp of twenty thouſand me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> between Paris and the frontiers, and the other reſpecting the prieſts, were altogether deciſive. The court beheld in theſe meaſures the overthrow of its ſecret machinations, of all its plans of partial inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the means of ſanaticiſm, and the progreſs of the enemy towards Paris; both of which opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it protected.</p>
               <p>The king was too much decided in refuſing his ſanction to be very earneſt in declaring his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. He made uſe of different pretences, by
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031634_0277_0FED3264085B5010"/>
which means he avoided an explanation for fifteen days. A debate was begun ſeveral times on theſe two articles. Roland and Servan inſiſted with warmth, and with great energy declared the moſt ſtriking truths, becauſe each felt the importance and the neceſſity of the law as it reſpected his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular province. The general intereſt of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was a thing evident to all of them, and the ſix miniſters had but one opinion on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>During theſe diſputes, Dumourier, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with the king, and whoſe morals were more in uniſon with thoſe of the court, was often a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the queen; and as he was not in great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with his colleagues, the auſterity of whoſe manners was a reproach to his own, he found ſoon the means of getting rid of them, and entered into arrangements the effects of which were not long in being felt. A miſunderſtanding, or rather a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpute, had taken place between Dumourier and his colleagues, particularly Roland, reſpecting Baron Carrieve, whom Dumourier had made direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-general of the foreign department. A report was ſpread that the ſum of one hundred thouſand livres was paid to Madame de Beauvert, who lived with Dumourier as his miſtreſs, and did the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of his table, to the great ſcandal of thoſe who were connected with him. Dumourier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the repreſentations that were made to him by Roland, both with reſpect to his neglect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and his attachment to this director-general, with ill-humour: he quitted the meeting of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic deputies, and became viſibly cool towards Roland. "From this moment," continues Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Roland, "he ceaſed holding any farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the deputies, and became more reſerved towards his colleagues; and no doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to meditate how he might moſt expeditiouſly
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031634_0278_0FED6434B56A4D18"/>
rid himſelf of thoſe whoſe characters were leaſt in uniſon with his own. I foreſaw the effect of theſe conferences, and ſaid to Roland; "If you were an intriguer, capable of behaving according to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the old court and its former ſyſtem, I ſhould ſay that the moment is come when you ought to get rid of Dumourier, to hinder him from play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſome trick." But honeſt men underſtand nothing of theſe ſort of courtier-like ſkirmiſhes, and Roland was as incapable of having recourſe to them as he was unfitted to practiſe them.</p>
               <p>The delay of the ſanction was now underſtood as a poſitive veto, as the time was almoſt expired. We felt that the council not having courage and conſiſtence enough to pronounce their opinions <hi>in maſs,</hi> it was Roland's duty, and what integrity and courage directed him, to ſtep forward ſingly; and we determined together on writing the well-known letter to the king. I compoſed this letter myſelf, which was written without much meditation. He carried it to the council to read it aloud on the day when the king, who was ſtill urged reſpecting his ſanction, required the miniſters to give each of them his opinion written and ſigned, and then went rapidly on to talk of other affairs. Roland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, added a few lines in the cover of the letter, and had it put into the king's hands on the morning of the 11th of June. The next day, the 12th, about eight o'clock, Servan called on us with a gay countenance. "Give me joy," ſaid he, "I have had the honour to be turned out." "My huſband," I replied, "will ſoon ſhare the ſame fate, and I am ſomewhat picqued that you are the firſt." He told us, that having gone that morning to the king for ſome private buſineſs, he had talked with him very warmly on the neceſſity of the camp of twenty thouſand men, if he was really in earneſt

in oppoſing the deſigns of the enemy; that the king had turned his back to him in very ill humour; and that Dumourier had juſt left the war-office, where he had gone to take the ſeals in conſequence of an order which he carried with him. "Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier! he plays a ſorry part—but it does not ſurpriſe me." The three preceding days he had often been at the Thuilleries in long conferences with the queen; and it is not amiſs to remark, that Baron Carriéve had ſome intereſt through her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Roland hearing that Servan was with me, left the perſons to whom he was giving audience, learned the news, and ſent to invite his colleagues, Dumourier excepted, to come to him.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed proper not to wait to be diſmiſſed; and as Servan's diſmiſſion had taken place, thoſe who poſſeſſed the ſame principles ought to give in their own, at leaſt unleſs the king would recall Servan, and diſmiſs Dumourier, with whom they ought never again to ſit in council. I do not doubt but that if the four miniſters had behaved in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the court would not have been a little embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed to replace them; that Lacoſte and Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon would have done themſelves credit, and that the buſineſs would have been ſo much the more intereſting for the public, as it became ſo in a very different manner.</p>
               <p>The miniſters debated without coming to any concluſion, except that they would meet again the next day at eight o'clock in the morning, and that Roland ſhould prepare a letter for them. I could never have believed, if circumſtances had not put me in the way of knowing it, that judgment and firmneſs of character were ſo rare: how few men are there, conſequently, fitted for buſineſs, and how much fewer ſtill are formed to govern! Were we to wiſh for the union of theſe qualities with
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:031634_0280_0FED6385F481E500"/>
perfect diſintereſtedneſs, we wiſh for a Phoenix, almoſt impoſſible to find. I am not aſtoniſhed that men above the common ſtandard, and who are placed at the head of empires, ſhould hold moſt commonly the human race in contempt. It is the almoſt neceſſary conſequence of great knowledge of the world, and in order to avoid the errors into which thoſe may fall who are entruſted with the happineſs of nations, there muſt be a fund of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and of magnanimity not very common.</p>
               <p>The miniſters kept their appointment, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it would be better to ſpeak to the king in perſon than to write to him; a meaſure which appeared rather as an expedient to avoid loſing their places than to come to an explanation. While they were yet deliberating, the king ſent a meſſage to Duranthon, the miniſter of juſtice, to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and alone. The miniſters Roland and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres went to wait for him at his hotel. Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon returned with a lengthened face and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical air, and drew out ſlowly from his pocket a paper containing the diſmiſſion of his two col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues. "You have made us wait a long time for our liberty," ſaid Roland to him, ſmiling, and taking the paper: he returned and acquainted me with the news, which I had well foreſeen. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated him on it, and adviſed him not to wait till the king announced it to the aſſembly, but to do it himſelf; and, ſince his majeſty had taken no advantage of the inſtructions contained in the letter, to make them uſeful to the public by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them himſelf. I ſaw nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the courage of having written to him, than firmneſs in ſending a copy of it to the aſſembly: in hearing of your diſmiſſion, the aſſembly will become acquainted with the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:031634_0281_0FED644543EFDFA0"/>
This idea proved agreeable to my huſband, and every one knows the honours which the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conferred on the three miniſters Servan, Roland, and Clavieres; by declaring that their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was accompanied by the regrets of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as well as the applauſe beſtowed on the letter, which was ordered to be printed and ſent into the departments."</p>
               <p>This citation from madame Roland's memoirs will not perhaps be thought too long, ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the detail of thoſe circumſtances which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated Lewis XVI. from the throne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed monarchy in France. It is probable that at ſome future period this fabric would have fallen amidſt the ſtorms of popular diſcuſſions: but its diſſolution, had the conduct of the court been different, would have been at leaſt more gentle. I have already mentioned that madame Roland ſent me from her priſon certain papers, with a view no doubt, that I ſhould in ſome happier days vindicate her memory to the world; and I have till this period, when I find that many of her papers have been preſerved, felt the keeneſt regret, that I was compelled by the late ſanguinary ſyſtem to deſtroy thoſe in our poſſeſſion without taking a copy, ſince to have had them diſcovered was certain death.</p>
               <p>Of the account of the conduct of the court written by madame Roland, general Servan, the only principal actor who ſtill remains, has given me many illuſtrations. Servan, as miniſter of war, had to contend not only with the enemies on the frontiers, but with thoſe much more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the ſtate, in the Thuilleries. His office compelled him to hold longer communications with the king than the other miniſters—if that could be called ſo which was only a continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation.
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031634_0282_0FED63B4F54DFF00"/>
—His duty prompted him to explain to him that his conduct was precipitating himſelf as well as the kingdom to ruin, and that the whole tenor of it diſcovered him to be hoſtile to the conſtitution, as well as to the intereſt of the ſtate. "The king ſeemed at times ſo thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced," ſays Servan, "That I deceived myſelf into a belief that the next meeting he would aſſent to the propoſitions offered him: but in the interval he had been aſſailed and hardened into reſiſtance in favour of Auſtria, by the queen—in favour of the prieſts, by madame Eliſabeth; ſo that it required going the ſame round of argument to bring him again to conviction. The king ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Servan, as knowing, from having been long at court, the rectitude of his intentions; to which Servan never would aſſent: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he told him that his weakneſs, which was criminal, would never be any ſhield againſt the indignation of the people, who would not enter into diſtinctions. Sometimes Servan finding no good was to be done that day, ſat down to write till the hour when the council broke up, which diſtreſſed the king exceedingly; who frequently interrupted him, by aſking if he was taking notes of their converſation. No ſecretary was allowed, though decreed by the conſtitution, and repeatedly inſiſted on by Roland and Servan; the former of whom brought his great morocco covered book, under his arm, to the great diverſion of Servan, in order to enter the records: but the king perſiſted in his refuſal, and the pages remained from the firſt to the laſt unſullied.</p>
