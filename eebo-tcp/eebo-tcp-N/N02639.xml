            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>Wo, unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; for ye pay tithe of Mint, and Annise, and Cummin, and have omitted the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi>

            <p>THESE Words were spoken, by our Blessed Lord, to the Scribes, and Pharisees, in His Day; whom He severely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, for several very great Errors, and Mistakes in their Conduct, with respect to the MoralLife. The Scribes and Pharisees were very remarkable, among the Jews, for their strict Observation of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and Rituals of Religion; and not content with the many Ceremonies of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003130_0004_0FF006D4AAF86D60"/>
had advanced various Customs, and Traditions, of their own Invention, into an Equality with those of Divine Appointment, and made them necessary Appendages of their Religion. The Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi> therefore, in his XI. <hi>Chap.</hi> at <hi>ver.</hi> 38. takes notice of the Occasion of our Lord's dispencing this Rebuke in my Text to them, namely, their finding Fault with Him, for not observing their Custom of Washing, before He sat down to Meat, when He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to dine with one of the Pharisees; which our Lord layes hold on as a good Opportunity, to shew them, the vanity of their pretentions to greater Piety and Holiness than other Men, because of their being so very punctillious with regard to the Externals, and Rituals of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; when at the same time, they were so very negligent of the more essential parts of true Religion.</p>
            <p>The Jews had the Pharisees in such Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, for their Sanctity, because they were so critical in their Observation of the outwardForm of Religion, that they verily tho't, if there were but Two Men in the World that should get to Heaven, a Pharisee would be one of them. But our Lord, who better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood Religion, and the Pharisee, lets them know, that notwithstanding all their exactness, in attending upon the outward Form &amp; Rituals of Religion, they were so far from bidding fair for the Kingdom of Heaven, that the Wo of Hypocrites belonged to them, while they lived in the neglect of those more essential Parts and

Duties of true Religion, Judgment, Mercy and Faith: <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes, and Pharisees, Hypocrites,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>for ye pay Tithe of Mint, and Annise, and Cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Our Saviour does not reprove them for this their exactness in the outward duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he sayes, <hi>ought not to be left undone;</hi> but that under this outward shew, and mighty pretence of Zeal for the lesser parts and duties of Religion, they really <hi>neglected</hi> the greater,<hi>the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment,

                  <q>The Jews had no strict regard to the Morality of their Actions, and contenting themselves with some kind of outward conformity to the bare Letter of the Ten Commandments, were almost wholly taken up with little Ceremonies and Observances, in which they placed the main of their Religion, almost wholly neglecting the greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the further handling of these words, I crave your patience while I discourse, as briefly as I can, upon these Four or Five Things, which are plainly included in them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the Externals and Rituals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be observed by us. <hi>These ought not to be lest undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The Duties of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, are specially to be observed, as the weightier matters of the Law. <hi>These ye ought to have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. No exactness in the Observation of the Externals and Rituals of Religion will be an Excuse for our Neglect of the weightier matters of the Law.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Tho' a Man should be ever so exact in the Externals of Religion, yet if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects Judgment, Mercy and Faith, he is but an Hypocrite after all.</p>
            <p n="5">V. While Judgment, Mercy and Faith are neglected, the greatest Criticalness in the Rituals of Religion will not secure a Man from the Wo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003130_0007_0FF006DBFA1815E8"/>All of these I think, are very fairly included in the words of my Text, and I shall offer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to each of them, in their Order.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Externals and Rituals of Religion ought to be observed by us. This is what the Scribes and Pharisees were very exact in. They were noted for their scrupulous niceness in every little Modality of Religion, &amp; were such strict observers of the Letter of the Law of Moses, that they were very punctillious even in the most Minute part of their Tithe. So that their paying Tithe of Mint, Annise, and Cummin, seems to include in it, a Critical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness about the Externals &amp; Rituals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and these, said our Blessed Saviour, <hi>ye ought not to leave undone.</hi> Which shews they are to be observed by us.</p>
            <p>By the Externals of Religion, I mean all those various ways by which we outwardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our Belief of, and Reverence to the Deity, whether in Word, or Gesture; as all our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Religious Worship, whether more privately, in the Family, or more publickly, in the House of God; together with the Gravity and Seriousness of our Countenances, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of our Bodies, while we are bowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our God. And by the Rituals of Religion, I mean those Rites and Ceremonies of our Holy Religion, which are of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; whereby we take upon us the Badge and Token of our peculiar Relation to God, as his People, and express our Hope of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003130_0008_0FF006DE96953830"/>
the promised Mercy of God, and bring ourselves under explicit Obligations to be his Servants, obedient to all his Commands.</p>
            <p>These Externals and Rituals of Religion, I say, ought not to be neglected by us; but are carefully to be observed, even to the minute Circumstance of paying Tithe of Mint, Annice and Cummin. For indeed the Light of Nature leads hereto, and the Command of God enjoyns it upon us.</p>
            <p>The light of Nature leads to it; for upon Supposition of the Being of a God, infinitely Great and Powerful, Wife, Holy, Just &amp; Good, it is one of the next and plain Consequences that then, this God ought to be reverenced, and Worshipped; that therefore we should be careful not to affront him, and cast Contempt and Indignity upon him, by Blasphemy, or any profane mentioning of his Holy Name; that we ought to pay our publick Honour to him, and so acknowledge him the Author of all our publick, as well as private and personal Mercies. Thus far the Light of Nature goes; tho' it does not dictate to us, how we are to Worship God, nor what are the Rites and Ceremonies, which are most acceptable and pleasing to him.</p>
            <p>But then, these Externals and Rituals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are enjoyned us by the positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.

            <p>As to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, these are but few, and more posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively enjoyned. For when the Change was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003130_0010_0FF006E38A96C8F0"/>
made from the Jewish, to the Christian Religion, the alteration chiefly consisted in the external Rites &amp; Ceremonies; and therefore when the old were abolished, there needed a positive Law for the Instituting of New ones. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly our Saviour, the great Head of the Christian Church, has positively instituted these; as the Baptism of the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. <hi>Go ye Disciple all nations, baptising,</hi> &amp;c. which evidently means a water Baptism, as appear from the practice of the Apostles, and those Words of St. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> x. 47. <hi>Who can forbid water, that these should not be baptised.</hi> So also, has He possitively instituted the Holy Supper, (<hi>Matth.</hi> xxvi. 26.) and commanded us to observe it in Remembrance of Him, (<hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 19.) and that, a literal feeding upon Bread and Wine, not transubstantiated into the Body and Blood of Christ, but as Commemorative of His Body broken, and His Blood shed for us, but yet remaining truely Bread and Wine after the Consecration, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 26.)</p>
            <p>There is also another Rite of the Christian Church, namely, the Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; concerning which, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular directions, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles; and our Saviour hath given us a more general and comprehensive Rule, in <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 15. These Rites and Ceremonies of the Christian Religion ought carefully to be observed by us, and no pretence to greater spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality in Worship, without these external and carnal Ordinances, as some are pleased to call them, should exempt us there-from.

            <p>I know some have been ready to suppose that by Faith, here, is to be understood, Faith in Jesus Christ; but I cannot but think, that our blessed Lord here speaks of the common Offices of Men one among another, respecting their Deeds, by Judgment; their Passions, by Mercy; and their Words, by Faith. And in this last Instance, the Scribes and Pharisees were deeply guilty, in that they made noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p n="1">1. The Duties of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith are <hi>most indispensably</hi> required of us.

and kind Temper and Disposition, this is the great Law, which, together with the Love of God, was at first written on the Table of our Hearts. And when the Characters hereof were greatly obliterated and obscured, by the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Apostacy of Mankind, and the contracted Habits of Sin and Vice, the Main Designs of the Divine Revelation was, as to reveal a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to us, so, to recover to us the Knowledge of this Law, and reduce us to the practice of these Vertues and Graces. As for the Externals and Rituals of Religion, these turn purely upon a positive Command, and result from the mere will and pleasure of our high Sovereign; but the Duties of Judgment, Mercy and Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from all the infinitely glorious perfections of the Deity, and remain unalterably the same, and are obligatory upon the Creature, capable of obeying them, antecedent to any positive Law and Command: So that they are weightier with respect to their original &amp; stability. And when it pleased God to reveal his Mind unto the World, what has He more positively, and peremptorily insisted upon, than that our Faith in Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness, we should add these great Duties, and that both under the old Testament and the New.

only to this purpose. Tho' it be true that the incarnate Son of God fulfilled all Righteousness, by a devout attendance upon all the externals and rituals of Religion, then belonging to the Jewish Church; and hath given us His Orders and Directions concerning such Rites as He has made the distinguishing Mark and Character of the visible Christian Church; yet this was not the great design of His coming into the World, and dying for us.

And what is the bringing us home to God, but the bringing of us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a hearty, willing, universal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Subjection to the Law of God; and so, from a principle of Love to God, and in the Obedience of Faith to the Son of God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these great Duties of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith. Therefore as a <hi>Prophet</hi> sent from God, He has taught us the way of Truth clearly and fully, and in His Doctrine, chiefly insisted upon these, as the Weightier Matters of the Law: So thro'out his whole excellent Sermon on the Mount, wherein he explains, and refines, and exalts the Law of Nature, and gives us the

            <p n="3">3. These Vertues render us most <hi>Beneficent and serviceable</hi> to the World, while we are in it; and therefore are the weightier Matters of the Law.

so, to our Social Nature; and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of Tryal and Probation in this World, is chiefly concerned about the Exercise of those Vertues and Graces, which more specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Social Life. The Tryal of our Obedience to our Sovereign Lord, does notly, so much in a Compliance with the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals &amp; Rituals of Religion, as in the Government of our Appetites &amp; Passions, and the Practice of Vertues, of Righteousness, Meekness, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Patience, Temperance, Brotherly-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Charity: And in this Way it is, that we answer to the original Intention of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in a common Beneficence, and Usefulness to all about us. For God made all things for His own Glory, in the subserviency and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Creatures; one unto another, whereby the glory of His Wisdom, and Goodness, as well as Power, are marvelously displayed. And it is the Law of the Gospel, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 24. <hi>Let no man seek his own, but every man anothers Wealth.</hi> We are <hi>not born for our selves,</hi> but for Society, for the Benefit, and Advantage of Mankind: and it is our great Duty, while we are in the World, so to lay out our selves in the Improvement of all our Talents, our Capacities, and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that Mankind may, some way or other, fare the better for us.</p>
            <p>But what Benefit and Advantage is it to others, that we are very critical &amp; exact in the observation of the Externals, and Rituals of Religion: all this may be, and yet we may, at the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We shall then, not only, do no Hurt to any Man, by our Words, or Deeds, but, we shall really do them all the Good that lies in our Power, in the Exercise of these Vertues; and this will be indeed to Love our Neighbours, as our selves. And if the World would but once learn to live up to the Laws of the Gospel, in these respects, Heaven would come down upon Earth, (and possibly, something more of this than ever the World has yet seen, may be intended, by the Thousand Years Reign of Christ on Earth, and the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;) where there is nothing but the greatest Serviceableness, accompanied with the highest Delight in each other, among the glorifyed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that blissful Region. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, are the wightier matters of the Law.</p>

            <p>This renders us <hi>more like to God.</hi> For there is nothing in the Externals &amp; Rituals of Religion that makes us any ways like to the ever blessed and Holy God.

            <p>And can any thing then make us <hi>more fit to enjoy</hi> God? than by doing those things which make us most like unto Him, and by which we most glorify Him. The most constant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the externals of Religion does no ways of it self fit us for the enjoyment of the blessed God, but may still leave us associated with those fallen Spirits, who know how to transform themselves into Angels of Light; because this neither alters our depraved Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, nor glorifies God in those direct Acts of

a rational Spirit, which we are capable of, and intended for. But when we have once so got the mastery over ourselves, and our vicious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as, in the Faith of the Gospel, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Promises of it, to exercise our selves to have always a Conscience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence both towards God, and towards Man, in the constant Practice of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, and all those Vertues and Graces inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them, as inseparable Companions of our religious Worship and Adoration, then, are we most like unto the infinitely pure &amp; holy God, (as I have shewed already); then do we in the most direct-way and manner, we are capable of, glorify Him, and therefore are thereby best fitted for the Enjoyment of Him. For no Man shall enjoy God, and the happy state above, but those that are like Him; those that are <hi>Pure, as He is Pure,</hi> those that are <hi>Holy, as He is Holy;</hi> those that have their Hearts purifyed from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness &amp; Worldly-mindedness, from Pride and Insolence, from Falshood and Guile, from Malice and Envy, and the like, and live in the Exercise of that Love to their Neighbour, which is productive of all social Vertue, and fits them for Communion together in a better World.

I am full of the Burnt Offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Beasts; and I delight not in the Blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He-Goats: when ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your Hand, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations; Incence is an Abomination unto me; the New Moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of Assemblies, I cannot away with; it is Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, even the solemn Meeting your New Moons, and your appointed Feasts, my Soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them:—Wash ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your Doings, from before mine Eyes: cease to do Evil, learn to do Well; seek Judgment, relieve the Oppressed, Judge the Fatherless, plead for the Widow.</hi> And thus the Prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah Chap. vi. 19. 20. <hi>Hear, O Earth—they have not bearkened unto my Words, nor to my Law, but rejected it: to what purpose cometh there to me Incense from Sheba? and the sweet Cane from a far Country? Your Burnt-Offerings are not acceptable, not your Sacrifices sweet unto me.</hi> And he goes in the same strain, Chap. vii. 4.—7. <hi>Trust ye not in lying Words, saying, the Temple of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003130_0032_0FF0071C980F7838"/>
the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these; for if ye throughly amend your ways, and your Doings, if you throughly excute Judgment between a Man and his Neighbour; if ye oppress not the Stranger, the Fatherless, and the Widdow, and shed not innocent Blood.—Then will I cause you to dwell in this Place, &amp;c.</hi> So mean are all the Externals and Rituals of Religion, in the esteem of God, tho' He had appointed them, in Comparison with the greater Duties of Judgment, Mercy, &amp; Faith, that He declares, He had no Delight in them, yea, the least of them were an Abomination to Him, and none of all their religious Services would render them acceptable to Him without These. And since there are no Externals of Religion of equal Value in the Sight of God, with Justice, Charity, and Truth to our Neighbours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of them are equally to be regarded by us in our Practice; but tho' we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Rituals of Religion, yet ought we to be much more careful to do these weightier Matters of the Law.</p>
            <p>Tho' God has required us to Worship Him in the ways of His Appointment, yet these Externals of Religion are to give Place when they interfere with the greater Duties, of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith. Hence is that, 1. Sam. XV. 22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great Delight in Burnt-Offerings, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams.</hi> Sacrifice,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003130_0033_0FF00720859B8430"/>
tho' of Divine Institution, is scarce Obedience, if compared with moral Duties. Hence also is that of our Saviour, Matt. xii. 7. <hi>If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi>

from a Principle of Love to God, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not from Shew and Ostentation, are the main &amp; essential Duties of Religion, even of the Christian, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <q>I know, said the great and good Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> that it hath been the great Design of the Devil and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all Ages, to undermine Religion, by making an unhappy Seperation and Divorce between Godliness and Morality, between Faith and the Vertues of a good Life; and by this means not only to weaken and abate, but even wholly to destroy the Force and Efficacy of the Christian Religion, and to leave Men as much under the Power of the Devil and their Lusts, as if there were no such thing as Christianity in the World. But let us not deceive our selves; This was always Religion, and the condition of our Acceptance with God, to endeavour to be like God, in Purity and Holiness, in Justice and Righteousness, in Mercy and Goodness, <hi>to cease to do Evil, and learn to do Well</hi> And this you will find to be the constant Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures from the Beginning of the Bible to the End.</q>

            <p>It is a vain thing, for a Man to think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is externally devout towards God, he is exact and constant in attending upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship of God, and behaves himself with a great deal of apparent Devotion while he is there, or is very nice &amp; critical in asserting and defending, and practicing the little Modalities of Instituted Worship, that this will be any plea or Excuse for his allowing himself in the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Lusts and Passions, for his Injustice in his Dealing, his Falsness to his Word and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003130_0035_0FF007256E022320"/>
Promise, and his want of Charity, in his Heart and Actions, to his Neighbour. To what Purpose is it, that thou art punctual in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Form and Fashion of the House of God, and yet obeyest not the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, the Fundamental Laws that are taught in His House; but hatest thy Brother in thy Heart, or heapest up Slander and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon him? <hi>He that hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Murderer,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 15. For tho' the Observation of a greater Duty may be a just Excuse for the Neglect of a Lesser, at this or that particular Time, when they could not be both attended together; yet the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Lesser Duty will by no means be an Excuse for the Neglect of a Greater: And therefore since Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, are the weightier Matters of the Law, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Exactness and Punctuality, in the external Mode and Form of Worship, will not in the least palliate and excuse our neglect of them. I do not mean here, that, under a Pretence of being Just, and True, and Charitable to our Neighbour, Men may hope to be excused for their Total Neglect, of the Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship, which God has required. For the Divine Command with respect hereto is always Obligatory, tho' not at all Times; and there is no Reason why one Command should wholly thrust out another. But yet of so much greater Weight and Consequence are the Duties of Justice, Charity and Truth, that they are to be preferred to Sacrifice, in our Estimation of them; and we are to be especially carefull in the constant Practice of these, tho'
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003130_0036_0FF00729AF975598"/>
we may sometimes be obliged thereby to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend any particular Duty of Sacrifice; while under no Pretence whatsoever, to attend upon our Sacrifices and the Rituals of Religion, may we be guilty of Injustice, Uncharitableness, or Falshood.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> Tho' a Man should be ever so exact in the Externals and Rituals of Religion, yet if he neglect the weightier Matters of the Law, judgment, Mercy, and Faith, he is but an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>after all. Thus our Saviour here calls the Scribes, and Pharisees, <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> for their neglect of the weightier Matters of the Law, notwithstanding they were Men of such apparent Sanctity, and Critical Exactness in all the parts of the Formalities of Religion, that they were very carefull to pay their Tithe even to the most minute point, the little insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Herbs of Mint, Annise, and Cummin. And so let a Man be ever so constant in his Devotion, either private or Publick, let him come up to all the Ordinances of the Gospel, and make ever so great a Noise and Stir about the Modalities of Worship and Discipline in the church of God; yet, if after all, he is one that makes no Conscience of his Dealings, if he is full of Tricks, and Fraud, and Oppression; if he be false to his Word, &amp; unfaithfull in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, to his promise &amp; Engagments: if he be full of Envy, &amp; Malice, and Hatred, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and calumniating his Neighbour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Bowels of Compassion from his poor Brother, when he is in want, and it is in the

power of his Hands to relieve him; let his pretentions to Religion be ever so great &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he is for all that but a very Hypocrite. Thus God articled against His People of old as Hypocrites, Isa. Iviii. 2, 7.<hi>Ye seek me daily, and delight to know my Ways, as a Nation that did Righteousness, and forsook net the Ordinances of their God: They ask of me the Ordinances of Justice; they take delight in approaching to God:</hi> Thus they seemed to be mighty devout and Religious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and yet their solemn <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> were for strife and Debate, and to smite with the Fist of Wickedness;</hi> they made then very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a Clock for their unjust and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Carriage towards their Neighbour: <hi>Tho' they hung down their Heads like Bulrushes,</hi> and were very demure in their external Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet <hi>did they not loose the Bands of wickedness, undo the heavy Burdens, nor let the oppressed go free; they dealt not their Bread to the Hungry, but cast the poor out of their Houses, and covered not the naked, yea, they hid themselves from their own Flesh.</hi> So that all the shew of Religion in them, who so trespass upon the Fundamental Rights of Equity, Charity, and Truth, is but vile Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</p>
            <p>And the Reason is very obvious; such will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect Matters of the greatest-Weight and Moment, and satisfy themselves with the Lesser: Or they Observe but a part of their Duty, and that which is less hard and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and would have others think of them,

If making a few four countenances, and saying his Prayers, and crying the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, and insisting very rigidly upon outward Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, will carry him to Heaven; this is so easy a Way, that he is content eno' so to get thither: But if he cannot arrive at those Mansions without doing Violence to himself, in the crucifying the Flesh with it's Affections and Lusts, if he must pluck out his right Eye, and cut off his right Hand, he desires to be excused from going to Heaven in such a rough and rugged Way, and is ready to perswade himself that the Rewards of that World are not equal to the Pains he must take to obtain them.</p>
            <p>What is an Hypocrite? But, one that takes upon him a Character that does not belong to him: And so does he, who would be esteemed a Religious and Good Man for his critical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a few External Rites, when he is defective in the Main Duties of Christianity.

Religion goes into the Heart and Conscience of the Man, and means the government of him in the secret Springs of his Actions; it means to regulate his Desires and Cravings, his Volition and Choice, and the very Pathos of his Mind, and to correct all the Disorders the Man is prone to run into thro' the Depravity of his Nature. And therefore he that culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his inordinate Desires, in a series of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, Oppression, Fraud, Falshood, Unmercifulness, Back-biting, Slander, and the like; And improves the vicious Bias of his Will, by prefering that which is Evil to that which is Good, as he certainly does who neglects these weightier Matters of the Law; he is verily nothing of a truly religious Man, under all the fair shew and Pretence of one. He is but like the whited Sepulchre, which indeed appears beautiful on the out-side, but within is full of all Uncleanness and Iniquity. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Matt xxiii. 27.</note> Hence the Apostle tells us of Charity, which comprehends all the Vertues spoken of in my Text as the weightier Matters of the Law, for he sayes of it, <hi>it suffereth long and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, behaveth not it self unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no Evil, beareth all things, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;</hi> he sayes of this Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. xiii.

               <hi>and Hope,</hi> and all pretences to other Vertues signify and <hi>profit nothing</hi> without it. So that if a Man should speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, tho' he should attain unto all Gifts Natural and Acquired, and have the strongest Faith or Belief, it would be all to no purpose with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Charity; yea, if in a sudden fit of Devotion he should give all his Goods to the Poor, and be so tenacious of the Rites of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as to offer his Body to the Flames rather than Part with them, yet without Charity, which puts him upon the Exercise of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy, and Faith, it would be all in vain and to no purpose: his Eloquence would be but empty Babling, his Faith a vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and wild Enthusiasm, and all his external Devotion and exact observance of Rites and Ceremonies, but meer Grimace and Pageantry, while he neglected these weightier Matters of the Law.</p>
            <p>The Last thing I proposed to speak to was, to shew,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> That while Judgment, Mercy, and Faith are neglected, the greatest Exactness in the Rituals of Religion will not secure a Man from the <hi>Wo</hi> which God has denounced. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes, &amp; Pharisees,</hi> said our Saviour, <hi>for tho' you tit he Mint, &amp; Annise, &amp; Cummin, ye neglect the Weightier Matters of the Law,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003130_0041_0FF007361D6FFED8"/>
Judgment, Mercy, and Faith.</hi> God has requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Obedience of us unto the whole of our Duty, especially unto the great and essential Articles of it, and that upon Pain of His high Displeasure. And therefore if we wilfully omit the more essential Parts of our Duty, tho' we may be careful to practise the Lesser, we cannot rationally expect any Interest in the Divine Favour, nor solidly hope to escape the dreadful Threatning, which God has denounced against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness, of Men. Every Breach of the Law of God, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and allowed and unrepented of, brings down the Wrath of God upon the guilty Head, of him that so rises up in Opposition to his Maker. We are therefore told, <hi>the wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. and <hi>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men,</hi> Rom. i. 18.</p>
            <p>Sins of omission will expose Persons to the Divine wrath as well as Sins of Commission. Hence in the Representation of the Judgment of the Great Day, Jesus Christ is introduced as saying to those who omitted these weightier Matters of the Law, <hi>Ye did it not, ye did it not,</hi> therefore <hi>depart ye cursed;</hi> and these <hi>wicked shall go away into Everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Matt. xxv. 41, 45, 46. Especially when we consider that our Sinful Omissions are attended with Sinful Commissions as the neglect of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith are. They commit Unrighteousness &amp; Injustice, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity &amp; Cruelty, Falshood &amp; Deceit, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003130_0042_0FF00739201F6768"/>
at least, in the very Instance wherein they omit Judgment, Mercy, and Faith. And we are sure, that such cannot escape the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments of God, without a very deep and unfeigned Repentance. For <hi>to them that are Contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteousness, God will render Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguish, upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.</hi> Rom. ii. 8, 9. And <hi>Jesus Christ shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and the Glory of His power,</hi> 2 Thes. i. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Nor will any Pretentions to Religion, the strictest Observation of the Rites of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, and the most constant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Externals of Divine Worship, secure them herefrom, while they are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the great Duties of Justice, Charity, and Truth; because no Performance of our Duty, in one Instance, will buy off the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to us, for our neglect in another, and a Greater. But indeed the Nice Attendance upon the Externals of Religion will but the rather encrease the <hi>Wo</hi>upon us; because it is evident from hence, that we have at least had the advantage to know our Duty, and have some Sense of our Obligations to the Deity to perform it, and therefore the neglect of it in 
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003130_0043_0FF0073D0D943DF8"/>
any Part, especially in such great Instances, will render our Punishment the greater, the Lashes of our own Consciences the more severe and pungent, and consequently will be so far from securing us from the <hi>Wo,</hi>that it will make it fit the heavier upon us. For <hi>to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin;</hi> Jam. iv. 17. <hi>and that Servant that knew his Lords will, and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many Stripes,</hi> Luk. xii. 47.</p>

            <p>Let us all then be perswaded seriously to set ourselves to the Practice, as of the Externals and Rituals of Religion so also, of those weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith. Let it be our Care to Worship our God in an Attendance upon all those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rites and Services which He has enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us; and let us make Conscience of what we do in our Religious Worship, and be more than External therein, acting in obedience to the Commands of God, and having our Hearts serious and engaged in what we do, and so Worship the Lord in Spirit and in Truth, as He requires of us. But then let us take heed
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003130_0044_0FF007403593F528"/>
to ourselves, that we do not neglect the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law, and satisfie our selves with the Externals of Religion only; for all our Religious worship will be but shew and outward Form if we are negligent in These.</p>
            <p>The Generality of Mankind are exceeding apt to take up with an Out-side and Shew of things, and think it eno' if they do but observe that which is less hard and difficult to them; and therefore finding it burdensome to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their vicious Inclinations, to muster and eradicate their Lusts and Passions, to correct and reform the Disorders of their Hearts and Lives, they seem inclinable to compound the matter and substitute in the Room thereof, a very great Exactness and Scrupulosity in the Externals and Rituals of Religion, which they can more easily and with less Labour and Pains come up to. But know, O Man, that these great Duties, these weightier matters of the Law, Righteousness and Peace, Meekness and Humility, Fidelity and Goodness, are such essential parts of Religion, even of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that thou canst be no true Christian, nor wilt thou ever please God and get to Heaven without them.</p>
            <p>It is true these Vertues are sometimes called Morality. But then they are such Morality <hi>that if a Man do them be shall live in them;</hi> Gal. iii. 12. and <hi>without which no Man shall see the Lord.</hi>

but only upon the account of the Merit of Jesus Christ who has loved us and died for us; (for when we have done our best we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants) yet by whatsoever name they are called, they are essential to Christianity, and our partaking of Eternal Life. They are Morality as they are required by the Law of Nature; but they are Graces as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of the Gospel. They are Morality as sometimes one, or another, of them may be performed by the Strength of Nature; but they are Graces as they are unitedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Strength and Opperation of the Divine Spirit in us. They scarce deserve the Name of Moral Vertues when performed from fleshly carnal selfish Views; but are real Graces when performed in Obedience to the Commands of God, and in Conformity to the Example of Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us not then think to have ourselves excused from the Practice of them, upon any Terms; but let us sincerely apply ourselves hereunto, and in good earnest, that we may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, in all things, and walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith we are called.</p>
            <p>Travellers have told us of a Country, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Leagues to the Westward of <hi>Iberia, that the People are a very Religious People, but it is a thousand pities they are not Honest.</hi> O, let not the Sarcasm ever be deservedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ourselves! But let us resolve to be a Religious People, truly so, in a devout and hearty attendance upon all the outward Duties of Religion, and in our Care to put in Practice

Strong-Drink.—If it be inquired, where is Faith? where is Judgment? where is Mercy? even among Christians, with whom these things ought to be found; alass, you will see Tyranny and Iniquity in the place of Judgment, Oppression and Inhumanity take place of Mercy, and Superstition towards God, and Persidiousness towards Man has banished Faith from among them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We make a high Profession of Religion, there is much of the Externals of it to be found among us, and we pretend a Zeal for the Faith and Order of the Gospel: O let not the want of Judgment, Mercy, and Faith among us slur our Profession and stain our Glory, and rank us with Scribes and Pharisees, lest a dreadful Wo from a provoked God fall heavy upon us: but wherein any of us have erred from the Paths of Vertue, let us deeply humble &amp; abase ourselves before God, and repair the Injury we have done unto Man, and throughly amend our Ways and our Doings, and thus return to the Lord our God; return to Him with a fixed Resolution to walk in all His Ordinances and Commandments blameless; the Ordinances of His Worship, and the Commandments which shew unto us what the Lord our God requires of us, even to do Justly and to love Mercy. This will be the way for us to engage the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Presence of God with us, for our Protection and Defence, for our Prosperity &amp; Flourishing;
