            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the great Abuſes of the Sabbath they had been guilty of, in Buying and Selling on that Holy Day.

HE was,</hi> This <hi>Pronoun</hi> hath doubtleſs a <hi>Logical Reference</hi> to both the Perſons here mention'd; but as it is ſingular, ſo can have a <hi>Grammatical Reference</hi> only to one of them, and this 'tis moſt likely was <hi>Hanani</hi> his Brother; becauſe <hi>Hananiah</hi> the other, was before, one of his ſuperior Officers, a ſort of <hi>Steward of the Houſhold.</hi> Whereby he had doubtleſs had large Experience of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Integrity, and therefore could depend upon him in that Truſt, he now commits to him; beſides as he was a public Officer he muſt have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf to others, and ſo had an eſtabliſhed Character in the City, and therefore there was no need to give a Reaſon, why he gives to ſuch a Man as he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this important Charge: But ſince <hi>Hanani</hi> the other, was his Brother, Kinſman or Relative, it was neceſſary he ſhould give a good Reaſon why he committed ſo great a Truſt to him; leſt he ſhould incurr a Suſpicion of Partiality to him, on account of his Relation, and therefore he ſays, <hi>He was a faithful Man, and feared God above many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence I make this incidental Note, <hi>That when thoſe who are in ſuperiour Place of Power commit any Poſt of conſiderable Truſt, to ſuch as are related to them, it is expedient</hi> (with reſpect to the Reputation of their own Juſtice and Impartiality) <hi>that ſuch ſhould have thoſe Qualities that remarkably fit them for that Station.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Character then, as I ſaid before, muſt have a <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Rational</hi> Reference to both theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mention'd, and they were both of them <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men that feared God above many.</hi>

            <p>And as they were Men of Integrity, ſo they were Men of true Religion, <hi>for they feared God above many.</hi> Religion the whole of it, is frequently expreſs'd in the Scripture by ſome one particular Grace or Act of Religion, ſometimes by <hi>Faith in God,</hi> ſometimes by the <hi>Love of God,</hi> ſo here it is expreſs'd by the <hi>Fear of God;</hi> and here the Character given is, <hi>That he feared God above many, </hi> that is, that they (for I have ſaid the Character belongs to both) not only made a Profeſſion of Religion, and lived in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practice of thoſe good Morals required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but from a full and thorough Knowledge of them; he look'd upon them as Men of true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion and vital Piety: From the Words then, as I have thus conſider'd them, I propoſe for our Conſideration this Obſervation as appoſite to the Occaſion of this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thoſe whoſe Province it is, to deſign others, to Stations of publick Truſt, ſhould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</hi>

There are it is true, other Qualities neceſſary to ſuch as are inveſted with a public Character, as I ſhall ſay hereafter, but none that we ought to have ſuch a Regard to, as theſe; and therefore I call theſe the principal.</p>
            <p>And tho' in the choice of this Subject, I vary from many of my Fathers and ſuperior Brethren, who (before me) have ſtood in this Desk upon the like Occaſion, in that they have choſen to diſcourſe of the Apoſtacy of this People of God, and drop their Tears over their Immoralities, while they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all Orders of Men, both Civil and Sacred, to endeavour a Reformation of Manners, rather than to inſiſt upon any Subject, that had a direct Aſpect on the Affairs of the Day, and the Duty of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors to have a peculiar Regard to the Qualities of ſuch, as are this Day to be conſtituted one Branch of the Legiſlature. Yet the Reaſon (I know) has been, very much, becauſe they look'd upon it as an Impropriety, and altogether in vain, to ſpeak of neceſſary Qualities, when the Perſons themſelves are already fix'd upon, and (in Effect) choſen before this; and that perhaps without any Regard to their Qualities, only that they are ſuch as will be ſure to anſwer that Party-Cauſe and Intereſt they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for.</p>
            <p>When then, thus reſolved, they come to hear the Arguments and Exhortations of the Houſe of God, and here pretend to addreſs Heaven for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in, and a Bleſſing upon, their Elections, that they may be proceeded in, with Love and Peace, with Freedom and Uprightneſs; which I take for granted to be the original Deſign of theſe Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; I ſay when they come, thus reſolved to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Point, whatſoever Animoſities, Heats and Contentions they kindle thereby.</p>
            <p>

Or when they neglect the divine Worſhip this Day, in order to attend ſome ſelect <hi>Juncto,</hi> where (without a Tho't of God) they concert the whole Affair; it is no other than a bold Praevarication with God, and ſuch an impious Colluſion, as gives us a melancholy Proſpect, and bids us fear that God will <hi>take away Wiſdom from the wiſe, Underſtanding from the aged, and lead Counſellors away ſpoiled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' we pretend not to Inſpiration, yet we may very well apply to ſuch, that of the Prophet Jeremy, 42 Chap. 20. verſe, <hi>Ye diſſembled in your Hearts, when ye ſent me to the Lord your God, ſaying pray for us unto the Lord our God and according to all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, ſo declare unto us and we will do it.</hi>

Truſt, ſhould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein are plainly contained theſe Propoſitions,
<list>
                  <item>I. Prop. That it is the Province of ſome to deſign others to Stations of public Truſt.</item>
                  <item>II. Prop. That in this Deſignation, they ſhould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</item>

            <p>I. Prop. <hi>That it is the Province of ſome to deſign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Stations of public Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition naturally offers itſelf to us in theſe two Parts,
<list>
                  <item>1. A public Station is a place of Truſt.</item>
                  <item>2. It is the Province of ſome to Deſign others to theſe Stations.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak to theſe Heads and ſo to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in but brief and general Manner.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A public Station is a place of Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how great is that Truſt! It is true, This Truſt is greater or leſs, according to the Degree of the Importance of their ſeveral Stations; but all that is dear to a People, is in general Intruſted with thoſe who are in public Stations.</p>
            <p>Our Lives and our Intereſt our civil Privileges and Immunities, and our Religion too, are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted in their Hands; ſome <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of theſe, every Man in a public Station, is in ſome Meaſure intruſted with, whether he be in a civil or military Poſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004026_0012_1003BE53B6012A30"/>
The military Officer hath (eſpecially in the Time of War) the Care of our Lives and Intereſt too.</p>
            <p>By his diligent Watch and Guard it is, that God ſometimes draws a Line of Protection round about us, and the Land of unwalled Villages is ſafe from Fear.</p>
            <p>By his Conduct and Bravery it is, that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives Conqueſt and Victory to his People, when they <hi>are of good Courage, and play the Men, for the Cities of their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, He that in civil Regards is in a public Station, and that conſider'd either as legiſlative or executive, hath the Care of our moſt valuable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, committed to his Truſt.</p>
            <p>The peaceable and quiet Enjoyment of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, is intruſted with thoſe who are in executive Place of Power: Our civil Peace is put directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Charge, and much of our Religion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Guard and Protection.</p>
            <p>To them is committed the Diſpenſation of that diſtributive Juſtice, ſo neceſſary to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any People: and with them it lies to puniſh the Breaches, that are from Time to Time made upon that commutative Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, ſo neceſſary to their Trade and Commerce.</p>
            <p>Again, Such as are, in a legiſlative Conſideration, in a public Station, have an high Truſt committed to them; even our civil Liberties and Privileges, and the Cauſe of Religion too. It is theſe that prepare the civil Sword which is put into the Hands of the executive Officer, and give it Keenneſs and Terror, by the ſevere Sanctions of thoſe wholeſome Laws, which from Time to Time are enacted againſt Vice and Immorality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004026_0013_1003BE596F7ED040"/>
Theſe have it greatly in their Power to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Religion and Vertue;</p>
            <p>By placing ſtrong Guards about all our religious Enjoyments;</p>
            <p>By enacting ſuch Laws whereby the Worſhip of God may be promoted, and his holy Sabbaths more ſtrictly obſerved; which alas! are highly neglected, tho' the careful Obſervation of them are found to be the beſt Means of ſecuring the Religion of a People.</p>
            <p>By ſtrengthning the Hands and encouraging the Hearts of ſuch as are properly the <hi>Miniſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe it lies to take Care of the Means of Education; without which we ſhall ſoon become an ignorant and a barbarous People</p>
            <p>To make our Schools of Learning more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually anſwer the Ends of their Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>To take Care of our College, that Seminary of Literature and Religion, the early founding of which was one of the greateſt Glories of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and a Proof both of their great Wiſdom and Religion.</p>
            <p>Again, To theſe is committed the Care &amp; Truſt of our valuable, civil Liberties and Privileges; and it is by their loyal and dutiful Behaviour that they are yet continued to us, as it is certainly in their Power, by a froward and uneaſy Carriage, by Stubborneſs and Contumacy, to betray them all; and intirely defeat all the Good that was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd us, by the Royal Indulgence in the valuable Charter, which we (by the Favour of God) yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Thus have all thoſe who have any Share in the Legiſlature, a great Truſt committed to them.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Commander in Chief</hi> hath all theſe valuable Intereſts of the People, committed to his Truſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004026_0014_1003BE60AEF37860"/>
As they lie divided among the ſeveral Officers in public Station, either in the military Order, or in the civil Power, either Legiſlative or Executive; ſo is the Truſt of them all united in him.</p>
            <p>The Lives and the Intereſt, the civil Liberties and Privileges, and the religious Concerns of this whole People, are all under his Care; and it greatly lies with him, as to advance, aſſiſt and encourage them all; ſo to diſhearten and diſcourage the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and Endeavours of the moſt zealous Patriot, for the promoting and ſtrengthning theſe Intereſts of a People.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly conſider'd the great Truſt that is committed to ſuch as are in a public Poſt and Station: This is the Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p>How came they poſſeſt of this Truſt, and who hath committed this Charge to them?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>He whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> 8 Prov. 15, 16. <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, by me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as God hath done this ſometimes by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Deſignation to ſuch Station, by the Mouth of ſome inſpired Perſon, as in the Caſes of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and ſome of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So is this generally in a providential Way and Manner.</p>
            <p>For as Rule and Government is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the World, and the Peace, Welfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a People depend upon it; ſo is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſecuring Religion and the Glory and Honour of God, and hence he claims it as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to appoint over the Children of Men, whomſoever he will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004026_0015_1003BE62B3416DF0"/>
And therefore what Truſt is committed to ſuch, is committed to them by God; they Govern and Rule for him, and he will expect an Account, and that a ſevere one, from all Kings, Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the World, from all who have had theſe Truſts in any Regard, committed to them, how they have anſwered that Truſt.</p>
            <p>Every Kind of Power then and Manner of Rule (as they are very various) is of God; and therefore the Apoſtle tells us in that 13 Rom. beg. <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> Whereby a dutiful and loyal Behaviour towards ſuch as are in Power, is ſecured, from a Conſideration of the Ordination and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himſelf, by whoſe Authority they act. And therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mean not by theſe Texts, ſo often abuſed to that Purpoſe, at all to Recommend the ſenſeleſs Doctrine of paſſive Obedience and Non-reſiſtence; a Doctrine calculated for none, but a Nation of Slaves.</p>
            <p>All Forms of Government originate from the People; that is, God in his Providence hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced them; ſome to fix upon one Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſome upon another.</p>
            <p>While ſome reſerve the greateſt Part of the Power to themſelves, others inveſt ſome of the Nobles and great Families among them with that Truſt; while others chuſe to ſubmit themſelves to a Monarch, and delight in one ſupream Magiſtrate or Head over all the Eſtates of the Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004026_0016_1003BE6661DC9058"/>
As theſe Forms then have originated from the People, doubtleſs they may be changed whenſoever the Body of them chooſe to make ſuch an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their State.</p>
            <p>And therefore may they much more determine the Perſon and the Family, which they chooſe ſhould Reign over them.</p>
            <p>And this Principle lies in the Foundation of that wonderful REVOLUTION, the happy Effects of which, we feel this Day in the auſpicious Reign of a great KING, of the auguſt Houſe of HANO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER, in which illuſtrious Family KING WILLIAM the Third, (of immortal Memory) took the wiſeſt Meaſures (and it was none of the leaſt Actions of that great Monarch) to eſtabliſh the Succeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown.</p>
            <p>And may the God who rules UNIVERSAL KING.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

            <p>This Truſt which God is committing unto Kings, and by them to all that are in Stations of Truſt ſubordinate to them; is to be uſed for God, and the Happineſs and Welfare of that People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom they exerciſe their Authority.</p>
            <p>This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt Head under the firſt Propoſition, <hi>That a public Station is a place of Truſt.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004026_0017_1003BE6C5BE9FB18"/>
I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is the Province of ſome to deſign others to theſe Stations of public Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as the <hi>Body</hi> Natural as the Apoſtle ſpeaks<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12. 14.</note>, <hi>is not one Member but many.</hi> So is it alſo in the Body Politic, <hi>And God hath ſet the Members every one in this Body</hi> (as well as the Body Natural) <hi>as it hath pleaſed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is, as in the Body Natural, ſome Members are more honourable &amp; ſome are leſs ſo: For as the Offices to be executed among a People are many &amp; various, ſo is it neceſſary, there ſhould be various Orders and Degrees of Men, ſuperior and inferiour; and it is the Province of thoſe who are in ſuperior Station, to appoint to Office, ſuch as are Inferiour, &amp; to act in ſubordination to them.</p>
            <p>So is it the Province of the King as ſupream, or becauſe he is the ſupream Magiſtrate, to appoint others to Office; and this is done in a various Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, either mediately by the Power, with which he hath before inveſted thoſe, who are near him and round about his Throne, or immediately and in a direct Manner; ſo he delegates his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Governours who are ſent by him, and ſet over any People, to repreſent among them his Perſon, and to execute in his ſtead, a great Part of the regal Power: To whom, when they are thus conſtituted by him, it belongs to deſign others to Places of Truſt under them.</p>
            <p>And according to the various Conſtitutions of ſeveral Governments, this Power is communicated to others in a various Manner.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004026_0018_1003BE6FD1F47F20"/>
And ſuch is the Power which the Electors this Day are inveſted with by the Royal Charter, to chooſe one Part of our Legiſlature, and with the approbation of His Majeſty's Repreſentative, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them to a Place of very great Truſt.</p>
            <p>And thus I ſhall leave the firſt Propoſition, <hi>That it is the Province of ſome to deſign others to places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Truſt.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>II. Prop. <hi>That in this Deſignation they ſhould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thoſe who are in ſuch Authority anſwer their Duty, and rightly execute the Powers committed to them, then thoſe that are thus intruſted, muſt be fit for that their Truſt: and therefore they who deſign them to thoſe Places, ought to conſider their Qualities and Diſpoſitions, and therein their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſcharge the Duties of that their Truſt.</p>

by which all thoſe Qualities that are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by ethical Writers moral Virtues are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely abſorp'd and diſappear, as the feeble Light of the Stars, when the Sun ariſeth ſhining in his Strength.</p>
            <p>So the dim <hi>Light of Nature</hi> is of little uſe to guide us in our Way, when we have the more glorious Beams of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhining upon our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall conſider this as a natural Quality: Natural, I mean, in Contradiction not to moral but acquired.</p>
            <p>For as Men by their Regard to the Duties of the Religion of our Lord and Saviour, which they profeſs, may attain to a great Degree of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment; ſo the Diſpoſition thereto in ſome Men, may be ſuch, that it may be conſider'd as Natural.</p>
            <p>By Integrity then I underſtand, <hi>That natural Turn of the Mind, which diſpoſes a Man to act ſteadily and uniformly in all his Conduct, with an honeſt Regard to the various Intereſts that are intruſted with him, whether Public or Private.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, as our Nature is corrupt, and intirely deprav'd with Sin by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all, ſo <hi>there dwells in us no good Thing;</hi> and there are in us the <hi>Stamina</hi> or Elements of all Sin: But yet there is nothing more evident, than that we are not alike inclin'd to all, but more to ſome Sins than others; ſo are ſome Men much leſs inclin'd to any Breach upon Truth and Uprightneſs, than others</p>
            <p>And whether we can give a proper Reaſon for this, that ſhall ſatisfy us Philoſophically, or not, yet the Fact is evident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004026_0020_1003BE7777E26580"/>
And it appears very much to be natural, both, becauſe we find this continu'd frequently from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son. And his Father's Steadineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, or his Inſincerity and Turn to Cunning and Deſign, is plainly viſible in the Son that comes after him: And for that, we frequently ſee Men remarkable for this Quality, that not only have no Religion, but that ſcarce pretend to any; yet are they ſuch as from this natural Caſt, we are very ready to truſt and confide in.</p>
            <p>This then is a Turn of Mind that is very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the World, and of itſelf recommends a Man greatly to our Liking and Eſteem: For tho' this Quality will never ſerve a Man in ſpiritual Regards, ſaving, that ſuch an one is nearer the Kingdom of God than another; yet has it often done excellent Service in the ſecular Affairs of the World, and in the civil Societies and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men: Thus I ſhall cloſe this Head, <hi>What we are here to underſtand by Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>What we are to underſtand by Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Expreſſion of our Text then, we are lead to ſay in general, That the Man of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is one that <hi>Fears God and keeps his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As here is doubtleſs to be underſtood, one that makes a Profeſſion of Religion, and explicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Reſolution, for the Service, Honour &amp; Glory of his God, ſo hereby is not to be underſtood the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profeſſor only, however exact &amp; formal he may
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004026_0021_1003BE7B6316E518"/>
be in this Reſpect; but the Man of true vital Religion; the Man who hath the Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at his Heart, as well as upon his Tongue:</p>
            <p>The Man that acts from a Principle of divine Grace in the Soul: He who is influenc'd in all his Actions by the Views of another World; who <hi>lives his Life in the World, by the Faith of the Son of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an one as is not influenc'd in his Duty to God, (I mean in the external Profeſſion of Religion) nor in that to his private Nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bour, his Country or his People, by any little &amp; ſiniſter Views of worldly Honour or Advantage: But can wait for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Reward of all his ſincere, tho' imperfect Actions, till after Death:</p>
            <p>Who infinitely prefers his Acceptance with God, and the bleſſed <hi>Euge</hi> he Hopes for, from the great Judge of all; to all the vain popular Applauſe, that can be given by Man:</p>
            <p>In a Word, He that makes the Word of God his Rule, by which he acts ſteadily and uniformly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of a pure and upright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</p>
            <p>This is the Man of Religion, whoſe Motives, Ends and Deſigns, in all his Actions, both in public and private Life, are great and noble, right &amp; true.</p>
            <p>I proceed,</p>
            <p>III. To prove the Propoſition, <hi>That Integrity and Religion ſhould be principally Regarded by thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign others to Places of public Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, The Manner of the Expreſſion of this Propoſition implies, That there are other Qualities
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004026_0022_1003BE7F627428F0"/>
requiſite to the proper Execution of ſuch Truſts, in relation to which, theſe are the principal.</p>
            <p>And it is very true, There are other Qualities neceſſary, beſides Honeſty and Religion; ſuch as a good Underſtanding, Knowledge and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>For it is not every honeſt and religious Man, hath a Pretence to any one, much leſs to all of theſe.</p>
            <p>And to have ſuch in Places of public Concern, who are weak &amp; low in their natural or acquired Accompliſhments, tends to render the Government baſe and contemptible.</p>
            <p>Such then as are in public Stations, ought to be Men of a good Underſtanding, Knowledge and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſhould be Men of a good Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men of good intellectual Powers, that have a Capacity, when they apply themſelves to Buſineſs, to underſtand the Duties of their Station; that ſo their Weakneſs may not be a Snare to them, while they are lead blindfold by others, and made the Tools of a Party, and become the Property of Men of Trick and Deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as are in public Stations ſhould be Men of Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is ſuch Knowledge as is proper to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they ſuſtain: This therefore is various according to the Variety of public Stations in which Men are plac'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004026_0023_10039D6A66056DD0"/>
Such then as are in ſuperior public Stations, ſhould be ſuch as were the Men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Chron. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 32.</note>, <hi>Men: that had Underſtanding of the Times to know what Iſrael ought to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such ought therefore to be Men of political Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; knowing and underſtanding in the Laws of their People; and well acquainted with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Intereſts of that civil Polity and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in which they act their Part.</p>
            <p>And as the former Head reſpects the Faculty, ſo this doth the Application of that Faculty: And there are many Men of good natural intellectual Powers, who from the Narrowneſs of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and the neceſſary Diligence in the Buſineſs of their Callings, have no Time to ſpend in procuring that Knowledge, whereby they would otherwiſe be very fit for public Offices &amp; Stations, according to that of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ecclus. 38. 24, 25, 33.</note>, <hi>The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a learned Man cometh by Opportunity of Leiſure, and he that hath little Buſineſs, ſhall become wiſe: But how can he get Wiſdom that holdeth the Plough, and that glorieth in the Good, that driveth Oxen and is occupied in their Labours, and whoſe Talk is of Bullocks. They ſhall not be ſought for in public Counſel, nor ſit high in the Congregation, they ſhall not ſit on the Judges Seat, nor underſtand the Sentence of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Some thro' their Idleneſs and Indolence ſuffer a good Underſtanding to lie barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated.</p>
            <p>So that a good Underſtanding only, doth no way qualify a Man for ſuch Stations, unleſs it be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004026_0024_1003BE86C07C3CB0"/>
inform'd and enlightned, with that Inſtruction and Knowledge, proper for the Station he is aſſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Such as are in public Stations, ſhould be Men of Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Head is very different from the former, for that, a Man may be endow'd with great Treaſures of Knowledge, and yet be far from Wiſe &amp; Prudent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge</hi> conſiſts in the Poſſeſſion of a great Number of Ideas, and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the proper Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, to our ſeveral Needs and Purpoſes in Life: So that, Knowledge doth by no Means certainly imply Wiſdom: And <hi>the greateſt Clerks are not always the wiſeſt Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the Man of Knowledge will ſhine in the beauties of Diſcourſe; and as moſt Men are apt to judge ſuperficially, ſo will they be ready to imagine, that he that can ſpeak ſo finely, muſt alſo be a Man of equal Wiſdom: But it is very certain, That <hi>to Talk well and Act wiſely, are very different Talents;</hi> and oftentimes, do not meet in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame Perſon (unleſs where the Genius is great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior); but frequently, the more remarkable he is for the <hi>one,</hi> the leſs ſo is he for the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wiſdom and Prudence then are very neceſſary for ſuch as are in public Stations; whereby they may underſtand how to lead and govern the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inclinations &amp; Tempers of Men, the various Parties they have to do with (for there will always be ſuch) and the various Intereſts which ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties purſue; ſo as to bring Good out of Evil, and advance, ſometimes, the Intereſt of the Public, by ſuch as mean nothing leſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004026_0025_1003BE8A34E81CF8"/>
Theſe Qualities, then, of Underſtanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom, are all neceſſary to Stations of public Truſt; and yet, theſe are not mention'd in our Text: but, rather ſuch are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought for as are Men of Integrity and Religion.</p>
            <p>And this for ſeveral Reaſons; 1. <hi>Becauſe there is not ſo much need of urging the choice of Men of natural Powers; for that theſe Qualities are what Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally apt to look firſt at:</hi> Often imagining, that the Capacity of doing Service, and the Power and Ability to anſwer all the demands of the Place they ſuſtain, conſtitutes them fit and proper Perſons for that Station. 2. <hi>Becauſe ſuch is the Corruption of our Natures, that it is eaſier to find thoſe that are fit for a public Station, as to their natural Powers, than ſuch as are properly qualified by Morals.</hi> And then, Once more; <hi>Becauſe a moderate Degree of theſe natural Qualities, when they are well balaſted with Integrity and Religion, is much more likely to procure the Welfare and Happineſs of a People, than the higheſt Degrees of theſe natural Powers, when they are without the Moral:</hi> And therefore are Integrity and Religion to be look'd upon as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Qualities in thoſe, who are deſign'd to any Places of public Truſt. Which Things are ſome Proof of the Propoſition. But I proceed to a more direct Proof of it in three Things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Examples we have in the Scriptures, of the Care which the good Kings and Governours over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have taken in this Regard, are our Directio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> herein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we are to yield a ſtrict Obedience to the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per Precepts and Directions of the Word of God ſo are the Examples which we have there record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of holy Men, to have a great Weight with us
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004026_0026_10039D720D29ACB8"/>
for as the Apoſtle tells us,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Whatſoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning.</hi> And<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>That all theſe Things hapned to them for Enſamples, and are written for our Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find then, that thoſe that had the Character of good Rulers, have made this their Care, to put ſuch in Places of Truſt, as were Men of Religion, and a ſtrict Regard to the Law of God. Such is the Example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a King in <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>urun:</hi> For when he ſet Officers over the People, and gave them that Charge, 1 Deut. 1. 15, and onward, <hi>And I took the Chief of your Trives</hi>—<hi>and charged them at that Time, ſaying, hear the Cauſes between your Brethren, and judge righteouſly ye ſhall not reſpect Perſons, nor fear the Faces of Men, for the Judgment is God's.</hi> It is hence evident, That thoſe who had this Charge, were ſuch as he eſteemed Men of Integrity, and a ſtrict Regard to that Law of God which he put under their Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>So when the good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> appointed his Officers to public Truſt, he gave them that Charge, 2 Chron. 19. 6.—<hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord; wherefore let the Fear of the Lord be upon you.</hi> This being his Charge then, we cannot imagine, but that he took the greateſt Care to commit this Truſt, to Men whom he could confide in, that they would anſwer the Charge ſo given them: Even Men of Integrity and Religion.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the Example we have in our Text of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the pious Governour of <hi>Judah,</hi> who regarded the Integrity and religious Fear of God, in theſe his Officers, before every other Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; eſteeming <hi>that</hi> a ſufficient Reaſon, why he gave them the Charge of the City of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:004026_0027_1003BE902101D058"/>
2. <hi>We are directed to this in the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exod. 18. 21. <hi>Moreover, thou ſhalt provide out of all the People—Such as fear God, Men of Truth and having Covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them, to be Rulers of Thouſands, and Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, This is the Advice of <hi>Jethro, Moſes'</hi>s Father in Law, but it muſt be look'd upon as the Direction of God, if we conſider what follows, 23 v. <hi>If thou ſhalt do this Thing and God command thee ſo.</hi> As then the Government of that People was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Theocracy;</hi> ſo we are not to imagine, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would make ſuch a conſiderable Alteration in it, without the divine Direction: And therefore as he followed this Advice, we are to conſider it, as the Direction and Approbation of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>We ſee here, that this Direction to Men of Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and Religion is given with reſpect to ſome of the loweſt Officers, even to the Rulers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Tens, that they ſhou'd be <hi>Men fearing God and bating Covetouſneſs.</hi> How much more then are theſe Qualities neceſſary to the ſuperior Officers, and ſuch as Rule over the Thouſands of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore have we a particular Direction given by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to the ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that he ſhould be a Man that regarded the divine Law, in all his Rule and Government over the People. Deut. 17. 18, 19. <hi>And when thou ſhalt ſet a King over thee, when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law; and he ſhall read therein, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep theſe Statutes and do them, that he turn not aſide from the Commandment, to the right Hand or to the Left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004026_0028_1003BE9841A65D00"/>
3. <hi>That ſuch ſhould be deſign'd to Places of public Truſt is evident, becauſe it is only ſuch as are ſo qualified, will anſwer the Truſt repoſed in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When ſuch as are thus intruſted anſwer not to the Importance of their Truſt, it is always a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon their Conſtituents, and intimates a Deficiency of their Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>As the ultimate and general End of all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, and ſo of Government, ought to be the Glory of the divine Being, ſo the next &amp; more immediate End, is the Happineſs of the People.</p>
            <p>This then ought to be the next and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Purpoſe of ſuch as are in Place of ſuperior Power, and have the Authority of deſigning others to Places of public Truſt. And as it is a principal Part of Wiſdom to purſue any End which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves, in that Manner that ſhall beſt and moſt certainly attain it; ſo it is certainly the moſt egregious Folly, to defeat by any of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that very End, which by ſuch Actions we profeſs to endeavour after: And this (by the way) is the Reaſon, why all Sin is Folly.</p>
            <p>Now it will doubtleſs be univerſally allowed, that they that are in ſuperior Places of Power, ſuch as are to give Authority and Power to others, ought to act wiſely: Which, if they deſign the Intereſt and Welfare of a People, they do not, when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Offices of public Truſt to ſuch as are not Men of Integrity and Religion; becauſe ſuch as have no claim to theſe Characters, will by no means anſwer the Truſt repoſed in them, by ſuch Conſtitution and Appointment; for that ſuch are evidently deficient in thoſe valuable Endowments,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004026_0029_10039D9BB7B72730"/>
which are always neceſſary to the Weal and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of ſuch as they govern.</p>
            <p>But as Religion graſps in it all thoſe excellent Virtues, both perſonal and ſocial, that tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and eſtabliſh the Privileges, the Intereſt, and the Religion of any People; ſo he that deſerves ſuch a Character, muſt, generally ſpeaking, be the fitteſt Perſon of all others, to have theſe arduous Affairs committed to his Truſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore here conſider ſeveral of thoſe truly noble Qualities, productive of the public Weal, which are the genuine Effect of Religion: And which therefore it binds a Man to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, whatſoever public Character he is inveſted with.</p>
            <p>And they are ſuch as theſe, 1. Integrity and Uprightneſs. 2. Courage &amp; Fortitude. 3. Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart productive of a public Spirit. 4. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Righteouſneſs. 5. Liberality, in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Avarice or a ſordid View to a Man's own private Intereſt.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Integrity and Uprightneſs is a Quality neceſſary to a Man in public Station, which is the genuine Effect of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I before conſider'd Integrity as it is a Diſpoſition of the Mind, which is more natural to ſome than others. I now conſider it as it is a divine Vertue.</p>
            <p>And ſo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is that Habit of the Soul, whereby a Man is always inclin'd to act agreably to his Conſcience with every Man.</hi> (For I here conſider this Head, only as it has regard to our Actions toward Man) And ſo will he that is a Man of Integrity, act in Truth and Sincerity with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004026_0030_1003BE9A37E065C8"/>
all with whom he hath to do. He is in this reſpect<note n="*" place="bottom">John 1. 47.</note> 
               <hi>an Iſraelite indeed in whom there is no Guile.</hi> As he will not only, not lie to his Nei'bour by the Word of his Mouth; ſo neither will he by any of his Actions; for we may as well do ſo by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the former: As ſuch an one is a Man of no Artifice or Diſſimulation, ſo will he not delight in any ambiguous Manner of Expreſſion, whereby he may afterwards flatter himſelf, he is clear from any Obligation, which yet he knows his Nei'bour tho't he had, by ſuch Expreſſions, laid upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Such an one ſpeaks what he means, and his Words truly diſcloſe the Intent of his Heart: And he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Deſigns to act according to his Word, and always doth ſo, unleſs unavoidably prevented. And it is not any Diſadvantage which will accrue to him by his Faithfulneſs, that will make him forfeit his Integrity;<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalms 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>For ſuch a Man ſweareth to his Hurt and changeth not.</hi>

            <p>Now this, I ſay, is an Habit of the Soul: He is honeſt and upright, not in this particular Affair, and at ſuch a particular Time, or with reſpect to ſuch particular Perſons, but he is ſo, as he hath always a conſcientious Regard to his Actions.</p>
            <p>And this Virtue or Grace is the genuine Fruit and Effect of Religion, as it is analogous to one of the Perfections of God, whoſe Image it is the End and Deſign of Religion, to reſtore to the Soul; and therefore it demands this Quality of us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one of the Precepts of that divine Law, which the religious Man profeſſes to be the Rule of his Life, and that he is under the higheſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be obedient unto.</p>

And when he that hath that natural Turn to Truth and Integrity, as we have before conſider'd it, hath alſo his Heart ſanctify'd by Religion, What a Firmneſs doth it give to this noble Diſpoſition of the Mind! And it appears in all his Actions, and it is impoſſible to warp him from his Duty to God, and the Truſt that is repoſed in him; and he ſaith with <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 27. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Till I die I will not remove mine Integrity from me: my Righteouſneſs I hold faſt and will not let it go, my Heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man of true Integrity acts always under a Senſe of his Duty to God, for that he can never hope otherwiſe to dwell in his Preſence, according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, 5. 12. Who ſhall dwell in thine holy Hill, he that walketh Uprightly and worketh Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that ſpeaketh the Truth in his Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is this Motive and Principle of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that diſtinguiſhes Integrity from that unami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Vice of <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> which very much Troubles any Community, where the Leaders of it, pretend to Steadineſs of Truth and Virtue under that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe: For as <hi>Obſtinacy is a bigotted Reſolution to abide ſtifly by any Determination whatſoever, once made;</hi> ſo by this Stiffneſs, which hath the Face of a proper Conſtancy, it often mimicks Integrity. For as the World, which ſeldom judges wiſely of Things, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally account of a Man's Integrity, according to the Steadineſs of his Action, (tho' this of it ſelf is no Virtue, only as it is apply'd and directed,) ſo are they apt oftentimes to miſtake Obſtinacy for Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs; tho' they very widely differ from one another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:004026_0032_1003BEA1D65A3E88"/>
For,</p>
            <p>The Man of Truth and Sincerity acts ſteadily, becauſe what he doth he is ſatisfied is juſt &amp; right, and his Duty; according to the Character he ſuſtains. But,</p>
            <p>The Man of Obſtinacy acts ſteadily, becauſe he vainly delights in the Character that is given him, as not apt to Turn or Change. And tho h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forfeit any of his Intereſt, by this his Stiffneſs, which is very likely to fix his Character for Truth and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity: yet if he be not, in other Regards, a Man of uniform Virtue, it only ſhews, that he is leſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, than he is proud; and that from the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of this Vice, and the violent Attachment to his own Will, he had rather himſelf ſuffer, and make every one elſe, who has had any Dependance upon him, ſuffer with him, than make any Abatement of his Stubbornneſs &amp; Pertinacity Whereas the moſt upright Perſon and ſteady too, to Truth and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if he be a Man of any Modeſty, as he will after as often as he receives good Reaſon for it; ſo will he open his Eyes to receive Light, and be ready to hear the Reaſons that are given to perſwade him to change; tho' he always acts ſteadily and uprightly according to his preſent View of Things.</p>
            <p>So that he is one that may be depended upon, and Men put an intire Truſt and Confidence in ſuch a Man, which is an unſpeakable Advantage in all the Affairs of Life.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Courage is a Quality neceſſary to him who is in a Place of public Truſt, which is the genuine Effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man of Religion is ſuch an one as he in our Text, <hi>he fears God,</hi> and for that Reaſon he doth not fear Man: He is one of thoſe, who hath taken
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004026_0033_1003BEA730CD0EA8"/>
that Advice of our Lord,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 12. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, but fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath Power to caſt both Body and Soul into Hell.</hi> The truly religious Man doth all his Actions as to God, that is, as in his Preſence, and for his Glory and Honour; and ſuch an one is ready to ſuffer in the Cauſe of God, or when his Conſcience tells him it is his Duty.</p>
            <p>And thus Religion influences a fearleſs Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in all Stations of public Life.</p>
            <p>This gives Life and Spirit to the Soldier, when <hi>Thouſands fall at his Side, and ten Thouſand at his right Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion fixes the Courage and Reſolution of the executive Officer in civil Power, when he cauſes the Sword of Juſtice to fall with irreſiſtable Force upon the Head of the guilty Criminal.</p>
            <p>From hence proceeds Firmneſs and Stability, in all public Counſels and Debates: and the Patriot, if he be a Man of true Religion, always ſpeaks his Mind freely, regardleſs whom it will offend, when he thereby keeps a good Conſcience, for in this Caſe, as much as in any, is that of the wiſe Man true, Prov. 29. 25. <hi>The Fear of Man bringeth a Snare, but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhall be ſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that relies upon the Protection of God, ſhall be ſafe from the Deſigns and Reſentments of all ſuch as he offends, when thus he doth his Duty. For ſuch an one ſaith with the Pſalmiſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm 56. 11,</note> 
               <hi>In Gad have I put my Truſt, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:004026_0034_1003BEA8C0D80C98"/>
3. <hi>Largeneſs of Heart is another of thoſe Qualities, which is the genuine Effect of Religion, and neceſſary to ſuch are in public Stations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is the Tendency of Religion to dilate the Soul, ſo it is the End and Deſign, the Beauty and Excellency of it, to releaſe the Mind from that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, contracted State which Sin hath ſhrunk it into.</p>
            <p>True Religion diveſts a Man of <hi>Self,</hi> and gives him a generous and extended Concern for all that are round about him. For this is a natural Effect of true Love to our Nei'bour, that is the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mark of genuine Chriſtianity: For that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given it as an infallible Token whereby all the World might know his Diſciples,<note n="*" place="bottom">John 13. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Hereby ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye Love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Love, as it is an active Principle, ſo it doth not centre in it ſelf. If Charity begins at Home, yet it does not end there: But the Man endowed with this Grace is always active in doing good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when he hath an Opportunity: Yea He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to ſee all that are round him, in Proſperity; nor envies his Nei'bour, when he riſes above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He abhors thoſe Actions which we juſtly call mean and little, as what are as truly forbidden by the Law of Chriſt, as any of thoſe Actions which we are more ready to ſtile ſinful &amp; immoral: For Actions that are little and mean, are a direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Chriſtianity; which more than any other Religion, more than any one Set of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whatſoever, tends to enlarge the Heart, and influence to great and excellent Actions: And it is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004026_0035_1003BEAC74B9ECC0"/>
certain that he that hath a narrow, ſelfiſh and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Soul, can never be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>When, then, the Man in public Station is a Man of Religion too, he will diſdain to act from any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er Views: They are no Temptation to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he endeavours to anſwer the Duties of that Station, let the Event and Iſſue of ſuch his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be what it will.</p>
            <p>And tho' his Honour, Repute and Eſteem with Men be dear to him, yet when they come in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Honour of God, and the Peace of his own Conſcience, they appear to him, as indeed they are, Things of little Value.</p>
            <p>And if by his acting in a generous, open and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted Manner, he pleaſes neither Party, becauſe he has not forwarded according to their Hopes, their little and private Deſigns; yet a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he has acted according to the Obligations of that Religion which he profeſſes, is ſuch a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Mind, that he is little affected with the Reſentments which ſuch his true and generous Behaviour may have raiſed againſt him.</p>
            <p>This Magnanimity and Expanſion of Heart, as it is neceſſary to Men in public Station, ſo is it the genuine Effect of true Religion; for hence it is that we ſometimes ſee the Man of mean Extraction, and of the courſer Imployments of low Life, by true Religion attain to that greatneſs of Mind, that is often found wanting in ſuch as are the Sons of Nobles, and have had the moſt open and generous Education So neceſſarily does Religion enlarge the Soul; according to that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119 32 <hi>I will run the Way of thy Commandments when thou ſhalt enlarge my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

4. <hi>Juſtice and Righteouſneſs is another neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Man in public Station, which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Fruit of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Quality, I ſay, is neceſſary to him that is made, any way, a Ruler over Men; according to that, 2 Sam. 23. 3. <hi>He that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt.</hi> Hence <hi>Job</hi> ſays, when ſpeaking of himſelf in his judiciary Quality,<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 29. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I put on Righteouſneſs, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m.</hi> It cover'd him all over as a Garment; it was his Glory and Beauty, and gave a Luſtre as the Jewels of a royal Diadem.</p>
            <p>This is perpetually found where there is true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for it is always a Part of the Baſis of it: And that Man's Religion is bottom'd upon the Sand, that hath not this divine Virtue in the Foundation of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Virtues which the Heathen call'd Moral, and in which lay their higheſt Attainments, our bleſſed Saviour hath made a Part of the Chriſtian's Duty, by the Precepts of the Goſpel: But then, they are but a low Part of it, and but the ordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of a Chriſtian: But however, abſolutely neceſſary to Chriſtianity, and he can never be a Chriſtian that wants them.</p>
            <p>So that whatever neceſſity there is, of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in public Life, the Man of Religion will certainly be poſſeſs'd of theſe Qualities: And we may depend upon a rigorous Impartiality in the Execution of every Office he ſuſtains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:004026_0037_1003BEB4C02E8DF8"/>
5. <hi>Liberality, in Oppoſition to Avarice, or a ſordid View to a Man's own Intereſt, is another genuine Effect of Religion, neceſſary to Men in public Station.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who wants this Vertue, or which is all one, he that is properly a covetous Man, whoſe Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wrap'd in worldly Gain, cannot be a Man of true Religion; for the Love of God (in which conſiſts the Eſſence of Religion) can never dwell in ſuch a Soul.</p>
            <p>For if it be true as our Lord tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> How much more is it true of him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Money to God! Is it poſſible that God ſhould dwell in that Heart, where he ſees ſuch an Idol in the higheſt Seat of the Affections? No; but it is impoſſible ſuch an one ſhould have any Love to God. Such a Soul knows no Fervours of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are Strangers to his Heart. He has no Aſpirations after ſecret Communion with any God but <hi>Mammon.</hi> The Tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of the pure and holy converſe of the heavenly World, give him no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; neither if he were there could he take the leaſt Satisfaction, unleſs he finds the Apoſtle's <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> Deſcription of that Place, <hi>literally</hi> true,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That the Streets of it are of pure Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man of true Religion then, will be juſt his Reverſe: who as he has the higheſt Regards to the ſpiritual Entertainments of Heaven, which are the Riches of Righteouſneſs, ſo will have but a mean Opinion of thoſe of this preſent Life; and as he is not anxiouſly careful for theſe Things, ſo will he never make any Breach upon his Conſcience, for
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004026_0038_1003BEB64B30BF00"/>
the ſake of obtaining them; but abhors the Tho't of diſhoneſt Gain.</p>
            <p>This Quality then is abſolutely neceſſary to him who hath the public Intereſt of a People, any way at his diſpoſe, leaſt he convert it to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage. For as ſuch an one always ſtands ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>queze himſelf into any Station, whereby he may get ſomething, if it be but a little: ſo every ſuch Station he will make the moſt of, whatever the Public ſuffers thereby.</p>
            <p>So that by this immoderate Deſire of Gain, and ſordid Love of the World, he not only <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uch a Man will tranſgreſs.</hi> And let ſuch an one pretend never ſo much to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Welfare of his People, by a prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Treaſury, whereby, tho' he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelf to their Approbation, as a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward; yet how often doth he thereby ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard thoſe Intereſts and Privileges of a People, that are infinitely more valuable than the triffling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Taxes &amp; Eſtates, which he means to ſave by his ill-tim'd and pretended Thrift and Frugality? He then that is more ſaving of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Monies, than he is tender of the Privileges of a People, never can deſerve that honourable Title

            </p>
            <p>And thus I have conſider'd ſome of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities, which are always neceſſary to ſuch as have a public Truſt committed to them, as the genuine Fruits and Effects of Religion. And ſo I have proved that ſuch are the fitteſt of all others for the diſcharge of the Duties of a public Station. Hence the Propoſition is evident, <hi>That ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign others to Stations of public Truſt, ſhould have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</hi> And thus I proceed to the</p>

               <p>And here tho' I might mention many Things that naturally ariſe from what I have ſaid, yet as the Time would fail me, I ſhall content my ſelf with theſe that follow,</p>

               <p>As every Man then, ſhould be concern'd for the public Welfare, ſo ſhould he preſent ſuch in Prayer to God; for his Aſſiſtance &amp; Direction with them, in all their Endeavours to advance ſuch public In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: Hence we have that Direction of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

                  <hi>I exhort therefore, that Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made—for Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> And we are to pray to God, becauſe they are his Officers, ſuch as he in his Providence hath ſet up; and therefore are we to apply to him to make them his <hi>Miniſters to us for good.</hi> We are alſo to give Thanks to God for ſuch, when our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, in general, flouriſh under their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And when this is the Caſe, it proceeds from a murmuring Spirit and Diſpoſition in a People, and is a Proof of an unthankful and ungrateful Heart toward God, if, becauſe every individual Affair doth not proceed according to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and, perhaps, narrow Tho'ts of Things, they ſhall endeavour to form Parties, and ſtir up Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs and Complaints; thereby greatly diſturbing the public Eaſe &amp; Quiet, and ruffling the Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

But this requires a perſonal Knowledge,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004026_0043_1003BEC2C433CE40"/>
which indeed is the moſt full and perfect, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rather to be choſen by ſuch as communicate to others, any Part of their Rule and Authority: But as this is oftentimes impoſſible, ſo are ſuch then to be judged of, according to their general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Such was the Care taken by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Appointment of others to Office.

                  </gap>it for that Station in the Government, which he had aſſign'd them to.</p>
               <p>When, then, there is not this perſonal Knowledge, and their Character is various; the next wiſeſt Thing is to conſider the Qualities of ſuch as vouch for them For that Men will (generally ſpeaking) recommend ſuch as are like themſelves: And the Man of Integrity and Uprightneſs of Heart will ſeldom ſollicite, much leſs will be a <hi>Sponſor,</hi> for a Man of Falſhood and Deceit. For it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Abuſe of thoſe in Authority, and deſerves their higheſt Reſentment, when Men, from their own lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and private Views and Deſigns, have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to recommend to any Place of Truſt and Importance, ſuch unqualified Perſons.</p>

               <p>It is true, a Man may pretend the higheſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the public Worſhip and Honour of God; and, as we have heard, make the moſt exact Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion; and yet have none at all: For <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in Mens Heart, <hi>cometh not with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and are diſcoverable only by him <hi>before whom all Things are naked and open.</hi> But tho' the higheſt external Reverence, and the ſtricteſt Profeſſion, will not prove Religion in the Heart, yet it will hold negatively, That he that hath no Reverence for the ſocial, public Honour of God, is certainly not a Man of true Religion. For as the Man of Religion hath the Honour and Glory of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near his Heart, ſo he will certainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to advance and promote it by all his Actions: And therefore, as he will gladly Covenant with God, in an explicit Manner, ſo will he continually wait upon him to do him reverence in his Houſe, <hi>when the Multitudes come up there to keep holy Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is neceſſary then, that the Man in a public Station ſhould be a Man of reverential Regard to the ſocial Worſhip &amp; Honour of God in the World: For that, as the Externals of Religion are under his Guard and Protect on ſo will he be very ſlack both in promoting and executing the Laws that ſupport them, when himſelf is a Delinquent.</p>
               <p>And here, as to our committing the Guard of the Externals of Religion to ſuch as are of own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Profeſſion, which is tho't by many to be moſt expedient, I ſay; That tho' every Man ought to enjoy the Rights of a good Subject, that is one; notwithſtanding his particular Sentiments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where the Principles of that Religion do not tend to the Deſtruction of his Loyalty and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: And tho' it be abhorrent to chriſtian Charity to imagine, true Religion is confin'd to ſuch as are of our own Mode of Profeſſion: Yet, when we think it moſt wiſe to chooſe rather to commit the Care of theſe religious Privileges (which we our ſelves think tend moſt of all others to advance
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004026_0045_10039DB09AEFD7F0"/>
Religion in Heart) to ſuch as are of the ſame Profeſſion with our ſelves, we cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>airly fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as are yet moſt ready to blame us for it, unleſs they acknowledge, it would be for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Welfare of our Nation, that their <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Corporation Acts</hi> ſhould be repeal'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We learn from what we have heard, <hi>That ſuch as are in a public Station, ſhould be Men of good Morals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he that profeſſeth Religion never ſo exactly, may be without the Religion of the Heart, ſo it is very certain that he may be ſo too, that is very exact in his external, moral Behaviour toward Men. But yet, when we have gone this length, when we have had a ſtrict Regard to the Externals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the good Life and Morals of him that is to wear a public Character, we can go no further. Then have we done all that God requires of us in that Affair, ſo far as Religion is concern'd in it; and muſt leave the Event to God.</p>
               <p>Such an one as this, our Charity obliges us to think a Man of Religion; and ſuch an one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be one of true vital Piety or not, yet will generally ſtand upon the Side of Religion &amp; Vertue.</p>
               <p>But the Man of bad Morals is the leaſt of all fit for a public Station; for as he that is in ſuch a Poſt, hath both the Religion and the Morals of a People, very much under his Care and Direction, ſo he needs all poſſible Obligations to bind him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge faithfully that Truſt committed to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe Intereſts are included all the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Welfare of any People; ſo he that hath the Ties of Conſcience upon him, lies under the ſtrongeſt Bonds poſſible, to the Performance of his Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004026_0046_1003BECFD9C5BF70"/>
But the immoral Man cannot have the Face to pretend he acts upon a Principle of Conſcience, becauſe he declares by his general Life, that <hi>he Fears not God, nor Regards Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With how ill a Grace muſt he pretend to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Principle of Integrity and Uprightneſs, who is a Man of known Fallacy and Deceit? Is he fit to puniſh Prophanity &amp; Irreligion, whoſe raſh Tongue itſelf, often flies in his Maker's Face? Is he a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon to puniſh Intemperance, who is himſelf a Drunkard? Or how can he diſcourage Lewdneſs, who is a Man of inſatiable Luſt and Debauchery? And ſhall he pretend to diſcountenance Theft, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and Injuſtice, who is himſelf guilty of cheating and defrauding his Nei'bour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Public, which is the worſt Theft and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice? Or how can he that is in the Legiſlature, have any Zeal in promoting and enacting any wholeſome Laws againſt theſe Vices, when he knows himſelf ſhall be continually liable to the Sanctions of them?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, From what we have heard of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Integrity, we learn, <hi>That that Diſpoſition will be a valuable Addition to the religious Qualifications we have recommended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a Man of ſuch a Diſpoſition will more eaſily, or rather with leſs Difficulty, be perſwaded to act thoſe ſeveral Duties, which we have conſider'd as neceſſary to a Station of public Truſt; while the Man of a different Byaſs, will find it much harder to bind himſelf to an uniform Practice of that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Truth and Fidelity, which yet are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fruits and Effects of true Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004026_0047_10039DB921F509F8"/>
For tho' the Deſign and Intent of Religion, be to correct all the Diſorders and Depravities of the Soul, yet that Diſorder and Error that we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moſt inclin'd unto, or that <hi>Sin which doth</hi> therefore <hi>moſt eaſily beſet us,</hi> will be the laſt correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or at leaſt, ſuch a Diſpoſition will be always apt to diſcover itſelf, in ſome Meaſure, in our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however the Heart may be truly ſanctified.</p>
               <p>So have I ſometimes obſerv'd, ſuch as have not only had a Name for Religion, but ſuch as by their general Courſe of Life, according to their ſtrict Profeſſion, are well intitled to our Charity: yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a natural Lurch to Cunning and Intrigue, have ſometimes made ſuch Breaches upon their Uprightneſs, as a Man of natural Integrity would have been aſham'd of. And tho' afterwards they themſelves were ſo too, and have had their Souls humbled for it; yet by ſuch their Diſſimulation have they not only diſhonour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Religion, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt the Cauſe they were intruſted with.</p>
               <p>But then, tho' Religion teaches and influences, produceth and binds faſt upon us, that Integrity we have been ſpeaking of, yet it is not what the World commonly calls Religion, that doth this. We commonly call him a religious Man, That as he makes Profeſſion of it, ſo his general Life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to ſuch his Profeſſion; and we can tax him with no Immorality ſcarce, for that as to any Thing we can diſcover, he generally <hi>keeps a Conſcience void of Offence towards God and towards Man:</hi> This we call a Man of Religion, and we ought to call him ſo, for we ought to think him ſo: But if after all this he be not ſo, as it is certain this may be the Caſe, notwithſtanding our ſevereſt Scrutiny, for that true Religion is inviſible, and a Thing of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004026_0048_1003BEDB314E5468"/>
Heart, the Knowledge of which is the Prerogative of God alone? And then, the Actions of ſuch a Man are not done in Purity of Conſcience and from a ſincere Regard to his Duty toward God: And then, (it is evident) he has not thoſe Ties and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon him, which he had depended upon; and therefore may looſe himſelf from all the Bonds of his outward Profeſſion, upon ſome large ſecular Advantage he may have in View.</p>
               <p>And ſuch a Man is certainly leſs to be depended upon, than he that hath that natural Inclination to Honeſty &amp; Uprightneſs, as we have before deſcrib'd it. Upon the whole, it is evident, that this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſpoſition to Uprightneſs and Steadineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will add to our Reaſons for depending upon him that is, beſides, a Man of Religion and Virtue.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now Conclude, but that the Reverence and Veneration I bear them, bids me firſt make an humble Addreſs of what I have ſaid, to the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS of my Country:</p>

               <p>That as you appoint over the People, able Men, Men of Knowledge &amp; Wiſdom, ſo that they ſhould eſpecially be ſuch as have the Welfare and beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of this People, near their Hearts: Such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Wiſdom, and political Sagacity, you diſcern to be Men of Steadineſs, Truth and Virtue; Such alſo as are Men of true Religion, and a pure and upright Conſcience, who will, of all others, be moſt likely to anſwer all the Ends of Government: Whom the People will moſt willingly obey, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to whoſe good Example, they will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd to form their Conduct and Behaviour; and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004026_0050_1003BEDF899A1588"/>
who, by their wiſe Deportment, will <hi>reflect</hi> back upon you, a great deal of that Honour with which they ſhine, by your <hi>direct</hi> Influence upon them: Such alſo as will always make their Conſtituents moſt eaſy, while they hear no Complaints of their Male-Adminiſtration, but are from Time to Time refreſh'd and delighted with the Accounts of their Truth and Fidelity.</p>
               <p>For theſe Qualities, as we have heard, will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Man to do the Duties of every Station he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains, and that whether Civil or Military.</p>
               <p>YOUR EXCELLENCY, as Captain General, will have no Reaſon to repent your Favours to an Officer thus endowed; for that, Courage and a wiſe Conduct, is the natural Produce of theſe Qualities: As ſuch an one therefore will not raſhly proceed to Action, where he hath little or no probability of Succeſs; but will Fore-caſt all his Deſigns with Wiſdom and Caution, ſo will he execute them with Firmneſs and Steadineſs: And when in the <hi>high Places of the Field,</hi> he fights with Spirit and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, becauſe he thinks it his Duty. And all the empty Notions of Honour, which are commonly tho't good Reaſons for being prodigal of Life, are but Madneſs in compariſon with the Motives which the religious Man acts upon: And <hi>there is no ſuch Foundation for Intrepidity and Courage, as an upright Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, If we conſider this Officer, as concern'd with the Wages and Subſiſtence of his Men: Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Religion will be a ſure defence againſt all Fraud and Deceit; here will be no Danger of falſe Muſter-Rolls, and charging the Public with Wages that were never earn'd; but ſuch an one will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Advice to the Souldiers, given by <hi>John

               <p>Again, If you ſhall conſider the public Officer, as in a civil Poſt and Station, and that whether in the legiſlative or executive Part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; theſe Qualities, we have inſiſted on, are his Strength, his Beauty and Ornament.</p>
               <p>Conſider him as one of the Judges of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and how awful is he in the Execution of his Truſt; the Malefactor trembles before him, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely Juſt and Righteous; knowing that he will not forgive, when it is his Duty to puniſh; and that he will by no means clear the Guilty.</p>
               <p>And on the other Hand, what Joy do the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd and Oppreſſed conceive from theſe Qualities, when they come before him for Judgment: For ſuch an one acts like <hi>Job,</hi> that perfect and upright Man, when he ſat in the Seat of Judgment; and like him will have the Satisfaction of an happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his judicial Actions, as being done in Truth and Uprightneſs, when he ſaith with him,<note n="†" place="bottom">Job 29. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I delivered the Poor that cried, and the Fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The Bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh, came upon me: and I cauſed the Widow's Heart to ſing for Joy. I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame. I was a Father to the Poor: and the Cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out. And I brake the Jaws of the Wicked, and plucked the Spoil out of his Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, If we look upon this civil Officer as in the Legiſlature, and ſitting at the Council Board;
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004026_0052_1003BEEA18AF8CB0"/>
this Integrity and Religion gives him ſuch a Luſtre, as is incompatible to the brighteſt natural Qualities, the largeſt Knowledge, and the moſt ſagacious Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when they are in the leaſt ſhaded with Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and Craft.</p>
               <p>As ſuch a Man will have a Zeal for God, ſo will he manifeſt it in his public Capacity, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Concern for the Advancement of his Glory, and the perpetual Diſcountenance of Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality. Hence, he is ſtudious in deviſing, and active in promoting, ſuch Laws as are neceſſary in theſe Regards.</p>
               <p>He hath the civil Liberties and Privileges of his People always upon his Mind, nor patiently bears any Appearance of the leaſt Infringement of them. Such an one will appear in all his Actions at that Board, with Courage and Reſolution; and is not ſo ſolicitous to know, whether his Votes and Debates there, be agreable, either to the Chair, or to ſuch as have Elected him to that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as whether they will iſſue in the Weal and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his People: Neither will he ever look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nomination of any Officer at the Board, as having any Claim to his affirmative Voice, unleſs he thinks him qualified for ſuch a Truſt.</p>
               <p>And inaſmuch, as the Conſtitution of all civil Officers, lies very much with that honourable Board, it is therefore highly neceſſary, that they ſhould be Men of Integrity and Religion, who will certainly be the moſt likely to keep thoſe out of any public Truſt, that want thoſe Qualities, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have the greateſt Regard to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:004026_0053_10039DCF2B642B68"/>
Moreover, As it is always the Advantage of the Adminiſtration, that the ſeveral Branches of the Legiſlature ſhould act freely, without any influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Byaſs, from the other Part of it: And as the particular Perſons that compoſe this Part of the Legiſlature, depend upon the other Two for their Exiſtence: That they may nevertheleſs act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently and freely, it is neceſſary they ſhould act upon a Principle of Conſcience, and therefore ſhould be Men of Integrity and Religion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Theſe Qualities will very much free them from a great deal of Trouble and Uneaſineſs, which they are always liable to, from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Conſtitution of this Government: For that as the other Parts of the Legiſlature do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agree, ſo the Man of Artifice and Inſincerity, that more values his Seat at that Board, than the Intereſt of his People, will be oftentimes (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Art of Diſſimulation) in the utmoſt Perplexity how to act, ſo as to pleaſe the one, and not offend the other.</p>
               <p>But as the Man of Integrity hath not theſe Ends in view, but rather the Satisfaction of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
