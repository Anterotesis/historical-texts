            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A Sound mind in a ſound body, is ſaid to be a ſtate of the higheſt human happineſs indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually; when theſe bleſſings are ſeparate, a ſound mind, wiſe and prudent conduct, tend much to ſupport and preſerve an unſound body: On the other hand, where the body is ſound, the conſtitution ſtrong and healthy, if the mind is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, the governing principle weak and feeble, the body feels the injuries which enſue, the health and conſtitution often become enfeebled and ſickly, and untimely death cloſes the ſcene. This reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holds good politically, being ſometimes realized in bodies politick, and perhaps never more ſo than in the conduct lately exhibited to mankind by Great-Britain. Her conſtitution was ſound, ſtrong and firm, in a degree that drew admiration from the whole world; but, for want of a ſound mind, her directing and governing powers being imprudent and unwiſe, to ſuch a debilitated and ſickly ſtate is this fine conſtitution reduced, that, without a change of regimen, her deceaſe may not be very remote. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica

is a child of this parent, who long ſince, with many ſevere pangs, ſtruggled into birth, and is now arrived to the ſtate of manhood, and thrown off the reſtraints of an unwiſe parent, is become maſter of his own will, and, like a lovely youth, hath ſtepped upon the ſtage of action. State phyſicians pronounce his conſtitution ſtrong and ſound: the eyes of the world are ſingularly attentive to his conduct, in order to determine with certainty on the ſoundneſs of his mind. It is the general Congreſs, as the head, that muſt give the colouring, and ſtamp wiſdom or folly on the counſels of America. May they demonſtrate to the world, that theſe bleſſings, a ſound mind in a ſound body, are in America politically united!</p>
            <p>IT was a claim of freedom unfettered from the arbitrary control of others, ſo eſſential to free agents, and equally the gift of our beneficent Creator to all his rational children, which put fleets and armies into motion, covered earth and ſeas with rapine and carnage, diſturbed the repoſe of Europe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the treaſure of nations. Now is the time to demonſtrate to Europe, to the whole world, that America was in earneſt, and meant what ſhe ſaid, when, with peculiar energy, and unanſwerable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, ſhe plead the cauſe of human nature, and with undaunted firmneſs inſiſted, that <hi>all mankind</hi> came from the hand of their Creator <hi>equally free.</hi> Let not the world have an opportunity to charge her conduct with a contradiction to her ſolemn and often repeated declarations; or to ſay that her ſons are not real friends to freedom; that they have been actuated in this awful conteſt by no higher motive than ſelfiſhneſs and intereſt, like the wicked ſervant in the goſpel, who, after his Lord had forgiven his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017839_0004_0F4ABDDB984E7150"/>
debt which he was utterly unable to pay, ſhewed the moſt cruel ſeverity to a fellow ſervant for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling demand, and thereby brought on himſelf a puniſhment which his conduct juſtly merited. Ye rulers of America beware: Let it appear to future ages, from the records of this day, that you not only profeſſed to be advocates for freedom, but really were inſpired by the love of mankind, and wiſhed to ſecure the invaluable bleſſing to all; that, as you diſdained to ſubmit to the unlimited control of others, you equally abhorred the crying crime of holding your fellow men, as much entitled to freedom as yourſelves, the ſubjects of your undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER habit and cuſtom may have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed familiar the degrading and ignominious diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are made between people with a black ſkin and ourſelves, I am not aſhamed to declare myſelf an advocate for the rights of that highly injured and abuſed people; and were I maſter of all the reſiſtleſs perſuaſion of Tully and Demoſthenes, could not employ it better, than in vindicating their rights as men, and forcing a bluſh on every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſlave-holder, who has complained of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have received from Britain, which is no more to be equalled, with ours to negroes, than a barley corn is to the globe we inhabit. Muſt not every generous foreigner feel a ſecret indignation riſe in his breaſt when he hears the language of Americans upon any of their own rights as freemen, being in the leaſt infringed, and reflects that theſe very people are holding thouſands and tens of thouſands of their innocent fellow men in the moſt debaſing and abject ſlavery, deprived of every right of freemen, except light and air? How ſimilar to

an atrocious pirate, ſetting in all the ſolemn pomp of a judge, paſſing ſentence of death on a petty thief. Let us try the likeneſs by the ſtandard of facts.</p>
            <p>THE firſt ſettlers of
theſe colonies emigrated
from England, under the
ſanction of royal char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
held all their lands
under the crown, and
were protected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by the parent
ſtate, who claimed and
exerciſed a control over
their internal police, and
at length attempted to
levy taxes upon them,
and, by ſtatute, declared
the colonies to be under
their juriſdiction, and
that they had, and ought
to have, a right to make
laws to bind them in all
caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p rend="small">AFRICA lies many
thouſand miles diſtant,
its inhabitants as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of us, as we are
of them; we ſail there,
and foment wars among
them in order that we
may purchaſe the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and encourage the
ſtealing one another to
ſell them to us; we bring
them to America, and
conſider them and their
poſterity forever, our
ſlaves, ſubject to our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
will and pleaſure;
and if they imitate our
example, and offer by
force to aſſert their native
freedom, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as traitors, and
a haſty gibbet ſtrikes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
on their ſurvivors,
and rivets their chains
more ſecure.</p>
            <p>THE American Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in their declaration,
July 1775, ſay,</p>
            <p>"IF it were <hi>poſſible</hi>

infinite goodneſs and

of a legal domination
never rightly reſiſtible,
however ſevere and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive;

to that body. But a

convince all thoſe who
reflect upon the ſubject,

ought to be adminiſtered
for the attainment of that

DOES not this forcible

to Africans? Have we a

THIS was the voice, the language of the ſupreme council of America, in vindication of their rights as men, againſt impoſition and unjuſt control:—Yes, it was the voice of all America, through her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in ſolemn Congreſs uttered. How clear, full and concluſive! "We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the purſuit of happineſs." "By the immutable laws of nature <hi>all men</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to life and liberty." We need not now turn over the libraries of Europe for authorities to prove that blacks are born equally free with whites; it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and recorded as the ſenſe of America: Ceaſe then ye cruel taſkmaſters, ye petty tyrants, from attempting to vindicate your having the ſame intereſt in your fellow men as in your cattle, and let bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confuſion of face ſtrike every American, who henceforth ſhall behold advertiſements offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brethren to ſale, on a footing with brute beaſts.</p>
            <p>BUT what ſhall I ſay! Forgive it, Oh Heaven, but give ear, Oh earth! while we are execrating our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017839_0013_0FA4BDE9A21762F0"/>
parent ſtate with all the bitterneſs of invective, for attempting to abridge our freedom, and invade our property; we are holding our brethren in the moſt ſervile bondage, caſt out from the <hi>benefit</hi> of our <hi>laws,</hi> and ſubjected to the cruel treatment of the moſt imperious and ſavage tempers, without <hi>redreſs,</hi> without advocate or friend.</p>
            <p>OUR rulers have appointed days for humiliation, and offering up of prayer to our common Father to deliver us from <hi>our</hi> oppreſſors, when ſighs and groans are piercing his holy ears from oppreſſions which we commit a thouſand fold more grievous: pouring forth blood and treaſure year after year in defence of our own <hi>rights;</hi> exerting the moſt aſſiduous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care to ſecure them by laws and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while the poor Africans are continued in chains of ſlavery as creatures unworthy of notice in theſe high concerns, and left ſubject to laws diſgraceful to humanity, and oppoſite to every precept of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianty. One of theſe in effect gives Fifteen Pounds for the murder of a ſlave; that is, after a ſlave has abſconded a certain time, Twenty Pounds is given to any one who ſhall bring his head, and but Five Pounds if he is brought alive. Another, which empowers certain officers to ſeize negroes ſet free, and ſell them for the benefit of government: And, even during the preſent conteſt, negroes have been ſeized with the eſtates of perſons who had gone over to the Britiſh, and ſold by publick auction into <hi>perpetual ſlavery,</hi> and the proceeds caſt into ſtock for the <hi>defence</hi> of American <hi>liberty.</hi> Of the ſame complexion is an inſtance in New-Jerſey: A female Quaker, about ſeven years ſince, manumitted her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes; the times having reduced her ſo as to be unable fully to diſcharge a debt for which ſhe was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017839_0014_0FA4BDE9D82C7A00"/>
only ſurety, the creditor, a great declaimer in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>American freedom,</hi> although he was offered his principal money, obtains a judgment, levies on theſe free negroes, who by the aſſiſtance of ſome real friends of freedom, procured a <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> and removed their caſe before the juſtices of the ſupreme court. How many ſuch mock patriots hath this day diſcovered, whoſe flinty hearts are as impervious to the tender feelings of humanity and commiſeration as the nether millſtone; can ſport with the rights of men; wallow and riot in the plunder, which their unhallowed hands have ſqueezed from others! But only touch <hi>their</hi> imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate intereſts, and what an unceaſing outcry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades every ear. A love for my country, a regard for the honour of America, raiſes an ardent wiſh, that this picture may never be realized in her rulers.</p>
            <p>IT may be objected that there are many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be guarded againſt in ſetting of negroes free, and that. were they all to be freed at once, they would be in a worſe condition than at preſent. I admit that there is ſome weight in theſe objections; but are not theſe difficulties of our own creating? And muſt the innocent continue to ſuffer becauſe we have involved ourſelves in difficulties? Let us do juſtice as far as circumſtances will admit, give ſuch meaſure as we aſk, if we expect Heaven to favour us with the continuance of our hard earned liberty. The work muſt be begun, or it can never be completed. "It is begun and many negroes are ſet free." True, it is begun, but not in a manner likely to produce the deſired <hi>end,</hi> the entire <hi>aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>ſlavery.</hi> This is the buſineſs of the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending authority, the main ſpring which gives motion to the whole political machine; which, were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017839_0015_0FA4BDECD5BA0AD0"/>
they to undertake in good earneſt, I have no doubt but we ſhould ſoon ſee a period ſixed, when our land ſhould no longer be polluted with ſlave-holders, nor give forth her increaſe to feed ſlaves: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it hath been a matter of wonder to many, that that body, who have been ſo much employed in the ſtudy and defence of the <hi>rights,</hi> of <hi>humanity,</hi> ſhould ſuffer ſo many years to elapſe without any effectual movement in this buſineſs. Had they, with the declaration of independence, recommended it to the different Legiſlatures to provide laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that no perſon imported into, or born in America after that date, ſhould be held in ſlavery: it would have been a ſtep correſpondent with our own <hi>claims,</hi> and in time, have completed the work, nor can I ſee any impropriety, but what the nature of the caſe will juſtify, to have it ſtill take place.</p>
            <p>TO ſhew the neceſſity of this matter taking its riſe at the head, if any thing effectual is done. I may inſtance the Quakers. Some among them, it is ſaid, always bore a teſtimony againſt ſlavery from its first introduction, and the uneaſineſs increaſing, advices were given forth cautioning their members againſt being concerned in importing ſlaves, to uſe thoſe well whom they were poſſeſſed of, ſchool their children, <hi>.</hi> but ſome of the foremoſt of that ſociety having experienced the profits of their labour, no effectual ſtop could be put to the practice, tho' many became uneaſy, and ſet their negroes free, until the difficulties attending the late French and Indian war, brought the rights of men into a more cloſe inſpection, when a rule was agreed upon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting their members from being concerned with importing, buying, or ſelling of ſlaves; and ſome years after a further rule was made, enjoining all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017839_0016_0FA4BDEF5C8AFDD8"/>
thoſe who held ſlaves to ſet them free, otherwiſe to be ſeparated from religious memberſhip.—The work was then ſoon accompliſhed, and they now ſay there are very few members belonging to the yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Philadelphia who hold a ſlave.</p>
            <p>WHEN a grievance is general, it is but trifling to apply partial means; it is like attempting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a great tree by nibbling at its branches. It is only the ſupreme power which pervades the whole that can take it up by the roots.—The diſquiſitions and reaſonings of the preſent day on the rights of men, have opened the eyes of multitudes who clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that, in advocating the rights of humanity, their ſlaves are equally included with themſelves, and that the arguments which they advance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict others, rebounds with redoubled force back on themſelves, ſo that few among us are now hardy enough to juſtify ſlavery, and yet will not releaſe their ſlaves; like hardened ſinners, acknowledge their guilt, but diſcover no inclination to reform. It is true theſe convictions have occaſioned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of many ſlaves, and two or three ſtates to make ſome feeble efforts looking that way; but I fear, after the ſunſhine of peace takes place, we have little more to expect, unleſs the ſovereign power is exerted to finiſh this ſin, and put an end to this crying tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>LET me now addreſs that auguſt body, who are by their brethren clothed with ſovereign power, to fit at the helm, and give a direction to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant concerns of the American union. You, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, have, in behalf of America, <hi>declared</hi> to Europe, to the world, "That all men are born <hi>equal,</hi> and, by the <hi>immutable laws</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> entitled to liberty." We expect, mankind

We are encouraged in this expectation by the ſecond article of your nonimportation agreement in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of America, October 1774, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> "That we will neither import nor purchaſe any ſlave imported after the firſt day of December next, after which time we will wholly diſcontinue the ſlave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourſelves, nor will we hire our veſſels nor ſell our commodities or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures to thoſe who are concerned in it."—And much would it have been for the honour of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, had it been added and confirmed by laws in each ſtate (nor will we ſuffer ſuch a ſtigma to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on our land, as that it can produce ſlaves, therefore no child, born in any of the United States after this date, ſhall be held in ſlavery.)—But the children of ſlaves are private property, and cannot be taken from their maſters without a compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! What! After it hath ſo often been echoed from America, "All men are born equally free." "No man or body of men can have a legitimate property in, or control over their fellow-men, but by their own conſent expreſſed or implied. Shall we now diſown it in order to hold our ſlaves? Forbid

it all honeſt men; it is treaſon againſt the rights of humanity, againſt the principles upon which the American revolution ſtands, and by which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conteſt can only be juſtified; to deny it, is to juſtify Britain in her claims, and declare ourſelves rebels. Wherefore our rulers undoubtedly ought to give theſe principles, theſe laws which themſelves have declared <hi>immutable,</hi> a due force and efficacy. This every wellwiſher to their country, either in a religious or political ſenſe have a right to aſk and expect. But we have laws that will maintain us in the poſſeſſion of our ſlaves: "The fundamental law of nature being the good of mankind, no human ſanctions can be good, or valid againſt it, but are of themſelves void, and ought to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," Lock. Therefore none can have juſt cauſe of complaint, ſhould ſo deſirable an event take place, as that no perſon brought into, or born within any of the United States after the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of independence, ſhall be held a ſlave.</p>
            <p>WHEN I read the conſtitutions of the different ſtares, they afford a mournful idea of the partiality and ſelfiſhneſs of man; the extraordinary care, and wiſe precautions they manifeſt to guard and ſecure our own rights and privileges, without the leaſt notice of the injured Africans, or gleam of expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation afforded them, of being ſharers of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruitage, except in that of the Delaware ſtate, who, to their laſting honour, while they were hedging in their own, provided againſt the invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rights of others. By the twenty-ſixth article of their conſtitution they reſolve, that "No perſon hereafter imported into this ſtate from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, ought to be held in ſlavery under any pretence whatever; and no negro, indian or mulatto ſlave,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017839_0019_0FA4BDF35F9A7058"/>
ought to be brought into this ſtate for ſale from any part of the world." Had they went further and made proviſion by which ſlavery muſt at length have terminated within their juriſdiction, it would have been doing ſomething to the purpoſe; and, as this is the only conſtitution in which poſterity will ſee any regard paid to that abuſed people, I hope the ſame humane conſiderations which led them ſo far, will induce them to take the lead<note n="*" place="bottom">When this was written I had, by information, been led to believe, that the late Pennſylvania ſlave law was very partial and inadequate, but have ſince learned, that it is a judicious and well conſtructed law, which provides for the entire abolition of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that ſtate.</note> in doing their part toward putting an effectual end to this crying evil, which will ever remain a ſtain to the annals of America.</p>
            <p>AND you who in the ſeveral ſtates are clothed with legiſlative authority, and have now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of diſplaying your wiſdom and virtue by your laws freed from every foreign control, although this people were below notice, and their rights and intereſt thought unworthy of a ſanction in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; let me beſeech you, if you wiſh your country to eſcape the reproach and laſting infamy of denying to others what <hi>ſhe</hi> hath ſo often, and in the moſt concluſive language, declared were the rights of <hi>all;</hi> if you wiſh to retain the name of chriſtians, of friends to human nature, and of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up acceptably in prayer to the common father of men to deal with you in the ſame tenderneſs and mercy as you deal with others; that you would even now regard the rigorous oppreſſions of his other children, and your brethren, which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under laws which you only can abrogate.

your negro laws calculated not to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, but to augment and heighten their calamitous ſituation! Caſt out and rejected by the regulations formed for the defence and ſecurity of the rights and privileges, and to guard and improve the morals and virtue of the whites: Left open to the gratification of every paſſion and criminal commerce with one another, as though they were brutes and not men; fornication, adultery, and all the rights of marriage union among blacks, conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the notice of thoſe rules and ſanctions formed to humanize and reſtrain corrupt nature, or the regard of thoſe whoſe duty it is to enforce them. Yes, bluſh Americans! Ye have laws, with ſevere penalties annexed, againſt theſe crimes when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted between whites; but, if committed by blacks, or by white men with black women, with the aggravated circumſtances of force and violence, they paſs as ſubjects of mirth, not within the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of law or magiſtrates inquiry, and loſe the very name of crimes. Hence children often become familiar with theſe ſcenes of corruption and wickedneſs, before they are capable of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the duties of chriſtianity, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of unreſtrained nature. No marvel then if ſlave-holders are often ſcourged by the vices of their own offspring, which their untutored ſlaves have been a means of inflicting—children who, inſtead of being educated in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, are too often nurtured in pride, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lewdneſs, and the indulgence of every natural appetite; that, were there no other inducement, this ſingly is ſufficient to cauſe every real chriſtian to lift a hand againſt, and exert their utmoſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in, bringing this hydra miſchief to a period.</p>
