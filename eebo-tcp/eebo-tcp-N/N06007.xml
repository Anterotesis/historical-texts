            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the all-wiſe GOD hath made, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the World, by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo he over-rules, directs, and orders univerſal Nature, by his Providence. The Diſpenſations of which have been very extraordinary of late, in the terrible <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> that have been in one Country, and another, and in the dire Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they have produced; ſome of which have been amazingly Awful; and; vaſtly exceeding, in their Extent thro' many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Countries, and in the Deſtruction

of many Cities, Towns, Villages, and Places, any thing of the like Kind that ever has been known in any one Year of the World.<note n="a" place="bottom">It appears from various accounts computed, that the <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> being on the first of <hi>Nov.</hi> laſt, continued for the ſpace of 60 Days, and were felt with more, or leſs Violence, from the eaſtern Shores of the <hi>Atlantic Ocean</hi> to the heart of <hi>Germany</hi>; and from the frozen Clime of <hi>Iceland</hi> almoſt to the Tropick of Cancer; a prodigious
extent of about four thoſand Miles from Eaſt to Weſt &amp; about two thouſand from North to South.</note> 
               <hi>Nation</hi> is riſing <hi>againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom</hi>; rumours of <hi>Wars</hi> ready to break out, are ſpread among the Nations: And our own Nation is obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Arms for the defence, and ſecurity of her just Rights; and our own Land is actually engaged in a dangerous WAR. Which with the Invaſions that hath been made on our <hi>Frontiers,</hi> the Blood that hath been already ſpilt, and the vigilant Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions each ſide are making for a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous carrying on the War; together with other remarkable Diſpenſations of Divine Providence, ſeem all plainly to forebode ſome great Overtures, and Events in the womb of divine. Providence ready to break forth. What ſhall we then ſay to theſe Things? The frowns of Heaven, and the Dangers
that ſurround us; does not the ſame excite

in every thinking Man, good Chriſtian, and loyal Subject, ſerious, and enquiring Tho'ts what theſe Diſpenſations calls us to; what we have to do, and what may beſt be done, to ſecure ourſelves againſt thoſe threatning Dangers, and Invaſions of our Enemies; which ſeems to put every Thing that is dear to us at ſtake; not only the Property of the Country, and our Enjoyments in it; but alſo our Liberties, Privileges, and the holy Religion we are bleſſed with; and when this is the general Concern and Enquiry in ſuch a critical Day, where can we better go for Direction than to the ſacred Oracles of GOD, which offer the beſt Directions in all Caſes, and Light in the darkeſt Times. And if we enquire at the Divine <hi>Oracles</hi> we ſhall find ourſelves directed to look to GOD, and ſeek his Face, and Favour, Preſence, and Bleſſing, as the beſt, and only ſure Way for Deliverance from Dangers &amp; Troubles, &amp; for Protection, and Safety at all Times. For if GOD be for a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Government,</hi> or a <hi>People,</hi> who can be againſt them to their real Harm, much leſs to their Ruin: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> triumphantly ſpeaks in our Text,—<hi>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe Things</hi>? TO GOD's abundant Grace towards Chriſtians; his myſterious Love to them in Jeſus Chriſt, his kind, and gracious Intentions towards his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007617_0007_102BAA6537746558"/>
People, and the wonderful ſpecial Care he takes of them; who keeps them as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Eye, who is Afflicted, in all their Afflictions, and ready to their help in every time of Need, to relieve and ſuccour them, to protect and ſave them in all Times of their Trouble, and Danger; on their <hi>humbly looking to and truſting in him for the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe Things</hi>? Why this we may ſurely ſay, and ought believingly and thankfully to ſay, That <hi>if God be for us who can be againſt us</hi> ſo as to prevail to the ruin of GOD's People? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none at all! GOD is for his People, as he is in Covenant with them, &amp; ſo engaged to them and for them, as he condeſcends to dwell among them, and take them under his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care, and Protection, and is ready to beſtow every needed Bleſſing of Grace, and Providence on them, on their ſeeking to, and truſting in him for the ſame. So that GOD's being for us implies Preſervation, and Guidance, Counſel, and Conduct, in all our Ways: Protection, Preſervation, and Help in every time of Need, together with the beſtowment of all the Bleſſings of Grace, and Providence, ſo far as ſhall be for GOD's Glory, and our beſt Good; Yea, GOD is for his People, and bringing about their Good and Salvation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſpiritual when he ſeems to be againſt them. And ſince it is ſo. <hi>If God be thus for us who can be againſt us,</hi> ſo as to prevail to the ruin of GOD's Church and People, be their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies never ſo many, never ſo ſtrong and potent, never ſo malicious, politic, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning. Yet GOD is above them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul all their Meaſures, confound their Counſels, and overthrow their evil Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations againſt his People. What then can they do while GOD is for his People, and with them, to Protect, Defend, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and Fight for them.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE which ſeems to offer it ſelf to our Conſideration is this, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>That GOD's Favour for, and Preſence with his Covenant People, is their Happineſs, beſt Security, and Safety always; eſpecially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</p>
            <p>Their being GOD'S Covenant People, and as ſuch near to him, and intereſted in his divine Favour, does not exempt them from Enemies, Troubles, and Dangers in this ſinful World. No their being ſo, often raiſeth them up Enemies, and exaſperates ungodly Men againſt them, and expoſes them to their Rage, and Perſecution, who would gladly <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thereof. But GOD has ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for them for his Covenants Sake, and for CHRIST's Sake, the Head of the Covenant; and becauſe there are many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Ones,</hi> and elect <hi>Veſſels</hi> in the collective Body) as he has not for the reſt of the World. <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord
our God is in all things that we call up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Two Things here offer for clearing the Doctrine (<hi>viz.</hi>) To Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is implied in God's being for, &amp; with his People.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew, that this is their Happineſs, beſt Security, and Safety always, ſpecially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</p>
            <p>I am then to conſider firſt PROP. I.<hi>What is implied in God's being for, and with his People.</hi> For his being for them, certainty implies his Preſence with them, And here, 1.

            <p>But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2 GOD is for, and with his own Church and People, in a more eminent, and peculiar Way, and Manner. He has choſen them out from the reſt of Mankind, and taken them into Covenant, to be a peculiar People to himſelf, <hi>a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People.

               <note n="c" place="bottom">Numb 16.10</note> Hence there is none like them in the account of the Bleſſed GOD; none near to him in Favour as they be: <hi>For what one Nation in the Earth is like thy People, even like Iſrael, whom God went to redeem for a People to Himſelf.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Sam. 7.23.</note> Hence GOD condeſcends to ſtand in a peculiar Relation unto them, as their Covenant GOD, and Friend. <hi>For thou haſt confirmed to thyſelf, thy People Iſrael to be a People unto thee forever; and thou Lord art become their God,</hi>

               <note n="f" place="bottom">Deut. 32.9</note> Therefore the LORD takes them under his peculiar Care, and <hi>keeps them as the Apple of his Eye</hi>: He intereſt's him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all their Intereſt; and is afflicted in all their Afflictions, as the Prophet ſpeaks: <hi>In all their afflictions, he was Afflicted, the Angel of his Preſence Saved them, in his Love, and in his Pity he Redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of Old.</hi>

            <p n="1">(1) It implies ſpecial Favour, ſuch as GOD has not for the reſt of Mankind.

            <p n="4">(4) It implies Help in Times of Danger, and Trouble, and ſure Deliverance, in GOD's Time, which is the beſt Time.

            <p n="3">(3.) The mighty Power of GOD can Save his People in the greateſt Dangers, and bring about their Salvation, in ways, and by means (to us) the leaſt likely, and probable. How unlikely was it to humane Probability that Pharaoh ſhould be brought to let GOD's People go from under his tyrannical Yoke in manner as he did, laden with Jewels, and rich Spoils of the Egyptians, and that when purſued by the ſtrength of Egypt, the Sea ſhould open a ſafe, and dry Paſſage to GOD's
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007617_0023_102BAA73B256EAC8"/>
People: But drown all their Enemies! How improbable was it to humane appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that Gideon with his three Hundred Men, Arm'd only with Pitchers, Lamps, &amp; Trumpets,ſhould diſcomfit, and deſtroy, that vaſt Army of Midianites, who with their Allies were like Graſs-hoppers for Multitude? Alſo that Deborah, and Barak with a few ill-arm'd, &amp; undiſciplined Men, ſhould defeat, and deſtroy <hi>Siſera,</hi> and his vaſt Army, ſtrengthned with a Thouſand Chariots of Iron?</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the days of the Judges, &amp; afterwards under pious Kings: How often did the Lord make an handful of his People Victorious over vaſt Armies of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? When to humane probability Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory muſt have turned to the other ſide.—But 'tis equally easy to infinite Power to Save by many, or by few. And he ſaved his People becauſe they called upon and truſted in Him.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation might be brought down to latter Times, &amp; nearer to ourſelves. Who more unlikely than King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to bring on that glorious Reformation, began in our Nation, in his Reign, and effected by wonderful Means!

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007617_0024_102BAA442F797910"/>
jeſuitical Counſels; Means indirect enough to ſo glorious an Event; yet by theſe were the Eyes of the Nation opened, and the Way paved to that great Salvation.</p>
            <p>Again, How often did our <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> the firſt Planters of this Country, experience glorious Salvations wrought for them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their numerous, ſurrounding Enemies when their Numbers, and Strength, was as nothing compared to that of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Succeſs granted our ſmall Army in the laſt War againſt that ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi>; was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Salvation beyond a rational Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. And when thereupon a ſtrong Fleet, was ſent from France, to attempt the recovery of that Place, or make Reprizals on us. How totally was it fruſtrated, and broken by the immediate Hand of Heaven?<note n="i" place="bottom">This French Fleet conſiſted of about 16 Sail of large of Men of War, moſtly line of battle Ships, and ſome ſmall Frigates, and a large Number of Tranſports, with Troops on board; a Strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miment this! but very Sickly when they arrived in <hi>Chebucto</hi> Harbour, where they lay for ſome Time, and Buried many: They made no attempt on any Place, but putting again to Sea, were broken, &amp; parted by a violent Storm, in which ſome Periſhed, and many more being taken in one Place, and another, few ever got ſafe back to France. How great a Diſappointment this to France! And how remarkable, memorable, and favourable a Providence this, to this Land.</note> How great a Mercy to this Land? How glorious a Salvation this!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007617_0025_102BAA75622A0C48"/>Nor indeed is the Hand of GOD to be leſs ſeen and acknowleged in the ſignal diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poinment &amp; overthrow of the <hi>French Fleet,</hi> perſidiouſly ſent againſt <hi>Halifax,</hi> and <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Scotia</hi> laſt Summer, to fall upon, ſeiſe, and deſtroy the ſame, under the cover of Peace.—Alſo in the Succeſs, and glorious Victory granted to our Forces at <hi>Lake-George</hi>; when the Enemy apprehended the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ly ſo on their Side, that they came on to Battle with raiſed expectaions of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and Victory. But the greater was their Diſappoinments, and Defeat. Thus does the Almighty GOD ſometimes bring about the Salvation of his People, and do great Things for them, in Ways, and by Means, leaſt likely to human Probability. Well, <hi>if God be for us, who</hi> then <hi>can be againſt us</hi>: Let us obey his Laws, ſeek his Favour, and Truſt in Him, then we ſhall be ſafe amidſt all the threatning Dangers that any Time ſurround us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Truth under conſideration will further appear if we conſder the infinite Wiſdom of GOD. He is Wiſe in Heart as

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By directing them into ſalutary, &amp; right Counſels for their own Safety, and Defence. They know not (it may be) their own Danger but GOD does, and by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom directs them into right Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for their own Defence, and Safety. He influences, and enlarges their Minds, giving to them ſuch a Spirit of Wiſdom, Counſel, and Forecaſt, as to over-match the Counſels of their Enemies; ſupplant them
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007617_0027_102BAA78E6F63E40"/>
in their evil Deſigns, and guard themſelves againſt all their attempts upon them: They have Prudence given them <hi>to fore-ſee the Evil, and hide themſelves,</hi> they are directed from on High to proper Expedients, and wiſe Precautions, for their own Safety, and Defence: Even as the <hi>Britiſh Court</hi> in the Summer paſt, were directed into a Foreſight of, and into right Counſels &amp; Meaſures for, diſappointing and defeating, the ſecret and perſidious Deſigns of the <hi>French Court</hi> on <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and other Engliſh Settlements on this Continent.</p>
            <p>And as the Officers of the Army at <hi>Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>George</hi> were directed into a right Conduct on the critical Day of Battle there; by which Means GOD ſaved his People; the greater Part of them, from the cruel Deſigns of that Blood-thirſty <hi>Army of French,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> and gave us a Signal <hi>Victory</hi> over them, on that Memorable EIGHT OF SEPTEMBER laſt: Very conſpicuous were the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Stepſ of divine Providence, leading on, and opening the Way to that great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note n="t" place="bottom">I was my-ſelf an Eye witneſs of this great Action, and ſaw the Salvation of the LORD on that Day. The particulars of which are carefully Recorded, in my <hi>Journal</hi> of that Expedition.</note> And a great Smile of Providence was it on theſe Churches: May the ſame
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007617_0028_102B857AAE89ECD8"/>
never be forgotten; and all the Praiſe be aſcribe there, where 'tis all Due.—</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sometimes by ſeaſonable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Warnings, diſcovering, and pointing out their Danger: Sometimes in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and ſometimes in an extraordinary Way. So GOD warned the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his Prophet of the deſigned <hi>Invaſion</hi> of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> upon him. By which means he was enabled to Defeat the ſame, and Save himſelf, <hi>not once, nor twice.</hi> Of the ſame kind waſ the Diſcovery that divine Providence made of the ſecret, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Gun-Powder-Plot,</hi> in our own Nation; a Mercy of Heaven never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. So the cruel Plots of the Churches Enemies laid againſt them, are diſappointed, and broken by a ſeaſonable Diſcovery made of them by divine Providence.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Sometimes by providing for them an <hi>Azylum,</hi> a City of Refuge, or Place of defence, and ſafety from impending Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Ruin. As GOD provided an <hi>Ark</hi> for Noah, and his Family: A <hi>Zoar</hi> for Lot and His—And the City of <hi>Pella</hi> for the firſt Chriſtians, to which they fled, and were Saved, when Jeruſalem was Deſtroyed. And ſo the Earth helped the Woman, and the Wilderneſs was made her ſafe Retreat, from the Rage of the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Even as this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007617_0029_102BAA7A6AD915F0"/>
wilderneſs Land was made of GOD a ſafe Retreat to our Fathers, when they fled from the Perſecutions at Home.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Sometimes by controuling, and overruling the Enemies Counſels, for Hiſ People's Deliverance.</p>
            <p>GOD rules ſupreme in the Courts of Princes, and over all the Children of Pride; turning their Hearts, and overruling their Counſels at His Pleaſure. <hi>The Kings Heart is in the Hand of the LORD: As the Rivers of Water He turneth it whetherſover He will.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 21.1.</note> Sometimes he leaves, or gives them up to a Spirit of Infatuation; that they are inſnared in their own Ways, and confounded in their own Counſels; they are guided by a Spirit of Folly to their own Ruin. When a People are left to weak, and fooliſh, and to uncertain, and wicked Counſels: Not having Wiſdom to project right Means; nor ſteadineſs, nor courage to purſue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Meaſures, what then is like to follow but their own Diſappointment and Ruin, to the Deliverance, and Salvation of GOD'S own People? Thus was the haughty King of <hi>Syria</hi> confounded in his own Counſels at the Siege of <hi>Samaria</hi>; when relying on the ſuperior Numbers and Strength of his
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007617_0030_102BAA48E2CB3A00"/>
Army, he deſpiſed <hi>Ahab,</hi> and his handful of Men coming out to raiſe the Siege; and gave thoſe fooliſh, and haughty Orders, <hi>Whether they be come out for Peace take them alive, or whether they be come out for War take them alive.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Kings 20 18.</note> On which followed his immediate Defeat, with a great ſlaughter of his Army, to the Deliverance of GOD's People. And it may teach all Generals that a deſpiſed Enemy often proves a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable one; as thoſe two experienced Generals with their old veteran Soldiers from <hi>Europe</hi> found it to be laſt Summer, when they deſpiſed the raw, and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Soldiery of this Country to their own Defeat and Ruin.<note n="‖" place="bottom">General <hi>Braddock,</hi> who unhappily fell in the Battle at <hi>Ohio,</hi> July 9th. 1755. And the French General. <hi>Baron de Dieskau,</hi> who was Beaten, dangerouſly Wounded, and taken Priſoner in the Battle at <hi>Lake George, Sept..</hi> 8th. 1755.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Sometimes by dividing their Counſels ſo that they ſhall weaken the Hands of one another, and ſo cannot perform their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Scarce any thing is more dangerous to a State, or Army, than divided Counſels, or want of Unity in them: And when this is found prevailing, 'tis an Omen of the approaching Ruin of that State, or Army. And thus GOD ſometimes divides the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007617_0031_102BAA7BED9FEA98"/>
of His Churches Enemies, by which He defeats their malicious Deſigns, and ſaves His People. So that vaſt conſederate Army which came up againſt <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and his Kingdom were utterly Deſtroyed by divided Counſels, and Mutiny among themſelves. <hi>Ammon, and Moab ſtood up againſt the Inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to ſlay and deſtroy them.</hi> And that being done <hi>every one helped to deſtroy another.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Chron. 20.13.</note> And thus GOD's People had Deliverance from that formidable Invaſion.—How dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and deſtructive a Thing is Mutiny in an Army! and how carefully ſhould every leading ſtep to it be avoided, and unity of Counſels be maintained as they would hope to proſper, and be ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>But to proceed</p>
            <p n="6">(6) GOD can take off the Enemies of his People from their malicious Deſigns againſt them, by cutting them out other Work to do. Thus he defeated the deſigns of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> when he came with a powerful Army to ſack, and deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and delivered His People from that eminent Danger <hi>by cauſing him to hear a Rumour</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings 19 7.</note> of an Invaſion coming on his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, on which he raiſed the Siege, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007617_0032_102BAA4AF75C3DC0"/>
haſtened Home for the Defence of his own Territories. So GOD cauſeth evil Men to make Work for one another, and thus ſecures the Peace, and Safety of His own People. Such Work may poſſibly be cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> to employ them on this critical Day, by the Jeſuits uſurped Kingdom in <hi>Paraguay,</hi> and the progreſs he is making down the <hi>River Plate</hi> to enlarge his new Kingdom. This may be a means of hindring the junction of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms with the <hi>French</hi> againſt us, or at leaſt of dividing, and weakning down their Power,—Or Again,</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) When GOD's People are to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on the brink of Ruin He can raiſe them up ſome mighty Deliverer, and ſo ſave them from all the Danger as he did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> many a Time. A <hi>Moſes,</hi> a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> a <hi>Jephtha,</hi> a <hi>David.</hi> And for our own Nation a <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> when it was on the brink of Ruin.—And may I not add a <hi>GEORGE</hi> too, whence we enjoy the preſent happy Eſtabliſhment? Yea GOD can make the <hi>Beaſt</hi> help the <hi>Woman,</hi> the Papiſts, the Proteſtants, as he has many a Time done.—Or further,</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) He can help and ſave his People by giving them a Superiority of Wiſdom, Strenght, and Courage, to overmatch their
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007617_0033_102BAA7ED3B3D6A8"/>
Enemies: As he gave to the Jews in the Time of Eſther on the Day of their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſaſſination, <hi>When no Man could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them but the Fear of them fell on all People</hi>:<note n="t" place="bottom">Eſther 9.2.</note> And their Enemies were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated that they could not find their Hands,—Or again,</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) GOD will by his own immediate Hand break the Power of the Enemy; and open the way for the Deliverance, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People. As he did for Iſrael when he opened a Paſſage thro' the <hi>red Sea,</hi> for their Deliverance, from the Power of the purſuing Egyptians. Or as in the Days of Joſhua, and Deborah, when the Stars in their Courſes, Sun, and Moon, Fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemies of GOD's People; and GOD Rained from Heaven, Hail-ſtones, Fire, and Tempeſt, on their Heads to their utter Deſtruction, and Overthrow before his People; <hi>So let all thine Enemies Periſh, O Lord.</hi>—Or,</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Finally, By removing particular Perſons out of this World, in the very criſis of his Churches Danger: As in the Caſe of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. So his Church had Deliverance, and Salvation. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom is never at a loſs to find out
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007617_0034_102BAA4CF0318258"/>
ways, and means by which to Save his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be their Streights, and Dangers what they will. He will make the Wrath of Man to Praiſe him, and the remainder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he will reſtrain: Surely they are ſafe, &amp; happy then, who have GOD for and with them; a preſent and all-ſufficient Help in every Time of Need.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Truth before us will further appear if we conſider the infinite Goodneſs of GOD engaged for his People's Safety: GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his People, his Goodneſs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is engaged for them, and to them. So when Moſes was under fearful Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether Iſraels Sin in making the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Calf, and their frequent Murmurings would not wholly throw them out of the divine Favour, and Protection: GOD to Satisfy him was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>I will make all my Goodneſs to paſs before thee</hi>;<note n="h" place="bottom">Exod 33.19</note> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my People, and will be merciful to my People, and ſpare them as a Father does his Son: That their Follies, and Failings ſhall not caſt them out of my Protection.—Here lies the Difficulty, when we find ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs with ourſelves; and looking abroad find ſo much Sin in Church, and State; I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity abounding, and the Love of many
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007617_0035_102BAA80D5C08AE0"/>
waxing Cold; ſo much degeneracy from the pious Paths our Fathers walked in, &amp;c. Our Hearts are ready to miſgive and ſay, Can GOD be for ſuch a degenerate, sinful, &amp; backſliding People? Will he ſave a People walking ſo unworthy the Grace, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges indulged them? Now under ſuch dark Apprehenſions, GOD's boundleſs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted Mercy, is our only Support, and it is a proper, and ſufficient Foundation for Faith, Hope, and Truſt in GOD: If his Churches will conſider and turn to him, at the call of his Word, and rebukes of his Providences (and not Tempt GOD by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him to deliver, and ſave them, while yet they refuſe to put away thoſe Sins for which he is Correcting them) for this is the intendment of all his corrective, Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to deſtroy his People; no, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and teach them Righteouſneſs, and ſtir us up to ſeek his Face, and Favour that he may appear for, deliver, and ſave us. <hi>God is ſlow to Anger, but ſwift to ſhow Mercy,</hi> and to ſave his People. He is ſovereign in his Goodneſs, boundleſs in his Grace; the Reaſons of which are from, and within himſelf: <hi>He therefore hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy</hi>; and ſo becauſe he will. And thou' when his People Sin, and grow corrupt he will withdraw his wonted
