            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Sabbath compleats a HALF CENTURY ſince I was ordained a Paſtor, and upon the laying on the hands of the Preſbytery, ſolemnly veſted and charged with the care of ſouls in this place.</p>

WHOEVER has juſt views of eternal things muſt be ſenſible, that in the name of Chriſt to miniſter to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortals, who are ſo intereſted in thoſe things, is the moſt important employ in the world. Accordingly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> a miniſter of the Lord, makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of the matter of his charge, as lying with the greateſt weight on his mind. And however imperfect and unprofitable I have been in the diſcharge of my office, I think I can heartily join him therein. He had his peculiar trials, but they moved him not; for he counted not his life dear unto himſelf, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his arduous truſt, if ſo be he might finiſh his courſe with joy. Theſe laſt words abſtractly, contain matter equally concerning to all chriſtians; which viewed in its ſolemn importance, is enough to ſilence every amuſement, and command the moſt entire atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man. But connected with the following clauſe, they redouble their energy upon that order of men, here perſonated by the venerable Apoſtle.—He receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commiſſion to miniſter in matters relative to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls and things eternal—things weighty enough to cruſh the ſhoulders of Angels, and affect their minds with the deepeſt ſollicitude; as the honour of GOD, and the ſalvation of men, were jointly and ſo greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. An affecting ſenſe of this (as the time drew nigh in which he muſt give an account to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) conſtrains him, as in my text to ſay, <hi>Neither count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017182_0005_0FA073770B6845D8"/>
finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpel of the grace of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>OH how ponderous; how weighty the care of ſouls, on the hearts of faithful miniſters! St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuch lively apprehenſions of this, that death, in whatever form it threaten him, moves him not, if theſe two things may but happily conſpire in his favour, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that his courſe might end with joy, and the Lord Jeſus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him faithful in the miniſtry which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him. The ſummary of which is, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD. To do this, is evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically and faithfully to preach the divine word, not ſhunning to declare the whole counſel of GOD. Conſcious of having ſo done, the Apoſtle is emboldened to make his appeal to the elders of the churches in the words ſucceeding the text. As a dying man, whoſe face he expected they would ſee no more, he calls them to record, that he was pure from the blood of all men; not having ſhunned to declare unto them the whole counſel of GOD. Thus he appeals to their conſciences for witneſs, that without reſervation, in its fulneſs—he had ſet forth the glorious goſpel of GOD's free grace, as he had been directed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>HAD he failed of this—had he legalized the goſpel—had he ſhifted it off from the proper baſis, well might his confidence deſert him: But he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his errand;—had ſincerely teſtified the goſpel
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017182_0006_0FA07377CCBA50E8"/>
of the grace of GOD. Hence we behold the bleſſed Apoſtle poſſeſſed of that ſettled proſpect of finiſhing his courſe with joy; which indeed is the higheſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Saint this ſide Heaven.</p>
            <p>IF we take a look at this world, and the courſe of ungodly men, lo! all that is therein is putrid and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what ſhall their end be! But we behold the courſers to Zion upon their high places; and how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they eſteem all things on earth as dung and droſs, if they may attain to pleaſe GOD, and be accepted of a glorious Chriſt, in the great day of his appearing.</p>
            <p>IN further meditation on the ſacred paſſage before us, I would lead the minds of the audience to conſider;</p>
            <p>THAT every man here in this life hath his courſe.</p>
            <p>THAT this his courſe will certainly be finiſhed, in a ſhort time, either with joy or ſorrow.</p>
            <p>THAT it is of infinite importance to all, ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in life, as that they may finiſh their courſe with joy.</p>
            <p>AND eſpecially miniſters of the goſpel, whoſe great and main buſineſs it is, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD.</p>
            <p>THAT every man here in this life hath his courſe, will not be doubted; but briefly to attend to it.</p>
            <p>THE word <hi>courſe</hi> intimates that ſeries of actions which pertains to any perſon. Every Agent then has his courſe. A man's calling is his courſe; whether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, civil or ſacred; and he that hath no good calling, or employment, neceſſarily has a bad one. That
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017182_0007_0FA073788DD5E690"/>
which a man mainly buſieth himſelf about, is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his courſe. He that is engaged for Heaven, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his thoughts—fixes his mind, and bends his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to know how he may pleaſe GOD, and anſwer the great intent of his being.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jerem. xxx. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me? ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the grand object of every good man's care and ſtudy.<note n="‡" place="bottom">I Cor. ix. 24.</note> 
               <hi>So run that ye may obtain, i. e.</hi> uſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, care and conſtancy in the chriſtian courſe, that you may obtain the prize of glory.</p>
            <p>HE that is engaged for the world bends his courſe that way—mediates, converſes and labours to obtain the enjoyments of it—makes that his ultimate end. Directly oppoſed to this, is that caution of our bleſſed Saviour;<note n="†" place="bottom">John. vi. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAN is a buſy creature, formed for action: And as there is here no continuing city, ſo his life is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a race, and the manner in which he practiſeth his courſe, whether it be good or evil. Which of theſe is ours, is determined by the temper of our hearts. Thus are we taught by our Lord,<note n="§" place="bottom">Matt. xii. 35.</note> 
               <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil treaſure bringeth forth evil things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE great author of the world at firſt placed man in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017182_0008_0FA073794C59D5B0"/>
a very happy ſituation—with his face toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his heart ingeniouſly diſpoſed to holineſs in life and all manner of converſation: But his high hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebellion has turned his face from GOD, and plunged him into a labyrinth of wretchedneſs. Hence that divine order from the Lord of all,<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xii. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Make the tree good.</hi> This neglected, men will inevitably walk in the way of their wicked minds, until they are filled with their own devices.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to obſerve, that whatever be our courſe, it will be finiſhed in a ſhort time, either with joy or ſorrow.</p>
            <p>THIS demands our ſerious thoughtfulneſs. Death is irreſiſtibly ravaging through the four quarters of the world: And <hi>Adam'</hi>s ſons, countleſs, are daily drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the globe:—Yea, the earth itſelf muſt ſoon come to a terrible diſſolution.—All things here below are temporary and tranſient—every courſer muſt ſoon arrive at his term—his days are as a ſhadow—he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth for a little while and then vaniſheth away.</p>
            <p>VAST and infinite things do nearly and moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately concern us all; for we ſtand hard by the ſhore, and as at the very doors of eternity.—Were man's days an hundred years on the earth;—ſtill he has here no abiding place:—The end is by and by:—Time wings its way with ſpeed, and the extremity of our courſe is juſt at hand.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Job. xvi. 22.</note> 
               <hi>When a few years are come I ſhall go the way whence I ſhall not return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017182_0009_0FA0737A0A494530"/>
OUR days on earth muſt indeed be finiſhed ſoon, becauſe our natures are ſo very feeble and ſubject to decay, that upon the leaſt touch they totter to a fall: Our ſinews are not as braſs, nor our bones as iron: We continually feel our natures mortal.—Every pain and every ach in our bones or fleſh, is none other than death knocking at the door—Heralds proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the approach of the king of terrors:—Our days are few—our race is ſhort.—'As an eagle haſteth to her prey, ſo we ſwiftly to our end.'</p>
            <p>O WITH what ſolemnity ſhould our thoughts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate the grand remove from this inch of time, to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eternity!</p>
            <p>IF, paſſing from this world of inconſiſtencies and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, we make proportionate advance towards the manſions in our father's houſe, the proſpect is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully animating and joyful.—But otherwiſe, every ſcene beyond time muſt open with amazing terror: For if GOD's word may be credited, as our courſe is, ſo will be our end.</p>
            <p>IT is moſt evident, and yet ſurprizing, that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men, poſting to eternity, are altogether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned about the courſe they ſteer. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, alas! very many run a mad career—the danger of endleſs ruin hangs on every moment.—But a happy number there are, who being influenced by the ſpirit of GOD, to faith and love, hope and confidence, upon a good foundation, ſhall be ſafe in the arms of immutability—Remove in peace to partake of the fruit of their hope
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017182_0010_0FA0737D38364A10"/>
—the ſalvation of their ſouls—an immortal fullneſs of joy.</p>
            <p>THE Holy Ghoſt is the mover of their courſe—God's word their compaſs, and their haven, realms of bliſs; where mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 10.</note>.—<hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> Such are they who follow the lamb of GOD—they have hope in their death—well may they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in their deſolution. They behold the mark for the prize—rich prize, juſt at hand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Chriſtian, that moveſt thy courſe aright, though briars and thorns were with thee on every ſide; yet thou mayeſt be joyful in paſſing the rugged—gloomy vales, for that thy ſorrows ſhall ſoon have an end, and thine expectations ſhall not be cut off. And will it not joy thee, when arrived to thy father's houſe, to review thy labours in watchings and warrings, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt myſtical, which were yet behind, having in part been filled up in thy pains? Now when thy tears, kept in his bottle, ſhall be poured out for a teſtimony in thy favour; Oh then! How exquiſite the joy! When the Redeemer ſhall bid thee welcome, and wipe away all tears from thine eyes forever!</q> This, to the diſciples of the Lamb, as well as the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wretchedneſs and deſpair to the wicked, is near—very near and certain.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, with the ſtricteſt propriety is it aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—that ſo to conduct in this life, as to finiſh their courſe with joy, is of infinite importance to all.</p>

INDEED, my brethren, it ſhould be the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and buſineſs of life, to ſtudy and learn how to die in peace. No man is poſſeſſed of complete felicity on earth.</p>
            <p>IT was the ſaying of an antient Philoſopher,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Solont</hi>
               </note> that he could not pronounce a man happy, until he knew how he died. And by divine revelation, we are more abundantly certified of this truth; that he only is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who is found ready to depart and die, when his Lord ſhall call for him.</p>
            <p>'HE that ſecures the good part, and reaches the true evidence of his heavenly father's love; a ponderous crown of life is his ſure and everlaſting portion—He knows his Redeemer liveth, and as he liveth in Chriſt, ſo death appears without a ſting; and his ſoul is full of longings to depart and be with him.'</p>
            <p>OH! thrice happy man, whoſe lamp burns bright at the midnight of death.</p>
            <p>IT is without diſpute, that the prize of our high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Jeſus Chriſt, is infinitely worthy of the intenſe care and ſtrenuous purſuit of every man. Surprizing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrange therefore, that the generality of mankind ſhould be ſo indifferent to, and ſo negligent of, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable part!—Paſſing ſwiftly to worlds of joy or woe, that they ſhould be ſo entirely thoughtleſs to which they go! Oh that the ſpirit of the living GOD might effectually move upon their hearts; that, while time continues, they might awake from their deluſive ſlumbers—ariſe from the dead, and become living, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017182_0012_0FA0737E8CC26B20"/>
inſtruments of GOD's glory, and finally partakers of the happineſs which flows from his preſence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, that any one (realizing his immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſhould not deſire to<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxiii. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Die the death of the righteous, and ſhat his laſt and might be like his?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT what are the neceſſary prerequiſites to a joyful exit? In brief, they are ſuch as ſanctification by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſpirit—or a renewal and change of the temper of our hearts—or a being born again. As we all have partook of the corruption of nature by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> which expoſes to complete wretchedneſs; ſo every man, to become an heir of eternal glory, muſt partake of a renovation of mind, according to the image of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE bliſſful Heaven of GOD's preſence, can be no place for the unſanctified and unholy.—<hi>The carnal mind is enmity to</hi> GOD. Hence the abſolute neceſſity of that ſanctification by the ſpirit of GOD; which conforms us to his divine likeneſs, and influences to the exerciſes of thoſe graces, and the performance of thoſe duties, eſſential to the Chriſtian character, that we may finiſh our courſe with joy. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> We ſhall therefore find the neceſſity of repentence towards GOD, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; love to the divine character, perfections, laws and government; and benevolence to creatures; accompanied, with increaſing affection to things ſpiritual, which are above; and proportionate
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017182_0013_0FA0737F4F9FF060"/>
indifference to, and diſengagedneſs from the leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, trifling and comparatively ſmall objects and enjoyments of the preſent world.</p>
            <p>ACCOMPANIED, with prayerfulneſs, watchfulneſs, activity, diligence and perſeverance in the diſcharge of the duties of life—duties which reſpect GOD, our neighbour and ourſelves. We muſt do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly before GOD, &amp;c. in order to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; which ſeat of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted happineſs will not be indulged us, on account of any deeds in us, meriting GOD's favour, but ſolely for the prevailing merits of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, grand medium, and end of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH none will obtain eternal life for, or on account of, the exerciſe and performance of Chriſtian graces and duties; yet all, who from right principles obey, ſhall through the infinite mediator, finiſh their courſe with joy, and obtain a happy admiſſion to glory: When, thoſe of a contrary character, who practiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, ſhall be miſerably excluded the realms of bliſſful immortality.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his</hi> GOD <hi>and he ſhall be my ſon. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and ſocerers, and idolaters, and all liars, ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Whoever, therefore, would wiſh to have his ſun ſerene and bright, (when the dark curtains of death
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017182_0014_0FA073800CAC3788"/>
are gathering about him) and his eternity bleſſed, let him be holy in heart, in life, and in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. This, without a laboured proof, appears to be of infinite importance to every man: But parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and very eſpecially.</p>
            <p>TO Miniſters of the Goſpel, whoſe great and main buſineſs it is, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD, <hi>i. e.</hi> the goſpel wherein the grace of GOD is publiſhed to a fallen, periſhing world.</p>
            <p>As the doctrines of this goſpel are infinitely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to men, ſo the genuine and faithful preaching them is here conſidered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a matter of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance to himſelf, and others in the miniſtry; a number of which, he now had an interview with. He intimates to them, that to bear a due teſtimony to the doctrines of GOD's free grace (for which he was aware, the legalizing Jews would furiouſly perſecute him) was much dearer to him than life. Therefore, he was determined to publiſh the grace of GOD, bear witneſs to the truth of it, and proſecute his important errand, although it ſhould prove to the peril of his life.</p>
            <p>THE grace of GOD here mentioned, intimates the free and eternal love of GOD exhibited in the way of the new covenant.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the tenor of the firſt covenant, fallen man muſt neceſſarily relinquiſh all claim to the favour of GOD: The plan of the new covenant, on which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, man can become a partaker of forfeited happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is wholly founded in grace. The gift of GOD's
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017182_0015_0FA07380CCCEC730"/>
dear ſon to a ruined world, is entirely the reſult of pure, free, rich and ſovereign grace. Herein are diſplayed the aſtoniſhing wonders of the father's love; giving the immaculate ſon, to become a ſacrifice to divine juſtice, that rebels might be redeemed to GOD.</p>
            <p>As the purchaſe was free, ſo is the beſtowment of that grace which bringeth ſalvation—the grace of GOD.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. i. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER, the grace of GOD intends the free impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; on account of which believers are reputed righteous in the ſight of GOD.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 26.</note> 
               <hi>To declare I ſay at this time his righteouſneſs; that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, by the grace of GOD is deſigned the work of the ſpirit in believers.</p>
            <p>ALL the righteouſneſs that is wrought in them, or by them, is the fruit of grace. From firſt to laſt, from the foundation to the topſtone of our ſalvation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to cry, grace—grace unto it. Yet the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the free grace of GOD wherein we ſtand, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meet with unreaſonable treatment. The pride of the depraved heart can by no means reliſh thoſe ſoul humbling doctrines of the goſpel, which place the ſinner at GOD's foot, as helpleſs and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in himſelf: Which bind him to the methods of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017182_0016_0FA073818FD75410"/>
ſovereign grace, and ſhut him up to the faith of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for ſalvation: Which deny to the creature the honor of procuring his happineſs, and attribute the whole glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Jehovah: Which beſpeak the whole oeconomy of redemption, the wonderous work of GOD. Hence, at the preſent day, ſuch as teſtify the free grace of GOD, are by many, deemed ſtupid and irrational—treated with ſcorn and contempt, as though babblers and fools.</p>
            <p>BUT, as all religion which is evangelical and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, ſtands upon this baſis (the grace of GOD) ſo it muſt be inſiſted on and teſtified. This is the goſpel which muſt be preached to every creature, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Bleſſed be GOD, it is well atteſted, and therefore may be boldly teſtified.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel makes full proof, that being juſtified freely by his grace, we have peace with GOD, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THEIR'S is another goſpel than that of GOD our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is not founded on the free grace of GOD. This is the only way in which our reſtoration to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs can poſſibly be accompliſhed. Wherefore, for a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to believe, preach, practiſe and teſtify this goſpel of the grace of GOD, is the only way to fulful his miniſtry, to ſave himſelf and them that hear him.</p>
            <p>MINISTERS of the goſpel are ſtiled Stewards; and as they are by Jeſus entruſted with the charge of his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017182_0017_0FA073824C3C5AD0"/>
oracles, ordinances, and the ſouls of men; to him they muſt give an account of their ſtewardſhip; and how aggravatedly terrible their doom, if they corrupt the word of GOD! conceal divine truth! daub with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar! few pillows under arm-holes! diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the peace of the church! waſte their time! abuſe talents!—or miſimprove opportunities, to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or inſignificant purpoſes!</p>
            <p>On the other hand, ſhould they faithfully keep the truſt committed to them: Should they ſincerely ſerve the Lord Jeſus, in a buſy, careful, pleaſing attention to the matters of his family—the great affairs of his church and kingdom; how joyfully may they expect to finiſh their courſe, and the miniſtry which they have received of the Lord! How rich will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of divine grace upon them, who have faithfully teſtified the goſpel of the grace of GOD! They ſhall be graciouſly owned of their Lord, in the great day of his appearing; and with conſummate glory enter into their maſter's joy. All important then is it to them, that they ſo conduct in life—in their miniſtry, as that approbation and joy may attend the completion of both.</p>
            <p>TO CLOSE THE SUBJECT—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My dear Friends,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS it not ſuitable, while reflecting on what has been offered, and may it not be very advantageous, in an impartial, critical, ſolemn manner, to examine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and prove whether we be in the faith? of that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017182_0018_0FA073830A545538"/>
happy number, who are not greatly moved at any of the trying ſcenes of time, but prepared to finiſh their courſe with joy?</p>
            <p>IT can not be otherwiſe, than a moſt concerning, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, intereſting affair, to know how we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the gracious offers and tenders of the goſpel of the grace of GOD—whether in vain. Recollect that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar declaration of GOD our ſaviour;<note n="*" place="bottom">John iii. 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel of GOD's free grace hath been preached and teſtified to us: To reflect then, that we have ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contemned, or neglected it, may well ſtrike us with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>LET us all call ourſelves to account, and put the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn query, how we have believed and practiſed;—impartially enquire what effect the goſpel of divine grace hath had on our hearts and lives; what we have been doing in the world; and whether, we are now bending our courſe.</p>
            <p>IT will ſoon terminate in joy or ſorrow—What are the paths in which we walk? What is the main ſtudy and buſineſs of life? He that believeth, and endureth
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017182_0019_0FA07383CC396500"/>
to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, but practiſeth iniquity, ſhall be damned—muſt finiſh his courſe in miſery.</p>
            <p>LET every one, critically ſearch his heart, and try his own ways; knowing that in a very ſhort time, his ſtewardſhip will be ended, and his preſent ſtate of trial be reſolved into a ſtate of eternal retribution.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, let us behave as men, who are truly concerned for the honour of GOD and the welfare of our immortal ſouls; and who have received the grace of GOD not in vain, but to holineſs of life. And by all means be careful, that we make full proof of the reality of our high calling in Chriſt Jeſus, by all goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obedience.</p>
            <p>IF this wiſdom have a reſidence in our hearts; if this underſtanding be pleaſant to our ſouls, it ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep us.</p>
            <p>NOW is the time, if we would work the work of GOD: Now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of ſalvation; and on the wiſe improvement of it, much depends, even our happineſs in death, and forever.</p>
            <p>LET us look well to this, that we believingly, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and thankfully entertain the teſtimony of GOD's free grace, as manifeſtly exhibited, in the goſpel of his dear ſon; wherein rich and full proviſion is made for the happineſs and glory of the moſt unworthy and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the human race. Bleſſed are they who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs: Who rely on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017182_0020_0FA0738491B13C60"/>
and grace of GOD's ſpirit, to direct, ſtrengthen and conform them to the image of his ſon: That growing up into his likeneſs, they might be to the praiſe of him who hath called them: The happy trophies of redeeming love.</p>
            <p>LET it be the ſolemn concern of every ſoul—to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves—take up the croſs and follow after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.—To deny, all ungodlineſs and every world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſt—to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent evil world:—that they may evidence the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of him who invites them to his kingdom and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As a means of incitement to this, let us keep in view the end of our courſe—the ſolemn account we are to give, to the Judge of quick and dead, of every thought and word, and all the actions done here in the body—The fearful ſituation of a Chriſtleſs ſinner, at the verge of life, having rejected the counſel of GOD againſt his own ſoul. Had he not refuſed the gracious tenders of reconciliation, pardon and peace, he might have been a ſaint in Heaven: But he would not come to Chriſt that he might have life: And what can he now expect, but to ſuffer the juſt rewards of his folly and madneſs! O wretched his ſtate!</p>
            <p>ON the other hand how unſpeakable the joy, of a child of GOD, with clear and raviſhing views of the better world—ſenſible that he is returning to his father's houſe—the manſions of bliſs made ready by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Jeſus for all his followers!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:017182_0021_0FA073872CE9F490"/>
O THRICE happy!—eternally happy man!—paſſing the dark valley of the ſhadow of death, he fears no evil—he claſps, in the affections of his heart, the true ſaviour of men; who has become his ſtrength, light, life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>AND now, as the goſpel miniſtry is the moſt ſolemn, important and intereſting employment; with what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable weight muſt it ly upon the hearts of thoſe who are faithfully engaged therein, that they may be pure from the blood of all men, not ſhunning to declare the whole counſel of GOD!</p>
            <p>THEIR ſpecial buſineſs (as has been obſerved) is to publiſh ſalvation—to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD—to put away falſe confidences from the proud hearts of man—to open blind eyes, and turn men (if poſſible) from their courſes of ungodlineſs—to paint and preſent virtue and piety, in the moſt amiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to the mind, as grounded in the love of GOD, and the divine conſtraints of free and ſovereign grace.</p>
            <p>HAVING performed ſo arduous an employ—ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for advancing the divine glory, and ſo condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to human happineſs—Having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful; with what compoſure, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and joy, may ſuch an one finiſh his courſe?

            </p>
            <p>SUFFER me to add here, that it ſhould be often thought of, and may well ſerve to animate the zeal of a Miniſter, and excite the cloſe, affectionate attention of a people, to conſider that they muſt ſhortly part; ſee the faces, and hear the voices of each other, no more, for ever.

            <p>REALIZING myſelf on the edge of time, I have this comfortable review of my miniſterial courſe (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſſful or unſucceſſful) that I have not <hi>ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſel of</hi> GOD. That I have ſincerely endeavoured to ſerve the glorious cauſe

of my dear Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt: And if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to gain every ſoul to the knowledge and love of the truth: I have laboured to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD; and have been urging upon you the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of the fullneſs of grace in Chriſt Jeſus, for every one, willing to accept the offered ſalvation.</p>
            <p>IT is true I have been with you in much weakneſs and fear: I gratefully remember your kindneſſes: I feel the warmeſt deſires for your ſalvation. But alas! how little attention is paid to the all-important concerns of religion: It affects me with bitter grief to obſerve the apparent decay of it—That ſo few are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to GOD.</p>
            <p>IT would give me ſurprizing joy, to behold the ſymptoms of the grace of GOD taking place in all your hearts; and true piety reviving amongſt you, once more before I die.</p>
            <p>I CAN never forget my vehement ſtruggles at the throne of grace, juſt before I was here ordained a Paſtor, leſt I ſhould fail of ſucceſs among this people; when GOD was pleaſed to afford ſome comfortable proſpects: And to my particular ſatiſfaction, within five years 81 members were added to this church (at that time 49 in number) although the people here were then but comparatively few.<note n="*" place="bottom">The people of Sutton embodied and acted as a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety on December 3d, 1718, for the firſt time; although a few families had inhabited it ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

            <p>WHO then? O who of you are on the Lord's ſide, and determined, in prayer, to ſeek the face of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty GOD of <hi>Jacob?</hi> The gates of Zion tremble.—New-England never ſaw ſuch a day as this—The glory is departed.</p>
            <p>THE United, American States, this moment are in a critical ſituation. Have we not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> relied on an arm of fleſh? Have we not put too great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in men and means? None hath an arm like GOD. Why therefore do we reſtrain prayer before him? O ye who fear the Lord, let us unite, and ſocially, and often ſupplicate favour of the GOD of Heaven. And will not the Lord hearken and reform his people? For when Zion travailed, ſhe brought forth children. Be the bones ever ſo dry, the quickning ſpirit of the Almighty can animate and raiſe them up: And then ſhall Heaven and earth exalt his praiſe.</p>
            <p>THE day is gloomy—troubles, diſtreſſes and trials are on every ſide. We <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

of America. But could I diſcern the clear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of piety, and of a revival of religion, my joy would be great.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to external changes, I think I can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay—none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
