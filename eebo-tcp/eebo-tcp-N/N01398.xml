            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> In general my Advice is to you, That in good order &amp; with all Gracefulneſs which becomes Wiſe Men, you will with Zeal, Courage and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs, Stand in the Defence of and Maintain your <hi>Church Libertys</hi>; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the diſcretion and bravery of Spirit, which becomes free-men, in withſtanding Vaſſalage or a Servile State, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5 1.13. <hi>Stand faſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the</hi> Liberties, <hi>wherewith Chriſt was made us free, and be not Intangled again with the Yok of Bondage:</hi> The Plea is as forcible againſt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as a <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Thraldom.</hi> For <hi>Brethren,</hi> ye have been called unto <hi>Liberty.</hi> I muſt acknowledge I have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prejudice againſt any of the Governments of Chriſtian Proteſtant Churches in the World, ſo as to defraud or diſpoſseſs any of them of Heaven; or Monopolize ſo great a Royalty to our own;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001660_0011_0FB4D7B9451CF5C0"/>
But yet I am of this opinion, conſidering the juſt Title of the Crown, the Churches, the People, the Capacity of Soil and Climate together, That the Conſtitution and Way of <hi>New-England</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cannot be mended by Exchange.</p>
            <p>Briefly to Inſtance in the Civil part, or Intereſt of the Crown, <hi>I</hi> think it is very eaſie to evince, by the Precepts both of Religion and Policy, That the Parliament (that wiſe and Auguſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Nation) could not have invented an Eſtabliſhment in Church Order, more for the ſervice of the Imperial Crown of the Britiſh Empire than our preſent Conſtitution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch a Country and Climate as this is.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now any ways enter upon the Queſtion, but only give juſt a ſhort hint as to the Revenue. Our Preſent Conſtitution does indeed, ſome-what more then Sip; It takes an honeſt Healthful Draught at Natures Fountains, but leaves the flowing ſtreams for Empire to ſit at till filled with ſaciety.</p>
            <p>The Eccleſiaſticks in ſome Kingdoms in <hi>Europe</hi> are ready not only to chide with <hi>Crowned heads,</hi> but to take them by the throat, and wring out of hands, if not almoſt a Moity, yet a vaſt ſhare of the golden Fleeces that ſhould ſupply the Publick Treaſuries, and cloath the Nakedneſs of the Kingdoms, and the People have no more wit but to Juſtifie and defend them in their Claims and Oppreſſions, and that till they themſelves (in great Numbers) are as thin and raged as Penury it ſelf; for by their Rules of adjuſtment, when the Church hath gotten an Unconſcionable ſhare, Then the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001660_0012_0FB4D7BACC370788"/>
Crown or Subject muſt be almoſt ſtarved; for there is not left a ſufficient and plentiful ſupply for both.</p>
            <p>But now our <hi>New-England</hi> Conſtitution is very fair-mannered; for when it ſits down to the Staled Ox (made ready) it carves Temperately and (wit-hout much Defacing) Leaves the whole to Empire to make its Armies and Navies, with the reſt of its needful and unwearied Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wellcome. That in Loyalty to your Prince, and for the ſupport of the Royal Revenue, you may Juſtly preſerve your Freedoms.</p>
            <p>Let us alſo Conſider the beſt Good of a whole People.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, true Grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Powers both of Prince, Noble and Peaſant, and tho' Grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a faſhion and in ſome ſort of ſoil) almoſt under any Government, Yet it is moſt agreeable with Laws of Piety and Wiſdom (for the good of all in general (to chuſe and ſecure that Conſtitution and form of Government that is moſt a greeable, and which moſt naturally breeds it, and in greateſt Plenty.</p>
            <p>By the ſuffrage of our Nation, that Government which ſenſibly Clogs Tyranny, and Preſerves the Subject free from ſlavery, under the ambition of men of great Fortune and Truſt, is the only Goverment in the <hi>ſtate,</hi> to advance mens tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Happineſs; and we in the Country Honour the Reſolve in Civil Affairs, and alſo affirm (upon great Experience) that ſuch a Conſtitution
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001660_0013_0FB4D7BC4918B858"/>
in Church Government is (alſo) the only way to advance Grace and mans Eternal Happineſs; and we are the more Ratifyed in our Opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tryed, with a Witneſs, in almoſt all Kingdoms of the Chriſtian World, and the <hi>firſt,</hi> by Diſſeiſing the Fraternity of all Intereſt in Church Goverment, only they have had the liberty to be Governed with a Hook in their Noſe (like wild Cattle in a ſtring) by the mercy and pleaſure of their Drivers; but as for any ſhare in the Exerciſe of Goverment, they have had no more, than the Horſes in the Royal Stables, for that their Spiritual Owners having Seiſed all the Keys of Church Power, they profeſs no <hi>Dividend</hi> ſhall be made, and alſo they themſelves being Uncontroulable by any, and unaccountable to any, unleſs it be to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as they pretend; Tho' I believe, thouſands of them never Expect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any Accompts of theirs.</p>
            <p>But however, for the comfort and glory of the Preſent Life, the whole Government of the Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Kingdom, in all its Branches, and with its Immenſe Profits, has Eſtabliſhed theirs. But this ſort of Diſcipline, hath ſunk great part of the Chriſtian World, as many times over, as Ages have paſt, ſince it hath been Intailed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Rector,</hi> and where it hath kept abſolute poſſeſſion of the Throne.</p>
            <p>And muſt the Waves and preſent Currants fit and waſte theſe Churches towards thoſe Rocks and ſhip-wracks, whilſt we have ſuch good hands and Pilots on board? God forbid!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001660_0014_0FB4D7BDC5356B78"/>Therefore let theſe Churches and the noble Fraternity of them, Stand their Ground, Keep faſt hold of what you got, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown.</hi>
            </p>

It is moſt apparent through the whole Miniſtry of the World (unleſs in abſolute Monarchies) that it is the duty of all Publick officers to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter according to the plain Rules of the Publick ſtate, and not by their own Phancy or Wills, and ſo in this caſe, the chief Ruling Officers (then in being) <hi>In point of Conduct are obliged to lead the Church</hi> in their Operations, according to the Churches plain and ſettled Principles, And not reluct becauſe their own perſwaſions do otherwiſe incline them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001660_0025_0FB4D7D084E7F370"/>
It is now plainly too late for any Officer to pretend Conſcince againſt Eſtabliſhed Rules: This Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſhould have been made before they had taken Office. But now it is out of Seaſon, for they were Elected and Ordained to Govern the Church not by their own thoughts, as the Rule, but by the <hi>Churches</hi> Cannon, and that by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when they took Office. And moreover, this is moſt evident, that if ſuch Powers which belong to the inſide of mens being, <hi>viz.</hi> their Hearts, Phanſies, Notions, Judgments, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Conſciences, call them by what names you pleaſe, or let the Owners freely fix the Titles (the odds is not great) Now if theſe are to be the Rule of Churches, then Paſtors and Ruling Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have (in their degree) as abſolute a Dominion over the Churches, as the great <hi>Turke</hi> has over his Baſhaws, and other Vaſſals.</p>
                  <p>But I hope, none here will claim this Dominion. And if not, then let Paſtors and Teachers do their Duty in point of Conduct (if the Churches are not Remiſs in theirs) and this great vacancy may be ſoon ſupplyed, and there is alſo a Relief for Officers, if their juſt prerogatives are any ways toucht by the the Traverſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> To Confine the diſcourſe to this preſent Example, and to ſhorten terms, for brevities ſake, it muſt be granted, that any perticular Officer ſenſible of his duty, that ſhall undertake to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and lead the Church, in the Election and choice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This makes the caſe very eaſy in point of Conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, tho' other Officers in the ſame
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001660_0026_0FB4D7D2EDFC6A48"/>
Church ſhould either oppoſe or not act. For that any one Officer in a Church, where there may be many of the ſame nature, he himſelf is vertually the whole Colledge of Officers in any Office-Act that he performs without them. As in civil Affairs, a particular Executor ſo far ſuſtains the whole Executorſhip, as that he can make a vallid Act in that Miniſtry, though many others are joyned with him in the ſame Teſtament, &amp; yet don't nor won't Act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their Truſt; which Principle is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the nature of a joynt Tenancy in general, and in a joynt Truſt in particular, held by many Equals.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The caſe is very difficult when the ſtanding Officers joyn as one man, and will not guide the Church in theſe Elections referred to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I muſt needs ſay, I fear here has been the great bar to this Office.</p>
                  <p>We may from Intereſt, as well as Duty, Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppoſe the Inclinations of the Churches, and the deſires of many of them have been made known by repeated &amp; honorable Solicitations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſaying to <hi>Arcipus, Fulfill thy Miniſtry Co.</hi> 4.17. &amp; we may alſo affirm, the Principle is plain, the Office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of Divine <hi>Original.</hi> but however this is certain, it is a formal eſtabliſhment by theſe Churches, and not now to be Diſputed. Yet the Officers pretend, they ſee no Reaſon to give way to the Churches Deſire or Demands, neither will the conduct in this Caſe, though their Duty does oblige, that ſo
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001660_0027_0FB4D7D444F68200"/>
the Church may be compleated in its Officers; No! they are pleaſed by Acts of a Superintending Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to lock the Church Door, and turn this Key againſt the Office, and no Pleas or Perſwaſions can alter their reſolutions. But hereby the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do plainly abdicate their Office, by changing the Acts of a limited truſt, bounded by precept into what is meerly Abitrary; ſo in a Decree, they break up the Relation between themſelves and the Church, And by ſuch an Eſſential Error ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Churches Charter and their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they forfeit all at once, though Lenity and Mercy may favour them with a long life; Yet in the Eye of Juſtice they are Dead men, if not in nature yet in Law, And upon their <hi>OBSTINACY</hi> may juſtly be <hi>DEGRADED.</hi> Therefore in ſuch a caſe, when it comes to that Extremity, the Churches may and ought to call in Council and <hi>Proceed in their work and Duty for their own Well being,</hi> after the manner of an Inorganick <hi>Church Platform, Chap.</hi> 10 and this I need not ſtand to diſcribe, our Plat-form, The Laws of the Province and the Practice of the Churches in other Caſes, and vacancies will do it.</p>
                  <p>Then whether theſe Congregational Churches thro' theſe Provinces may not juſtly reflect Blame upon themſelves, for too Supine and negligent a frame of Spirit, towards ſo Great an Intereſt, and ſo noble an Office, ſeeing they have ſuch a ſhare in Government, and can fairly Reſcue themſelves and their own Rights, by the Power and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their own Eſſence, when their other Officers neglect Duty?</p>

                  <hi>THat you will pleaſe to Reviſe the ſtudy (and in order to it) a New impreſſion of your</hi> Plat-form.</p>
               <p>It is very uſual for many Gentlemen in your Country, Landed men, and men of Eſtates, every man to keep his Law-Book by him, as his Bible, the Bible for the ſolace of his Mind, and the Law-Book for the ſafety of his Eſtate, that upon any Defamation of Title, or other Incroachments, when his Lands and Properties are in hazard, he may know whither to repair for his Direction, and how to make his Defence. And ſo methinks it ſhould be with the Members of the Churches, as to their ſtated Rights by their Cannon Law! That there ſhould be a kind of a Penalty (if the hazard in ſuch a defect be not puniſhment enough) on ſuch Delinquents, as live Members of Chriſts viſible Kingdom here, and yet live without the <hi>Plat-Form,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Political Charter of theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs ſay, and I wiſh I could whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it ſo low that the Echo might never Rebound to <hi>Gath</hi> or <hi>Askelon,</hi> and yet be diſtinctly heard thro' theſe Churches) That I fear the Impreſſion of the <hi>Platform</hi> is almoſt Extinct, if not quite worn out in the Country. And that as it was ſaid in the day of Battle, under King <hi>Saul, that there was neither ſword nor ſpear found in the hand of any of the People,</hi> ſo here, tho' your Bible, which is the ſword of the ſpirit, is in every mans hand
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001660_0029_0FB4DA44003B0178"/>
yet poſſibly, this Spear or neceſſary weapon, in the defence of your Goſpel Liberties, is ſcarce to be found in the hands of one in a Thouſand, thro' all the hoſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I do therefore adviſe my Country, and theſe Churches, to furniſh your ſelves, and that you would encourage the Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in this Deſign, and they can ſoon Recruit you. <hi>My Honourable and Deareſt Friends</hi>!</p>
               <p>If we are puſh't on to Battle, and our Weapons then in the Oar, we may Juſtly ſuſpect we ſhall be but too eaſy and cheap a Conqueſt for Aſſailants. Therefore furniſh your ſelves in good time with this piece of Artillary, that you may be well fixt and equipt for Service.</p>
               <p>Don't you hear from the top of yonder Proud and Lofty Mountain, the Enemies Trumpets, and their Drums Beating a Preparative?

            <p>THe Nobleneſs of Parentage, by the Laws of Honour, entales on Poſterity (with other Rights) a protection from all incivilities, but not from the auſtere Demands of Juſtice, when that is affronted and violated. Juſtice keeping the Golden Rule (<hi>Quo dat Suum Cuique</hi>) obſerves no other Deſtinctions, than what it firſt makes in its Diſtributions amongſt the Rich and Poor, the Noble and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, it is no Reſpecter of Perſons, for that it is Superiour to all men, and ſits as a veiled Empreſs holding the Ballance to weigh out equal to each one according to the Merits of the cauſe, and ſees no man.</p>
            <p>There being now under Cogniſance, ſuch as are of honourable Families, yet arreſted and brought by due courſe of Law to <hi>Anſwer for high Crimes,</hi> it muſt not be ſuppoſed Rudeneſs in Manners, though they be ſome-what freely and Ruſly handled, whilſt the proſecution is held agreeable with the Impeachment and Rule of Juſtice.

my ſelf, who am under Commiſſion from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to appear in Defence of my Countries Sacred Liberties, <hi>I</hi> can in my own Juſtification, affirm, That I have no diſhonourable Inclinations, but carry a Juſt mind, ſo as to Condemn no Man or thing, but upon plain evidence, nor to agravate any Plea beyond its juſt Bounds.</p>
            <p>Therefore, tho' in the following pages there may be diſcerned a great Liberty in Argument, with a mixture of Satyres, as tho' none by my Inferiours were Involved in the Charge, Yet aſcribe it unto my love and veneration for ſo great an Intereſt as I appear for, and not to any baſe intent of ſinking the honour or darkning the Luſter of better Men. I neither deſire nor deſign to hurt any Man, No, not ſo much as an hair on his head, but <hi>I</hi> Solely aim at ERROR, that is the But <hi>I</hi> Level for.</p>
            <p>Thus having by this brief, but ſincere Apology ſecured the Honour of my Intentions, if I am worthy of belief, I ſhall no longer interrupt the Proceſs, but ſhall <hi>nextly,</hi> draw up the Indictment, upon which theſe Propoſals are to paſs, and abide a Tryal.</p>

uſual forms of Tryal in the Prologue of their Diſsolution; for they have been certainly great and good Servants to the Publick, that if they deſerve to dye, they ought to dye under all the Marks of Honour which Juſtice can allow of, at the leaſt a Grand Sesſions, a Jury and Liberty to make Plea in their Own Defence, and under the Influence of Royal Council, ſhould have been Granted, unleſs they may be treated as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours ſerve unfortunate Pyrates, who when taken, are without form of Law hung up at the Yards Arm.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whether it be not great Boldneſs for any particular Gentlemen to Invade, null, Alter or Weaken ſo great a Right and Propriety, as is the Government of theſe Churches without their Conſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Government is the greateſt Bleſſing in the World of of a worldy Nature; it is Felony, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by far to the Looſers to plunder men of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001660_0040_0FB4DA7C23CC17D0"/>
their Eſtate and wealth, nay, and of their Lives too then to diſpoyl them of Government; for by the latter, you haraſs and worry them in the world, with Plagues and miſeries, worſe then death it ſelf, that the baſeſt is far better, then no Government; a churliſh Tyranny, is better then an Inſolent Anarchy, when men are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, and all <hi>hail Fellows,</hi> not well but badly met. And for men to alter or warp Government, without all Intereſted parties are agreed, is a very bold Intruſion.</p>
               <p>That, yea, that Government which is in any good meaſure formed, and dos agree with the nature freedom of Humane Beings, and adjuſted by the Laws of wiſdome and Honour, and plain inly, and fairly Eſtabliſhed, is too much of God in the world, and too Great a Royalty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to men, for any to play the Knave or Fool with.</p>
               <p>And when a Government hath done all things in the main well, and has Reapt in a great Stock of Bleſſings, now to Shuffle it out of Place, is Fickleneſs, and not Policy; for a ſenſible Series of Blesſings will always attone for ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Defects in a Conſtitution. Therefore when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> met at <hi>Ramah,</hi> in a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to alter their Conſular Government, which had been Crowned with Signal Bleſſings, they got ill will in the Court of Heaven for it, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.</p>
               <p>The great ſucceſs which attended, ſignified it to be a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> and that it had more of God
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001660_0041_0FB4DA7D4CFFED38"/>
than of man in it, which is an Argument (<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Paribus</hi>) for all other Governments, and ſo for this of <hi>New-England Churches,</hi> which has been Honoured with great ſucceſs, and many Bleſſings from its Beginnings to this day; therefore well does Mr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> deſcribe the Subject, and adviſe his Country, in his laſt Sermon on the <hi>Street of Gold,</hi> ſays he (in a Remarkable paſſage out of a letter) pag. 40 <hi>Here is a Temple Built, more Glorious then</hi> Solomon's, <hi>not of dead Stones, but living Saints, which may tempt the Greatest Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>to come and See, and allure even Kings from far to come and worſhip in. Therefore, as to their Government</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Sirs, do not Spoil it, Oh, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy is not! There is a Blesſing in it.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. To the more Critical Examination of the <hi>Propoſals</hi> themſelves, which I ſhall Attend,
<list>
                     <item>1. More Generally.</item>
                     <item>2. More particularly, by taking a ſurvey of them in their diſtinct Sections.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. More Generally, by Inquiring into their Original, and nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By making a more Exact Inqueſt and ſearch after their Original, and in this debate they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Eſſence, unleſs they can derive their Eſſence, unleſs they can derive their Pedigree, either</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Gods Immediate Inſpiration. Or,</p>

               <p n="4">4. From the <hi>Platform</hi> of the Churches, which is a ſyſtim of Government, collected by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors out of ſeveral Fountains, and Principally from the Scriptures. Now in purſuing this Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, I ſhall diligently enquire, whether we can hear of their Original under any of theſe heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Immediate Inſpiration, I muſt needs preſume, theſe Gentlemen will not dare to Aſſert, that they are ſent Immediately from God with this Meſſage to the Churches; they are too good and wiſe to pretend (with <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi>) to Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Viſion, or a ſpirit of Prophecy; both the matter and manner of their writing ſufficiently convinces, that theſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> are their own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; they durſt not put, a <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD</hi> upon them; ſuch on Inſcription is too Heavenly and Royal for ſuch Coyn: for both they and we know, according to <hi>Dut.</hi> 30.12. it is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may know and do it? there is no need to ſend Meſsengers to that Court, to learn by Immediate and Extraordinary Information, either the Laws of our Duty or Intereſt; for that God hath made all things ſufficiently plain, by this Time of day, either by Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the Conduct and Government of his Churches, yea, of the ſubjects of his Univerſal
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001660_0045_0FB4DA90D4809C88"/>
Intellectual MONARCHY in this World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Antient Revelation; Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that beſt, tho' not the bigeſt of Books, is the ſaints Library, and the Clergy-mans Pandects, whence he takes the Rules for the Mannagment of his Truſt; ſo that it is very Amuſing that the Bible ſhould be forgotten in Drawing up ſuch Schemes as theſe; as tho' the uſage of the Popes Conclave, which turns the Bible out of doors for a Wrangler, and gives the chief Seal to Tradition, &amp;c. were here in faſhion. Indeed, I cannot but eſteem them very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Propoſals to be turned ſo naked into the World, as not to have the leaſt tincture of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Gaurd them from Contempt; no, not ſo much as a Citation, that might admit of ſo much as a ſtrained Conſequence in their Defence. And ſo, tho' leſs Prophane, yet they are alſo leſs Politick then the moſt deſperate of Hereticks, who alwayes bring their Errors on the ſtage guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Scriptures, and craftily Indeavour to make their Citations look with ſuch an aſpect, as tho' they were encampt on their ſide. But here we have nothing for our Faith to lean on, but ſo many auſterer <hi>Ipſe Dixits,</hi> as bitter Pills of Death for the Churches to Swallow, without any of the Confection of Heaven or the Sweet Manna Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon them; or elſe only ſo many naked Humane Perſumptions, as Arrows or Bolts, too Raſhly ſhot out againſt the ſides of our Churches, and no word of Scripture to Tip or feather them. Nay, it is very Memorable, and I account fatal,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001660_0046_0FB4DA9264D031C0"/>
and to be obſerved, that GOD, that ſecret Title of the Almighty, with which the Holy Scripture does ſo abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole Treatiſe; as tho' the moſt ſacred Titles, as well as Sections of that heavenly Book, would move Fears and irritate Jealouſies, rather then pouer down Solace and Comfort upon this Undertaking. Therefore, in a word, the whole Bible is thrown by as a Sealed Parchment, or as one that never Prophecies good to ſuch Adventurers. Therefore theſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> being apprehended as Sea Rovers, and Indicted upon the <hi>ſtatute of Pyracy,</hi> and upon Examination being found without the Prince of Princes Colours and yet doing great miſchief, in Aſſaulting and Wounding his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Lawful Subjects, on their honeſt occaſion, being bound on a Voyage to their own Country, they can no ways in Juſtice eſcape, but muſt Paſs under the Sentence, and endure the Pains of Death, for they were taken Fighting without Commiſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As to REASONS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Recta Ratio,</hi> Right Reaſon, that great Oracle in Humane Affairs is the Soul of Man, ſo formed or endowed by Creation with a certain Sagacity or Acumen (in many perticular Examples ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the conſtitution of nature, by Grace and ſtudy) whereby mans Intellect is inabled to take up (<hi>pro Medulo</hi> or in a degree) the true Idea or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of things, agreeable with and according
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001660_0047_0FB4DA9BB3D4BCE0"/>
to their Natures. So that if we bring theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals under Examination by the Laws of Reaſon, we muſt enquire whether they are agreeable with the nature and Conſtitution of the Churches, if they fully harmonize with their Principles of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then they may be enroled for Canons; but if they Jar and are plainly Repugnant, we may then Lawfully cenſure them, and pronounce them Irrational. Whether theſe Churches are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Scripture or Reaſon, yea or no, that is not our Queſtion, but being of ſuch a Frame or Conſtitution, as they now are, and always have been, all who pretend to Support and preſerve them, and yet take ſuch meaſures, as will utterly overthrow and diſſolve them, ſuch Repairers have apparently deſerted the Dictates and Government of Right Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And here we may Collect an Induction of ſome few hints of certain particulars for Evidence; the Platform Aſſerts a Claſſes to be no Goſpel form of Church Order; <hi>The Propoſals ſay it is,</hi> or they abuſe our Credulity. <hi>The Propoſals Order the Aſſociation to have the firſt Cognizance of Church Caſes</hi>; our Government ſays, No, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Juriſdiction of particular Churches. The Propoſals give Power to the Aſſociation to limit Elections, and to Direct them; but our Government ſays, No, it will not Conſent; the Election of Officers is the Prerogative of the Churches, and they wont, as yet, part with it, &amp;c. So that when we can by the Rules of Grammer Reſolve yea or no, yea or nay, to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001660_0048_0FB4DA9F5A905E88"/>
be the ſame voice and word, then you may Reconcile the <hi>Propoſals</hi> and the <hi>Plat-form</hi>; that Certainly whatever there be of Religion, the Method is apperantly Diſagreeable with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>As to the PLAT-FORM.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall repreſent it by a kind of a ſhort <hi>Proſopop<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi> enquiring whether the Propoſals are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from this fountain, the <hi>Plat-form</hi> with all its Chapters, and with one joynt Conſent, as plain as the Tongue in their heads can utter it, ſay, that never ſince it Poſseſt the Government, ſo much as Dream'd of them. It may ſay with deſtruction (<hi>Job</hi> 28.22.) we have heard of the Fame of theſe things, with our Ears, but never Imagined ſo much as a ſeminal vertue in our own being, for their Procreation, but rather ſtarts with the News of their approach, out of fear of its own Diſsoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their Repugnant and formidable nature. Therefore as in a grievous fright, from Surprize, Crys out with <hi>Athaliah, Treaſon, Treaſon</hi>! And Begs that Zeal and Conſcience, thoſe two Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the Crown, will at this Grand Court of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> Implead and Proſecute them as Traytors to the Prince of Peace, and Fellons to theſe Churches, Chriſts Loyal Subjects. So I come,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To enquire into the nature of theſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,</hi> by Surveying their Compoſition and Properties.</p>

Indeed at the firſt Caſt of the Eye, the Scheme ſeems to be the <hi>Spectre Ghoſt of Preſbiterianiſm,</hi> or the Government or of the Church by Claſſes; Yet, if I don't miſtake, in Intention there is ſomething Conſiderable of <hi>Prelacy</hi> in it, only the diſtinct Courts of <hi>Biſhop</hi> with the <hi>Steeples</hi> of the <hi>Churches, Tythes, Surplice</hi> and other Ornaments, do not ſhew themſelves ſo viſible, as to be diſcerned at the firſt look; yet with a Microſcope you may eaſily diſcern them really to be there in <hi>Embrio, Et in Rera nature</hi>; for this is a known Maxim, <hi>Quod neceſſario Subintelligitar non Deeſt,</hi> What is neceſſarily underſtood, or lies hid in the Intention of a Deſign, is Really here, by juſt Interpretation; Therefore theſe Propoſals <hi>which dare Revolt ſo far at a ſtep,</hi> as theſe have done, muſt needs underſtand no leſs in their aim, than of an Enobling Government for Clergy-men, which our Princes and Parliaments have adorned the Churches with. This ſeems Rational, that thoſe which never ſtick at Robbing the Churches of ſuch an Immence Treaſure, as the Propoſals carry off, will <hi>never ſtand, Shall we! Shall we! at the offer of a Biſhoprick,</hi> which is a Barrony with all its Rights and Royal Appurtenancies.</p>
               <p>There is alſo ſomething in it which <hi>Smells very ſtrong of the Infallible Chair,</hi> To Aſsume the Power of making Rules, to Ingroſs all Principles of Proceſs, The Right of Election, the laſt Appeal, The Negative Vote, and all Super-Intending
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001660_0050_0FB4DAA7FB339BF0"/>
Power in Matters Eccleſiaſtick, as the Prerogatives of Clergy-men, Diſtinct from all other Eſtates and Miniſters in Government; or thus for the Clergy to Monopolize both the Legiſlative and Executive part of Cannon Law, is but a few ſteps from tht Chair of univerſal Peſtilence, and by the Ladders here ſet up, <hi>Clergy-men</hi> may, if they pleaſe, Clamber thus high, for when they are inveſted with what is in theſe Propoſals provided and intended for them, who then can controul them but the Almighty himſelf? as was ſaid of thoſe daring men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6. And now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be Reſtrained from them which they have Imagined to do; for who can now with-hold from them Infallibility, or ſtop the Direful and Definitive Sentence? Who can limit their Power or ſhorten their Arm in their Executions? Their Bulls can now, upon any any affront, Bellow and Thunder out a Thouſand terrible Curſes, and the poor affrighted and Invaſsal'd Layity, both Princes and Subjects (being here as in the grave put under one and the ſame Topick) muſt forfeit their Salvation, if they don't tamely ſubmit, and obediently become their Executioners; for that it is now evident that all Power is, if not Really given, yet formally ſtollen, and in Intent Bequeathed to them.</p>

whereby the whole hangs to gether, the great Frame of nature is unpin'd and drops piece from piece; and out of a Beautiful ſtructure we have a Chaos. Theſe Propoſals are therefore very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, if not in matter, yet in the manner of Production; they are full of Diſorder, being things born out of due time, their Conception is without Countinance, from the Rule of Order. Indeed there is no Statute to be found that will juſtify the firſt Coitus of Parents, neither will any allow their Social Life; that the Birth muſt bear the Attender, of being both begotten and Born, out of Lawful Wedlock, and ſo in Point of Honour fall under the Cenſure of the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> and muſt be kept back from Promotion, for <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>A Baſtard ſhall not enter into the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That to paſs all other Remarks, if we are under miſtake in the aſſertions, I then demand and enquire, Where is that Lawful Authority which Publiſhed Legal Banes, with the Conſent of all the Intereſted Perſons, and the regular Conſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Match?

To invite all ſuch who are with <hi>Plato,</hi> Owners of a great Genius at Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new or Modeling old Governments, to try their Skill in altering the Engliſh Monarchy, and ſee how it will be Probated. That is, ſuppoſe you ſhould venture to Interdict the <hi>Royal Aſſent,</hi> or Convert the preſent Monarch into a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> or diſſolve the Lords in Parliament or (rather in Harmony with this Scheme) Turn the Burgeſſes and Knights of the Shires (as a ſort of men not fit for Politicks in Parliament) out of doors? And whether our Soveraign, the Peerage, or Subjects of Engliſh Liberties would take it well? And whether Chriſtian men may make Bolder with the Eſtabliſhed Government of Chriſts Churches, then with that which belongs to Civil Affairs? In Honour to the <hi>New-England Churches,</hi> and with veneration for the <hi>Engliſh Monarchy,</hi> I dare aſſert, that there is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Church Government more of the Engliſh Civil Government in it, and it has a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Complexion to ſuit the true Engliſh Spirit, than is in the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> or any other, both as to the Legislative and Executive part of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Indeed, conſidering how things are at home in Church and State, I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ready to Query, Why the Nation ſhould be ſo Enamored with their Civil, and yet ſo Careleſs and Regardleſs of their Goſpel Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo as to Truſt their Conſciences with their Clergy, more immediately, and yet won't ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Eſtates with their Learned Judges,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001660_0054_0FB4DAB89344A1E8"/>
without the Priviledge and Mediation of Juries; as tho' they were more careful and wiſe in ſecuring their Eſtates than their Souls, and valued one far more then the other. But I ſhall go on with the Compariſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Legiſlation</hi>; Our New-England Convocation admits, and the Government does profeſs the fraternity as neceſſary to the being of all Synodical Aſſemblies, that as far as Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſpiritual, is left to men, and as they have a great Treaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> Their <hi>Salvation</hi> Imbarqued, ſo they have a great Intereſt in the Management of it; and herein they agree with the Engliſh Caution and Wiſdom, in the Modes of Civil Government of the Empire; for the Commons are one great ſtate in the Civil Legislation; and as they have a great Power in the mannagement of that Great Truſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> or the <hi>Executive</hi> part of <hi>Government,</hi> Our <hi>New-England Government</hi> grants a Juriſdical Power to the Fraternity <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> makes them proper Judges in all Eccleſiaſtical Caſes and Adminiſtrations, on Perſons Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable, or that muſt paſs a Tryal <hi>Juridice</hi>; which is agreeable with the Conſtitution, Nature and Practice of the Civil Government of the Empire; for under the Proſecutions of Law, no <hi>Engliſh Subject,</hi> in Life, Limb or Eſtate, muſt be paſt upon, but by the Judgment of his <hi>PEERS</hi>; Yea, in all Pleas of the Crown, ſuch Confidence has the Government put in the Loyalty and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons, that our Engliſh Juries are
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001660_0055_0FB4DABA07CBCDC8"/>
ſtated Arbitarors and Umpires between our Prince and his Subjects. Yea, ſuch a dependance has the whole Nation in Keeping theſe Liberties in their own hands, that they Reckon the <hi>Commons in Parliament</hi> and <hi>Juries</hi> in the <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> to be the great Pillars of Engliſh Honour and Liberties, and they eſteem them as Ramparts built by the Wiſdom of our Anceſters, to Defend us from Tyranny and Slavery.</p>
               <p>That conſidering the affinity in theſe two Conſtitutions, one would be ready to Query, Whether the Heroick true Engliſh Spirit is not Parent to both? Or whether they are not equal Debtors to the Goſpel, for their Original? The Improvement of this compariſon is briefly this; Suppoſe ſome of the great Miniſters of State ſhould venture to ſweep away all thoſe Civil En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchizements which are <hi>Engliſh-mens</hi> Birth-Right, and ſet up an Arbitrary Power, with a pretence of doing Juſtice and Judgment in the Kingdom, by more conciſe and expedient Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, whether they might not be ſeized? And whether the Statutes would not be Chain ſtrong enough to hold them, as <hi>Traytors</hi> to a well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Government, and then laid faſt by a Mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus for great Uſurpers? And whether the Plea will not hold in Juſt Proportions, on the <hi>other ſide of the Compariſon</hi>?</p>

In managing this Plea, I ſhall only deſire that the Illegality of the Aſſembly which formed theſe Propoſals, with the Objects and things they intend, and the ancient Boundaries which they plainly Invade, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fearful apprehenſions that many good and ſober People in the Vicinage have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Enterprize, may be Critically exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and I doubt not but when we obtain the ſuffrage of this Honourable Court, it will <hi>Determine, The Impleaded Criminals are of a Riotous nature, and ſo the INDICTMENT will ſtand</hi> more valed againſt them.</p>

               <p>It grieves me to utter the Epethites agreeable with the Nature of theſe propoſals; yet they muſt Blame their own Nature, but not my Juſtice, if <hi>I</hi> give them but their due; for I find them in the breach of a Royal Statute, yea, I think of a Penal Law. This is plain, <hi>They take away the Liberties, Priviledges, Diſcipline and Government of theſe Churches, all which are Eſtabliſhed to them by the Law; and that not only by their own Cannons, but by the Laws of this Province,</hi> as by a <hi>Royal Magna Charta, viz.</hi> in an Act for the Settlement and Support of the Miniſters, pag. 3. in theſe words,

               <p>This Act (as one ſays on the great Charter of <hi>Engliſh Liberties</hi>) Deſerves to be <hi>written in letters of Gold,</hi> and hung up in all our Houſes of Gods Publick Worſhip, to ſignalize the Zeal (in the Preſence of God, Angels, and Men) of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Throne and Empire, for the Eſtabliſhing of theſe Churches, and Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them.

               </p>
               <p>And I am ſure there is great ſtore of this in theſe Propoſals; I ſhall Inſtance but in two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Timing the Challenge that is here made, to Brave a Rich and Powerful Enemy at ſo great a diſtance, and invite them by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to a Pitch't Battle, when Surprize and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments might be laid, and do the work with the Expence but of a tenth part of the Blood which this may coſt. This is not agreeable with the Art of War; <hi>Achitophel</hi> would have put a Deriſion upon ſuch Meaſures. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons when taking a Bloody deſign in hand, firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to Stupify and blunt the Courage of their Enemies, and then came upon them by Surprize, e're they could Arm in their own Defence (Tho' it does not juſtifie their Cruelty, yet it magnifies their Subtilty) for thereby they brought their deſign about, when as if they had gone a more Blunt and daring way to work <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> had not been half a breakfaſt for the <hi>Hivites, Gen.</hi> 34.25.</p>
               <p>So here, had the Churches been Convened, and no noiſe made of this Deſign, they Poſſibly
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001660_0059_0FB4DAC3052E8DA8"/>
(tho' their Treaſures are fortified by Right, and ſo in ſafety, and their Troops more ten to one then their Enemies) yet by ambuſhments or Surprize they might have chanced to have been Coakered or Conquered out of all, by being flattered, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed, or over Argued, into a Surrender or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; But we may now Rationally hope the Alarm will Rouſe the Whole Camp, and each Squadron will Rebound it to the next with a <hi>hinc Proixmus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>calogon</hi>; And ſo the Plot may upon a Defeat, blame its own bad conduct, more than its Fortune.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> the Deſign it ſelf (<hi>Quo ad finem Executionis</hi>) let it come to Birth, as is Deſigned, or Deſired, and the very Heavens would either frown upon or Laugh at it for its folly; If we Examine the Climate of the Country, the Degrees of Latitude, and the Severe Stars that chiefly govern, There is no good Policy in the Deſign; ſo that, me thinks, the Univerſal frame of nature Cryes it Down for a <hi>Non-Compos mentis</hi>; for there are no ſuch great Creatures as are here Conceived, can fare in hard cold Countries as the <hi>Camelion</hi> does in warm, there muſt be a very great hoard to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them; and Nature does honeſtly Confeſs, ſhe cannot anſwer the Bills of Fare, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their Table, and do her Duty to the Royal Exchequer; and this muſt be Maintained, or all breaks to pieces.</p>
               <p>Again, let it be conſidered, whether it ben't great Intellectual Weakneſs, or want of Policy, for one Generation to contrive needleſs Loads
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001660_0060_0FB4DACD86A3A948"/>
for the next, eſpecially when they may get as well to Heaven without carrying ſuch Packs along the Road? It has been univerſally the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of mankind, according to the Laws of Nations and Nature, when Rouſed by the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Dictates of Self-Love, to endeavour that every following Generation might be more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, free, noble and happy than that which did immediately preceed.</p>
               <p>They ſay, the <hi>Chinees</hi> dig Clay and uſe it not, but leave it heapt, or in Pits, mellowing for the next Age. Every Prudent man builds his Houſe for Duration. The Prince enlarges and betters his Dominions. The Peaſant ſweats to advance his Eſtate, and then each leaves all in Greater Triumph to their Heirs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kentiſh Yeomantry</hi> are had in honour to this day, for not ſtooping to the Conqueror, till they had Conditioned, and thereby ſecured their fair Eſtates of Lands in Fee and Free-holds forever from all Forfeiture by Felony, according to their Country proverb,
<q>
                     <l>The Father to the Bough,</l>
                     <l>The Son to the Plough.</l>
                  </q>
Such is the Mercyful fore-ſight of Mankind, and his charitable Care and fore caſt for ſuch as ſhall follow, tho' they may never be ſeen or Known by their wiſe Progenitors.</p>
               <p>But here is plainly a Conſpiracy very Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogenious to ſuch Judicious Acts of Humane Providence; A Deſign plainly, if not perfectly to Enſlave, yet to bring Poſterity into a needleſs Vaſſalage and Thraledom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:001660_0061_0FB4DACED29A5C10"/>This is an acknowledged verity amongſt wiſe <hi>Statiſts,</hi> That that Monarch who has the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Seas, can at his Pleaſure Command any Maritime Country. And ſo, thoſe men who have the Command and Empire of the Conſcience of Mankind, can Command their Eſtates, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whatſoever elſe is grateful to them.</p>
               <p>Then, where abouts are we in our Politicks, when we have delivered up the Royalties that are Challenged? and in what a weak Capacity ſhall we leave Poſterity in? Nay, theſe <hi>Vertuoſo's</hi> themſelves, ſeem to be hardened with the Oſtrich againſt their Own Natural Iſſue, unleſs the thing would chance to ſpring up as quick as <hi>Jonas Goard,</hi> and hang as full of Pearls and Diamonds as the Sea and Rocks of <hi>India,</hi> and they themſelves ſhall have the firſt ſhake, and fill all their Coffers, with this Harveſt, or at leaſt, that they are aſſured that they can and ſhall Entail their Offices as ſecurely as their Lands, upon their own Children, as was the Order of Prieſthood, and the Faſhion of the houſe of Levi. But alas! theſe modes are all worn out, and made null; and ſuch mens Sons, as we are now treating of, in with the Multitude, muſt carry their falling Equal ſhare of the Common Load; that ſhould the Project prevail, under their Mannagement, (might they but look up out of their Graves in about half an Age) They may complain in Elegy, after the manner of <hi>Virgil</hi> over his, <hi>Sic vos non vobis. Hos ego verſiculos feci, Jubit alter Honorem.</hi> Theſe verſes I made, but another man carries
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001660_0062_0FB4DAD462EC7DA0"/>
away the Honour. So theſe Gentlemen might e'en ſay, we have Contrived to greaten the Clergy, and with Bees have filled a Rich Hive, and Built a fair Neſt well feathered, but our Poſterity, we ſee, is never the warmer, nor will they lick their fingers of it; and not only ſo, but are the men that muſt make up the tenth Sheaf, and deliver the tenth Cock, Calf and Lamb unto others out of their poor Demeſnes. And alſo it may Juſtly beget a mournful Remembrance in Poſterity of their Parents, and make them often look with a ſad Countenance upon their Fathers Graves, not becauſe they are Dead, but becauſe they had not ended their days ſooner, <hi>viz.</hi> before this Scheme (ſo Oppreſsive and Cruel to their ſmall Free-holds) had taken effect under their Mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

But the Propoſal allows no Proceſs to be Opened, till Letters of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence be obtained, from the Claſſes. But why may not all other Perſons in Office be thus Fettered, as well as the Paſtors of Churches? are theſe the only Studients of Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, that are ſtrangers to the nature of Actions, to the Rule, and the application of it? All other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in Truſt and Commiſſion, who are wiſe and Loyal, execute the hardeſt Articles in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy; and who may ſay to them, why do you ſo? Our Judges never ſtick to hang a man, ſo long as their Commiſſion and the Law will bear them out, and they themſelves are left, to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Both. And that this Propoſal is a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for Officers againſt a ſtorm; alas! the moſt that we can make of it, is a Covering of Figg-Leaves, and may ſerve for a Harbour to Cowards and Fools but not for men of ſpirit and

hath alſo the ſame Power to caſt him out, that they have concerning any other Members.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now herein we find an Eſſential Article in the Government and being of theſe Churches, <hi>That they have and hold ſuch Juriſdiction over their own Members; That the Higheſt Tribunal Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical on Earth, is There; and that their own Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent private Members, and Publick Officers are Tryable only there, and there they muſt Receive the Definitive Sentence, and abide the Execution of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if ſo, then I ſhall make bold to Revive my Query again, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Propoſal is either Honourable, Civil or honeſt, thus to Tumble down at one Blow, this <hi>High Seat of Authority</hi>? and to break open our Priſon Doors, and Looſe the Fetters of our great Offenders? and at the beſt, to take them out of our hands, and make their Mittimus to Forreign Paſtors to do Juſtice upon them, and yet in the mean time, to Profeſs, they are doing us no other Injuries but only Repairing and Mending our Churches? Again, Whether this is fair, and work-man-like amongſt honeſt men?</p>
                  <p>But to make a ſmall Stop here, I muſt remind you, That this head is not to be paſſed over Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for this is the <hi>One Thing</hi> in the <hi>Eſſence of our Churches, It is their Peculiar Infranchizement and Birth-Right,</hi> and we may not ſell it with <hi>Eſau</hi> at a Cheap Market; If we Do, we undo our ſelves; for <hi>Indeed</hi> you muſt know, here lies the <hi>Marring</hi> or <hi>Making of our Churches</hi>; here is laid up their
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001660_0073_0FB4DAFFD5B62E88"/>
ſtrength, and here hangs the Pick-Lock of their <hi>Treaſure</hi>; for by this Key ſtolen or wrinched out of their Hands, the <hi>Churches</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>World,</hi> have been <hi>Expoſed and Plundred,</hi> for more then a Thouſand Years, and many of them have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at this day left them, comparitively, but a poor, ſtarved, ſhabbid, Implicit <hi>Faith,</hi> and a dull, ſaturnal, blunt and blind Obedience, that a man would ſcarcely give a Groat for both of them. In a word, the Uſurpations of the Paſtors, ſince the great Revolt, having unſhackled one another, and broke looſe from the Reſtrictions they are juſtly ſubjected to, under the Churches Power of Priviledge, has utterly undone the Chriſtian World, from <hi>This Root of Bitterneſs, and Pride,</hi> from this <hi>Seed</hi> ſprung up, the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> as we have it in an <hi>Anomulus Author, viz.</hi> the <hi>Eletherians,</hi> pag. 4. In words to this purpoſe,
<q>Then a little Preiſt had an Opportunity to Eſtabliſh himſelf, Then there Appeared in the Temple of God that Antichriſt, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Vicar of Chriſt.</q>
And then the ſame Author going on to diſcover the Original of this <hi>Monſtrous Birth,</hi> he ſays thus, Antichriſt was Conceived in, by, and from certain Affectations of Eccleſiaſtical Prehemincies. As tho' he ſhould ſay, the firſt Spawn or Embryo of that Inſolent <hi>Hector,</hi> or Aſpiring <hi>Nimord,</hi> (who firſt Robbed the Laity of their Chriſtian Liberties, and then Hunted down the Potentates of the World, and Brought them as a Rich ſpoil into his Habitation of Violence) took its Commencement from this

Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Clergies aſſuming to themſelves this Eccleſiaſtical Pre-heminence, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt their obtaining an Exemption from the Cognizance of the Churches, for their Crimes, and then in poſſeſſing themſelves of the ſole and abſolute Juriſdiction (by a diſpotick Government) over the Churches themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But however things have been hitherto, I ſhall no longer uphold the Debate, by revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Abuſes that have been <hi>done</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches by an Ambitious Clergy, in the Ages paſt, which might more amply be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by tracing the Foot-ſteps of the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; But I ſhall end the whole Diſpute on this head, by drawing up a Proteſt, and denying the Juriſdiction of the Court, erected and opened by the <hi>Propoſals,</hi> as being perfectly Diſagreeing and Repugnant to our former Settlements and preſent Conſtitution.</p>

                  <p>According to my Apprehenſion, this Propoſal Inſults very Daringly over the Churches in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Ingroſing the Right of Juriſdiction, not only over the viſible Freedom and Liberties, but Conjugal and Secret Powers of Chriſts Virgin and Widdow Churches. That it ſeems to me very Adviſeable (if this Propoſal may ſtand for a ſound Precept) that forth-with another Office be erected, and put into the hands and under the Government of a few men, exactly skilled in <hi>Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy,</hi> and deeply ſtudied in the Sympathies and Antipathies of Humane Nature, with an abſolute ſuperintending Power to Controul and direct all Wooers in their Choice for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Bed; for that there is many a fond Lover who has betrayed the glory of Wedlock, by making an unwiſe and unfortunate Choice; And why may not perticular Beds be over-Ruled,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001660_0089_0FB4DB3C0741A2B0"/>
as well as perticular Churches? both being for the good and ſervice of Mankind, and for that both parties, Husband and Wife, Paſtor and Church, by our ſort of Government, are bound for Term of Life, or ſo long as both ſhall live. Indeed, were our Conſtitution in Church-Order under the Superintendency of a Patron, or a Lord Biſhop, who can ſend (<hi>pro Tempore</hi>) a Curate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then Recall him, and place another in his ſtead, the Project might be very Adviſeable; but ſeeing theſe Churches are ſettled Congregational, and by their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Ordination is, as it were, the Nuptials, or Marriage Day of two Lovers, that nothing but Death, or a Bill of Divorce (for betraying the Glory of their Union) can Part: It is then good and reaſonable, that they be left to chooſe as they beſt affect, and not forcibly be tyed up to a kind of Hobſons Choice, <hi>One of theſe, or None.</hi> This apparently puts too hard upon the Churches Liberties, and overthrows the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that our Platform in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. treating of the Nature of the Churches, aſſerts, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>That the State of the Viſible Church ſince the Coming of Chriſt, is Only Congregational</hi>; Therefore neither National, Provincial nor Claſſical; Then what does this Propoſal do here?</p>
                  <p>Alſo, our Plat-form aſſerts the free electing Power of the Churches, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. in theſe words, Ordinary Church Power is that of Priviledge, ſuch as belongs to the Brother-hood whereby they deſign perſons unto Office. So alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001660_0090_0FB4DB45479E8FC0"/>
in theſe words, The Power granted by Chriſt unto the Body of the Church and Brother-hood is a Prerogative or Priviledge which the Church doth exerciſe in the Admiſſion of her own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in chuſing their own, Officers. Now if Chriſt has given theſe high Powers and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to his Churches, he has certainly furniſhed them with Skill and Wiſdom to Manage them.</p>
                  <p>So we come to the Second Part of the Affront in this Propoſal, and that is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> By its making a plain Preſumption of Incapacity in the Churches of Doing their own proper work without their Graces help. It is as much as to ſay, Alas! Alas! it is well known that the Churches are generally a ſort of plain men, little Skilled in deep Matters; That there is apparent Danger, if left in their Elections to their own Conduct of Introducing very Illiterate Perſons and doleful Creatures, to preach in the Temple of God, as Officers there. Now this is much agreeing with the old Arguments, againſt the Laity, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Learned to be without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Original Languages, and other parts of Polite Learning, and ſo no ways fit to Interpret Scripture, therefore it is very Rationally En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That the BIBLE be taken from them, leſt they ſhould ſtudy Hereſie and not Holineſs out of that Divine Book. But to paſs by all ſuch Pleas, I ſhall come to the main point in plain Terms, and that is this, Our <hi>Plat-Form</hi> is our Settlement, and it has Secured to the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001660_0091_0FB4DB48551EB918"/>
Churches theſe Prerogatives, and they are part of their Intailed Inheritance; &amp; it is a vain thing to pretend or plead the Incapacity of Right Owners and Rich Proprietors, eſpecially whilſt there is a Competent Set of Sences left them. Indeed, when any Gentlemen can ſhew any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and produce a Commiſſion for the taking into their hands the Eſtate of Ideot-Churches, they may then Cite their Intellectuals to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bar, and Verdict going againſt any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Example, they than, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> become Gaurdians, and may enter into their Worſhip. But in the mean time, as to our own Churches, and the whole Conſtellation of them, and every Individual or particular Church amongſt them remains <hi>Compos mentis,</hi> and therefore muſt not be intreagued by ſuch Officers as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>But yet before I cloſe this Argument, I ſhall a little further humour the Preſumption of Inſufficiency here laid down; and therefore I ſhall deſire, that a Survey be made of the ſtate of the Churches, and if their free Election be found for this thirty Years laſt paſt (and we will go no higher) have by the Major part of Voices introduced Inſufficient Officers, Then let the <hi>Plat-Form</hi> be null'd, and the Propoſal ſtand as a more vallid Cannon. And in this Inquiry we would know, whether the Dictators will give leave (in drawing up the Catalogue of defective electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that they themſelves be put on the back of the Title Page, and there ſtand as the <hi>Errata</hi> of our Old Government? or whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the only exceptions?</p>

We muſt obſerve the ſeeming Favour the Lay-Delegates or Fraternity of the Churches are Treated with in this Propoſal; for at the firſt Tender they ſeem very Honourably to be invited into the Aſſociation, as tho' they were to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Members of this Council, were to be equal ſharers in the Authority and Government in it; yet do but mind the Connection of both Parts of the Propoſition, and <hi>you will find there is nothing of this nature Intended for them.</hi> But only a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſhew, they are invited to eſtabliſh the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:001660_0108_0FB4D7E7C506CDE0"/>
Aſſociations on their Tottering Baſis, and that is ſoon done, if all parties are agreed, and from the Fraternity, there is no need of any more forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, than paying Homage to their Authority by this Act of Submiſſion and Obedience here Propoſed; and ſo ſoon as this is done, you ſhall find the Fraternity very fairly Releaſed at the door of the Seſſions, every man Repairing to his own home. It is an obſervation, on the Monarchy of Bees, that the Drones formerly ſuppoſed to be not only a lumpiſh, but a uſeleſs Bee, yet is of that nature, and ſo Eſſential a Member of that Common Wealth, that it is Really the Male-Bee, and does Imprignate the Females, who are the Sole Labourers in that Kingdom, but when that Criſis is over, the poor Drones are by common Conſent Baniſhed, as a great Incumberment; ſo in our Caſe, Alas! what can be expected, when the Laye-Delegatees have done the former Job, but that they ſhall be laid by, for their Wiſdom and Capacity is no ways Admired in theſe Propoſals. And it has always been found that the Laity are a Clog to Clergy-men, when they begin to ſoar a-loft, or above their proper Sphere; and if you will but view the Propoſal again, in the hindermoſt part of it, you will ſee a Back-door very Artificially finiſhed and left upon Latch, for their Excluſion; for tho' they are called to be Members of the Council in the firſt part of the Propoſal, yet by Exception made in the laſt part, they are to ſit upon no Caſe but what the Aſſociates pleaſe; and ſeeing
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001660_0109_0FB4D8A94AB6CC40"/>
it is at their diſpoſe, you may Rationally and forcibly conclude, That thoſe who have made it their buſineſs to unpin the whole Tabernacle, and have but this Chair to Do, and then all is their own, will now finiſh their Work with a wet Finger, upon the foreſaid Complyance. For you muſt Note, that after they have Admitted the Brethren, and viewed the Certificates of Election from the ſeveral Churches, containing ſome Congratulatory Complements, to Honour the new Conſtitution and Government, (as is uſual in all States) and having alſo treated the Delegates with the Civilities of the Houſe, and alſo with a long and tedious Harangue of the Mighty Bleſſings theſe new Settlements plainly Predict and Promiſe the Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates are then adviſed, <hi>There is no Caſe at Preſent Depending fit for their Cognizance, but what is upon file; The Aſſociates have already Conſidered about it, and Referred to ſome other Council beſt known to their Graces. And ſo,</hi> good Brethren, <hi>you are now with many Thanks for your obedient Attendance, Releaſed till</hi> Latter Lammas, <hi>or till the</hi> Greek Calends <hi>come about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we may dig a Grave to bury all our Antient Priviledges in, and Hang our Harps upon the Willows, and when we are thus wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ſhould you call us in once more to ſing one of the Songs of <hi>Sion,</hi> all our Notes muſt be <hi>Elegie &amp; De triſtibus,</hi> yet the Broken Accents, and lowly Murmours of our Sorrow will <hi>ſerve</hi> for <hi>Elahs</hi> and Sweet <hi>Diapaſans,</hi> in the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Song of Triumph.</p>

We muſt, <hi>Nextly,</hi> ſurvey the Nature of the Council, which cannot be ſooner, and with better Advantage (to Repreſent the true Idea of it to every mans underſtanding) than in a breif Definition, Thus, <hi>The Council is to be ſtanding and ſtated, To meet once in the year at the leaſt, and at other times as each Aſſociation ſhall pleaſe to Determine, To Inquire into the Condition of the Churches, and Adviſe ſuch things as may be for the Advantage of our holy Religion.</hi> Thus you have the nature of it laid out in Terms very Conciſely.</p>
                  <p>But if a longer Deſcription, according to the Genuine ſence of Expreſſions in the Propoſals, will better ſuit you, and give a better impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its Nature upon your thoughts, we may then Deſcribe it Thus,</p>
                  <p>It is a Council of Humane Invention, ſtated and Settled to Convene once in the Year, Yearly, during the Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies, and at other certain Times of the year, ſo as to keep its Courſe Parallel with our High and Superiour Seſſions of the Peace, if the Creators pleaſe to Conſult, Adviſe and Determine all Affairs within the reach of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Councils, and Eſpecially, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, we being a People ſwiming in ſuch Plenty, that all our Chargeable Meaſures, both Domeſtick in our Private Families, and Publick in Church and Common Wealth, being not near ſufficient, to take off our Waſte, and Superfluous Streams, and our Riches and ſtores

ſo plainly over-loading us, we have here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Creature, that will help to ſup up all, and feeding upon our full Baskets, we ſhall find, that the further we go with <hi>Eſop's Load,</hi> the lighter we ſhall grow; Then who will not Admire <hi>the Wiſdom</hi> of the Invention!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our next Task is to Examine the Original of this Council, which Inquiry may be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into this Disjunct Propoſition, <hi>viz. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is the Reſult of the Will, Obeying the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in its laſt Dictates, Erring or not Erring.</hi>

                  <p>The Queſtion being thus ſtated, it is at every mans Liberty, to take the part in the Disjunction which beſt likes him. <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe the Propoſal Arreſted and brought to Tryal, will plead, <hi>Not Erring,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> as is uſual with all Criminals, when Indicted; and therefore ſeeing you expect to be Cleared by the Jury, you muſt give us an honeſt account, <hi>Who ſet you on Work, and what Rule you were guided by to Aſſure us that your Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Powers were free from Error in forming this Council,</hi> and we will give you Room enough in your own Defence.

But no ſuch Cannon can be found. The <hi>Propoſals</hi> then Incur a heavy Premunire for making <hi>ſo Bold with a Settled Government,</hi> and no Text to warrant the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>Law,</hi> If there be any ſuch Law, you have Liberty to Plead it in your own Defence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>Practice,</hi> Has the Civil Government ever ſet ſuch an Example? Have they ever Intrencht upon the Priviledges of the Churches in the leaſt Degree? And in their own Orb, are they not more Exemplary? Don't all men keep to Commisſion? Are they not Curious in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all Settled Forms, as the Limits and Boundaries of all mens Actions and Intereſts? Nay, is not the <hi>Exalted Head</hi> of this Body Politick in his whole Miniſtry, Careful to Steer all his Actions by his Commiſſion, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Law? Is not the leaſt Error (tho' made by Jealouſy, and not found in Reality) that looks but like an Arbitrary Action preſently drawn into complaint, as a great Greivance, and Common Neuſance? If it be but in Dream, that the Exchequer appears Toucht, without a precept, or the Wings of our Civil Liberties Clipt, or ſo much as a Feather be pluckt from them, is not the Country here and the Court at home filled with Complaints? what means all this? And yet muſt theſe Churches, formed by Principles of Piety and Honour, and under the Steerage of a wiſe and juſt Government, bear whole Cart Loads of Injuries, and have all their Liberties Violated? And at laſt have a Stated <hi>Antichriſtian Arbitrary Council,</hi> that can cut their

                  <p n="3">3. Is there any Certificate, Orders, or Vote, from the Churches, as the Womb of this Council?

But, I ſay, this is not Right, for <hi>in Convening and calling of Councils, the Churches are your Superiours</hi>; and upon a ſevere Interpretation of their Canons, They may, if they pleaſe, leave you at home.

Therefore it is fit, that in the Choice of the Meſſengers for ſuch Aſſemblys, they have Special Reſpect unto ſuch, <hi>viz</hi> Elders; That certainly if you expect your Council ſhall eſcape Condemnation, you muſt then produce the <hi>Probatum Eſt</hi> of the Churches, or elſe it Periſhes under this Tryal.</p>

                     <p>The Emperour (they ſay) is the King of <hi>Kings,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is the King of <hi>Men,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſes,</hi> And the King of <hi>England</hi> the King of <hi>Devils,</hi> for that the Engliſh Nation can never be bridled, and Rid by an Arbitray Prince.

And therefore under this Branch of our Diſcourſe, and their Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Meaſures, I ſhall venture to annex the following <hi>Theſis,</hi> as Concluſions fairly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Premiſes, and leave them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. We came to Survey the Work cut out for this Council.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cato,</hi> that Great and grave Philoſopher did Commonly Demand (when any new Project was propounded unto him) <hi>Cui Bono</hi>? or what good was like to enſue? Now in this preſent Buſineſs, the definition Pretends to make a Satisfactory Anſwer to ſuch a Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Imployment of this Annual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and that is to enquire into the Condition of the Churches, and adviſe ſuch things as may be for the advantage of our holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, conſidering the Nature of the Creature here formed, there had need be ſome <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour Aſſigned. Thoſe who are Purveyours, and muſt provide Quarters, will find it very Chargeable, That it had need do very Extraordinary Buſineſs. As once King <hi>James</hi> the 1ſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid to a big-Limb'd Country Fellow, who came to Court to be a Porter; ſome that knew him, told the King how many Bowls fall, and Quarters of Mutton he would

eat at a Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Says the King to the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, You Sirrah, that Eat ſo much more than other men, If you cannot do ſo much more Work proportionably than other men, by my So'l (Says the King) I'll hang ye. So here, there had need go a handſome Stock of ſmall Cattle, and other Expences to Maintain one Seſſions; That if it has Confidence to meet, and is Treated with an Ordinary allowance, If it can't do abundance of Work, it will be waſte Charges, and great Incumberment.</p>
                        <p>Now, if this be all that is here Propoſed (in my Opinion) the Creators are very Defective in their Propoſitions; For tho' the Work Mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is in it ſelf good Work, <hi>But it's all Done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to their hands, There is nothing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Neglected in</hi> N. England Churches, at the leaſt, no Means or Methods wanted, but as God ſays, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4. What <hi>could have been done more for my Vineyard, that I have not Done in it</hi>: may Properly be applyed to the Churches here, and all for the Advantage and Good of our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that, in a word, <hi>there is no want in this Country,</hi> unleſs it be the want of good and honeſt Hearts; and I ſuppoſe you have none of thoſe to Bequeath.</p>
                        <p>Upon the firſt view of this ſtupendious Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I was ready to phancy, whether or no you had Dream'd of or ſeen King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth a coming with his old Caſe and Queſtion which involved the Pope, his Conclave and all the Accademies in <hi>Europe,</hi> and whether you were
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001660_0124_0FB4D8C2C6ED8F40"/>
getting a Mighty Caſuiſt ready to take the Kings Conſcience into Conſideration? Or whether you had news of the Old <hi>Arian</hi> War, its Breaking out again, that you ſhould in ſuch haſte, (without Citing other Eſtates for the Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but only by vertue of your Prerogative) Run up ſuch a formidable and Coſtly Redoubt? But if it be all come to this, and there is no more to do, then what every Pious and Wiſe Man does every day, every Week, and every Seſſions, it is even another fit or Paroxiſm of the Mountains bringing forth, as the Poet ſays, <hi>Parturiunt Montes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But to Humour what would ſeem Serious in the Propoſal, I ſhall conſider both parts of the Work Diſtinctly.</p>

Town, and whether there be any Surgeons, Phyſitians, or School-Maſters that do good to their Neighbours with out Lycence? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any new <hi>Golgotha's</hi> to be Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, for the ſecurer Retreat of the Dead to that Place? Or whether the Pariſh Curates Read Service well, and obſerve to time their Particular Leſſons, with the Canonical Days? and eſpecially whether the Bells are kept in good Tune and Order, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? All which makes up a Noble piece of Service, to Requite a Crown or Kingdom for the Revenues of a Barony! and, Whether it may be thought, that our Great and yearly Council, will come a whit behind the aforeſaid Miniſtry in the firſt or laſt part of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Mentioned? And whether if they do but equal them, we may not be thought to have made a wiſe Settlement? But notwithſtanding we ſhall grant, the Propoſal makes mention of a <hi>Chriſtian Duty,</hi> for that it becomes all men, who bear a love to Chriſt, to enquire into the ſtate of his Churches, both for their Manifeſting their love to men, and directing their Prayers and Gratitude to GOD.</p>
                  <p>Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to their outward and Temporal ſtate, we may inform our ſelves, by virtue of Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by Chriſtian Travellers and Publick Letters of Intelligence; and thus we may Rationally, and with very good moral Certainty know the ſtate of the Churches, both in other Countries and our own; and thus good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> informs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

                  <p n="2">2. As to their Moral State (which conſiſts in their Profeſſion, Faith, manner of Worſhip, Diſcipline and Converſation) this is diſcovered particularly, by their Directories, Confeſſions of Faith, Plat-forms, Rubrick, Liturgies, and other Canonical Syſtems made Publick for that end, &amp;c. And conſidering, that whatever of this nature is neceſſary for the advance of Religion, is well adjuſted in this Country, it muſt needs be but a vain Repetition, or ſenſles Tautology for a Council to meet yearly or quarterly for this end, <hi>viz.</hi> To Inquire what News, or whether <hi>New-Englands Confeſſion of Faith</hi> is the ſame this Year, as it was Laſt? Or whether all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, their Manner of Worſhip, is this Sabboth as it was the other? And as to their <hi>Converſation</hi> (which may ſeem to lie moſt out of ſight) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proviſion is made by the Principles of our wiſe Plat-form (for Upholding the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches) for our Inquiry and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here alſo.

after? And whether all the Churches and the whole Land are not Honour'd and Addreſt, from week to week, in ſuch Meaſures by infallible Truth, if not by Infallible Men? whether or no theſe Methods don't Divulge the whole Mind of God to each Plantation?</p>
                  <p>Or, whether theſe Gentlemen have any ſecrets of Wiſdom, not yet made Known? Or whether they Intend to ſerve the Churches, as ſome great Philoſophers and Profound Artiſts in Medicine Serve the World, <hi>viz,</hi> ſuch who carry ſome great Ineſtimable <hi>Catholicon</hi> to the Grave with them?</p>
                  <p>And whether they will be thus hard hearted in Religion, as the other are in Philoſophy, unleſs we will gratifie them with this Piece of Prodigality here Exacted? <hi>I</hi> muſt Ackowledge I have little Patience towards theſe things, that under ſuch a ſpecious ſhew and Pretence ſuch a direful Cataſtrophy ſhould be Shrowded!

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Legiſlative Power (that Civil Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) is doing very great things for Religion, by their Proclamations, and all Paenal Laws enacted for the Cruſhing of Immorality and Vice, and in all their wiſe and exact Precepts for the Support of Juſtice and Piety. They are opening many civil Channels, whereby they are Conveying Judgment, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs down our Streets, from the great fountain. Nay, this great and Dread Aſſembly puts Awe upon all Mankind. And the more Daring and Deſperate are kept within Compaſs, from a ſence of this moſt Terrible Seat of Thunder hanging over their Heads, and upon every Affront ready to break in ſtroaks of Vengeance and Woes upon them, eſpecially if they grow beyond the reach of Common Law.</p>
                  <p>And in Ordinary Caſes,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Executive Power,</hi> or Miniſters of the Law, are like a Standing Camp to awe, and a flying Army to beat the Enemy; They have their Spyes and Scouts out in every Quarter to obſerve his motions, and break his Meaſures, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Innumerable Numbers of all ſorts of Civil Officers; and thus by the Sword of Juſtice they hunt down Sin, and Impiety in
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001660_0129_0FB4D8CCCD495E00"/>
the Land. They are a Terror to Evil men, and a Praiſe to them that do Well; for the Civil Authority, by their wiſe and juſt Precepts, their perſonal and Noble Examples and Zealous Adminiſtrations, out-do <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf with all his Moral Reaſons; for they can turn a <hi>Sodom</hi> into a <hi>Zion,</hi> and keep <hi>Zion</hi> to be <hi>Zion</hi> Evident by the Hiſtory and Chronicles of Several Governments of Gods Ancient People. <hi>Nam Regis ad Exemplum Totus Componitur Orbis</hi>

Liſten! is not God with Them, and the Shout of a King amongſt them? Are they not as Valleys ſpread forth, and as Gardens by the Rivers ſide, which the Lord hath Planted? And yet, notwithſtanding, may we, muſt we under your Conduct, break up their Fences, to give them another ſort of Culture? Nay, conſider well! are not the Flowers better wed, and the Weeds more kept down, than in moſt of the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the World, belonging to the <hi>Great Huſband-man</hi>? And may you not (in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning up of means) allow us peculiarly to Aſcribe to their Government, and other of their meaſures agreeing with the nature of it in Dreſſing the Ground? But <hi>I</hi> will not

The College (That Artillery Garden from whence we receive our moſt expert Souldiers of Chriſt, and whence Chriſts Troops are ſupplyed with Cheif Commanders, who lead on to ſtorm the ſtrong holds of the Common Enemy, and ſecure our great Alley, <hi>Religion</hi>) This is the Seminary of Learning and virtue, and the Succeſs is almoſt to a Miracle, unleſs for Humiliation we muſt Secret the great Grace and Gifts of God which flow from that Fountain, and are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perſed thro' the Land.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The Families of the Country with their Oeconomies, and family Religion; If we take a Survey of the whole Land, we ſhall find Religion placed in the Body Politick, as the Soul in the Body natural. <hi>Nam eſt Tota Anima, in Toto Corpore, et Toto in Qualibet parte</hi>; That is, the whole Soul is in the whole Body, and whole in every Part. That were any other

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> do acknowledge, there is no General Rule, but has its Exceptions; But under this Caution <hi>I</hi> may ventre to affirm, there is no ſuch Spot of Earth in the Earthly Globe (ſo Belaboured with family Devotion, Reading Gods Word, Catechizing and well Inſtructing Youth, with neat and vertuous Examples, and Divine Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>non ex Codice, ſed ex Corde,</hi> not out of Books, but out of Hearts, the Solemnizing Sabboths, and family Attendance on publick means) as is <hi>New-England.</hi> And if ſo, then what need have we of this late invention? Therefore to conclude, I ſhall, for my own part, with the Jealous <hi>Laocoon</hi> enter Caution againſt taking down the ſides of the City, or opening the Walls of our ZION to let in this <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi>; and let all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay, <hi>Amen</hi>! For, Bleſſed be God, tho' we want to have our hearts Renewed dayly, but as for means, tho' we <hi>have no</hi> glut, we have Plenty enough, and want no new Inſtitutions.</p>

Time is juſtly eſteemed Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in relation to Heaven and Grace, and alſo very valuable with reſpect to the intereſt of Nature and this Life. Therefore, care ſhould be had, that it ben't Squandered away waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Our natural Lives, Health and Honour, Families and Eſtates are all very ſignificant and Coſtly things, and their Dependence is much on the well husbanding of Time, inſomuch that in hard and penurios Climates, the Inhabitants had need be very ſaving of Time for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all theſe great Intereſts, and ſeeing there is ſo much time already ſet for Religion.
