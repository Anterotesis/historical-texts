            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIANITY is the method deviſed by infinite wiſdom and goodneſs to effect the ſalvation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of fallen man. The execution of this gracious plan is committed to JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD; who, as he fulfilled his Miniſtry on earth, raiſed up and commiſſioned choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en men, whom he named Apoſtles, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the eſtabliſhment of his ſpiritual kingdom here below, and the ſacred vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume agreeable to which it is to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which being accompliſhed, the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of CHRIST receive their authority
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022275_0003_0FB7ACC1588A8C08"/>
from him indeed, but in the way of his common providence, and under the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al direction of his SPIRIT. How men are inveſted with that office—the difficulties which attend it—and the motives which ſhould engage them to diligence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in it, will form the ſubject of the following diſcourſe, founded on thoſe words:
<q>
                  <bibl>II. CORINTHIANS, iv.1.</bibl>
                  <p>THEREFORE, SEEING WE HAVE THIS MINISTRY, AS WE HAVE RECEIVED MERCY, WE FAINT NOT.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle concludes the preceding chapter with repreſenting the great effect of Chriſtianity, as producing the image of GOD in the hearts of men; from whence he infers the dignity and importance of the Goſpel Miniſtry. <hi>Therefore, ſeeing we have,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Since the great deſign and effect of the Goſpel is to reſtore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved human nature to the loſt image, forfeited favour and enjoyment of GOD, how intereſting and important is the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of CHRIST! And as it has pleaſed him in his diſtinguiſhing mercy, to inveſt us with, and to ſupport us in that office, ſo, under all the difficulties which we meet with, far from being diſcouraged, we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022275_0004_0FB7ACC4019A2BE8"/>
it, with a zeal and reſolution propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the greatneſs of its object, the glory of CHRIST, and the ſalvation of the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>IT would be arrogance in the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel to aſſume the ſtile of the Apoſtles, or apply to themſelves what was only intended of thoſe primitive and inſpired Preachers of Chriſtianity. But, as the Miniſters of CHRIST in every age derive their authority from him, as they are engaged in the ſame cauſe, ſerve the ſame Divine Maſter, from whoſe gracious hand they expect their final reward; ſo the ſame grateful ardour becomes them, and the ſame animating motives ſhould excite their zeal and diligence, in purſuing the great ends of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>AS GOD originally produced the grand ſyſtem of nature by an immediate exerciſe of his almighty power; but, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, governs it in the courſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence, agreeable to certain ſtated laws: So, when by the miraculous exerciſe of the ſame almighty power, he had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and eſtabliſhed his ſpiritual kingdom among men, he left it to be governed by the ſame univerſal providence, under the direction of his SPIRIT, and agreeable to the dictates of his holy word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:022275_0005_0FB7ACC6330D84E0"/>JESUS CHRIST adminiſters the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of providence. He is in particular that King whom GOD hath anointed upon his holy hill of Sion, and who is therefore head over all things to his Church. JESUS CHRIST raiſes up and qualifies ſome for the work of the Miniſtry, by beſtowing upon them thoſe natural and intellectual talents, a competent ſhare of which is evidently neceſſary to the purpoſe. For whilſt we readily acknowledge on the one hand, that the moſt ſhining talents are not eſſential to the work of the Miniſtry, it cannot be ſuppoſed on the other, agreeable to the mind of CHRIST, that perſons ſhould be appointed to that office to whom he has denied the abilities neceſſary to the proper diſcharge of the common affairs of life. If ſhining talents are not indiſpenſable, they are at leaſt ornamental to the Miniſtry and uſeful to the Church.</p>
            <p>THE ſame all diſpoſing Providence fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſome with advantages for acquiring ſuch degrees of learning as are, if not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, greatly conducive to the ends of the Miniſtry. An acquaintance with ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has a happy effect on the characters of men: It enlarges the mind, ſoftens the manners, and furniſhes with a variety, both of ſentiment and language, for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others. Learning is not, by any
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022275_0006_0FB7ACCB18CEFB90"/>
means, to be ſet in competition with an experimental acquaintance with true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Nor do we pretend that it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily tends to render men pious or virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Like all other temporal advantages it is very liable to be abuſed as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of pride and ſelf ſufficiency; and is, perhaps, as often perverted in this manner as any diſtinction which one man poſſeſſes above another. But when conſecrated by divine grace to the honour and ſervice of CHRIST, it becomes not only an ornament to the office, but tends to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its great deſign; and is a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nearly indiſpenſable, in thoſe who are ſet for the defence of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>BUT CHRIST deſignates or points out ſome for the work of the Miniſtry in a more direct way, by the effectual teachings of his HOLY SPIRIT; leading them into an acquaintance with the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven; enabling them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the truth of his doctrines, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his character, the beauties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the grandeur of thoſe proſpects which are opened, through him, into the eternal world.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER natural talents a man may poſſeſs—whatever learning he may have acquired, we muſt inſiſt upon it, that the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022275_0007_0FB7ACCC95E2FF30"/>
effectual teachings of the bleſſed SPIRIT of GOD, or that ſpiritual diſcernment which diſtinguiſhes ſpiritual things, is neceſſary to the work of the Miniſtry; and that it cannot be the mind of the great Head of the Church, that men ſhould be appointed to that office, whoſe commiſſion has not thus (if you will indulge the expreſſion) been ſealed with his own hand; that is, who are not partakers of his ſpirit and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with his image. Is that man prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly qualified to urge others to accept of CHRIST, who has not himſelf accepted him? Will he be likely to recommend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to others, who has not embraced it himſelf?—Will he be a good ſoldier of JESUS CHRIST, who has never given his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to that Divine Maſter?—Will he purſue his Miniſtry with proper zeal and perſeverance, through all the difficulties with which it is attended, who has no ſenſe of the excellency of the Goſpel, or the worth of ſouls, and is a ſtranger to thoſe hopes which ſhould warm the heart and animate the ſervices of the Miniſter of CHRIST?—In a word, is he qualified to take care of and watch for the ſouls of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who has neglected his own ſoul?— You will readily acknowledge the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the above ſuppoſitions, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, how neceſſary it is, that the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022275_0008_0FB7ACCE152B9228"/>
of CHRIST ſhould be partakers of the ſpirit of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>BUT we do not ſuppoſe, that a man's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the above qualifications, in the moſt extenſive manner, implies that he is under any obligation to engage in the work of the Miniſtry. There ought to be a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular inclination of the heart to it, attended with a perſuaſion of the mind, that GOD requires it of him, and that, of conſequence, it is his duty thus to ſerve the LORD CHRIST. When the above mentioned particulars meet with the acceptance and approbation of the Church and People of GOD, there is an evident deſignation to office, and ſuch men are called of GOD, as really, though in a different way, as thoſe primitive preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom he pointed out by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts of his HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>WE do not conſider the miniſterial office as neceſſarily aſſumed for life; many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may concur to render a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in it improper, and even impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. The ſame leading Providence which has pointed out the expediency of taking it up, may, with equal evidence, convince us that it is proper to relinquiſh it.</p>
            <p>AS the work of the Miniſtry is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, ſo, like moſt other intereſting purſuits, it is attended with many difficulties and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022275_0009_0FB7ACD3D92D5FA0"/>
diſcouragements. It affords but little proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of worldly advantage, leſs than either of the other learned profeſſions, whilſt the ſervice which it requires is equal, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, greater. And as for the pleaſures and honours of ſcience, the man who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attends to his duty, as a Miniſter of CHRIST, will find but little leiſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in curious learned diſquiſitions; or, if he does ſo, there is great reaſon to fear, it muſt be at the expenſe of, what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more important, a proper attention to the duties of his office and the ſalvation of ſouls. That man makes a wretched ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, who forfeits the favour of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maſter and endangers the ſouls of men, for the ſake of enjoying the pleaſures of learning or obtaining the honours of a literary character.</p>
            <p>THE good Miniſter will find much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the imperfections of his own heart: His office renders it neceſſary that he ſhould be much engaged in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of piety and in religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but alas! how difficult does he find it, always to keep alive that ſpirit of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, without which, the exerciſes of piety and religious converſation, become a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inſtead of a pleaſing ſervice. He wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to exemplify in his own temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that religion which he preaches to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022275_0010_0FB7ACD59B643118"/>
others; but upon trial he finds, with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regret, that, in many inſtances, this is impracticable. He is obliged to plead the ſincerity of his intentions, to excuſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies of his conduct with men; whilſt, with reſpect to his Maker, he conſiders the ſacrifice of JESUS as the ground of his own as well as his people's hope of pardon, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THERE is much diſcouragement ariſing to the faithful Miniſter of CHRIST, from the froward humours of mankind. He is often cenſured where he ought to have met with commendation—and diſcharging the moſt difficult office of friendſhip, reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faults of men, though done with exquiſite caution, will often forfeit their friendſhip, and convert it to the crueleſt hatred. Thoſe in whoſe ſervice he has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with the moſt painful aſſiduity, will, when unreaſonably offended, reward him with the moſt bitter reproaches. He frequently finds reaſon to adopt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of his Divine Maſter, that he has <hi>laboured in vain, and ſpent his ſtrength for naught and in vain.</hi> To which we may add the awful apprehenſion of bringing on himſelf the blood of ſouls who may periſh through his neglect. Theſe are ſome of the diſcouragements which attend the work of the Miniſtry. They are formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022275_0011_0FB7ACD71487EF88"/>
but the faithful Miniſters of CHRIST may notwithſtanding adopt the language of the text, <hi>we faint not.</hi> The ſame mercy of GOD which has honoured us, putting us into that office and has hitherto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, will ſtill ſupport us whilſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithful to him.</p>
            <p>THERE are many conſiderations to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the heart and animate the labours of the faithful Miniſter. He is engaged in a ſervice which claims the attention of all holy and good beings, whether on earth or in heaven. He is a worker together with GOD, and ſo long as he ſtudies to ſhew himſelf approved unto GOD, he is ſure of his gracious preſence. His office, to ſpeak modeſtly of it, is of great importance to mankind, and has therefore been held in high repute by the wiſe and the good of every age. It is an office well adapted to gratify the benevolent affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart.

fidelity to him and perſeverance in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.—Pleaſing office! where the heart is engaged in it, and where ſucceſs attends our labours, and we are inſtrumental, in the hands of CHRIST, in promoting the ſalvation and happineſs of the ſouls of men. We ſerve a gracious Maſter, who is as willing as he is able to afford us every needed ſupport, and whoſe addreſs to us is the ſame which ſilenced the fears of the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for you.</hi> We act always under his eye; a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motive to exertion, as we are ſure no inſtance of it, however inconſiderable in itſelf, or unknown to the world, will paſs unnoticed or unrewarded by him. We act with a view to eternity, and in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the rewards of our fidelity and zeal at the end of our warfare, when <hi>they who have turned many unto righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars forever and ever.</hi> How well adapted are ſuch views as theſe to lighten every burden, to reconcile us to every trial, and to call forth every exertion? Who would not cheerfully ſpend and be ſpent for ſuch a Maſter and in ſuch a ſervice? Bleſſed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, our faith looks to thee, through the vale of death, and anticipates the all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant moment when we ſhall hear from thy gracious lips, <hi>Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, enter ye into the joys of your LORD.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:022275_0013_0FB7ACDDD9588680"/>WE infer, from what has been ſaid, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is a painful and laborious ſervice; that it is ill ſuited to the indulgence of ſloth and diſſipation. <hi>Much ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh</hi>: The ſolicitude which the good Miniſter feels for the proper diſcharge of his duty, and the ſucceſs of his Miniſtry, is much more painful. His hands and his heart will be conſtantly employed, and the affectionate manner in which he purſues his Miniſtry in private, will diſcover itſelf in the warmth of his publick addreſſes; and one ſpirit of rational, conſiſtent and animated zeal will give life and ornament to every duty.</p>
            <p>I ADDRESS myſelf, with great affection, to the Church and Society who have, with ſuch unanimity, invited me to the paſtoral office among them, and to whoſe ſervice I am this day conſecrating myſelf in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner.</p>
            <p>MEN AND BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>THE Miniſter of CHRIST is the ſervant of his Church, and his labours, as to time and place, ought to be regulated by the proſpect of doing good, or promoting the intereſts of religion. But when by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al agreement, a relation is formed between him and a particular people, it becomes exceeding near and intereſting; their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022275_0014_0FB7ACDF8B24EF90"/>
is cloſely connected. The relation ought never to be diſſolved but upon the moſt urgent neceſſity—it never can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved but with the moſt painful ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Friendſhip is balm to a pained heart—The affectionate manner in which you have received me, the kind attention with which you have treated me, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſoothing, and afford the moſt pleaſing and flattering proſpect. But you will allow me to obſerve, that it is your conduct towards our Divine Maſter, for which I ought to be principally concerned. Would you give me the greateſt pleaſure, it muſt be by a ſerious attention to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of religion, and practice of its duties. I expect, indeed, as I ſtand in need of your candour towards me, that you will not lightly admit a prejudice againſt me, and that you will give me the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of explaining for myſelf, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may need explanation, either in my preaching or conduct. I was going to aſk your prayers—but I am ſure you will not ceaſe to pray for the ſucceſs of my Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with which your own and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's happineſs is ſo nearly connected.— This much depends upon the countenance and encouragement which I ſhall receive from the principal members of the ſociety, who, I am perſuaded, will not fail to ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022275_0015_0FB7ACE3AF801478"/>
my endeavours to promote the cauſe of piety and virtue among us. May the GOD of peace dwell with us—his glory be advanced by us—and his bleſſing reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT omit this opportunity of paying my grateful acknowledgments to the inhabitants of the town in general, and to my brethren in the Miniſtry in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for the very obliging manner in which they have received me, and the kind attention which they have paid to me, ſince I have been among them.—With reſpect to my brethren in the Miniſtry, I can with great propriety adopt the words of St. Paul, <hi>Theſe are my fellow workers to the kingdom of GOD, who have been a comfort unto me.</hi> I greatly rejoice in that ſpirit of candour which at preſent prevails between Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of different denominations: May it more and more prevail, that, united by that <hi>charity which is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of dividing upon circumſtantials, we may uſe our joint endeavours for promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great eſſentials of our holy religion.</p>
            <p>I PROMISE myſelf great pleaſure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from my connexion with perſons of ſuch amiable characters. May we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage each other in the ſervice of our common Maſter, and long know <hi>how good
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022275_0016_0FB7ACE556E40410"/>
and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY,</p>
            <p>I ADDRESS myſelf in a few pathetick words to this great and very reſpectable aſſembly.—If an heathen monarch, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory informs us, once wept over a numerous concourſe of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, on reflecting that they muſt ſoon become the prey of death, how much more does this tear of tenderneſs become the eye of one, who is profeſſedly the Miniſter of the GOD of mercy and the compaſſionate SAVIOUR of the world.</p>
            <p>IT is to that SAVIOUR I would now direct your views; <hi>Behold the LAMB of GOD, which taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> Are you deſirous of obtaining happineſs? Yes, for what child of Adam is not? In JESUS CHRIST all fulneſs dwells: He is that <hi>wiſdom, which is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her; whoſe ways are pleaſantneſs and all whoſe paths are peace.</hi> JESUS CHRIST can and will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply every real want, and ſatisfy every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſire. But where ſhall we find, and how ſhall we ſecure an intereſt in this ineſtimable friend? Attend to his addreſs; <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022275_0017_0FB7ACE6D46FE348"/>
come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> You will eaſily recollect, that from your earlieſt remembrance, CHRIST has been urging this admiſſion to your hearts; or, which is the ſame thing, he has by a gentle, but powerful influence, been pointing you to religion as the only means of happineſs; ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi> Admit him then into your hearts, make him the ground of your truſt, the object of your affections, and he will be the ſource of your joys; <hi>the peace of GOD which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through CHRIST JESUS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE kingdom of CHRIST <hi>is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</hi> His ſubjects are partakers with him in the glory and happineſs of his reign. <hi>Lift up your heads</hi> therefore <hi>and rejoice,</hi> ye ſervants of CHRIST, <hi>for your redemption draweth nigh. Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the morning. You ſhall return and come, with ſinging, unto Sion, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy ſhall be upon your heads. You ſhall obtain gladneſs and joy, and ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away.</hi>

            <head>THE CHARGE, GIVEN TO THE REV. MR. <hi>WEST,</hi> BY THE REV. MR. <hi>BELKNAP.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO form the character of a Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of JESUS CHRIST, it is neceſſary that he be firſt qualified, with gifts and graces, proper for the diſcharge of his office, and then that he be regularly called to exerciſe them.</p>
            <p>CHURCHES have a right to elect their own Paſtors; but before they exerciſe this right, it becomes them, impartially and devoutly, to look into the word of GOD, to ſee what qualifications are required in a Goſpel Miniſter; and then charitably to judge, whether the perſon whom they are deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of appointing to this office, be poſſeſſed of thoſe qualifications; if they find a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between the marks there laid down, and the character which he exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, they have a ſufficient warrant to call him to officiate; becauſe they may on good grounds be ſatisfied that the HOLY GHOST has fitted him to be an Overſeer of the Church of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:022275_0019_0FB7ACEF0CA5EA40"/>IT does not become <hi>the children of light</hi> to involve in clouds of myſtery, that which ought to appear void of all ambiguity. As far as Ordination, in the primitive times, was the conferring a gift or ability to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe powers peculiar to the ſtate of the Church in that age, we have nothing to do with it; but as far as it is the deſignation or appointment of a qualified perſon to the office of teaching and ruling in the Church of GOD, according to his word, there is nothing myſterious in it. The concurrence of neighbouring Miniſters and Churches in the publick inveſtiture is but an act of communion and a teſtimony of their broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly love.</p>
            <p>IF the Apoſtles were endowed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary powers, thoſe powers have ceaſed with their perſonal Miniſtry. We know of no ſucceſſors to them in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick character, nor do we conceive that there is the leaſt neceſſity for ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, while they themſelves are preſent with us for all the purpoſes of chriſtian edification, in their valuable writings. From them we learn the characters and duties of Goſpel Miniſters: By them Churches are to govern themſelves in their choice, and Miniſters in the exerciſe of their gifts: By an appeal to them we may regulate all our proceedings; and the nearer we conform
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022275_0020_0FB7ACEFD83B0C78"/>
to the ſimplicity, the better ſhall we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the purity of divine inſtitutions. Let the Apoſtles then be heard ſpeaking in the name of their Maſter and of ours; and let no aſſumption of ſpiritual power interpoſe itſelf, as a medium, between CHRIST and his Church. The ſheep will hear the voice of their own ſhepherd; but <hi>they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE claim no ſacerdotal rights by virtue of any real or ſuppoſed uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles. With equal propriety might we ſeek for evidence of our deſcent from Adam, to prove ourſelves hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, as call over the roll of Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops from the Apoſtles to this day, to entitle us to the character of Chriſtian Miniſters. As there are indubitable marks by which it is manifeſt that we are of the human race, without the former; ſo we conceive there are equally diſtinguiſhing and ſatisfactory marks of the Miniſters of CHRIST, without the latter. The children of GOD are made ſuch, by the efficacious influence of his word and SPIRIT; from the ſame ſource are derived the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Goſpel Miniſtry; and the Churches of CHRIST have a right to call to the exerciſe of this office him whom they charitably judge the SPIRIT of GOD has qualified for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022275_0021_0FB7ACF15443C650"/>ON ſuch an occaſion, it is the duty and pleaſure of his brethren, while they bid him welcome as a labourer in the vineyard of their common LORD, to put him in mind of that ſolemn CHARGE which the HOLY GHOST, in the writings of the Apoſtles, has given to him and to themſelves.</p>
            <p>YOU will therefore, my dear Brother, permit me (though your inferiour in age, as well as in other reſpects) to call your attention, at this time, to thoſe ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions which are given by the HOLY GHOST to you and to us.—They are theſe:</p>

            <p>"HOLD faſt the faithful word, as thou haſt been taught; and the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard, in faith and love which is in CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>"WATCH thou in all things, endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, make full proof of thy Miniſtry.</p>

            <p>"BE ſtrong in the grace which is in CHRIST JESUS, and endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier of JESUS CHRIST.</p>

            <p>"THOSE who ſin, rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear. Do nothing by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. Lay hands ſuddenly on no man. Be not partaker of other men's ſins. Keep thyſelf pure.</p>

            <p>"TAKE heed therefore to thyſelf and to all the flock over which the HOLY GHOST hath made thee an overſeer, to feed the Church of GOD which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>THE grand deſign of the Goſpel is to give us information reſpecting another world, and teach us to find our way to heaven; where, as the friends and diſciples of the Son of GOD, we may hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in glory;—where, fed forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon truth, and tranſported with the diſplays of the divine majeſty and beauty, we may ſpend our time with holy angels; with prophets and apoſtles; with martyrs and all our fellow ſaints, in wonder, love and praiſe.</p>
            <p>THE hopes of Chriſtians in relation to theſe their future enjoyments, reſt not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever on the writings of the Goſpel, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of other aid.

corroborate their faith, and is an internal and moſt convincing evidence of the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things which are unſeen, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting in the heavens.</p>
            <p>TO promote the ſtudy of divine truth;— to improve the Chriſtian's graces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his joys, it has ſeemed good to the great Head over all things, to organize the members of his Church by certain eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laws;—<hi>giving ſome, Apoſtles; and ſome, Prophets; and ſome, Evangeliſts; and ſome, Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CONSIDERING that we are all ſeeking the ſame heavenly home;—that we all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame Maſter, and profeſs our hopes and joys to be of the ſame kind— how much does it become the members of CHRIST'S Church, who are now neceſſarily divided into many diſtinct ſocieties, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate and eſteem each other!—Yet not more than it becomes the Miniſters of our common LORD, who are alike engaged in one honourable employment, and when faithful, are alike depending on one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>IN order to encourage this affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Churches and their Paſtors, it has been a cuſtom in our Eccleſiaſtical

            <p>WE ſhall not forget the time when the edifice wherein you formerly worſhipped on this ſpot, was wrapt in flames;—when the houſes in which you dwelled, were laid in aſhes by the fire, and many a heart was ſwelled with terrour at the ſight, and many an eye was bathed with tears.—We behold already a great reverſe of ſcenes;—and whilſt the elegant and goodly fabrick in which we are now aſſembled, affords a very pleaſing ſpecimen of the taſte and genius of the gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">MR.

in compariſon with the one which was loſt by fire, you allow the circumſtance to remind you of that vaſtly more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beneficial exchange to be made on the auguſt and important day, when all the faithful friends of the REDEEMER ſhall be admitted into the temple of GOD above, not made with hands, which, for external beauty and advantage, inconceivably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes any thing that is known on earth, but much more excels in glory, by reaſon of the perfect ſpirituality of its worſhip, the unmingled zeal and affection of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, and that exalted holineſs which ever gives riſe to the moſt enraptured Alleluias, and the profoundeſt praiſe.—For this celeſtial employment, may you here acquire a preparation.—To theſe bleſſed manſions, may you be received in the proper time, and ſo be ever with the LORD.</p>

            <p>THROUGH ſincere repentance for our ſins, and faith in JESUS CHRIST, may we be prepared for his coming. <hi>Then</hi>—when as we once ſaw the former Church upon this ground encircled with the flames, we ſhall behold a general conflagration all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us;—when the whole world ſhall be on fire, and the elements melting with fervent heat, may we ſhout aloud, for our redemption draweth nigh.—Secured by our ſtation near the Son of GOD, may we ſtand unmoved amidſt the wreck of time; and with the ranſomed of the LORD—with ſongs, and everlaſting joy upon our heads, be received into the new heavens and the new earth which are prepared for the ſaints; where righteouſneſs, peace and love ſhall be the ingredients of our felicity, and we ſhall ſing the new anthem, <hi>To him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto GOD and his Father; to him be glory and dominion, forever and ever.</hi>
