            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE liberties of a country, depend upon the light and information poſſeſſed by the people.</p>
            <p>Where the eſtabliſhed forms of worſhip are wrapt in myſtery, there can be no freedom of conſcience. Where the principles of government are dark and intricate, there can be no civil liberty. When attention to buſineſs, fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upright conduct, are not conſidered as the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable means for acquiring eſtates, there can be no proper and ſteady incitement to induſtry, no ſolid happineſs in the poſſeſſion of wealth, or true enjoyment of a competency.</p>
            <p>There happens to be a rage in the preſent day, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring property by accident. Some men are ſuppoſed to have made large fortunes by ſpeculations in the ſtocks and banks: And they who have not been thus fortunate, can diſcover no reaſon, why their neighbors ſhould be thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably diſtinguiſhed from them. And too many are ready to lay aſide their ordinary buſineſs, to purſue <hi>chance</hi> as the only goddeſs worthy of human adoration.</p>
            <p>If the following inquiries can have a tendency to cure the evils ariſing from this ſource, the Writer will be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated for his trouble.</p>
            <p>To underſtand the principles of ſtocks, and banks, it is neceſſary to underſtand the nature and uſe of money; I have therefore, ſelected a number of thoughts from the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:024829_0003_0FCD66C58D02D368"/>The hiſtory of the Bank of England, I have taken from acts of the Britiſh Parliament reſpecting it. That of Paris, is taken from Voltaire's works. And the hints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the other European Banks, are taken from good writers. The whole is attempted with a plain conciſeneſs.</p>
            <p>Where the meaſures of any government are criticized upon, it is done with a decent reſpect, but with the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a free citizen.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>POSSESSIONS, however extenſive they may be, are incapable of yielding happineſs. The wants of men are, for the moſt part, factitious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in proportion to their acquiſitions of property. Nevertheleſs, by a deſire of dominion over external things, and a thirſt for that ſuperiority which ariſes from wealth, we are urged on to exertion. Almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who can achieve a fair proſpect, will exert all his ability to gather the fruit of it. This propenſity, has a manifeſt tendency to the advancement of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt; and will produce the proſperity of the community, where it is exerted; unleſs the public mind is ſo corrupted, as to embrace wealth, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to virtue, by making property a qualification to the public confidence, ſuperior to thoſe of integrity, induſtry, learning, and ability.</p>
            <p>EVERY member of civil ſociety, has a clear right to gain all the property which vigilance and induſtry, reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024829_0005_0FCD66CA011319C8"/>
by the laws of the ſtate, can beſtow upon him. Every thing he acquires in this way, advances the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the public, and ſhews him to be deſerving of applauſe. Such a man, is the juſt man ſpoken of in the ſacred writings. He is not, perhaps, the good man, for whom "one would dare to die;" but he is a character which no one need to fear, and which muſt gain the approbation of his fellow citizens: But the good man, who loves his neighbor as himſelf; who wiſhes to do good unto all; who relieves the diſtreſſes of the poor, in proportion to his ability, and wiſhes the proſperity of all men, as he does his own, is another character. Such men are not every where to be found; and where they are ſeen, they are truſted with caution; becauſe their character is frequently counterfeited, for baſe and vile purpoſes.</p>
            <p>THE divine Author of the human race, has ſeen fit to place us under various, and very different ſituations. Some men appear, as if they were formed for ſucceſsful enterpriſe; and others, as if diſappointment was given them, as the fruit of every undertaking. This is, no doubt, wiſely ordered by HIM whoſe plans are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible to us, and whoſe meaſures are all founded in the moſt perfect wiſdom. But the rules and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, adopted by civil ſociety, ought always to be ſuch, as not to afford to any individual, or particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, an accidental opportunity, or a ſuperior privilege, for the acquirement of property. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are naturally emulous, and it is ſometimes very
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024829_0006_0FCD66CBCA15FC48"/>
difficult to find the line where juſtifiable emulation ends; giving place to the deadly, and corroſive paſſion of <hi>envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREVER the laws, or the meaſures of ſtate policy, give to one man, or one order of men, an excluſive right to acquire property, or a greater and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous opportunity to improve his, or their talents, than is given to all, there is a juſt cauſe of complaint.</p>
            <p>BY a meaſure, which is not founded in perfect equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, a few men may frequently derive great advantages to themſelves, and accumulate great wealth; while others, who are fully as deſerving as they are, remain under the ordinary advantages ariſing from induſtry and frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This tends greatly to the diſquiet and unhappineſs of civil ſociety; becauſe men, who, before they obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an undue and unuſual increaſe of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's property, were contented with their own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, become very uneaſy. They have new and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious wants upon them; and what they before enjoyed as a competency, they now eſteem as only the dreadful tokens of inferiority, and the marks of comparative pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. This is clearly wrong in a free and equal gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. There are ſome men, who will live idly, and repine at that proſperity of their neighbor, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by induſtry and attention to buſineſs; theſe ought to be pitied: but their malady can never be rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edied by human laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024829_0007_0FCD66CD2DDE7E20"/>GREAT eſtates are not originally acquired, unleſs it be by conqueſt, or by commerce. The conqueſt of countries, we hope, will no more deluge the world in blood, or be ever more ſuffered to make the innocent and unoffending inhabitants of newly diſcovered regions, the unhappy victims of cruel avarice. But commerce is intended to give great and beneficial advantages to mankind. It is the life and ſupport of civilized ſtates; and the great medium of communication between the people of different climates. It gives the various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the terraqueous globe, a friendly intercourſe with each other; and will finally, form a chain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and friendſhip throughout the world. To haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this important and glorious event, nothing is needed but a ſpirit of commercial enterpriſe, conducted with fairneſs, and unſhaken integrity.</p>
            <p>COMMERCE had its origin in the ſuperfluous produce of countries, aided by a prevailing taſte of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of each particular climate, for the produce of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign ſoils. This important negociation, no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by exchanging one article for another: a deſire of gain, promoted and ſupported by a curioſity, exiſting naturally in the boſom of the people of all nations, brought it to that height of perfection where we now contemplate it.</p>
            <p>AGRICULTURE, and the arts, purſued with unabat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing induſtry, muſt give ſupport to commerce; for, without this, there never can be a ſuperfluous produce
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024829_0008_0FCD66CEE2F02720"/>
to export, or an enticing mixture of the arts, with the exported articles of produce, to tempt foreign nations to a conſumption of them.</p>
            <p>ORIGINALLY, there could be no ſettled rule for the meaſure of exchanging one commodity for another, or for appreciating or ſettling a fixed value upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles offered in exchange. Their value was founded in the neceſſity of the receiver, and the abundance of the deliverer's ſtock on hand, with the probable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of plenty, or ſcarcity of the article, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of preſerving it to a future period. The value of each article was eſtimated by the eyes, which gave the meaſure of quantity, upon a view of the bulk of the commodity under the power of the transfer. This may be fairly concluded from the practice of uncivilized nations more recently diſcovered. Recuial, in his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the voyages of the Dutch Eaſt-India company, aſſures us, that in the iſland of Formoſa, when firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the inhabitants had no other way of traffic; and travellers, who may be relied upon, tell us, that in Ethiopia, the commerce of gold is carried on ſo at the preſent day.</p>
            <p>THE extenſion and benefits of commerce, could never have been very great under ſuch intolerable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, and clogged with ſo many embarraſſments; it therefore became abſolutely neceſſary, to find out ſomething which would ſerve as the acknowledged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of property, and as the eſtabliſhed ſtandard
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024829_0009_0FCD66D00EA08D78"/>
of the value of the articles paſſing in commerce; for there was no way to bring the articles offered in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, to an exact, or even value with each other, and they were not always, or perhaps frequently, capable of being divided without being injured, or deſtroyed by it.</p>
            <p>METALS offered themſelves, as the moſt ſuitable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for this important purpoſe. As they could not be well ſubjected to liquid, or lineal meaſure, the uſe of weights and balances, were neceſſarily reſorted to. Shells, pieces of particular wood, ſalt, grains, fruits, and other ſubſtances, had been uſed as money, or as the agreed repreſentative of the articles of commerce, and ſome of them are, in various countries, uſed in that way at the preſent time.</p>
            <p>THESE ſigns were very inconvenient and troubleſome, and therefore the moment metals were diſcovered, it was eaſily ſeen that they were well ſuited to this uſe. They were found in all climates where civilization was introduced. Their hardneſs and ſolidity, raiſe them, generally, above the accidents to which other kinds of money are liable. They may be divided without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their value. Their ſcarcity alſo, contributed to raiſe their value in the eſtimation of the world; and the common conſent of commercial people, gave them a currency as the repreſentative and meaſure of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of things in the market.</p>
            <p>IN ſome countries, their inſtitution was very ancient. Abraham brought gold and ſilver from Egypt; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024829_0010_0FCD66D214466A18"/>
to the account given by Moſes, he returned very rich from that country. And we find, that in thoſe days, Abimelech gave Abram one thouſand pieces for a treſpaſs committed againſt him.</p>
            <p>WHEN metals were firſt introduced into commerce as money, their value was determined by their weight alone. There was no ſtamp of public authority upon them, expreſſive of their relative value ariſing from their weight and fineneſs. Abraham gave an hundred ſhekels of ſilver for a ſepulchre, and weighed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people. In ſome countries, where gold and ſilver are uſed as money to this day, they are cut in pieces and paſſed by weight. This is practiſed in ſome parts of China, in Tonquin, and in Abyſſinia.</p>
            <p>THE weighing metals, as money, where commerce is extenſive, muſt be very inconvenient; and therefore it has become neceſſary to fix a ſign, or mark, upon each piece, expreſſive of its true value, according to its weight and fineneſs. If this was to be done by each individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at his pleaſure, there could be no confidence in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them; and therefore it has been conſidered as the prerogatives of government alone, to fix the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of alloy, and the weight of all pieces of metal eſtabliſhed as current money. There is no danger of fraud or deception in this way, for the honor, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the exiſtence of each nation, depends upon their rectitude on this point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:024829_0011_0FCD66D349ED1B70"/>AS antiquarians are much divided in their opinions, reſpecting which nation it was who firſt coined money, I ſhall not attempt to ſettle it in this eſſay. Herodotus aſcribes it to the Lydians, and others to Ithonus the ſon of Ducaliver. Some ſay it was the Aſſyrians; and Diodorus gives it to the Egyptians, becauſe he finds that counterfeiting of it in their country, was very early puniſhed with the amputation of the hand of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</p>
            <p>THE practice of coining money, introduced what is called imaginary money, or money of account. There are no pieces of money now, agreeing with our pounds, ſhillings and pence, or with the French livres, ſols and deniers. But this mode of computation is intended to facilitate the ſtating of accounts, and for keeping them on a regular footing. When money becomes ſcarce, the articles of commerce are lowered proportionably in their price, and they riſe as money grows plenty. But ſtill, the nominal ſtandard uſed in accounts, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Sometimes, when a nation is involved in a war, and the public debt is too great for the public reſourc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the imaginary, or nominal price or value has been raiſed, to the great injury of public or private charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are in ſuch caſes defrauded. Such meaſures are generally evidences of public or private inſolvency, and are ſeldom attempted.</p>
            <p>AS coined metals were eſtabliſhed in the commercial world, as the repreſentative ſign of the articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, if each country poſſeſſed an equal proportion of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024829_0012_0FCD66D48A38CE58"/>
money, according to the quantity of property offered for ſale in it, there would exiſt no other difference of price in the ſame article in different countries, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would ariſe from the tranſportation of it from one country to another, and from the demand for it in the market. Whereas, at preſent, the quantity of money exiſting in a country, has a great effect upon the price of every article. Money is always like water, ſeeking a level; and when it becomes plenty in one country, or place, it is neceſſarily urged away to another. He therefore, who involves himſelf in debt, when money is plenty, is ſure of being injured or ruined, if his debt reſts upon him, until it grows ſcarce.</p>
            <p>THE burden and riſque of tranſporting metals from one place to another, as a general medium of commerce, rendered it neceſſary, to ſelect the moſt valuable of them for that purpoſe. If gold and ſilver were as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as other metals, it would be very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to raiſe their value, ſeparately, ſo much above that of the others, as it now is. There is a fineneſs and beauty in them, which originate and ſupport a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in their favor; but this would not give them the rank they now ſuſtain, if their comparative ſcarcity did not yield a powerful aid in their cauſe.</p>
            <p>THE tranſporting metals, however precious they may be, from one country to another, for the uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, cannot be effected without riſque and expenſe. This difficulty, though ſmall in its appearance, has been ſufficient to produce one other ſign, or evidence of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024829_0013_0FCD66D8CEF4A8B8"/>
wealth, which may be called a ſecondary repreſentative of the articles in commerce. The ideas of a paper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium for this purpoſe, is of very ancient date.</p>
            <p>THE origin of bills of exchange has employed the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inquirers much in the ſame way as they have been employed upon other ancient matters, which had their birth from accident, or neceſſity, and which were thought to be of but little conſequence, when they were at firſt produced. It is generally agreed, that the Jews, when they were baniſhed from France, or the Gibelins, when they were baniſhed from Italy, by the faction of the Guelphs, invented this method of exchange to ſave their effects from confiſcation: thus, by delivering their effects and money to a friend, and taking his bill for a delivery of an equivalent from his effects or credits, in the country where they were to ſeek an aſylum from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, they found the means of an inviſible, eaſy, and ſure mode of procedure, to place their eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of the extended hand of tyranny.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of exchange was encouraged by laws made in England, in the reign of Edward the third. When it was abuſed, by being uſed as an engine of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it was prohibited; but the facility it afforded to the then dawning commerce of that country, again revived, and gave it a legal ſtanding.</p>
            <p>THIS idea of exchange, by a paper medium, introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divers other ſpecies of paper, as the repreſentatives of real money, which aſſumed a value upon the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024829_0014_0FCD66D9CB3D8870"/>
they afforded, of the poſſeſſors having the money on demand; or of the certainty of his receiving it at a future day, with a premium for the uſe of it, until it ſhould be paid.</p>
            <p>ONE ſpecies of this paper, is commonly called <hi>ſtocks.</hi> This word, generally, means a capital uſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, where a number are concerned in a common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and have a capital ariſing from their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſhares. But the appellation, when applied to the funded credits of a government, is entirely arbitrary, and needs an explanation before it can be underſtood: for in this kind of buſineſs, there is no exiſting ſtock, unleſs the plighted public faith may have that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE foundation of this kind of paper, has lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very familiar to the people of America. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public has ſtood in need of aids and ſupplies. The individuals, who form the nation, have afforded theſe ſupplies upon the credit and faith of government. The republic cannot, from its reſources, ſatisfy the demands with real money; they are not poſſeſſed of metals in quantities ſufficient for that purpoſe, and therefore a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and equitable uſe ought to be engaged, for the delay; and the payment of the debt aſſured upon a future day. The premium upon one part of the debt is at ſix per cent. per annum, another at three per cent. and on another there is no proviſion yet in actual execution; but a dependence upon the juſtice and reſources of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024829_0015_0FCD66DB76F3B7F0"/>
nation, is ſuch, as to give the deferred ſtock a value to the poſſeſſors, and a ready exchange in the market, for money, at a certain rate of diſcount.</p>
            <p>WHILE the nation of united America, ſhall be able to pay an annual intereſt with punctuality, upon their public debt, and ſhall convince the poſſeſſors of the public ſecurities that the public reſources are finally equal to the diſcharge of the principal, theſe evidences of a right to receive money will hold a firm and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent value; and the poſſeſſor can at all times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change them for gold and ſilver, becauſe there will be at all times men in the country, who will wiſh to have a part of their property in the hands of others, from whom they may derive a uſe for it, and from whom they may be aſſured to receive it again at a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture period.</p>
            <p>THIS project has furniſhed a large, an active capital, for commerce in this country, and anſwers as extenſive a purpoſe as to internal commerce, as would be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by real money: and ſo far as foreigners are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our public debt, it anſwers the purpoſes of real money for foreign commerce. Nevertheleſs, it is a great grievance and burden to the people; becauſe, while it anſwers ſome of the purpoſes of real money in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the people have to pay a certain rate of intereſt for it, by which thoſe who are in poſſeſſion of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſecurities, derive great pecuniary advantages from the toil and labors of them, who have none. And though the rate of intereſt appears ſmall, yet it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024829_0016_0FCD66DCC96A2800"/>
contribution, and deprives the people who pay it, of a great ſhare of their profits in trade: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore agree with thoſe who conſider a public debt, as a public benefit.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this, there is another conſideration which ought to have weight; it is very poſſible that America may be ſo unfortunate as to be engaged in another war. Large ſupplies may be called for, by which the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the government may exceed its national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and the payment of principal and intereſt may be neceſſarily deferred to a future day. Should this ever happen, the ſtocks will ſink in the hands of the proprietors. Stockjobbers will be multiplied, and public ſecurities be again made the engines of cruelty and oppreſſion. The tranſactions of our own age exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a variety of examples of this kind, and our integrity ought to urge us to every exertion that can have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to prevent a repetition of them. It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly be well to uſe every means which induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, economy, and frugality can point us to, for the ſinking of our public debt. If there is any thing in the obſervation, that a public debt is a ſecurity to a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, it can be only where a government founded on a revolution, is in danger from a counter revolution. Perhaps the idea was introduced into Great-Britain upon the large debt contracted to ſupport the war which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the houſe of Stuarts: If there had been a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revolution there, the men who had aided William with money, would have loſt their property; it was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024829_0017_0FCD66E09F36B900"/>
therefore, in that inſtance, their intereſt to ſupport the government under the revolution. We are very apt to borrow maxims from a nation from whom we derive our common language, without examining their origin, or inquiring ſtrictly into their application to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our own country.</p>
            <p>WHILE there are ſtocks transferable by their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will be ſtockjobbers, or men who will buy and ſell ſtocks for themſelves and others. While this buſineſs is conducted with truth, ſincerity and fairneſs, it may be conſidered as reputable and honorable; but when in this, or in any other buſineſs, chicane, cunning, deceit and fraud, are adopted as the ordinary means of making a good bargain, the men, who practiſe in this way, renouncing the principles of truth, honor and honeſty, are contemptible and dangerous in ſociety.</p>
            <p>IN Europe there are a great number of men who devote themſelves to this kind of traffick, and who avail themſelves of every art and accident to rob the unwary and neceſſitous part of the community. News of victories won by armies which had never ſeen an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, of wars raging where nothing but peace prevails, and of treaties of peace between nations which had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſidered of preliminary articles, furniſh but a ſmall part of the vile means uſed to deceive and defraud the leſs attentive and more induſtrious part of the people.</p>
            <p>IN our own country, and at the preſent day, ſtock-jobbing has not been carried to ſuch a height as it has
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024829_0018_0FCD66E20BE68A10"/>
been in England; but we have no reaſon to conclude that all who have concerned themſelves in the buſineſs have, in every inſtance, taken the ſame care of their neighbors' intereſt as they have done of their own.</p>
            <p>WE have other kinds of paper which we call <hi>bank ſtock.</hi> It may be well, therefore, to ſay ſomething on the nature of banks in general.</p>
            <p>THE word <hi>bank</hi> is derived from the Italian word ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, or banca; becauſe thoſe of that nation who uſed to exerciſe themſelves in this kind of buſineſs in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places of trading cities, ſeated themſelves upon forms with benches to write their letters, count their money, or to draw their bills of exchange. When they failed, and became unable to pay their debts, their benches were broken as a mark of infamy: from which the word bankrupt is derived.</p>
            <p>A BANK now ſignifies a public office for keeping or circulating money, to be employed in exchanges, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the loans of government, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>BANKS are kept by private men on their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or by public bodies incorporated by an act of government for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>PRIVATE bankers are generally men of large proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; their buſineſs is lucrative according to their ſtocks and reputation. By obtaining a credit, and by creating a confidence in the public mind, they induce men who have their property in caſh, to depoſit it in their hands
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024829_0019_0FCD66E38883CB58"/>
for ſecurity; for which the banker gives a paper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the property, aſſuring the punctuality of its being redelivered on demand. This paper being, by its tenor, transferable, the poſſeſſor of it can immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if his banker is known, exchange it for money or for any article in commerce, without any diſcount or depreciation; and derives all the benefits from it which he could derive from real money, without a liability to thoſe accidents which would attend the keeping a large quantity of coin by him. But the value of this paper is founded altogether upon the aſſurance that the money is ready when called for. While this aſſurance exiſts, the bill will continue to circulate with all the credit of real ſpecie; but the moment there ariſes a doubt on this point, it falls into a uſeleſs, worthleſs ſtate.</p>
            <p>TWO principal advantages reſult to the banker from ſuch depoſits. Having ready money by him, he can exchange money for private ſecurities payable at a ſhort but future day, receiving a reaſonable premium for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the ready money. Thus if A, who lives in America, draws a bill of exchange upon B, who lives in Europe, requeſting him to pay to C, or order, one thouſand pounds at ſixty days after the bill ſhall be preſented to him; C, or his aſſignee or indorſer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the bill to B, and gives his acceptance of it; but as C wants the money immediately, he may go to a banker, and if the drawer, acceptor and indorſer, or either of them, can be relied on, the banker will pay the money for a reaſonable diſcount or premium, for wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024829_0020_0FCD66E749259D20"/>
the ſixty days. If there is any hazard in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the premium will be increaſed in proportion to the riſque attending it, and whether it exceeds the legal rate of intereſt or not, there is no law to control it: becauſe the idea of a hazard upon the principal, takes off the idea of illegal uſury.</p>
            <p>THE plan of depoſiting money with a banker, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily led to that of rendering bank notes a currency in the medium of trade. From this idea the banker de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives great advantage, becauſe, that by his buſineſs, there is a conſtant ſtream of caſh iſſuing through his cheſt; by means of which he is enabled to iſſue notes for a much larger ſum than what he holds as his own private property: and thus by premiums on diſcounts he accumulates a profit proportioned to the reputation he ſuſtains, and the opinion the public holds of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and reſponſibility. But this opinion depends for its ſupport altogether on the ſecurity he takes for the notes he emits: ſhould the ſecurities he diſcounts upon, prove in frequent inſtances, to be bad, it will deſtroy his credit, and ruin his buſineſs. The idea he iſſues his notes upon is, that the money is at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the poſſeſſor of them; and the ſecurities he takes conſtitute a part of the ſtock wherein this aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is grounded; and in proportion as they fail in their punctuality, the ſtock fails on which he iſſues his notes. It is very extraordinary and curious, to ſee how far the men concerned in this kind of buſineſs in England, France and Holland, are capable of deciding inſtantly,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024829_0021_0FCD66E8CD0E0698"/>
upon the credit of the drawer and acceptor of every bill of exchange offered to them for a diſcount: it ſhews alſo, in a very convincing manner, what great proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy men can make in a buſineſs to which nature has fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and to which alone they pay all their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC banks are corporations eſtabliſhed by legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, with an expectation in the government of deriving certain aids and ſupplies from them.</p>
            <p>THE bank of England, from the nature of its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, cannot be conſidered as a public national bank, becauſe the nation owns no part of the ſtocks which compoſe it, although the public derive great advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from it, by way of loans given upon the diſcount of certain and fixed annuities. Where there is a national bank the intereſt of every conſiderable private banker is quite incompatible with it: hence in England, becauſe of the national advantages derived from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bank, the parliament have laid private bankers under certain reſtrictions; and, amongſt others, that contained in a ſtatute made in the reign of Ann, which provides that there ſhall be no aſſociation of more than ſix per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in their private capacity, for the buſineſs of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The number of ſeparate private bankers in that country, is, however, very great; but the ſums they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are not conſiderable enough to interfere with the buſineſs of the public bank, which could not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend to ſmall diſcounts without great inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:024829_0022_0FCD66EA48733D10"/>THE convenience of placing ſpecie in banks, where it is ſecured by ſtrong bars and faithful guards from thieves, and by deep vaults from the ravages of the flames, is found to be ſo great in commercial countries, that it is univerſally adopted. The poſſeſſion of paper which bears a demand for an immediate exchange of gold and ſilver, without a poſſibility of denial, gives it all the advantages as a circulating credit which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination can conceive of. Such paper embraces all the articles of commerce; and in countries where public faith and private banks are well eſtabliſhed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial opinion, there is but very little real money uſed as the meaſure of trade.</p>
            <p>IN a commercial country it is of but very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to have a bank in credit with the people of the country where it exiſts, unleſs it poſſeſſes the faith of foreigners coming there to trade.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC banks are of two kinds; thoſe of the firſt are wholly inſtituted on the public account, and placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of magiſtrates, or officers of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, who are to take care of the bullion or ſpecie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in them for the uſe of the proprietors, and by their order to be managed for profit or advantage. Such is the famous bank in Amſterdam, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ſo much fidelity and exactneſs, that one of the magiſtrates was executed for appropriating a ſmall ſum, although he returned it in a ſhort ſpace of time, and before the fact was diſcovered. The regulation of that bank is ſuch as gives it the higheſt public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024829_0023_0FCD66EEE8AB4910"/>
by means of which there is ſcarcely an inſtance of any money which has once been there depoſited, having been taken out. Convinced, that the money is always ready when demanded, the man who is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a payment from another, is contented to appear at the bank, and to be credited the ſum in bargain, on the bank books; and he again transfers it in the ſame way to another; ſo that the ſame ſum will be paſſed in a thouſand payments without being ſeen, weighed or count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any one, excepting him who firſt depoſited it in the bank. Thus millions are negociated in a week, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing or counting money. This eaſy mode of doing buſineſs is ſupported by an unſhaken confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the money is ready at all times, when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by the perſon in poſſeſſion of the paper eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial of its being depoſited. Should this confidence be once brought into doubt, all the authority of a moſt arbitrary government, exerted by a moſt vindictive and independent magiſtracy, would not be able to maintain the character of the bank, or to give currrency to its credits for one day.</p>
            <p>IT is confidently aſſerted by writers, that the money depoſited in this bank amounts to three thouſand tons of gold, or as ſome ſay twenty eight millions ſterling. Sir William Temple, who examined that bank with the prejudice of an incredulous Engliſhman, tells us, that <q>the place where the treaſure of this celebrated bank is lodged, is a great vault under the town houſe, provided with doors, locks, and every other ſecurity
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024829_0024_0FCD66F04AE5C3B0"/>
neceſſary to the preſervation of the contents. And that whoever goes there will diſcover a vaſt treaſure in bars and ingots of ſilver plate, and alſo an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of ſacks full of metal, ſaid to be gold and ſilver; but as there are none but the Burgomaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who have the direction of this bank, and as there are none who keep an account of what is brought in, or carried out, it is impoſſible to know, or even to gueſs, with exactneſs, the proportion there is between the real and imaginary treaſure of it. It does not ſolely depend upon the effective gold and ſilver actually depoſited for its credit, but is ſupported by the credit of the city and of the ſtates; of which the funds and revenues are as great as thoſe of ſome kingdoms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BY the conſtitution of this bank and the laws of the ſtate, all the payments on bills of exchange, and for wholeſale goods, are to be made at the bank only, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſum is not ſo high as three hundred guilders; ſo that the debtor is obliged to carry his money into the bank, and the creditor is obliged to go there to receive it.</p>
            <p>WRITERS ſay that the city of Amſterdam is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the real magnificence in which it appears, by the profits of this inſtitution, while all the people are fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to lodge their money where it will ſafely reſt ſecured from every poſſible accident, and where they can uſe it without the trouble of telling or of weighing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:024829_0025_0FCD66F1C87E7428"/>THIS bank makes no negociable bills, but gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts for money depoſited, which are good to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor for the ſum mentioned, and which may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by certain eſtabliſhed forms.</p>
            <p>THE profits of this bank are immenſe, though the ſources of them are concealed with the uſual ſecreſy and ſilence of the Dutch people. But it may be eaſily ſeen that they give receipts for depoſits, which exiſt only in ſecurities, and on which they receive unlimited premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums for their diſcounts.</p>
            <p>THE bank of Paris was erected upon the ſcheme of Mr. Law, a Scotchman, in the year 1716; and in its hiſtory gives a ſtriking inſtance of the impracticability of ſupporting a paper medium without an unfailing aſſurance of a ready exchange for ſpecie.</p>
            <p>THIS attempt was made during the regency of the Duke of Orleans, and has been very ſeverely treated by Engliſh writers; but the account here given of it is taken from Voltaire's works, and may be relied on.</p>
            <p>THERE are two claſſes or characters of men who are naturally avaricious; the one is compoſed of them who heap up wealth with an ambitious view to excel their neighbors in point of property; the other of them, who have no regular bounds to their expenditures, and are therefore always ſtreightened in their finances, let their income be what it may. The regent of France was in the latter claſs. His demands for money in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024829_0026_0FCD66F691078328"/>
and in his public capacity, were inſatiable; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore, for affording ample ſupplies, was very flattering to him.</p>
            <p>MR. Law projected his plan upon principles which, if they had been ſtrictly purſued, would have been an improvement on all the preceding plans in Europe; but he wiſhed to flatter the court. He propoſed that he and his aſſociates ſhould ſupply the funds that ſhould be adminiſtered by the authority of the government; and that the bank ſhould have the appellation of the bank royal. This plan was approved by the council, and was finally adopted.</p>
            <p>THE bank thus organized, effected all the purpoſes which were expected from it. The quantity of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating medium was exceedingly increaſed. The people had a great facility in the payment of impoſts. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce received new life, and derived new vigor from the aid of the inſtitution. In the ſecond year of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, the government ordained that the bank notes ſhould be received as caſh in every branch of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
            <p>THE ſucceſs of the bank was ſo aſtoniſhing, that in the ſecond year the government wiſhed to be the ſole proprietor, as well as the only director of it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly purchaſed all the ſtock.</p>
            <p>THE power of this government being uncontrola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the plan of urging into circulation a medium by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024829_0027_0FCD66F7CCB62680"/>
the voice of ſovereign authority, without adequate funds for the ſupport of it, was conceived. The event was ſuch as might be expected. The bank notes were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to exceed the real ſpecie depoſited and the funds provided as a conſtituent for them, and they therefore depreciated with great rapidity. In the year 1722, they were thrown out of circulation; and one writer obſerves that they were not finally worth the value of the paper on which they were printed. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in that country received a ſhock from which it has never been recovered. The finances of the nation became deranged, and the ability of the government was exceedingly diſgraced.</p>
            <p>THERE were men then who made great eſtates from the public calamity; and by the ſplendor of their fortunes intoxicated the people in England and in the Netherlands. Hence aroſe the South Sea bubble in Great Britain, divers mad ſchemes in Holland, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous land bank in New-England, which for ſeveral years controled the elections of the province, created incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confuſion, and finally ruined a great number of families.</p>
            <p>THE emiſſion of paper bills of credit in the New-England ſtates was firſt no other than the anticipation of particular taxes; but as the ſpecie could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to be exchanged for them at all times when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they could not avoid a depreciation. This depreciation virtually leſſened the quantity of medium, and created a neceſſity for a further emiſſion; whence
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024829_0028_0FCD66F948EEE938"/>
it has happened that there never has been an inſtance of emitting bills but where they have been redeemed at a depreciated value, if redeemed at all.</p>
            <p>NEW-HAMPSHIRE had paper money at all times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 1768. The ſituation and character of the people were changed for the better, almoſt immediately on their having a regular, unfluctuating medium of commerce.</p>
            <p>RHODE-ISLAND being more out of the control of the government of the mother country, has always had a paper medium, or a bank without ſtock. The effects are too eaſily ſeen to need a comment.</p>
            <p>THE bank of Genoa is the moſt ancient bank in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; the date of its inſtitution is not certainly known. This bank was firſt conſtituted from certain branches of the public revenue, upon which, ſums were borrowed during the exigencies of the commonwealth, and which, for a long time, were not violated through any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. But by their ſtate being involved in the wars of the laſt and preſent centuries, they exhauſted their treaſury, went beyond their public reſources, and for ever deſtroyed the credit of their bank. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of their country died with it. The ſtate loſt, and has never yet regained its importance.</p>
            <p>THESE are not the only inſtances which hiſtory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords of the extreme folly of attempting to ſupport the credit of a paper repreſentative of money by the mere authority of government, without being able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024829_0029_0FCD66FC09DA56C0"/>
real money, promptly, to ſupport the credit of it.</p>
            <p>THE ſituation of all the ſtates ſeverally in 1775, and of all conjointly repreſented at that time in Congreſs, produced inſtances where the moſt determined patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, ſtruggling for what was juſtly conſidered as the foundation of all that could render life and property worthy of poſſeſſing, attempted in vain to ſupport a paper credit upon the mere authority of law. Severe penalties were annexed to even ſpeaking againſt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the currency. Very ſingular and terrible tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were inſtituted, with ſummary and arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, to puniſh thoſe who dared to conſider the ſigns of money, which never exiſted, as unequal to gold and ſilver; but all was ineffectual, the depreciation became exceedingly rapid. It was with great addreſs ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the money did not fall, but that the articles of commerce roſe in conſequence of the war. And the two laſt remedies attempted, were ſtopping the auctions and regulating prices by laws. Had the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture admitted of paper bills of credit, where there was no real money to exchange for them, being capable of repreſenting the money of the world, theſe efforts could not have failed of ſucceſs, more eſpecially when the greateſt penalty of all was the ſtigma of a want of pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm, and the unhappy offender's being held up to the people, by committees, as an enemy to his country's liberty.</p>

            <p>THERE are other public banks in Europe; but there is no neceſſity of paying a particular attention to them in this eſſay, excepting that which is eſtabliſhed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in London. For by the obſervations already made upon others, and which ſhall be made on that, the general principles, as well as the public utility of banks, under proper limitations, will be ſeen.</p>
            <p>IN former times, the idea of improving the public credit, as an active efficient capital, with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a full, circulating medium, was never conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The kings of the nations in Europe, when preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the exigencies of the ſtate, uſed to borrow money on pledging the jewels of the crown, or on mortgag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lands of the royal domain, or by ſome other pledges of valuable property.</p>
            <p>THE Jews are remarkable for ſtrong traits of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al character, but for none more than their ability and adroitneſs in managing money. When they were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed France, and Italy, they reſorted to Germany, and to the Netherlands; where they were cordially received, and where their invention for turning money to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, increaſed their own wealth, and inſtructed their neighbors to increaſe theirs.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:024829_0031_0FCD66FE90087A18"/>WHEN William the third, had expelled James from the throne of England, and had, by the war through which that revolution was effected, involved the nation in a heavy debt, he had recourſe to the principles, and the practices of the children of Iſrael for relief. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exigencies of his affairs, his miniſters introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plans, which other nations, as well as America, have been glad to imitate. Amongſt which was that of the famous bank of England. One Mortimer, who wrote in the year 1761, ſuppoſes that William had been initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the principles of ſtate banking, at Amſterdam, by his friends of that city.</p>
            <p>THIS bank was erected in the year 1693, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence in June 1694. The king and queen, by an act of parliament, were empowered to iſſue their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, under the great ſeal, appointing commiſſioners to take ſubſcriptions by any perſons, natives or foreigners, for raiſing one million two hundred thouſand pounds: and the parliament agreed to raiſe one million five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds upon certain annuities, and to pay the governor and company of the bank one hundred thouſand pounds annually. The bank loaned the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment one million ſix hundred thouſand pounds. The one million two hundred thouſand pounds was the ſtock in real money, depoſited by the ſubſcribers, and the debt due from the government on the above loan, and for which was pledged the faith of parliament upon the above ſtipulated annuities, conſtituted another part of the ſtock. The bank ſtock has been increaſed by
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024829_0032_0FCD6700091E1370"/>
new ſubſcriptions, according to divers acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the charter of the bank continued during the exiſtence of the annuities pledged by government for the money borrowed. The laſt act of parliament for that purpoſe was made in the year 1781, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a loan of two millions to pay off a debt of the navy department.</p>
            <p>THE acts regulating the bank, provide that their debts ſhall never exceed their capital ſtock, and that if they ſhould, at any time, exceed the capital, the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual members ſhall be liable, of their own private eſtates, for ſuch exceſs. The money lent to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment being on the credit of the nation, that credit is conſidered as good ſtock, becauſe certain duties are irrepealably pledged; and there can be no reaſon to believe that any poſſible exigency would induce them to violate their faith in a matter upon which the credit and commerce of their nation ſo much depends. A failure in that bank would derange the finances of the government, deſtroy their commerce for a time at leaſt, and involve the nation in a great and almoſt irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calamity. To prevent this, the parliament guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees the credits of the bank, by providing that their notes or bills, drawn to the amount of one hundred thouſand pounds, originally payable by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annually, and the increaſe of that ſum, by ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts on loans, ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from the others; and if they ſhall be demanded at the bank on days of diſcount, between the hours of nine and twelve
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024829_0033_0FCD67049FD31458"/>
in the forenoon, and not paid, then, on affidavit being made of the fact, they ſhall be immediately paid in the exchequer, without any further proceſs or delay, and without any other warrant. The ſums ſo paid, are to be charged to the one hundred thouſand pounds, and the increaſe of it annually payable by the nation to the bank. The other credits are warranted by act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, providing, that when judgment ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered againſt the governor and company of the bank, and the money not paid on producing the execution, that the ſame ſhall be brought into the exchequer, and be there diſcharged by the public treaſury without any further warrant or delay. This proviſion is abſolutely neceſſary to the credit of the company, becauſe their private eſtates are not liable for any thing more than what their debts ſhall exceed their capital, and their corporate property cannot become at to be taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>THE intereſt originally allowed by the nation to the bank, was four pounds for the annual loan of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; but it was afterwards, on other loans, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to four and an half per cent. on others again to four; and on the loan of 1781 it was reduced to three per cent.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee, that this mighty piece of machinery, on which almoſt all the national movements of Great-Britain depend, is ſupported by the certainty which the creditors realize, that they can receive, when they ſhall call for it, the real money for their paper, evidential of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024829_0034_0FCD67060AE3DF50"/>
the depoſit. Some of their writers have advanced prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which no ſober man will agree in, that a nation has a right to eſtabliſh what they pleaſe for a medium of commerce, and that it is quite immaterial what that medium is compoſed of. If by this aſſertion they mean, that a people, by their unconſtrained, common conſent, have a right to receive what they pleaſe in exchange for articles of commerce, they are right; and this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, or meaſure of appreciation, is money to all who receive and can paſs it. But there is no government, however forcible it may be in other matters, which can impoſe any thing beſides the precious metals, on the people, as money, for any conſiderable time together. The paper of the bank of England is the money of that country, but it is not eſtabliſhed as ſuch, by legal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It was never attempted as a tender for debts, but has reſted on the voluntary conſent of the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial people, as receivable on the idea, that it repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money which is at all times ready to be produced.</p>
            <p>SOME of their writers beſtow the moſt extravagant encomiums on this inſtitution; while others, who are apparently as patriotic, as learned, and as candid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it as a bubble which will finally burſt; as an engine of oppreſſion and cruelty which tends to tyranny, and will finally ruin the nation.</p>
            <p>THE bank of the United States of America, is on principles of the ſame claſs with thoſe on which the bank of England is eſtabliſhed, but depends upon the credit of the government for a greater proportion of its
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024829_0035_0FCD6707DADF8440"/>
ſtock. There is only one quarter part of that ſtock in real money; the other three quarters are in public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of the public funded debt at ſix per cent. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and three per cents. at half the nominal value. The value of them ſecurities depends upon the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their final payment, and on the punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the intereſt ſtipulated. Should there be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a failure in either of theſe, the credit of the bank would be proportionably injured; but them ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are, by the economy of the treaſury, ſo blended with that of the bank, and that of the bank with the exiſtence of the government, that they muſt be the laſt pillars which will be ſuffered to be overturned by a public calamity. Whether it was either fair or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give, in the operation of this ſyſtem, particular holders of a part of them kind of public ſecurities this great advantage, is not neceſſary now to be decided: but the advantages reſulting from a part of the ſtock, being compoſed of them, is ſo immenſe, that the bank cannot fail of a ſupport, as far as the proprietors are able to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>SEVEN millions and an half of dollars, three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſtock which ariſes from the ſubſcription of individuals, is compoſed of them ſecurities; ſo that this three quarters of the ſtock, are a loan to government, upon ſix per cent. intereſt, and the ſtockholders have a right to iſſue bank notes to the full amount of their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, at the ſame rate of intereſt, by means whereof the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of the bank, have a legal right to receive twelve
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024829_0036_0FCD670908864FE0"/>
per cent. upon that part of their ſtock; and this makes a uſe of ten and an half on the whole, including the part which conſiſts in hard money. Upon this idea, the ſubſcribers to the bank would have been glad to have ſunk the intereſt to three per cent. if they could not have become ſubſcribers without. The advantage ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their having a right to extend their credits to the amount of all the money depoſited for ſafekeeping; and the determination of the treaſury to depoſit all the monies ariſing from the revenue in their hands, is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly great, that this would have been a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the ſide of the ſtockholders at three per cent. for their ſecurities.</p>
            <p>THE debts due from the corporation are never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their capital, and the money actually depoſited in the bank for ſafekeeping. They are not to trade, or to buy or ſell any thing but bills of exchange, and ſilver and gold; and ſhould their debts ever exceed ther capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the ſpecie in depoſit for ſafekeeping, in ſuch caſe the directors who iſſue the notes, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors who ſhall be then preſent, and ſhall not enter their diſſent to the meaſure, ſhall be liable in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and in their private eſtates.</p>
            <p>BY the above proviſion, the creditors of the bank are completely ſecured, provided that the directors and acting proprietors are either faithful, or of ſufficient ability. Should this precaution be inadequate, there are other checks provided, which are able to afford the higheſt aſſurances that can be raiſed on the principles of banking upon public credit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:024829_0037_0FCD670C3B235FB0"/>THE officer at the head of the treaſury department, has, by the act of incorporation, full authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſtate of the debts, and credits; an account of their ſtock actually exiſting in effective money, and of the depoſits in their hands; moreover, the act provides, that their notes ſhall be received in the payment of all duties and revenues, in the room of real money. This will give the bank a credit as extenſive as the quantity of money in demand, for all impoſts, exciſes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and fully guarantees their credit, unleſs they ſhall ſwell it beyond the limits of the revenue. Upon every view of this corporation, we muſt conclude, that while ſo great a part of their ſtock ſhall conſiſt of public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, and the credit of them ſhall be fully ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the advantages of the bank will be exceedingly great to the proprietors. The United States further guarantee the ſeven million and an half of dollars, by allowing them to be in public ſecurities. The advantages of this corporation by far exceed any thing of the kind which has heretofore been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excepting the Pariſian bank: that was attempted as a public, this is a private advantage.</p>
            <p>THERE can be no wonder that the opening a ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which offered ſuch immenſe and unprecedented profits to the people who ſhould be lucky enough to be concerned, ſhould raiſe ſuch a buſtle among the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators in paper ſecurities, and finally afford ſo much chagrin at the diſappointment of the unſucceſsful part of the community. If the members of congreſs had been
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024829_0038_0FCD670D8CB743A8"/>
men of like paſſions with the other citizens of America, poſſeſſing the ſame jealouſy in regard to private intereſt which men generally have in private life, we might have wondered that they ſhould ſuffer a few men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch extraordinary privileges in excluſion of all others, and to raviſh very great eſtates from the public exigency, which others were as fairly entitled to as they were. Congreſs ſeemed to have been aware of what was to be expected upon opening the ſubſcription; for they attempted what, perhaps, ſome of them thought to be a ſure and ſalutary preventative, by the ſupplement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary act. By that it was provided, that no one perſon ſhould ſubſcribe more than thirty ſhares in one day; but no proviſion was made againſt ſubſcribing in falſe or in unauthorized names. It was clearly evident that the ſubſcribers would throng on the occaſion; and yet no effectual meaſures were adopted to prevent monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, frauds and impoſitions.</p>
            <p>THESE advantages were foreſeen by nearly all the people; but the members of congreſs did not diſcern them in their public capacity. The houſe appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive ſubſcriptions, was, as ſoon as the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious day dawned, crouded by an incredible number of people: if a golden mountain had been kindled, emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from its crater a lava of the pureſt gold, liquid, yet tangable, the croud would not have been greater, or exhibited more intenſe eagerneſs to ſhare in the plunder.</p>
            <p>THOSE who appeared on this occaſion, were not all of them patriots, who had ſaved their country, or the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024829_0039_0FCD670F09FAAC18"/>
moſt deſerving part of the community of united Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. The men who had riſqued their lives in the war, or who had parted with their patrimonies or hard earned eſtates, to ſave the public liberty, ſtood at a diſtance, and with aſtoniſhment beheld the ſingular and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phenomenon. The ſecurities which they received for their ſervices and properties, in the place of gold or ſilver, and had ſold at two ſhillings and ſix pence in the twenty ſhillings, reſumed their priſtine value in the hands of their new poſſeſſors, and greatly enlarged their new and unexpected value by the machinery of the American bank.</p>
            <p>AS an apology for ſuch undue advantages to a part of civil ſociety, it is ſaid, that it is of no conſequence to the government which of the citizens poſſeſſes the property. This is not true: a great part of our wants are factitious, ariſing from what we ſee in the poſſeſſion of others; and therefore, when a few men, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of operation in the laws of the ruling power, accumulate fortunes, and live in unequalled ſplendor, it corrupts the taſte of the other part of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and draws their attention from their ordinary means of buſineſs. It produces a ſpirit of envy, and renders thoſe unhappy, who before had been quite contented with their ſituation. There are but a ſmall part of mankind who can look with contentment, like David, on the greatneſs of wicked men, and conſole them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are only like a green bay tree, which flouriſhes for a little time, and then is not to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:024829_0040_0FCD6712C8A21158"/>GOLD and ſilver is the acknowledged repreſentative of property of every kind; but paper is the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of nothing but money; and where the money is not actually exiſting, ready to be exchanged for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then the paper repreſents nothing but public or private credit, and the credit may be good or bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a variety of different circumſtances, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and events.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD not do juſtice to my readers if I did not tranſcribe a page from a pamphlet written by Dr. Price, on the nature of civil liberty, in the year 1776.</p>
            <q>
               <p>SPECIE repreſents ſome real value in goods or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; on the contrary, paper repreſents immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately nothing but ſpecie; it is a promiſe or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the emitter brings himſelf under to pay a given ſum in coin; and it owes its currency to the credit of the emitter, or to an opinion that he is able to make good his engagement, and that the ſum ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified may be received upon being demanded. Paper, therefore, repreſents coin; and coin repreſents real value, that is, the one is a ſign of wealth, the other is the ſign of that ſign. But farther, coin is a univerſal ſign of wealth, and will procure it every where, it will bear any alarm, and ſtand any ſhock; on the contrary, paper, owing its currency to opinion, has only a local and imaginary value. It can ſtand no ſhock. It is deſtroyed by the approach of danger, or even of the ſuſpicion of danger. In ſhort, coin is the baſis of our paper credit, and were it either deſtroyed, or were only
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024829_0041_0FCD6713E2DAE9A0"/>
the quantity of it reduced beyond a certain limit, the paper circulation of the kingdom would ſink at once.</p>
               <p>FROM this account it follows, that, as far as in any circumſtances ſpecie is not to be procured in exchange for paper, it repreſents nothing, and is worth nothing. The ſpecie of this kingdom is inconſiderable, compared with the amount of the paper circulating in it. This is generally believed, and therefore it is natural to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how its currency is ſupported. The anſwer is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: it is ſupported in the ſame manner with other bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Were all to demand ſpecie in exchange for their notes, payment could not be made; but at the ſame time that this is known, every one truſts that no alarm will happen while he holds the paper he is poſſeſſed of; and that if it ſhould happen he will ſtand a chance to be firſt paid, and this makes him eaſy: but let any event happen that threatens danger, and every one will become diffident. A run will take place, and a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy follow.</p>
               <p>THE account I have given of paper circulation, implies, that nothing can be more delicate or hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it is an immenſe fabric with its head in the clouds, that is continually trembling with every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe blaſt and fluctuation of trade; and which, like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, may, in a moment, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and leave not a wreck behind.</p>
               <p>KING William's wars drained the kingdom of ſpecie: they ſunk the revenue and diſtreſſed the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024829_0042_0FCD671536AC9CD0"/>
In 1694 the bank was eſtabliſhed, and the kingdom was provided with a ſubſtitute for ſpecie; ever ſince that period our paper and taxes have been increaſing together and ſupporting one another.</p>
            </q>
            <p>IT was expected at that time, that Doctor Price's pamphlet would have had ſome tendency to prevent the miniſtry of Great-Britain from proſecuting the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war: but as we had nothing ourſelves to depend upon but bills of public credit; and theſe too without any ſpecie, or any public ſtipulated funds whereon to found them; the argument was ſtronger againſt us, than againſt our enemies. We had however, been in ſome meaſure uſed to a paper medium, and enthuſiaſm ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of faith, and confidence: and whilſt the people parted with their property to defend their rights, they conſidered all as a neceſſary ſacrifice to liberty.</p>
            <p>MANKIND have a natural diſinclination to labor and exertion. In a ſtate of nature, hunger is a ſtimulous to the ſavage, or he would continue idle and inactive. In ſociety, ambition, that natural, and avarice, that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial paſſion, urge men to exertion; but nevertheleſs, labor is irkſome, and all they who can deviſe ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er method of gratifying their inclinations, and obeying the commands of their paſſions, will moſt certainly do it: hence it is, that we find every one, who can drive a bargain to advantage, forſaking the plough to do it.</p>
            <p>MONEY is ſcarce or plenty in a country, according to the demand for it. As it repreſents the articles expoſed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024829_0043_0FCD6716942A3B40"/>
to commerce, and as commerce increaſes in proportion to the quantity of money found to purſue it with, there can never be a very long ſpace of time together in which money can be plenty in compariſon with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it.</p>
            <p>THE public ſecurities of the United States of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica were a dead, inactive kind of property, previous to the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution of the new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they then became at once the object of avarice. They before had an exiſtence, as to value, on the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope of having ſomething done for them at ſome diſtant future period; and obtained a motion only from the ſagacity of a few, who happened to be right in their conjectures reſpecting the then future events of American financiering. Upon the adoption of the new ſyſtem of government, they aſſumed all the properties of a riſing credit, and became an immenſe active capital for commerce; but not for ſuch a commerce as was advantageous to the people; their activity centered in themſelves; and while they ſwelled the medium, they created proportionably a demand for more. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſucceſs of ſome ſpeculators, increaſed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber engaged in that kind of traffic, until the great towns and cities were filled with that kind of gentry.</p>
            <p>THE plan of the bank ſtill gave a new force to this kind of traffic, for it gave an opportunity to ſome part of the community to turn their ſpeculations to immenſe and unexpected advantage. While all the public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024829_0044_0FCD671809B3DF18"/>
might be conſidered as an active medium, the conſtitution of the bank gave the proprietors authority to add ſeven millions and an half of dollars to the whole: beſides this, their having authority to iſſue notes in proportion to the money actually depoſited for ſafekeeping, will prevent the dormancy in effect of any real money.</p>
            <p>WE owe ſpecie for all the paper which is now in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and yet the ſpecie in fact in the country, bears no proportion to it. This has been the caſe with us before; for we have once and again crouded the ſpecie out of the country by floods of paper money, and have paſſed through two or three ſtates of national bankruptcy with all the calmneſs of a company of philoſophers.</p>
            <p>SOLOMON tells us that the rich have many friends; but our Secretary of the Treaſury, by making others rich, has obtained money; and his reputation derives ſupport, as well from the greatneſs of his character for enterpriſe, as from the pecuniary intereſt which ſo many rich men have in the ſupport of it. But the game he has played is very deep, as well as very ſplendid, and the whole fabric he has raiſed with ſo much eclat, may be at once overthrown by a run upon the bank. He will therefore guard, with the utmoſt caution, the emitting quality of it; for ſhould it ever be induced by the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the public, or by any other means, greatly to exceed its capital, he may have to follow Mr. Law to Venice, in order to find an aſylum from the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. When he ſhall be removed from office, it
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024829_0045_0FCD6719F31D4038"/>
will be difficult to find a ſucceſſor who ſhall obtain the confidence which he has acquired, and the day of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion will, no doubt, be a day of hazard, expectation and anxiety.</p>
            <p>THE bank of the United States muſt be maintained, if it can be done, by the means of credit. But while the bank of England, which owes no more than ſixteen millions ſterling more than its ſpecie capital ſtock, has the ſupport of a nation which has in circulation ſixty millions; the bank of the United States, which will owe ſeven, perhaps eleven millions of dollars more than its capital ſtock in ſpecie, is ſupported by a nation in which there is not exiſting more than eight millions of dollars in ſpecie; its ſituation muſt deſerve great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and its economy be taken care of with great circumſpection.</p>
            <p>THE government of Great-Britain, in order to ſecure their bank, are under a neceſſity of reſtraining and of regulating even private bankers, while all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in united America are vieing with each other in eſtabliſhing private banks, or banks for the benefit of private companies. In fact, the idea of a paper curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is ſo familiar with us, that we ſeem incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting any one temptation that is offered to us for the emiſſion of paper bills of credit. If this ſpirit continues to prevail, according to the ideas and on the principles at preſent advocated, our bank bills will very ſoon be on a par with the old continental money. The bank of the United States, on which the honor and ſafety of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024829_0046_0FCD671C888964F0"/>
the nation ſo effectually depends, will be exceedingly injured, if not rendered inſecure and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>AMIDST the various ſchemes which have been adopted for giving a currency to paper bills, that of eſtabliſhing the corporation called the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bank,</hi> is the one which deſerves the moſt attention. When nations have been preſſed with expenſive wars, or other intolerable calamities, they have had recourſe to their public credit; in the ſupport of which, every member of the civil community has been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure intereſted. But the idea of giving a few men a corporate capacity to iſſue, regulate, and control the medium of commerce among a great trading peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was before unprecedented, and ſerves rather to evince the inattention than the ſkill of thoſe who eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it.</p>
            <p>THIS plan was conceived in the year 1785, in a time of profound peace, and without any view to ſink a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt, or to procure a public conveniency; it was an indulgence to a few men in the ſtate, who happened to aſk the legiſlature to grant it to them, without the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of any kind of reward. By means of this authority, the proprietors of that bank have had it in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to govern the medium of commerce in and about the metropolis of the ſtate. By emitting large ſums they have raiſed the price of public ſecurities, and of other articles in the market; and by refuſing again to loan, have brought on an artificial ſcarcity of money, and ſunk the price of the ſame articles; this has given
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024829_0047_0FCD671E08C4E750"/>
them all the advantages which could be gathered from the moſt enormous monopolies. Trade has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by a capricious and unſteady medium; great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of property, more eſpecially public ſecurities, have been ſacrificed to a punctuality, to a corporation which never had it in its power to be punctual itſelf if there had been a run upon it.</p>
            <p>THE ſubſcribers to this bank, with their aſſociates, were incorporated without any limitation of time or credits. Their ſtock is never to exceed five hundred thouſand pounds; but, upon this, they <hi>had</hi> a right to iſſue as much paper as they could obtain a market for, and were under no obligation as to the quantity of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital, only that it ſhould not exceed the ſum abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and let them iſſue as much as they will, the public, or the holders of their notes, have no remedy againſt their private eſtates. This is an agreed point, for the ſhares being transferable in their nature, it is quite impoſſible to know who the proprietors are. The act of congreſs for eſtabliſhing the bank of the United States, has provided, that the directors and the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors actually preſent, when there ſhall be an agreement to iſſue more than their capital and depoſits, ſhall be held liable in their natural capacity. The ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made by parliament reſpecting the bank of England; from all which we may conclude, that the proprietors are not liable by law in their natural capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, without ſuch proviſion; for if they were ſo lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all the debts of the corporation, there could be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024829_0048_0FCD672057AB5768"/>
no neceſſity for the ſpecial proviſion in the inſtitution of a bank.</p>
            <p>THE notes iſſued by the Maſſachuſetts' bank are not by force of any law receivable in taxes or revenues, or a tender in any caſe as money; neither are they in any other manner warranted to the poſſeſſors by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. They are iſſued under the authority of the government, and yet the ſtate is not reſponſible for their credit.</p>
            <p>THE corporation of the Maſſachuſetts' bank then amounts to nothing more than an authority delegated to a few men, in excluſion of all others, to make as much paper money as they ſhall pleaſe to iſſue, and to draw an intereſt upon it from the borrower at ſix per cent.</p>
            <p>THEY have not failed to improve an authority ſo very ſingular and advantageous, for they have had nearly one million of dollars in circulation at a time, when they had no pretenſions to have in their vault more than two hundred thouſand dollars. This gave them an intereſt of thirty per cent. upon their real money, if they had the ſum abovementioned actually depoſited in ſtock, while the reſt of the community were under heavy penalties if they ſhould take more than ſix per cent. for the loan of their monies.</p>
            <p>THE General Court, in their ſeſſion of the winter 1792, became alarmed at the operation of this bank; but, perhaps, the alarm was given by the men who were intereſted in the northern branch of the American
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024829_0049_0FCD6722101F9810"/>
bank. They ſent a committee who inquired, but never explicitly reported upon the credits and debts of that corporation. It ſeemed to be underſtood in the houſe of repreſentatives that it was a matter which ought not to be ſpoken upon, and a bill was paſſed, limitting the iſſues of their credits to double their capital.</p>
            <p>THIS meaſure was much more extraordinary than the original inſtitution; becauſe that, in 1785, the ſubject was new in the country; but the principles of banking had been under a free diſcuſſion in the year 1791, while the American bank was in conſideration; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Court took up the matter of the Maſſachuſetts' bank, expreſsly, to inquire into and to regulate it; and yet they ſet it down again upon principles which were never adopted in any other part of the world.</p>
            <p>ALL other banks are confined in their credits to the ſtock actually depoſited, and to the depoſits of private individuals; but this bank is allowed to iſſue double its capital without any aſſurance or guarantee from the public, that their credits ſhall be maintained. Their capital may be five hundred thouſand pounds, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they may have in circulation, and draw inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon five hundred thouſand pounds which does not exiſt, upon a paper currency which in fact repreſents nothing, upon a repreſentative which has no conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Thus they are incorporated with power to make thirty thouſand pounds a year, without making any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for it. The intereſt upon their loans they anticipate by taking it at the time of the loan, and thus
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024829_0050_0FCD6723787EEFB8"/>
raiſe a compound intereſt, which pays all their charges, and leaves them twelve per cent. upon their capital be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. But if this was not the caſe, they are not at ſo much expenſe in loaning, and in collecting the money they loan, as individuals would be at in managing the ſame quantity of property.</p>
            <p>THEY pretend, that there can be no want of ſecurity, becauſe, when they iſſue their notes, they draw good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from the borrowers. Upon this idea, their notes are ſo far from being the repreſentative of real money, that they are nothing more than the repreſentative of the credit of men, with whom the poſſeſſor has no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and of whoſe circumſtances he is totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>THESE men have led the government into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputable idea of giving a corporation authority to act as private bankers, without their private eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable for their debts. The notes of private bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are iſſued upon the credit of their reputation and private eſtates. It is a matter between them and their creditors, and the public have no concern in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If they fail, the ſtate is under no neceſſity, by equity or honor, to warrant their credits.</p>
            <p>NO doubt, there are ſome gentlemen of that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whoſe honor and conſcience would oblige them to pay their dividend, out of their private eſtates, if there ſhould be a failure; but they would not conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as held for more than their own ſhares. And
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024829_0051_0FCD6724C832CCF8"/>
even this reſource, precarious as it is, may ſoon fail; for theſe men are mortal, and we know not who will hold the ſhares a few years hence which they now hold.</p>
            <p>BY this inſtitution this company has taken ſix per cent. upon nearly all the commerce in and about Boſton. And what is more extraordinary, they have had it in their power to ſwell and leſſen the medium of the country when they pleaſed, and conſequently, to raiſe or fall the price of articles in commerce as they ſaw fit. We have ſeen ſo much miſery in our own age, ariſing from the bad economy of paper money, that we are called upon by every principle of honor and juſtice to avoid it in future. If we ſin again we muſt do it againſt the ſtrongeſt light and the cleareſt information.</p>
            <p>THE increaſe of the number of banks in other ſtates, is no reaſon for their being multiplied in this. We have been long in the habits of a paper medium: in the year 1745 we iſſued a large ſum, which, after a rapid fall, was redeemed at a great depreciation by a grant from the mother country. We were then obliged to prohibit the paper money iſſued in the other New-England ſtates, from being received in this. For this purpoſe all perſons elected to any kind of office, and all thoſe who wiſhed to take an execution for a debt, were obliged, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly, to take an oath that they had not taken any bills of credit of the other provinces within this.</p>
            <p>IF bank notes are valuable, only as they repreſent ſpecie ready to be exchanged for them, we ought to be very careful of our conduct reſpecting banks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:024829_0052_0FCD672976EB7E78"/>THERE is a natural propenſity in mankind to obtain property by art, by accident, and by any thing beſides labor and induſtry: when peculiar advantages are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from a plan which will gratify them, however prepoſterous it may be, or however incompatible with the public intereſt, it cannot fail of obtaining votaries. The accumulation of wealth by the proprietors of the American bank, and of thoſe who are proprietors of the Maſſachuſetts' bank, have intoxicated a great part of the community; and it may be well to examine the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which ought to move the legiſlature in this buſineſs. The people of Salem have petitioned for a bank, and have obtained the ſanction of one branch of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in favor of it. Another bill for eſtabliſhing a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine has been arreſted in its career, only by a majority of one in the ſenate. If the Salem people, and the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine aſſociation, or either of them, ſhould finally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, there are many other people in the ſtate who have an equal claim with them, and who will openly, and with good reaſon, charge the government with grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluſive privileges to one ſet of citizens in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the others, unleſs they are indulged in the ſame way. The great complaint is, that the favors of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are partially beſtowed, and the advantages of the laws unequally diſtributed. The complaint will gain ſtrength by each act of government in this way, until all are benefited to their own ſatisfaction, or in a way to convince them, that the weakneſs of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the deſtruction of the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:024829_0053_0FCD672ACAF4C770"/>THE true idea of erecting corporations is to enable them more eaſily and advantageouſly to improve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which they have; but the idea of giving them corporate powers to gain money by taking an intereſt on a capital which does not exiſt, is creating a property for them. It amounts to a gift from the ſtate, and is quite inadmiſſible; yet the propoſed Salem bank, the tontine, and the Maſſachuſetts' bank, are all calculated on this idea.</p>
            <p>THE creation of banks gains exceedingly in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion, in the ſame way that emiſſions of paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney have heretofore obtained in this ſtate, obtain now in ſome others, and lately in Rhode-Iſland. But if paper currency is the repreſentative of ſpecie, where is the ſpecie to be found? The ſpecie now active in the country bears no proportion to the paper in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the paper increaſes, the ſilver will grow ſcarce. Our commerce is with foreign countries, who will very ſoon, if our banks are multiplied, refuſe our paper currency, and our mighty bubbles may burſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>IT will be doing nothing more than juſtice to this ſubject to give the reader Dr. Price's opinion upon it in his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>PUBLIC banks are, undoubtedly, attended with great conveniencies; but they alſo do great harm: and if their emiſſions are not reſtrained and conducted with great wiſdom, they may prove the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024829_0054_0FCD672C4825AD98"/>
of all inſtitutions, not only by ſubſtituting fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious for real wealth; by increaſing luxury; by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prices of proviſions; by concealing an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable balance of trade; and by rendering a kingdom incapable of bearing any internal tumults or external attacks, without the danger of a dreadful convulſion; but particularly by becoming inſtruments in the hands of miniſters of ſtate, to increaſe their influence, to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their dependance on the people, <hi>and to keep</hi> up a deluſive ſhew of public proſperity, when perhaps ruin is near.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE plan of a public bank for private emolument is ſtill more dangerous. If it is given to a few only, they will be able to command the markets, monopolize by themſelves, or their confidential connections, what arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they pleaſe, to fix a capricious eſtimate upon every thing, and unduly to influence all the meaſures of the government. If it is general, then we muſt have a flood of paper medium, which, like our former paper curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, will ſink in the hands of the poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>SINCE the taſte of the public is raiſed inſatiably for a bank, it may be neceſſary to have one; but it ought to be upon ſuch a plan as will allow a great number of the people to participate of its advantages, and to be for the good and benefit of all the citizens in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THERE is one objection generally made to this plan, that a paper currency will give us an overflowing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and finally do great injuſtice. There is great
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024829_0055_0FCD672F30CB7868"/>
weight in this objection; but we are to take mankind as we find them. To contend againſt all the follies and weakneſs of the people would be but a poor way to govern them. If there is no other bank than the two now in Boſton, the people, the trade, and the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the medium, will be wholly given up to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price and humor. They will emit all the paper which they can lend upon good ſecurity, without any regard to the ſufferings of the people, and at ſuch times only as ſhall tend to their own emolument in another way. They will act in concert, for the proprietors of each are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally intereſted in both banks.</p>
            <p>I THEREFORE venture to propoſe another bank, in which all the people, as members of the ſtate, ſhall be intereſted, and a great number more, as private proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>THIS plan ought to originate with the General Court, without any regard to private petitions, or aſſociations; for why ſhould a number of men, merely becauſe they aſſociate and petition, have ſuperior or excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to gain advantages, alike due to all? Upon the expectations of ſuch aſſociations, ſpeculations have been ſet on foot, and large ſums of money have been made upon a mere ſporting with the weakneſs and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the government. We are all on the ſame grade of privileges, and nothing can induce our repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to divide us from our equal rights of free citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:024829_0056_0FCD6730CC92C3E8"/>SHOULD the ſtate erect a bank, that one called the Maſſachuſetts' Bank ought to be immediately repealed, or if the ſtate does not erect one, ſtill that bank ought not exiſt; or if that bank exiſts upon the reſtriction in the late act reſpecting it, all laws againſt exceſſive uſury ought to be repealed; for to give one part of the community a legal right to take twelve per cent. upon the loans of their monies, while others are ſeverely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for taking more than ſix for theirs, is making a cruel and an inviduous diſtinction between the people, and ought never to be allowed in a free country.</p>
            <p>THERE is no lawyer in the ſtate, who is diſintereſted, that will give it as his opinion, that the legiſlature has not a right to repeal the act of incorporation of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It is by no means a charter of privilege; if it is, the General Court had no right to grant it, becauſe the conſtitution expreſsly provides, that no <hi>excluſive privilege</hi> ſhall be granted to any man, or body of men. It is not like an incorporation to build a bridge, or to cut a canal, becauſe, in the firſt caſe, the government grants a property in a river, which belongs to the ſtate; and in the laſt it is only a grant of power to uſe the property and ſoil which they have bought, or may buy of others. But the incorporation of this bank is an open, expreſs privilege of taking more intereſt for their money than other people have a right to take. If it is not a grant of excluſive privilege, it is on the ſame foot of other legiſlative acts, ſush as incorporating towns and proprietors, which laws may be repealed at pleaſure.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024829_0057_0FCD67325AC30748"/>
Here was no contract between theſe people and the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, nor did the latter receive any reward or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for the grant.</p>
            <p>WHEN I ſay that there never was any other public bank eſtabliſhed on principles ſimilar to thoſe of the Maſſachuſetts' bank, I do not take into conſideration the ſeveral banks eſtabliſhed in America by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſeveral ſtates. I have not attended to their ſeveral inſtitutions, and ſhould not hold myſelf obliged to regard them, if their principles are now in the theory of banking. It is one of the defects of free and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar governments, that the ruling power being depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by frequent elections, upon the will of the people, and that people being liable to be influenced by party intereſts, many meaſures obtain which do not tend to the public good. The ſeveral banks in this country may have been obtained by fair means, but yet may, in themſelves, be wrong. There is, as Cicero ſays, no power on earth capable of making that right in itſelf which is naturally pernicious, or to make injury a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary to take notice of a meaſure adopted in congreſs in December 1781. Robert Morris, Eſq. had propoſed a plan for a bank of the United States. This bank was eſtabliſhed by an ordinance, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had power to do it; but not on principles ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as thoſe contained in the plan propoſed. In the plan it was provided that the bank notes ſhould be received in payment of all taxes and duties in all the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024829_0058_0FCD6733C9F42C08"/>
ſtates: This would have given the proprietors of the bank full power to have emitted a paper currency for the whole union, and to have drawn an intereſt of ſix per cent. upon the whole annually. Congreſs did not in their ordinance, even provide that the bank notes ſhould be received by the federal treaſury. But the General Court of Maſſachuſetts, in their act paſſed in March 1782, made proviſion that all debts due to the confederated ſtates ſhould be receivable in the notes of this company; and that no other bank ſhould be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THIS company were, by the ordinance of congreſs, reſtricted as to the quantity of property they ſhould hold, but not as to the debts they might owe. They therefore might iſſue notes to as large an amount as they pleaſed; and there was no proviſion for making the directors or proprietors liable in their natural capacities for what ſhould exceed their capital.</p>
            <p>SOME of the ſtates did not agree to this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attempt for money making; and it is rather difficult to find where it now is, or what was the final ſettlement of it.</p>
            <p>THAT I may be better underſtood in my ideas of a bank for the commonwealth, I take the freedom to mention the outlines of it, without having an idea that the principles offered are perfect, but only hoping to ſuggeſt ſome uſeful thoughts on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral reaſons which plead in favor of the meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:024829_0059_0FCD673651CA88F0"/>THE commonwealth being a ſovereign ſtate, ought to poſſeſs reſources independent of any other ſtate or government. Should the ſtate, by an inſurrection, or by any accident or adventitious diſtreſs, be under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of anticipating a tax by the loan of money, a ſtate bank would be very uſeful, and prevent the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of an application to an office where it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of a ſtate bank will form an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrongly oppoſed to the incorporation of any other. It will be the beſt of all intereſts, the intereſt of all the people: and the bank can, from time to time, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when it ſhall be neceſſary, by new ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and a proper proportion of the ſpare ſpecie may he improved in that way.</p>
            <p>THIS method, if there can be any truſt or confidence in the governing power of the commonwealth, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the incorporation of a number of banks which otherwiſe will be applied for and obtained. It will prevent a flood of paper money which will otherwiſe be iſſued on the credit of private men, under the ſanction of the government, without any ſpecie to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. By this, individuals will be prevented from raiſing or falling the medium of commerce to anſwer particular purpoſes of ſpeculation; and the meaſure of trade will be rendered permanent, certain and ſteady.</p>
            <p>THERE is a complaint, that money is not plenty enough to anſwer the purpoſes of trade. There never
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024829_0060_0FCD67378AF77308"/>
was a long time together when this complaint did not exiſt. Gold and ſilver repreſent all other property; and when they abundantly increaſe in a country, the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal value of every thing which is offered to ſale, or compared with them as with the meaſure of real value, will riſe in proportion to their abundance, and there will be ſtill a complaint for money, though ſilver and gold ſhould be as plenty as ſtones on the earth,</p>
            <p>SPAIN experienced a ſcarcity of money when gold and ſilver had become as plenty there as lead or any other common metal; and the influx of bullion ruined the nation.</p>
            <p>IF our commerce was an interior commerce, paper, ſhells, iron, braſs, ſalt, or any thing elſe, might do as the ſign of wealth; but as the money which we want is to carry on our traffic with other nations, we muſt have thoſe ſigns of wealth for a medium which the world has agreed to receive as ſuch; and we may iſſue paper as frequently as we pleaſe, but if that paper cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſilver and gold when called for, it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate. Every inſtance of depreciation gives a new demand for more emiſſions, in the ſame manner as if a part was ſunk or ſtruck out of circulation.</p>
            <p>I KNOW that the Engliſh writers pretend that there is not in the bank of Amſterdam, one quarter part in gold and ſilver of the value of the ſum repreſented by the paper iſſued from thence. I doubt the truth of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: but if it is true, the people who receive the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024829_0061_0FCD66C00934B850"/>
paper believe the real money to be there; and as none but the magiſtrates have acceſs to the books, it cannot be contradicted by evidence. But we live in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in an age, and are a people where no ſuch decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can take place. If we were ignorant enough to be thus practiſed upon, we ſhould be incapable of poſſeſſing a free government.</p>

            <p>ALL notes and bills iſſued by the bank to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the treaſury of the ſtate, and by collectors of all taxes, impoſts, and exciſes.</p>

            <p>NO number of perſons to be allowed to aſſociate for the purpoſe of banking.</p>
            <p>SOME men imagine that banks will always owe more money than their capital ſtock and the monies depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſafekeeping; that is, that they will, by conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the directors, iſſue notes far beyond their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. But this is a kind of cunning and chicane which never ought to be allowed of. If the bank eſtabliſhed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024829_0065_0FCD67430C201488"/>
in a country, can, without injuring the public, loan more money than they have a right to loan, their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtock ought to be increaſed by a new ſubſcription, otherwiſe they will draw an intereſt on a capital which does not exiſt.</p>
            <p>THIS will never be the caſe, unleſs there is a greater demand for money in trade than there is in agriculture; for banks can never ſupply the farmers with loans; and if all the ſpare money is veſted in bank ſtocks, there never can be a ſufficient quantity in the hands of private perſons to ſupply thoſe who wiſh to take on land ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>WITH many prudent and wiſe men, it is a queſtion far from being ſettled, whether an eaſy acquirement of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on loan, is for the advantage of the farmers. Where new lands are purchaſed at a low price, the increaſe of their value from their own improvement, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and ſettlement of the lands round them, may render them able to pay an intereſt of ſix per cent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um per annum on their purchaſe money. But it is very evident, from every calculation, that an old farm will never afford ſuch an intereſt on the purchaſe money given for it.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this, where money is offered on loan for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity by mortgages, there will be frequently moments when farmers, from a variety of inducements, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily run in debt and lay the foundation of their own ruin. A ſon wants a ſettlement, or a daughter her
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024829_0066_0FCD674448936388"/>
portion on marriage; the pride of the family predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates over prudence, the mother urges to a gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the children, and the father, upon the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or from a wiſh of eaſe and quiet, complies. The whole are made happy for one year, and then all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ruin and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>BANKS are not intended for loaning on land ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and if all the ſuperfluous money is uſed in banks, the farmers will not obtain any. It will all be uſed in that way if ſuch enormous and unprecedented advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are offered as we have ſeen in the national and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts' banks. The only method, therefore, is to have only one bank beſides the branch of the United States' bank: to give the government an intereſt in that, by which we ſhall all be benefited, and to let the advantages be ſo moderate that there will not be a crowd preſſing to be admitted. By this method, there will be a proper proportion of money improved in banks to facilitate trade, and a proper proportion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to be loaned to farmers by individuals.</p>
            <p>THE deſtiny of man, is to acquire his bread by toil and labour. But there is almoſt a univerſal reluctance to a compliance with this decree of our Maker. The wiſhes of men, are boundleſs as the wide extenſion of eternity: and no place, no poſſeſſions, and no acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are competent to the factitious wants of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. The law which annexes want, ſufferings, and diſgrace, to idleneſs, is not more oppoſed to the inclinations of men, than ſome others are. There is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024829_0067_0FCD67467A757FF8"/>
no time, ſeaſon, climate, or weather, which gives ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all the ſubjects of it, in ſhort, man is at war with his own nature, and with his natural neceſſities.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething very inſtructive in the fable of Midas, whoſe avarice urged him to petition, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he touched might be changed into gold. His wiſhes being complied with, he had nothing to eat, drink, or wear, but what was diſqualified for thoſe uſes. People are generally wiſhing to turn almoſt every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance into money, without conſidering, that this would render gold and ſilver of as little conſequence to the world, as the ſtones in the ſtreet. In fact, it would bring them to diſtreſs and deſtruction, like the man in the fable, if they could obtain the grant of what they wiſh.</p>
            <p>DR. Robinſon gives the world a very ſtriking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the misfortunes which Spain derived from the exceſs of gold and ſilver procured from South America. He repreſents that kingdom as the moſt commercial in Europe, when their fleet firſt entered the river de la Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. But when they had acquired an abundance of the precious metals, they loſt their conſequence and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. <q>Under the reigns of Ferdinand and Iſabella, and Charles the Fifth, Spain was one of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious countries in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and ſilk, were ſo extenſive, as not only to furniſh what was ſufficient for her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but to ſupport a ſurplus for exportation. In the beginning of the ſixteenth century, Spain is
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024829_0068_0FCD674816597368"/>
ſaid to have poſſeſſed above a thouſand merchant ſhips; a number probably far ſuperior to that of any nation in Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEN, after deſcribing her mode of trade, he goes on to obſerve, that <q>wealth which flows in with mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate increaſe, feeds and nouriſhes that activity which is neceſſary to commerce, and calls it forth into vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and well conducted exertions; but when opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence pours in ſuddenly, and with too full a ſtream, it overturns all ſober plans of induſtry, and brings along with it a taſte for what is <hi>wild and extravagant, or dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in buſineſs or action.</hi> Such was the great and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den augmentation of power and revenue, that the poſſeſſion of America brought to Spain, and ſome ſymptoms of its pernicious influence upon the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal operations of that monarchy ſoon begun to appear. Her flouriſhing manufactures, early in the ſeventeenth century, were fallen into decay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all Europe, were ruined. Her extenſive foreign commerce was loſt. The trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween different parts of her own dominions was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the ſhips which attempted to carry it on were taken and plundered by enemies whom ſhe once deſpiſed. Even agriculture, the primary object of induſtry in every proſperous ſtate, was neglected, and one of the moſt fertile countries in Europe hardly raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was ſufficient for the ſupport of her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a moſt ſolemn leſſon to nations, and if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:024829_0069_0FCD674A04DAEB80"/>
to, will ſtrongly urge them not to wiſh an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown medium of commerce, even though it ſhould be compoſed of gold and ſilver. But when we ſee the people of a country zealouſly engaged in purſuit of an overflowing medium which has no credit beyond cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits, and there, only from poſitive laws, which has no value in its own compoſition, or in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; and which is offered only as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of ſpecie which does not actually exiſt, we may, without breach of candor, conclude, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of ſuch a people, and their final cataſtrophe, as to public proſperity, is founded in, and much accelerated by their own folly and madneſs.</p>
            <p>THERE is a wide difference between the principles of iſſuing a paper medium on a bank ſtock, and iſſuing one on the common ideas and principles heretofore practiſed upon in this country. The one is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of money actually depoſited, and ready to be paid when called for, and the other is only the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of an intention to pay by a future tax, when the people are willing to bear one. The former will always be equal to real money; the latter muſt, as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has done, undergo a rapid depreciation.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the government of the commonwealth erect a bank, they will never do it on the idea of iſſuing ſums larger than their capital ſtock, and the ſums depoſited for ſafekeeping; becauſe, ſo far as they diſpenſe with this principle, ſo far they will in effect make a paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency upon the principles of public credit alone. While
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024829_0070_0FCD674D6E8600F0"/>
this is concealed, if a depreciation ſhall happen, it will not be confeſſed, but pretended that demands for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie raiſe the price of gold and ſilver, and the articles of commerce may riſe in their nominal value, but this riſe will be aſcribed to a thouſand cauſes before it is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the true one.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be aſked, what benefit will reſult from banking, if there can be no more money iſſued in bills than there is actually depoſited in ſtock? The anſwer I make has been before repeated. The government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not incorporate a ſet, or number of men, with a gift of property, but may give them corporate powers to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the property which they have in poſſeſſion, or which they may acquire. By an act of incorporation they can loan their money with more eaſe, at leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and with greater ſecurity, than they could do it in their private, natural capacities; and the advantages ariſing from depoſits for ſafekeeping, will be what would very lately have been called great enough to induce the undertaking.</p>
            <p>THE government, by ſuch an incorporation, can, from time to time, on all caſes of ſudden emergency, have aids of money without applying to any other gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and by having one bank in which all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have an intereſt, they will prevent the operation of applications which will otherwiſe eſtabliſh a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of banks under different denominations; for if one aſſociation is indulged with corporate powers, why ſhould not another? And if the Maſſachuſetts' bank
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024829_0071_0FCD674EC8BE0598"/>
has a legal right to iſſue one million of pounds lawful money in notes, and to draw ſix per centum per annum on that ſum, when they may not have more than one half of it in their vault, why ſhould not the aſſociations for the tontine, and for the Salem bank, and all others who will aſſociate for eſtabliſhing other funds in money, have the ſame privilege? And if the Maſſachuſetts' bank has this enormous benefit, why ſhould the Salem bank be incorporated under privileges inferior to theirs? What have the proprietors of that bank done for the public to purchaſe ſo much preeminence and thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive privileges? Why ſhould the reſt of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens be under pains and penalties for taking more than ſix pounds for the loan of one hundred pounds for one year, and theſe men have a legal right to take twelve for theirs?</p>
            <p>THESE are very ſerious queſtions; the public mind la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors with them, and if even the men intereſted in this extraordinary ſcheme, can anſwer them, it is high time it was done. The public expect a diſcuſſion of them, and are anxiouſly waiting the event.</p>
            <p>IF the abundance of the precious metals will forfeit their comparative value in the opinion of the world, how much more will a paper currency, repreſenting nothing but a credit, or a promiſe of money to be paid at ſome future day, loſe its eſtimated value, when it ſhall be abundantly increaſed? The gold and ſilver torn from the bowels of the earth, are of no more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the firſt poſſeſſor than the corn or wheat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024829_0072_0FCD6751A28E7750"/>
by labor is to the huſbandman. The labor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the taking the metals from the mines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining them, is hardly paid by the produce, unleſs the owner employs ſlaves in the ſervice; and theſe might be as profitably employed in agriculture.</p>
            <p>THE idea of the people who want banks, is to ſpring a mine of wealth without labor. They wiſh to draw double the income from their property by creating a bank, than could be obtained in any other way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. But the conſtitution of our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as well as that of the United States, contains a ſolemn compact, that no man, or company of men, ſhall have any legal excluſive right or privilege; and therefore, if a bank for the commonwealth is erected, the private ſubſcribers can have no privilege but what ſhall ariſe from the ſtock actually depoſited, and from the money depoſited for ſecurity and ſafekeeping. The bank, therefore, will be compoſed by proprietors who have ſpecie which they wiſh to employ in that way, and not by men who wiſh to accumulate wealth by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and excluſive advantages.</p>
            <p>THE idea of a loan of money by banks to farmers upon mortgages of real eſtates, is inadmiſſible. It was never attempted in any country, excepting in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; I mean the land bank in Maſſachuſetts. That bubble was produced by the circulation of Law's ſcheme in Paris. The intoxication occaſioned by the method in which that plan was managed, made its way into Holland and England, and finally operated in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024829_0073_0FCD67537B81B808"/>
of Maſſachuſetts Bay. About the year thirty, a company was incorporated for the purpoſe, as was oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſibly held out, to encourage agriculture and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Some of the greateſt men in the government were of the corporation, and the influence of it pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing. Elections were governed by it. The legiſlature was under its control, and its power was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by nothing but the misfortunes and calamities which were introduced by it. The notes iſſued by the company could not be paid, becauſe the company had no funds for that purpoſe. There were monies due to them on mortgages, but that money could not be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and therefore the ſecurities were ſold at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and a rapid depreciation took place. A great variety of acts and laws were made in order to bring this buſineſs to a cloſe. The general import of them all was, to levy money from the private eſtates of the proprietors, to pay the debts due from the corporation; the laſt of theſe acts was made in 1759.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, Apthorp and Wheelwright were engaged in a contract with, or under others, to ſupply the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh army in America, and iſſued notes on their own credit, ariſing from their connection with the Britiſh treaſury. But theſe very ſoon began to go under par, and had but a very ſhort run in commerce; the reaſon was very plain: if the money was ready, there was no need of notes; if the money was not ready, then the notes repreſented credit only, and not money.</p>
            <p>THERE was ſomething plauſible in the propoſition of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024829_0074_0FCD6754F06CF900"/>
the <hi>tontine</hi> aſſociation for loaning money to farmers on mortgages. They were either not ſincere, or they were ignorant of the principles of banking. If a bank was to iſſue no more notes than what would repreſent the ſpecie on hand, it could not be done on mortgages; becauſe, upon banking principles, the gold and ſilver is always ſuppoſed to be ready when called for; but when notes are made repreſenting ſpecie, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon monies ariſing from mortgages for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and delays are great, and an equity of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lands mortgaged extended to the ſpace of three years, it will be impoſſible to ſupport the credit of the bank.</p>
            <p>THE tontine aſſociation were quite right, however, in making an application; they petitioned for no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er privileges than had been granted to their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by this and the general government; and they are unable now to diſcover the reaſon why one part of the people are thus diſtinguiſhed from the other.</p>
            <p>IF there are evils reſulting from the multiplication of banks, and from ſpeculations in public ſecurities, thoſe evils ought to be avoided. But we are frequently told, that they will cure themſelves; the ſame may be ſaid of all other natural, moral, and political evils; and if the argument proves any thing, it will prove that there is no need of providing any checks againſt wrong doers. Fevers generally cure themſelves by their own rage, if they do not deſtroy the ſubject of them: but we do not conclude from thence, that there is no injury in a fever.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024829_0075_0FCD6757EA17DD18"/>
Conflagrations ceaſe when the city is conſumed, but the diſtreſs of their operations remains in a laſting ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Moral evils cure themſelves frequently by bringing offenders to the halter; they are nevertheleſs intolerable, becauſe they injure and diſtreſs the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community where they are perpetrated. The obſervation, that evils cure themſelves, is nigh akin to that of the ſtoics, that there is no evil at all: and not very diſtant in relation from the doctrine of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal indiſcriminate happineſs, as well to the wicked as to the righteous, in another ſtate of exiſtence. Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal evils cure themſelves; but they very frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge a country in blood in their progreſs, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave a nation overborne with a heavy debt, if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people are preſerved; and the widows and orphans of deceaſed patriots and warriors, are for a long time the numerous witneſſes of the preceding calamity.</p>
            <p>OUR old paper money ſchemes and public debt were evils, and they have cured themſelves; but not until they had placed it in the power of one part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to make vaſt eſtates upon the diſtreſſes and misfortunes of the other.</p>
            <p>THE aſſurance that good may come out of evil, is no excuſe for doing wrong. Government ought to move uniformly, on fixed, rational, honeſt, and regular prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. It is intended to preſerve the equal rights of all the citizens, and to protect the weak againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and the poor againſt the rich. But theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ends can never be accompliſhed where the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

of wealth, and medium of trade, is unſteady and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious, or where the powers of government, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due influence, are made ſubſervient to the gratification or emolument of particular aſſociations, or of individu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>als in the civil community.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER apologies may be formed by men in power, ſatisfactory to their own conſciences, from local ſituations, from examples in the ſame, or in any other government, or from the preſſure of men purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there will be an hour when theſe can form no plea; a day, when what has been right, and what has been wrong, in morals and politics, will appear with an indiſputable certainty.</p>
