            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE pulpit is devoted, in general, to more important purpoſes, than the fate of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or the civil rights of human nature; being intended, to recover men from the ſlavery of ſin and ſatan—to point out their eſcape from future miſery, through faith in a crucified Jeſus—and to aſſiſt them in their preparations for an eternal bleſſedneſs: But ſtill, there are ſpecial times and ſeaſons when it may treat of politics. And ſurely, if it is allowable for ſome who occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it, by preaching up the doctrines of non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and paſſive obedience, to vilify the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and to ſap the foundations of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous revolution, that exalted the houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> throne; it ought to be no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in others, nor be conſtrued into a want of loyalty, to ſpeak conſiſtently with thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved tenets, that have made GEORGE the third, the firſt of <hi>European</hi> ſovereigns, who otherwiſe, with the his perſonal virtues, might have lived an obſcure Elector.</p>

Having then, the paſt morning of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial thankſgiving, accommodated the text to the caſe of individuals, I ſhall now dedicate it, according to its original intention, to the ſervice of the public, the ſituation of whoſe affairſ, is, both <hi>diſtreſſing</hi> and <hi>alarming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE capital of the colony is barbarouſly treated, pretendedly for a crime, but actually, for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtand ſhe has made in favour of liberty, againſt the partiſans of ſlavery. She has diſtinguiſhed herſelf by an animated oppoſition to arbitrary and unconſtitutional proceedings; and therefore has been markt out, by miniſterial vengeance, to be made an example of, whereby to terrify other <hi>American</hi> cities into a tame ſubmiſſion. She is an example—and, thanks to heaven! an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of patience and fortitude, to the no ſmall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of her enemies, whoſe own baſe feelings led them to imagine, that ſhe would immediately become an abject ſuplicant for royal favour, tho' at the expence of natural and charter'd rights. May ſome future hiſtorian, the friend of mankind and citizen of the world, have to record in his faithful and ever-living page, that ſhe never truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſailors and ſoldiers, contrary to their natural affection for the cauſe of liberty, were baſely employed to intimidate her; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly held out, through the fiery trial, 'till a revolution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and meaſures brought on her deliverance.</p>
            <p>But it is not the capital alone that ſuffers. The late venal Parliament, in compliance with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of admini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

powers to individuals, for the enforcing and maintaining thoſe encroachments, that they have ventured, in defiance of common equity, to make upon the rights of free people.—And had not the calmneſs and prudence of others ſupplied their lack of wiſdom, the country might by this time have become an <hi>Aceldama.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I take this opportunity of making my public acknowledgments to his Excellency the Governor, for not having precipitated the country into a civil war—an event, which as, appears by his letter, he ardently wiſhes may never exiſt. Should the continent be exerciſed with ſo great an evil, I promiſe myſelf from the known humanity, the conſtant attendant of true bravery—the known humanity of the Britiſh officers and troops, that they will not add barbarity, to the unavoidable calamities of war: But ſhould any helliſh policy order it's being done, the colonies, 'tis to be ſuppoſed, will dread all, leſs than ſlavery to thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>UPON the principles, which the Britiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have adopted in their late extraordinary proceedings, I ſee not, how we can be certain of any one privilege—nor what hinders our being really in a ſtate of ſlavery to an aggregate of maſters, whoſe tyranny may be worſe than that of a ſingle deſpot—nor that a man can with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety ſay, <hi>his ſoul's his own,</hi> and not the ſpring to move his bodily machine, in the performance of whatever drudgery his lords may appoint—nor that the public have a permanent and valuable conſtitution. If the Britiſh legiſlature is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or ſuperior to the conſtitution, <hi>Magna Charta, the bill of rights, and the proteſtant ſucceſſion,</hi> theſe boaſts of Britons, are toys to pleaſe the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and not <hi>ſolid ſecurities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE operation of the late unconſtitutional acts of the Britiſh Parliament, would not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014072_0006_0F92DB5A505B4D38"/>
the colony of invaluable privileges, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a train of evils, little expected by the generality, and give the Britiſh miniſtry ſuch an aſcendency in all public affairs, as would be to the laſt dangerous.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In ſupport of this paragraph, I ſhall quote the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, from the proteſt of the Lords againſt the regulating Act, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr>

                  <p>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>The new conſtitution of judicature provided by this bill is improper, and incongruous with the plan of the admiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice in Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>The Governor and Council thus inſtituted with powers, with which the Britiſh conſtitution has not truſted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Privy-Council, have the means of returning ſuch a jury in each particular cauſe, as may beſt ſuit with the gratification of their paſſions, and intereſts. The lives, liberties and properties of the ſubject are put into their hands without controul; and the invaluable right of trial by jury, is turned into a <hi>ſnare</hi> for the people, who have hitherto looked upon it as their main ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the licentiouſneſs of power.</p>
                  <p>We ſee in this bill the ſame ſcheme of ſtrengthening the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity of the officers and miniſters of ſtate, <hi>at the expence of the rights and liberties of the ſubject,</hi> which was indicated by the inauſpicious act for ſhutting up the harbour of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                  <p>By that act which is immediately connected with this bill, the example was ſet of a large important city (contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaſt multitudes of people, many of whom muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and all of whom are unheard) by an arbitrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence deprived of the advantage of that port, upon which all their means of livelihood did immediately depend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This proſcription</hi> is not made determinable on the payment of a fine for an offence, or a compenſation for an injury; but is to continue until the miniſters of the Crown ſhall think fit to adviſe the King in Council to revoke it.</p>
                  <p>The legal condition of the ſubject (ſtanding unattainted by conviction, for treaſon or ſelony (ought never to depend upon the arbitrary will of any perſon whatſoever.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would add alſo. The clauſe in the regulating act, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town meetings, leaves it in the power of a Governor, to prevent them all at pleaſure, thoſe only excepted for the choice of town officers in March, and for the choice of Repreſentatives. Neither the moſt trifling, nor the moſt important buſineſs can be legally tranſacted, ſo as to be binding upon the inhabitants, even in the moſt diſtant towns of the government, <hi>without leave firſt had and obtained of the Governor in writing, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch ſpecial buſineſs,</hi> though it ſhould happen that if not done, within leſs time than neceſſary for the obtaining of that leave, it cannot be done at all. The town's-men can neither lay out a new road, nor raiſe monies for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an old one: nor can they ſettle a miniſter, without obtaining the expreſs written leave of the Governor. Yea, they are forbid ſo much as to talk, for they are not to <hi>treat,</hi> of any <hi>other matter</hi> at their March meeting, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the election of their officers, nor at any other meeting, except the buſineſs expreſſed in the leave given by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, or in his abſence by the Lieutenant Governor.</hi> If this is not to eſtabliſh ſlavery by legiſlative authority, I beg to know what is? The arbitrary mandates of the Grand Monarch enjoining his ſlaves silence, when ſtate affairs are diſagreeable to the public, will ſcarce be thought by many, ſo great an attack upon the rights of mankind, as an attempt to perpetuate ſomething of the like nature by a permanent law. Should the favourite of a Governor have embezzled the towns-money, how ſhall a meeting be obtained to vote and order a proſecution againſt him?

Should an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed town be deſirous of ſtating it's grievances, and praying a redreſs, how ſhall the inhabitants do it in a corporate capacity, ſhould the Commander in chief be prejudiced againſt them? Should the electors be inclined to inſtruct their repreſentatives upon matters of the higheſt concern to them, how ſhall they do it without violating the law, when the Ruler's intereſt prevents his giving them leave?

                  <p>In the year 1697, the penſions amounted only to ſeven thouſand and ſeventy ſeven pounds ſterling; but in the year 1705, they amounted to eighteen thouſand one hundred and eleven pounds. Since then they have increaſed to a moſt enormous ſum. A late publication informs us, that, about ten years back, there was a million of debt contracted on the 6d per pound tax laid on penſions. The intereſt of a million at 4l. per cent, being forty thouſand pounds per annum, the penſions, to have anſwered for it, muſt have amounted to one million ſix hundred thouſand pounds per annum; if at 3l. per. cent to one million two hundred thouſand.

It would have been much worſe had we been dealt with according to our demerits. <hi>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> Some may at firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object agianſt this, as being too ſtrong an expreſſion, and may think, conſidering the morals of the people when compared with the inhabitants of other places, that it is miſ-applied. I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to allow, that the morals of this people, taken collectively, are ſuperior to thoſe of other places (Connecticut excepted, where I ſuppoſe they are nearly the ſame) whether in the new or the old world, all things conſidered; and I cannot but view, as a ſtrong proof hereof, the order that prevails through the country, now that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the laws, becauſe of the peculiarity of the times, is ſuſpended. And yet after all, I muſt hold to the text; and, that we may be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and be duely affected with the truth of it, ſhall make ſome remarks upon this people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ſubjects of God's moral goverment.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014072_0012_0F92DB5FA344EA58"/>
1. IN the firſt place I remark, that the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of any vices and immoralities among this people, muſt be peculiarly provoking.</p>
            <p>Circumſtances aggravate or alleviate the crimes, of ſocieties, no leſs than of ſingle perſons; and far more and other is expected from ſome, than from many others in a very different ſituation and condition.</p>
            <p>NOW it ſhould be remembered, that this is but a <hi>young</hi> people, not a hundred and fifty years old; for, they were not a <hi>people</hi> for the few firſt years of their ſettlement in this wilderneſs, no more than a ſmall company, who muſt have ſoon periſhed by the hands of the native <hi>Indians,</hi> had not God interpoſed. They youth is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to the crimes committed by them. For a young perſon to be given to vice, though he has a corrupted nature the ſame as others, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive. We look for a decent, modeſt, and orderly behaviour in <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN like manner, a <hi>young ſtate</hi> ſhould be pure in its morals; ſhould be addicted to no particular vices; ſhould obſerve the utmoſt regularity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; and ſhould not even think of, much leſs practiſe, the crimes too generally to be met with in countries of long ſtanding, when attained to thier height in power and affluence. There is an utter unfitneſs in the former's attempting to imitate the latter. Can we ſay, that this riſing young ſtate is clear as to this matter; that it has not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the corrupt manners of it's aged parent; and that it hath not it's particular vices that are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to it? However willing we may be, thro' ſelf love and native fondneſs, to apologize for it; we cannot conſcientiouſly pronounce it <hi>not-guilty,</hi> while we know how notorious, intemperance, uncleanneſs, luxury and irreligion are among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:014072_0013_0F92DB606811B4A8"/>
BUT another thing that makes that vices and immoralities of this people peculiarly provoking is, their deſcent and education. This ſins of a youth deſcended from pious parents, who has had good examples ſet him, and who has been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully educated, are worſe than thoſe of a common youth, that has not enjoyed ſuch advantages.</p>
            <p>Now the anceſtors of this people were eminently godly. I was the ſtrength of their zeal for true unadualterated religion, and the ardour of their love to God and Chriſt, that prevailed upon them to venture over the great deep, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in this then inhoſpitable and dangerous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that reconciled them to the numberleſs difficulties, that they had long to encounter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever attaining to the various comforts that we enjoy. They were concern'd to perpetuate the ſame ſpirit of piety which they were actuated by; paid great attention to the riſing generation; and wiſely provided for the good inſtruction of ſucceeding ones. Wherein can we charge them with want, either of wiſdom, or faithfulneſs to poſterity? Do we not ſtill reap the fruits of their contrivance and foreſight, though not in ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a manner as might, be through our own faultineſs? Judge ye, what could have been done more, through their inſtrumentality, for this part of the Lord's vineyard, than what hath been done? Wherefore then, hath it brought forth ſo many wild and bad grapes, when it ſhould have yielded the choiceſt fruit? Is not this people ſtrangely degenerated, ſo as to poſſeſs but a faint reſemblance of that godlineſs, for which their forefathers were eminent! And, could theſe laſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014072_0014_0F92DB611EC620C8"/>
appear for a while, again in this colony, with the common paſſions and ſentiments of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would they not ſtand amazed at the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent generation, and be ready to diſown them for their poſterity! Is it not another generation of profeſſors, very different both as to ſentiments and practice, from that which by their emigrations for conſcience ſake, firſt planted the goſpel in New-England; would not the like zeal for the leading doctrines of chriſtianity, and the like ſtrictneſs in morals, that prevailed in the firſt ſettlers, be ſeverely cenſured and be ſtigmatized by ſome reproachful epithet, as in their day, by the generality among us, though through the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the times, the perſecution might not be more than that of the tongue. They that will diveſt themſelves of prejudice, and judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, will be obliged, I apprehend, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this people do not anſwer to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablenſs of their deſcent; any more than to the care that was taken by their predeceſſors, for their being well-educated in the principles and practices of religion; the <hi>full</hi> benefit of which care, though they may not enjoy, through the cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faultineſs of ſome in neglecting their duty, yet is ſo far enjoyed, as that people in general, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all ranks, are not better inſtructed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated any where, it is probale, than in this country. But certainly the more honourable their religious deſcent, and the better their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the more provoking muſt their vices and immoralities be; and nothing can be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their particular conſideration, eſpecially in theſe threatning times, than thoſe words in the 3d of <hi>Amos</hi> 2d. wherein the Lord addreſſes the children of Iſrael ſaying, <hi>You only have I known of all

            <p n="2">2. I therefore proceed to mention in the ſecond place, that the obligations this people are under to holineſs, are ſpecial, from the many appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in their favour, and his having ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and exalted them.</p>
            <p>How oft has the ſupreme Governor of the univerſe wonderfully, next to miraculouſly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed for their deliverance, when in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt danger! Their enemies expected to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up, and were upon the point of doing it, when providence hath critically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpoſed, ſo that they have eſcaped, like a bird out of a ſnare that has been thrown over it. When their eagerneſs to co-operate with the parent ſtate, in reducing the power of the common enemy, led them into a bold and dangerous enterprize, in which if they had miſcarried they would have been ſubject to an almoſt irreparable damage, and which muſt have miſcarried according to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courſe of human and military affairs, had not ſpecial events, carrying in them the evident marks of providential appointment, though in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the unbeliever purely caſual—I ſay, which muſt have miſcarried, had not ſpecial events turned up; it pleaſed God to order the exiſtence of them, and, by crowning the expedition with ſucceſs, not only to avert the train of evils that muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have followed, but to give this people, then indeed in their infancy, a NAME among the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like veteran ſtates of <hi>Europe</hi> and to ſhow the world, what a few raw provincials could do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmiles and care of heaven, againſt fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and batteries really ſtrong, and defended

by regulars, though not by Britons, May they never loſe <hi>that</hi> NAME, nor blaſt the laurels gained at <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> by any future cowardly conduct, when it is not conqueſt, but liberty and property that are at ſtake!</p>
            <p>GOD hath not only appeared for this people, but hath greatly multiplied and exalted them. They were at firſt a few men in number, yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few and ſtrangers in the land. They came from a well cultivated kingdom to a ſavage people and a wild country, enough to diſcourage the ſtouteſt. However they ventured to take up their abode in it, and, through the original bleſſing of heaven upon them, which perhaps never diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf and wrought more effectually, except in the inſtance of the Jews, they are become a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable nation, poſſeſs a tolerable ſhare of wealth, and would enjoy much public happineſs, were the painful diſputes between them and the parent country comfortably terminated. The face of the colony is not leſs changed for the better ſince firſt ſettled, than what is ſet forth in the language of Iſaiah's prophecy, <hi>the wilderneſs and the ſolitary place ſhall be glad; the deſert ſhall rejoice and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as the roſe. I ſhall bloſſom abundantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice even with joy and ſinging, the glory of Lebanon ſhall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. They ſhall ſee the glroy of the Lord, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our God.</hi> Iſa. 35. 1, 2. Theſe enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, are <hi>ſpecial</hi> obligations on this people to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. But does their holineſs correſpond with them? Are the fruits yielded by them ſuited to ſuch benefits? Are they that manner of people, that might have been expected; and that they engaged to be when under difficulties, and in great perplexity through threatning appearances? Or
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014072_0017_0F92DB6348235FC0"/>
have they not, like the Jews of old, after ſinging the divine praiſes, forgot the works of God, and the wonders he hath ſhowed them? And hath not the caſt of their after-conduct evidenced that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their engagements with him in the day of their affliction, <hi>they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues; and that their heart was not right with him;</hi> for, <hi>they have not been ſtedfaſt in his covenant,</hi> have not walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the deſign and purport of God's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, with which they have in much mercy, been made acquainted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall now remark in the third and laſt place, that though the appearances of religion among this people, are great and many, yet it is to be feared, that real religion is ſcarce, that the power of godlineſs is rare, and that while there is much outward ſhow of reſpect to the Deity there is but little inward heart conformity to him.</p>
            <p>Individuals are juſtly entitled to the benefit of an exception, notwithſtanding which it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with too much truth to the community as a body, <hi>this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> Math. 15. 8. What is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the generality, more than being baptized, attending public worſhip ſtatedly on the Lord's day, owning the covenant, coming to the Lord's table, and then being orderly in the outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment! If, beſides all now mentioned, there is a ſtrict attendance upon private prayer, and the further addition of family, though the prayer ſhall conſiſt of nothing more than the repeating of a certain ſet of words that the tongue has been habituated to, the goodneſs of ſuch religion muſt not be queſtioned; though not proceeding from a

work of regeneration—not produced originally by any ſpecial influences of the holy Spirit—not accompanied, with any ſaving illuminations from above, with any ſpiritual view of the divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, any true hatred, to ſin, any ſenſe of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of holineſs, any ſoul-ſanctifying love to God and the Lord Jeſus.

                  <p>'Twas a ſpecial pleaſure to me, on my firſt arrival in America among the friendly Philadelphians, to obſerve how Papiſts, Epiſcopalians, Moravians, Lutherans, Calviniſts, Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts and Quakers, could paſs each other peaceably, and in good temper, on the ſabbath, after having broke up their reſpective aſſemblies—which I could not but take notice of, in an early letter to my native country.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that notwithſtanding this apparent regard for the rights of conſcience, I am really unfriendly to them, unleſs I will admit of an American epiſcopate. Though ſome may be prejudiced againſt it, from the fibbing, ranca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and abuſive oppoſition that certain D.

Yet, the rights of epiſcopalians are not thereby forfeited: and whenever the majority of them, laity included, (and not a few of the leading clergy, who are for more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage than the preſent equality admits) are deſirous of an American epiſcopate, and will ſee to it's being with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that the Biſhop and every other dignitary, ſhall be confined purely to ſpiritual matters—ſhall have no more rule in civil concerns, than the parochial prieſt—ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by no kind of tax, but by voluntary contributions, or from legacies given a full year before the death of the teſtator, when coming out of a real eſtate—and ſhall be deprived of all power to injure or interrupt other denominiations, let them be gratified. It will have a good effect, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our young men's making a trip to <hi>England</hi> for orders, which generally proves dangerous—to their love of freedom. But it will be long enough, 'ere ſome who have been ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly labouring to accompliſh a proteſtant American epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, will, with all their conſcientious attachment to, and zeal for it, agree to it's exiſtence in this new world upon ſuch equitable conditions; as may be inferred, from the little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention paid to what L—d S—g mentioned to them, at or in the neighbourhood of <hi>Amboy.</hi>
