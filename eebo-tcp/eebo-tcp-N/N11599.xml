            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lord Stirling, with his uſual intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and preciſion, has reconnoitered their numbers,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014660_0011_0F94570A0CB65948"/>
which he finds to be about ſeven thouſand. General Sullivan has appointed the hill with exquiſite judgment; where the Brigades under him and Lord Stirling, are to take poſt, and act as occaſion may require: twelve thouſand men are allotted for the ſervice of ſending them back to their ſhips. I, with eight thouſand, will ſtay within theſe lines, to be called out to the ſlaughter and purſuit; unleſs our preſent deliberations, alter this plan of operation. My Lord, the Council expects your opinion.</p>

                     <p>Good betide them both.—After this fuſtian, a little ſober reaſoning, General Sullivan, may fit the mind for the doubtful events of war. My apprehenſions from the King's troops, believe me, are trifling, compared with the riſque we run, from the people of America at large. The tyranny, that our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed uſurpation has made neceſſary, which they now feel, and feeling, I fear, will ſoon make them ſee thro' the diſguiſe. Their rage, no doubt, will be heightened, by the ſlaughter that will probably enſue; and we, as members of the Congreſs, fall the firſt victims of it.— O Sullivan! my heart never conſented to this ruin of my native country!</p>

                     <p>My dear General, the moments for reflection are elapſed, and irrecoverable, Our ſafety is firſt in conqueſt; if that is denied to our endeavours, I am ſure, we can obtain better terms, from our much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Sovereign, than from our more injured country: —but wear a leſs rueful countenance; it is a proverb among the troops, that their General is much melted down, ſince the fleet arrived.</p>

to our becoming the heads of the Church, in America; a dignity, that ſo properly belongs to the Elect, and for which, they have had the aſſurance to contend with the Lord's own people. As for the Quakers, who in general have joined the tories againſt us, we ſhall not fail to produce "an ancient teſtimony" in their behalf: I mean the teſtimony of our forefathers; till with fines, whipping, impriſonment, and the gallows, we have extirpated them from the face of the earth.</p>

Remember, Sir, the fuzee you filched at Merrick; item, the two watches, rings, &amp;c. &amp;c. at ſeveral other places; you gave me no account of theſe, though I had an equitable demand upon you for half. There is a fifty dollar fund for you,—don't you think, young man, to catch old birds with chaff. It is near night: I muſt to my poſt, and get you over the ferry to your duty.</p>

                     <p>Is it, really! then it is one of the baits, which the Continental Congreſs threw out, for the people of America to bite at; and the event gives the lie to the inflaming and prophetic oratory, this day reſounded from the pulpits of New-England. A day, on which, heaven has diſcarded them, and diſavowed their cauſe, in a remarkable manner. O King, our preachers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this unhappy diſpute, from coming to a bloodleſs iſſue.</p>

                     <p>It is a maxim with the Congreſs at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that by the marvellous, the vulgar are to be robb'd of their reaſon; but heaven has rejected the ſacrifice, that the people may open their eyes, and be no longer the dupes of their tyranny, deception and bloodſhed.</p>

                     <p>True, very true—ſtrangers, indeed, to moſt of them: the firſt they have amply uſurped from the people, and have had art enough, to make uſe of them as inſtruments, to confirm the uſurpation.</p>

                     <p>They are, indeed, ſuch monopolizers of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they do not ſuffer other people to follow their inclinations: but as we know, and conſequently deteſt, their machinations; let us avail ourſelves of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſervants, and the confuſion of retreat, to lie concealed, until they are clear of the iſland.</p>

                     <p>Agreed; and in order that we may claim the mercy, that our good old maſter has extended to his erring ſervants, and return to that authority which never oppreſſed a ſubject; let us renew our allegiance to the moſt amiable and virtuous Prince, that ever ſway'd a ſceptre; and join our weak endeavours, in ſupporting a conſtitution, that has been, at once, the envy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the whole world.</p>
