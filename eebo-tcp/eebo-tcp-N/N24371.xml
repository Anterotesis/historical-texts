            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE ſpirit of adventure which has increaſed in proportion with the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commerce, and of which it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a parent; has contributed much within the laſt hundred years, in expanding the human mind, and extending the bonds which formerly attached a ſociety only, round the whole univerſe and to each individual of the human ſpecies.</p>
            <p>To the aſpiring genius of a Columbus we owe our national exiſtence. It is to him the civilized world muſt bow with reverence, when the gold and ſilver of the New World, together with the immenſe ſources of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in natural hiſtory, and other ſciences, are laid open to their acquiſition by this diſcovery. It is to him that commerce owes its ſecond and more vigorous birth, and the art of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032239_0004_0FF131BA9A6C7338"/>navigation that perfection to which it has now arrived; through this art the remoteſt nations are united in knowledge, manners, and property, more intimately than the inhabitants of two provinces of one nation were in the fifteenth century.</p>
            <p>Under what immenſe obligations are the ſciences laid by the republics of Genoa and Venice, who gave to mankind the diſcoverer of America and the commerce of the Indies. Portugal and Spain partake of the glory which belongs to thoſe mighty enterprizes, in being the nations which opened the boſom of the New Indies, and intrepidly forced a new paſſage to the Old, round the boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cape of Africa. England, in her gallant Raleigh, Holland, in her ſcientific Dampier, and France in a crowd of enterpriſing navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, have had the honour of carrying the ſailing art to its preſent ſtate of excellence.</p>
            <p>Happy had it been for the Aborigines of the New World, and of many uncivilized
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032239_0005_0FF131C0B78A75C8"/>nations of the Old, had philanthropy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed where ſcience daringly trod, or had the principles of a humane philoſophy kept pace with the intrepidity of heroic adventure.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems to be the deſtiny of mankind to arrive at perfection in the ſciences by the ſlow progreſſion of ages only, and that it is given to the preſent period to obtain by experience the deſired principles of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when men are yet incapable of duly eſtimating their value, or delay till it is almoſt too late to convert them to a proper and immediate uſe.</p>
            <p>Uſeful leſſons are however taught by that ſpecies of experience which is derived from the hiſtory of nations and individuals. For the travels of men, who have viſited remote countries and people, whether actuated by the ſpirit of curioſity or gain, have ſignally contributed to the edification of the world at large, and to the intereſt of the philoſopher, the merchant, and the lover of adventure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032239_0006_0FF131C279F0C380"/>
It is not preſumed, however, that in the preſent work, ſuch great advantages as have already been derived from the writings of diſtinguiſhed travellers, ſhould be extended in an eminent degree; far from it; its claims are but the humble ſhare of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity; the object and courſe of travel, which it deſcribes, is not ſuſceptible of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary novelty, nor of ſcientific reſearch; ſome degree of both, however, we may venture to promiſe. Beſides, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under which the voyage was taken, and particularly the condition of total blindneſs to which the Author was reduced at the concluſion of it, may readily be conſidered as a preventative to the general perfection which the work would probably poſſeſs, if dictated under more favourable and happy circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The liberal minded citizens of America, to whom this work is dedicated, will freely make the few allowances expected in this part of its character. They, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032239_0007_0FF131C5D7261620"/>will not be deficient in their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic generoſity, when the circumſtances of the publication are conſidered; for little did the Author ſuſpect, when he made the notes from which this is compiled, that want of ſupport ſhould ever compel him to ſubmit his remarks to the criticiſm of the world.</p>
            <p>The ſtile and form of the compilation, with reſpect to words and expreſſions, will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perhaps require to be commented on: but the ſame liberal ſpirit of the candid reader will frame an excuſe in his mind at any part expoſed to the ſhafts of criticiſm; and kindly omit his remarks, when he ſhall learn that the work is brought forward by A STUDENT.</p>

            <head>A HISTORY, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>READERS of Travels like travellers are rarely ſatisfied, till they know ſome particulars of thoſe with whom they are about to embark, in purſuit of advantage or pleaſure: without this knowledge, ſome diſſatisfaction, or doubt, will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take place in their minds. In this view therefore it is that I think proper to introduce a few particulars concerning myſelf, which, on any other occaſion, would neither be ſufficiently important or intereſting to merit relation: but as the greater part of young men are directed through life more by accident than choice, and many of their fortunes and misfortunes to be placed rather at the door of chance than prediſpoſition;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032239_0009_0FF131CE9A119580"/>ſo, it will be uſeful on this occaſion, to mark the courſe which led me to the Voyage and Travels which I am about to relate, in order that the reader may carry the remembrance of my circumſtances and ſituation in life, and the part I acted in ſome tranſactions which I have to deſcribe; that I am not an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer of pleaſure nor of choice, but one who ſtarted from the humble walks of private life in ſearch of a competence, and launched into the ocean of the world with no other pilot than neceſſity, or other chart than that of a youthful knowledge of the world, deſtitute of every ſtock but that of induſtry and an active diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>My Father's family, although not popular in point of property, were reſpected for their induſtry and probity, in the town of Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Waſhington County, ſtate of New York, where I was born in 1772. Arrived at the age of eighteen, bred up with a diſpoſition to an active life in common with my countrymen, I was encouraged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032239_0010_0FF131D30CF86B58"/>a mercantile purſuit at the Town of Alsburgh, in the ſtate of Vermont; where having reſided, and witneſſed the wildly rude and romantic beauties, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded Lake Champlain, at the end of fourteen months I found my hopes of ſucceſs in buſineſs diſappointed, and that I muſt neceſſarily ſeek ſome new purſuit.</p>
            <p>Hearing it frequently ſaid that a young man of a moderate education and induſtrious habits, with a good recommendation, would be ſure of an eligible and conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſouthern ſtates, after adviſing with my friends and making the neceſſary preparations, I determined to proceed for Charleſton, South Carolina. I ſet out for Boſton on horſe-back, where I arrived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any very intereſting adventure, and ſoon obtained a paſſage by ſea for Charleſton, where I arrived in 20 days after leaving Boſton Harbour, heartily ſick of my firſt ſea voyage—as I called it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12"
                   facs="unknown:032239_0011_0FF131D4DD63B650"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
My circumſtances and proſpects on arriving in Charleſton by no means equalled my wants or expectations. Diſappointed hopes, and the ſtill predominating turn of my diſpoſition, prompted me to new purſuits, urged on by the more potent ſtimulus of neceſſity, and my efforts were redoubled, but without ſucceſs. While in this unſettled ſtate, an offer was made me of a ſituation on board a Guinea Trader; the ſhip had been delayed through the want of a ſupercargo. I was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently qualified, and happy did I conſider myſelf in obtaining a ſituation reputable in its nature and highly profitable in proſpect.</p>
            <p>We ſailed from Charleſton the 1ſt of Dec. 1793, on board the ſhip Charleſton, J. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly maſter, burthen 400 Tons; and after a paſſage partly boiſterous, and frequently becalmed for ſeveral days, we made the iſles of Delos on the 17th January 1794.</p>
            <p>Theſe iſlands are nine in number, and afford harbours and ſafe anchorage in deep
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032239_0012_0FF19E424CBC6428"/>water for ſhips of any burthen; they are ſix leagues from the main land of Africa, in 12 deg. 30 min. ſouth lat. they are inhabited by French and Engliſh factors, who find their account in living on thoſe iſlands in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the main, particularly from the circumſtances of accommodation for their ſhips, which lye here with the greateſt ſafety in all weathers, and that their ſlaves cannot eaſily eſcape. The ſlaves are in thoſe iſlands ſuffered to go at large, without chains, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the cuſtoms on the continent. The ſurface of the iſlands is barren and rocky, but there is abundance of fine freſh water; and proviſions are procured with facility.</p>
            <p>From the factors here we learned that the <hi>Ebo</hi> and <hi>Golo</hi> Kings had been at war, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whom having been defeated, and a great part of his army had fallen into the hands of the conqueror, they therefore adviſed us to proceed for the <hi>Reyo-pongo</hi> river, about 25 leagues ſouth weſtward, and from thence the acceſs to the <hi>Ebo</hi> nation would be eaſily
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032239_0013_0FF19E4693E769C8"/>ſecured, by a paſſage up that river and from thence by land, about three hundred miles from the mouth of this river; they furniſhed us with further directions, and aſſured us of a certain and good trade.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to this information, we provided ourſelves with ſuch neceſſaries as the factors could afford us, and proceeded for the <hi>Reyo-pongo,</hi> which we made on the 5th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and after chuſing a proper ſituation, came to anchor in a handſome harbour within the northern bank, three leagues from the mouth of the river, cloſe to the ſhore, in view of a luxuriant country, low, and thinly covered with ſcattered woods and pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque collections of reed. The oppoſite ſide of the river appearing in perſpective, more bold and riſing in proportion to its diſtance.</p>
            <p>The country bore the appearance of being frequently overflowed, which we afterwards learned to be the caſe; the banks were however covered with the moſt exuberant
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032239_0014_0FF19E4AE6765040"/>richneſs, the air was not intenſely hot, the clearneſs of the ſky charming, and the nights delightfully ſerene and tranquil.</p>
            <p>The river abounds with fiſh, of which we caught ſeveral, different in form from any that I had ever ſeen; and the crocodiles from numbers and ſize may be conſidered as in their native empire when in the <hi>Reyo-pongo;</hi> here the number of beautiful iſlands formed by the windings and diviſions of the river into branches afford them a ſecure and peaceful retreat.</p>
            <p>The tree moſt prominent and conſpicuous is the palm of various ſpecies, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one which I underſtood to be peculiar to Africa, which I ſhall have occaſion ſubſeqently to deſcribe, with a variety of uſes to which it is converted, and which renders its value ineſtimable to the natives.</p>
            <p>On the 6th February we were viſited by numbers of the natives, who offered to barter
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032239_0015_0FF19E4C78129188"/>with us fruit and ivory for our hardwares; but finding after we had exchanged a few articles, that they belonged to a nation which had been before repreſented to us as thinly inhabited, and that we could not accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date ourſelves here as we wiſhed, we made uſe of them to obtain information concerning the country of the <hi>Ebo</hi> king. We fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſound an interpreter acquainted with that country and the trade, him we engaged, and an expedition was immediately deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon by the captain.</p>
            <p>After ſome conſultation, no perſon could be found ſo ſuitable for the journey as myſelf, and the captain propoſed it to me. On viewing the dangers and difficulties that muſt be neceſſarily attendant on a journey of this kind; in which I was ignorant of the country, and its languages, and without any knowledge of the duties of the charge, but ſuch as might be derived from inſtructions that could not be expected to apply in all caſes that might occur, I was averſe to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032239_0016_0FF19E50D80E4F58"/>attempt, and declined in engaging in it; my reaſons were not deemed ſatisfactory by the captain, whoſe orders I muſt obey, and after obtaining as full an account as the poor negro interpreter could afford me, I was obliged to provide the neceſſaries for the journey, arranged my affairs on board the ſhip, and prepared for the expedition.</p>
            <p>An enterprize ſo hazardous, will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be conceived as undertaken with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable anxiety and apprehenſion. I was not deſtitute of reſolution, nor unuſed to hazardous expeditions; and a habit of perſeverance acquired on the borders of the extenſive American Lakes, and on the ſides of the Green Mountains, could not be inauſpicious to an adventurer ſo young, and much poſſeſſed of the ſanguine confidence peculiar to that period of life:—I had but barely entered on the courſe of a journey, in which the flattering allurements of profit were too potent to be conquered by ſears or forebodings!</p>

I now ſatisfied myſelf of the knowledge of my guide, of his acquaintance with the languages of the people, and with the courſe of the route which we were to purſue; and, having taken precautions to cultivate a kind underſtanding between my future fellow-traveller and companion, I provided myſelf with a ſtock of ammunition for ſport and defence, with a caſe of piſtols in my belt, a fuſil on my ſhoulder, and a hanger by my ſide; my friend <hi>Hurdee</hi> I furniſhed with a good fowling piece, a ſword, a handſome bow and arrows, purchaſed in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, ſome powder, ſhot, flints, trinkets, and a quantity of rum. With theſe we landed and ſet out on the morning of the fourth of February, accompanied by a crood of the natives, men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who appeared anxious to do us every ſort of kindneſs, and aid us by their good offices. They aſſiſted us in plucking fruit and paſſing over the creeks and gulleys acroſs which this days route lay. They left us, however, about two hours before noon, and we retired to the covert to avoid the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032239_0018_0FF130A958AF4278"/>heat of the ſun, and to partake of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the firſt time in this expedition.</p>
            <p>About 4 o'clock, P. M. we continued our journey nearly S. E. keeping a diſtant chain of mountains that appeared like a miſt, inclining to our left. The river lay before us, extending through a tract of country variegated with cluſters of trees, plains, and ſpacious ſwamps, covered with lofty and cluſtering reeds, or canes. Here we could mark on the ſides of the rivulet the traces of the voracious crocodile, which finds in theſe receſſes a ſecure retreat. Here, likewiſe, the windings of poiſonous ſerpents, of which Africa affords ſuch multitplied variety, are frequently obſerved. In the courſe of this evening my heart frequently palpitated with alarm, and my apprehenſions figured the wide jaws of the dreadful animal, or the poiſoned tooth about to ſtrike me, and finiſh, by a miſerable death, my journey and my cares. My fellow traveller was not deſtitute of vivacity, and being a ſtranger
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032239_0019_0FF19E59CA0BABA8"/>to fear from this quarter, took occaſion, when he ſaw me thoughtful as we walked along, to call my mind into action by explaining ſome of the African terms, which in the end proved of great utility.</p>
            <p>After about two hours march, we reached a deep ravine; through this it was neceſſary to paſs, in order to gain the hills which we had to croſs the enſuing day, and at the foot of which we were to take our repoſe for the night. The ſide upon which we ſtood was marſhy, and that oppoſite to us ſhaggy, and covered with thick irregular underwood. We had been ſearching for a place convenient to ford, the current appearing too rapid, and too deep, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acroſs with perfect confidence, when, as I was loſt in a momentary reflection, my companion ſuddenly roared out that there was a crocodile—I had ſcarcely power to move: a ſudden ruſtling in the reeds, with a loud plunge in the water, left me totally ſtupified: <hi>Hurdec</hi> had purſued the animal
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032239_0020_0FF19E5F9170B4D8"/>and cauſed his plunging into the water, and now returning, rouſed me from my terror by immoderate laughter. I judged it prudent, however, to conceal as much as poſſible my embarraſſment, acknowledging that I was in a ſlight degree alarmed. We croſſed the creek in a place that was fordable, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſcended the ſloping ſide of the oppoſite bank, which as we aſcended thickened with charming timber, and led to a long and winding range of beautiful hills, at the feet of which we could trace the river gradually narrowing to the eye, and receiving the tribute of a thouſand little ſtreams that flowed from the woods, and declivities that preſented themſelves in wild but ſimple grandeur, far as the ſight could reach in an eaſtwardly direction.—The approach of night, and the ſun ſetting behind us, threw an impoſing ſhade over this landſcape that is not capable of deſcription.</p>
            <p>We concluded to form our encampment in one of the valleys, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032239_0021_0FF19E6285E32BF0"/>to light a fire, and for the firſt time guard againſt the beaſts of prey, the traces of whoſe feet I marked with lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in the courſe of the day, and to keep clear of the monkeys that I learned to expect in great numbers, from the accounts my guide had already given me.</p>
            <p>We choſe a ſituation ſomewhat detached from the thickets beneath the rich and lofty palm tree, and having collected wood ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſuſtain large fires during the night, we dreſſed our plain but delicious repaſt, compoſed ourſelves to reſt, and paſſed a tolerably eaſy night, free from every real danger, although I was ſtill in ſome fear of the wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>Our diſtance from the villages that we had left I calculated, to be not more than ſixteen miles, having purſued with little deviation the irregular courſe of the river. To this we were compelled, in order to avoid the obſtructions to which we might have been
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032239_0022_0FF19E64152C5D48"/>ſubjected by the inhabitants who occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſide, at this ſeaſon of the year, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the oppoſite bank of the river. To their proximity, <hi>Hurdee</hi> informed me we might attribute the compoſure of the night, and my being releaſed from the terrific howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>The opening of the morning was the ſignal for our riſing. Having dreſſed our neceſſary proviſions of goats fleſh over night, we refreſhed as appetite required, and after bathing in an adjacent rivulet, we proceeded on our journey. After two hours travel along the ſkirt of an irregular hill, we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at ſome diſtance, ſeveral of the natives ſcattered apart with bows and arrows: theſe <hi>Hurdee</hi> informed me were in purſuit of game. We endeavoured to gain the covert of the wood, but they had alſo perceived us, and had formed into two parties, one of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves in our way, and appeared diſpoſed to diſpute our paſſage through the path into which we had turned. They ſtood
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032239_0023_0FF19E6714CFB688"/>for a conſiderable time with marks of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, but without the leaſt appearance of violent intentions. In the mean time, the other party had approached us at ſome diſtance behind, where they alſo ſtood fixed with admiration.</p>
            <p>My unacquaintance with the temper of the people, and judging of their ferocity by circumſtances that belonged to the ſevere character of the ſavages of the American Lakes, I ſuggeſted to my companion my fears of their intentions being hoſtile: he made anſwer they were friends, and left me little opportunity for further conſideration, when he advanced towards them in a ſlow pace; I followed him in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>When we had reached the party in front within about twenty paces, <hi>Hurdee</hi> ſpoke to them in their own language; they appeared much pleaſed, and approached us without further reſerve; the ſecond party ſoon after joined us likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:032239_0024_0FF19E6B5FB3CC88"/>
My companion informed them of the propoſed extent of our journey; they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much ſurprize at our undertaking a journey of ſuch length, with ſo few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and through countries thickly infeſted by beaſts of prey; this latter part of their information, however, was concealed from me at that time. A party of theſe negroes propoſed to accompany us part of our route, to which we aſſented, and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany partook of refreſhment about noon. At 4 o'clock in the evening, as we aſcended a hill marked by beaten pathways, the ſerenity of the ſky and the ſtillneſs of the air cauſed me to notice the violent agitation of a tree at ſome diſtance before us, on the ſkirt of a ſhady cluſter: I pointed it out to the guide, and to the negroes; they drew me out of the path into a more open one, and I learned the following particulars of a large ſnake, whoſe beauteous folds but cumbrous form, I could diſcern upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching it at a ſafe diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:032239_0025_0FF19E6E4C47C0C8"/>
This ſpecies of ſnake grows to the length of 24 feet, being in diameter from ſix to eight inches; its back is of a deep green, intermingled with luminous colours, and its belly of a lighter ſhade; its motions are ſlow, therefore not dangerous if diſcovered in time by the traveller. It ſeizes its prey by ſtratagem, climbing lofty trees cloſe to the pathways of men and cattle: theſe it attacks by winding its tail round the trunk of the tree, and letting its fore folds fall on the object it means to deſtroy; after cruſhing it to death in the inſtant of ſurpriſe, it devours its victim at leiſure. The negroes complained of ſome recent miſchief committed in that neighbourhood, and <hi>Hurdee</hi> ſuggeſted that the deſtruction of this ſnake with our fire arms would be at once eaſy to us, and highly agreeable to our good natured fellow-travellers.</p>
            <p>We accordingly loaded our guns with two balls each, and having taken a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient poſition ſo as to fire together, we
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032239_0026_0FF19E6FDD9B44F8"/>perceived from the noiſe, and the blood flowing down the trunk of the tree, that it was ſeverely wounded. It preſently made a moſt hideous noiſe, and vented its rage on the branches of the tree, which having torn in various directions, gave us a more clear view of his violent ſtruggles</p>
            <p>I was not perfectly ſatisfied as to our ſafety from its rage, and prepared to complete its deſtruction by another diſcharge. The negroes who had ſeen with aſtoniſhment the effect of our arms, had retired to ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance behind us; we fired a ſecond time, and the monſter fell gaſping to the ground, where it lay a few minutes apparently dying; but ſuddenly collecting the vigour of deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and torture, threw itſelf into various forms; now it collected itſelf, blood flowing from its wounds, in knots and circles, cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and breaking the young ſaplings that that grew within his circuit; exhauſted by its ſtruggles and the loſs of blood, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes approached and helped to complete
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032239_0027_0FF19E716E4E1C58"/>the cataſtrophe with their arrows; <hi>Hurdee</hi> employed his hanger, and aſſiſted in cutting off ſuch parts of the animal as they choſe, which they did with exultation: they each took ſuch parts as ſuited them, and night approaching, we were conſtrained to ſeek a convenient place of reſt. Our fellow travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers reſolved to ſpend the night with us, which gave me conſiderable pleaſure. We encamped, and fires were kindled in a lovely valley. The negroes fell to dreſſing their ſnake with great glee, and feaſted heartily on its ſlices and rice cake; while I preferred ſome dryed ſhip beef, which from prejudice I choſe rather than their high flavoured luxurious banquet.</p>
            <p>Free from the anxieties of the previous night, and fatigued by the labour and exertions of the day, I lay down in the midſt of them, and ſlept undiſturbed by noiſe or care till the break of day, when I awoke refreſhed and chearful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032239_0028_0FF19E74694D0B38"/>
The advantage and ſecurity derived from our innocent and voluntary fellow travellers, rendered it painful to me to part with them; I ſignified my wiſh that they would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany us farther; they expreſſed ſome reluctance, but the promiſe of a few trinkets which I ſhewed them prevailed, and theſe children of nature, agreed to accompany us further on our journey, to the foot of certain mountains which they called <hi>Kailoo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After bathing, a rule which I reſolved to purſue every day when the contiguity of water afforded me an opportunity, and which I purſued thenceforward; we break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted on our uſual ſimple fare, and ſet forward.</p>
            <p>After a journey direct E. of about fifteen miles, over a beautiful champain country, we made the banks of the river <hi>Dundy,</hi> running from the N. E. which being too rapid and deep to ford, we were obliged to bend our courſe four miles along the bank;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032239_0029_0FF19E78B69E48D8"/>but the heat of the day growing irkſome, we took to the covert and reſolved to conſtruct a raft; we procured timber, and having ſecured them by ropes of withy and vine, we croſſed at a convenient bending, and ſet ourſelves over by poles, aſſiſted with great addreſs by our fellow travellers, with whom we were now become completely familiar.</p>
            <p>This river diſplayed an abundance of various fiſh, of which our negroes caught ſeveral with peculiar ingenuity for our eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning's repaſt; and after a march of four hours we gained a riſing ground, on the ſide of which we determined to ſpend the night.</p>
            <p>The ſurrounding country in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of this river is truly luxuriant; the ſoil is ſoft and loamy, producing a variety of elegant flowering ſhrubs, and fruit trees; among which are the wild orange and limes, with tufts of the rich <hi>bannana</hi> and pine apple. We provided ourſelves with as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032239_0030_0FF19E7A488E6248"/>much as we could carry of theſe rich ſtores, underſtanding that our next day's route would be more irkſome and fatiguing.</p>
            <p>We roſe early, and as uſual comfortably refreſhed; my health was never better than I had hitherto experienced it in this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and I ſeemed to feel an agility of mind and body that was ſuperior both to danger and fatigue.</p>
            <p>The accuſtomed formalities of the broiled and roaſted, with the morning deſſert and the ſimple beverage, being diſpatched, we ſet forward, with a party of our friendly Africans in front. We had aſcended a ſloping ground, and wiſhed to reach by a leſs-circuitous route the elevated country which our little party in advance had gained, where we ſaw and heard them ſhouting for us to haſten, as we underſtood it. We found much difficulty to form a new path, but at length ſucceeded, and were exceedingly alarmed to find a youth of about ſeventeen
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032239_0031_0FF19E7BE2929218"/>bewailing loudly: his father, a robuſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle aged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cheerful man, had been bitten by a large ſnake which they call the <hi>Hoopel Koppel;</hi> the animal's head had been cut off by the boy, and the body lay writhing at his feet, while he vented his complaints and the bitterneſs of his reſentments, in language that I could not comprehend otherwiſe than by the vehemence of his actions, and by his emphaſis. <hi>Hurdee</hi> acquainted me with the particulars of the honeſt boy's imprecations; and I haſtened to the old man, whom I found in the moſt tranquil manner applying medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to the wound, which was on the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior of his left thigh. The antidote to this moſt poiſonous of ſnakes is a ſimple root, which the Africans always carry about them; they chew it to the conſiſtence of a ſoft pulp, and apply it like a poultice to the wound; removing it continually as the poiſon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours the application, until the chewed root remains of its original colour, when they finiſh the operation by waſhing the part affected in clean water, and applying a large
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032239_0032_0FF19E81D48B8580"/>portion of the root, which they faſten with a bandage over the wound, where it remaine till the cure is effected. We neceſſarily halted till the proceſs was completed, and as it was tedious, were conſtrained to prepare for dreſſing our mid-day meal earlier than uſual.</p>
            <p>The animal that had been thus the cauſe of our delay meaſured nine feet without the head, which was flat and ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the fore part of the <hi>ſole</hi> fiſh, or black flounder; the tongue forked; the body thick; the back of a dirty yellow and brown, very like the rattleſnake The bite is not always curable, to which cauſe muſt be attributed the grief of the boy; his father, however, appeared no wiſe diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed, and we had the pleaſure to ſee the application come from the wound without the leaſt appearance of poiſon, after about three hours application. The attention of theſe innocent people to their wounded bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their activity and kindneſs in procuring
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032239_0033_0FF19E84C777AEA0"/>the antidote and encouraging him not fear, was extremely impreſſive, and ſuch as is not always to be ſeen among more poliſhed people.</p>
            <p>I examined the head of this ſnake, and the Africans pointed to me the cavities in which he conceals his venom of death. It is contained in a ſack, at the roots of the two teeth anſwering to the canine teeth; the upper and lower jaws, are likewiſe armed with each a ſmaller row of teeth, uſed as I ſuppoſe for maſtication only. The Africans deſcribe the effects of this poiſon as extremely ſudden and dreadful, if the antidote is not immediately at hand: in this caſe, the body is ſaid to ſwell to an uncommon bulk, with excruciating torture: the ſwelling continues till the body burſts, when death follows and cloſes the ſcene.</p>
            <p>We had a difficult journey for the next day, it was therefore agreed to gain the eaſtern ſide of the hill, or rather mountain,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032239_0034_0FF19E87C23CFF80"/>upon which we now were, and having ſet out about 3 o'clock, we reached the ſummit by an eaſy march, through a broken and unequal piece of ground; and at about 7 o'clock, being much fatigued, we reached an agreeable ſituation, where we propoſed to reſt for the night.</p>
            <p>The cuſtomary preparations of collecting wood for fire, and arranging our rations of food, were ſcarcely made, when one of the Africans ſignified with ſome alarm that he ſaw a fire at ſome diſtance. I had ſeen a ſmall blaze myſelf, a few minutes before; but felt no ſenſe of alarm at it, more than I ſhould at any other ordinary occurrence, from being unacquainted with the danger. The diſtance might be about three leagues, and it was on a mountain from which we were ſeparated by a deep and gloomy valley; I found that <hi>Hurdee</hi> as well as my other companions were extremely uneaſy, and ſignified that it would be preferable to remove, to a ſituation where we ſhould be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032239_0035_0FF19E8963EB28F0"/>be covered from the danger of our fire's being ſeen at a diſtance. We accordingly bent our courſe to the ſouthward round the contiguous hill; and after a march of about a mile and a half, found a convenient ſhelter under a lofty cliff of rocks, where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to dreſs ſome veniſon, caught the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day by one of our Africans, in a ſnare that he had ſet for the purpoſe. We paſſed the night to a later hour than uſual, in converſation with our companions, who were to part with us, on their return, in the morning. We ſlept till the uſual hour the next morning without alarm. The diſtance from the water we found to be a very ſevere inconvenience; ſo we haſtened our dry repaſt, and having diſtributed, as I propoſed, a variety of trinkets among our good natured friends, we ſaw the old man and his ſon depart in perfect health and ſpirits, and with ſome evidences of regret at our ſeparation, a ſentiment which came home to my boſom with new and redoubled ſenſibility.</p>

It was vain to repine, and reſolution to perſevere and fortitude to bear, were now the only feelings that could be of uſe to us. I determined to brave every apprehenſion— and in a critical time, for we were now on the confines of a nation of whoſe pacific diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition my guide ſuggeſted ſome fears; a matter the more alarming to me, as it was not his uſual character hitherto to betray ſymptoms of alarm.</p>
            <p>We purſued our journey, keeping the deepeſt covert of the woods, occaſionally aſcending every prominent ground that could afford a proſpect of the country before us. This day for the firſt time I ſaw a Panther; he was diſcovered by <hi>Hurdee;</hi> he came frequently in ſight, but hung down his head and retired into ſome neighbouring thicket whenever we turned round to look at him. My guide, ſimply enough, ſaid that the beaſt was terrified at ſeeing a white man, and to this cauſe it was he attributed his retiring, when I turned round. Such, however, was
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032239_0037_0FF19E9202CBE588"/>the fact; for when I kept advancing and <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> remained a few paces behind, the animal ſemed to redouble his pace forward till I turned round, and he then retreated with equal precipitation.</p>
            <p>My companion ſuggeſted a fear that he might climb a tree and ſpring upon us, as he ſaid it was a common practice with thoſe animals; and being obliged ſtill to travel through the woods to avoid diſcovery by the natives, it was no leſs dangerous for us to fire our guns. <hi>Hurdee</hi> feared capture, as he ſaid he ſhould certainly be deſtroyed, if taken, and that I ſhould be kept at leaſt a conſiderable time a captive, perhaps till ranſomed. Night approaching with this choice of difficulties, we reſolved to retire into a thick receſs, and there keep large fires burning all night; to ſleep and watch by turns.</p>
            <p>Having choſen our lodgment and kindled our fires we ſupped as uſual; I determined
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032239_0038_0FF19E9395372AE8"/>to keep the firſt watch; <hi>Hurdee</hi> had lain down to ſleep, and I was parading cloſe to the fire, when <hi>Hurdee,</hi> who had heard the ſound of ſteps on the ground ſuddenly ſtarted up and ran to his gun: I directed him not to fire but at my order, and ſhould I fire, not to diſcharge his piece, till I ſhould have loaded. We could hear the trampling of a ſoft foot, and the ruſtling of the buſhes cloſe on our left, but could not determine whether it proceeded from man or beaſt. We were ſoon ſatisfied however that it was our morning viſitor, whom we could ſee croſſing and recroſſing an opening in our front where the fire was low: we therefore renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our fire, and threw ſeveral pieces of the lighting wood in the track of the animal, who we found retreated ſnorting, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Finding ourſelves thus ſucceſsful, we kept our fires alternately well lighted, and obtained a troubled ſleep, but ſufficient for a moderate refreſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:032239_0039_0FF19E982155FF20"/>
In the morning we purſued our route rather to the eaſtward, the mountain ſide bending off in that direction. The morning ſun ſhined extremely hot through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and we could diſcern a variety of wild animals, ſuch as I had never ſeen before; the monkeys were very numerous, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leopards beautifully ſpotted, paſſed us affrighted, moſtly in pairs.</p>
            <p>About noon we had gained higher ground, the woods grew thinner, and we had an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional proſpect of an open, but mountainous tract of country, extremely romantic, but dreary in the diſtant appearance. We loit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through the heat of the day in a ſhady ravine or glen, worn through rocks and ſands by ſtreams from ſprings in the boſom of the mountain; here we enjoyed the pleaſure of bathing, and an agreeable repaſt of wild fruits.</p>
            <p>The courſe that we had hitherto purſued was tedious, and though not deſtitute of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032239_0040_0FF19E9B1D02C5E8"/>pleaſures was fatiguing and attended with danger. We had calculated the diſtance we had come as well as we could, and concluded that we muſt be not far from the <hi>little Congo</hi> river; we determined to follow the courſe of the ravine, to the place into which the water diſcharges itſelf; often were we on the verge of retracing the path we had come up to the ſummit, the fatigue was ſo exceſſive, and the heat reflected from the rocks and a chalky loam on the ſides of the ravine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intolerable; it became neceſſary to take up our nights reſt in this glen, where we reſted well but with our fires as uſual.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning we purſued our route downwards: the deſcent became leſs ſteep, and the water accumulating, gradually formed a deep rivulet. About 10 o'clock, we had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing the winding of a beautiful little river, flowing with gentleneſs along the ſkirts of the hills. We concluded it muſt fall into the <hi>Congo,</hi> and accordingly reſolved to conſtruct a raft to
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032239_0041_0FF19E9F81BBD900"/>croſs. After ſome labour we effected our purpoſe, and gained the oppoſite bank about eight miles down. Here we could perceive the track of human feet: we, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, determined to change our courſe directly S. E. though the champaign lands, and to keep the ſhade, which was but light, conſiſting of trees thinly ſcattered and of ſlender growth, interſperſed with a tree like the wild date, and the palm tree in great variety. About 5 o'clock, when we had walked about an hour and a half after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we came unexpectedly upon a town of the natives. The huts ſtood ſcattered irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly in our front, and the appearance of fallow land ſtretched off contiguous to them on the right and rear. Fortunately, the village was deſerted, but we could obſerve on an open elevation the ſmoke of domeſtic fires at the duſk of evening, a conſiderable way to the eaſtward. We were obliged once more, with reluctance, to ſeek the woods to the ſouthward of us; and encamped that night amid the horrors of the deſart,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032239_0042_0FF19EA2838B1AC0"/>the roaring of the tyger, and other beaſts that haunt the neighbourhood of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſavage.</p>
            <p>We ſlept none this night!—Its horrors are ſtill awake in my memory, and I ſhudder when I recall them!—Our fires appeared ſcarcely ſufficient for our protection. We heard the ſtep of the heavy breathing tyger, his horrid, broken, panting aſpiration: this, with the thrilling ſcreams of the <hi>jackall,</hi> the yell of the wild dog, and the ruſtling of the leaves and branches, on ſeveral ſides, kept us in a ſtate of terror that cannot be conceived, but by thoſe have experienced ſuch ſituations, and ſeen the glaring eyes of the moſt fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animals rolling within a few paces, and ready to pounce upon and tear the trembling victim to a thouſand pieces.</p>
            <p>Thinking it beſt, when day joyfully broke in upon us, to quit this neighbourhood, where the vacated village already pointed out a warning that we had neglected, of the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032239_0043_0FF19EA57B5BF410"/>dangerous courſe we were purſuing; we determined to prefer the riſque of expoſure to our own ſpecies, than to the monſters of the wood, and again bent our courſe to the eaſtward. About 11 o'clock, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by two of the natives, armed with bows and arrows, apparently hunting. A half ſcream expreſſed the firſt emotions of their ſurprize; our confuſion was no leſs extreme, perhaps it was more ſo. They retired ſoftly to ſome diſtance, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ran away with infinite ſpeed, and we ſoon loſt ſight of them.</p>
            <p>My perturbation may be conceived. I revolved paſt, preſent, and future, with the rapid glance of regret and apprehenſion:—<hi>Hurdee,</hi> too, was loſt in reflection; but ſoon collected himſelf, and endeavoured to cheer me. We lamented that we had not kept the margin of the great river, where our dangers could not have been greater than they now were; and that our journey could not be many days longer. I ſaw the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032239_0044_0FF19EA89830A468"/>of this after-wiſdom; but it tended to rouſe me. <hi>Hurdee</hi> could not diſtinguiſh of what nation they were: he ſuppoſed they might be of the <hi>Ebo</hi> country, but they alſo reſembled natives of the <hi>Galla,</hi> from which we could not be very diſtant. If they were of the former, we might deem ourſelves ſecure; if the latter, there was ſome danger: we concluded it to be ſafeſt to get out of their way. <hi>Hurdee</hi> ſuggeſted that their ſurprize was principally excited by the ſight of a white man; and that curiouſity, as well as other motives, might tempt them to follow us with a large body of men. We made for the adjacent hills, and as we aſcended them, could obſerve a numerous body of the natives purſuing the courſe we had taken: we accordingly changed our courſe from the S. E. to the N. E. and rather ran than walked.</p>
            <p>We had to croſs a mountain, and after labouring to its ſummit, we became expoſed from the want of cover, there being little
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032239_0045_0FF19EAD02A283C8"/>elſe of vegetation but a light herbage and bruſh wood. We viewed them from an elevated ground as they croſſed open patches, and then crept on our hands and knees, and crouched behind cluſters of the thicket to prevent diſcovery.</p>
            <p>From the different views we had of them, we eſtimated them at about three hundred in number: they were armed with clubs, lances, bows and arrows, and kept their uſual order of battle in a very compact body. <hi>Hurdee</hi> now ſeemed ſatisfied that they were of the <hi>Galla</hi> nation, and he was certain we muſt be the objects of their purſuit.</p>
            <p>We reſolved to keep them in view, and watch till they ſhould encamp, when we might take advantage of the night to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march them: we did ſo, and embraced the cover of the night to return to our former courſe direct to the eaſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47"

This whole night we travelled without ceaſing, under conſtant alarm from the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wild beaſts. The night was exceſſive dark, and we could not diſcern any objects at a great diſtance. I drew the charge from one of my piſtols, and when we heard a ruſtling among the buſhes near us, burned priming, as the only expedient we could deviſe beſide firing ſhot, which we would not do, leſt we ſhould alarm our purſuers.</p>
            <p>About day break my companion trod upon a ſmall green ſnake, which bit his right leg cloſe to the outer ankle. I was much alarmed; but he very coolly took ſome of the root out of his pouch, and chewing it as the good old African had before done; the juice of the root was white like milk, but on applying it to the wound it changed to a yellow, diſagreeable colour: having repeatedly applied it, until the juice was no longer diſcoloured, he tied a bandage round it, and we purſued our route, happy that he had eſcaped ſo well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:032239_0047_0FF19EB020C2AC48"/>
This root I have repeatedly ſeen; but from a neglect of concerns leſs important for the time, I unfortunately did not bring it with me. The loſs of my ſight would prevent me from knowing it, ſhould it be common in our country; which I think probable, as the American Indians ſay they poſſeſs the knowledge of a ſimilar powerful antidote. This root appears to me as acting upon the poiſon by decompoſing it by ſome peculiar quality of its own juice. It is certain that the poiſon does not remain in the wound; and from the colour of the juice being changed, I ſuppoſe it muſt be by a decompoſition of the conſtituent parts; for a change in its properties and appearance is certainly effected<note n="*" place="bottom">A diſcovery was made a few years ago in the Eaſt Indies, by a phyſician, that the EAU DE LUCE, commonly uſed as a reſtorative, by perſons of a nervous habit, is a ſovereign antidote to the poiſon of the moſt venomous reptile. A variety of caſes, in which it was tried and found to baffle the poiſon of the <hi>Couvre Capelle</hi> of India, and that of the deadly brown adder, have been publiſhed in the Aſiatic Reſearches. A table ſpoonful has been found ſufficient: it is taken internally and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied externally with as little loſs of time as poſſible. This, it is probable, acted by the volat. alk. which is its chief ingredient, neutralizing the virulence of the poiſon.—Might not the vegetable alkaline principle exiſt in the juice of our antidote above in a ſtate either detached or eaſily ſeparable, ſo as to neutralize the matter of poiſon in a ſimilar manner? This is merely conjecture, but may be well worthy the further attention of medical men; for if found juſt, nothing more will be found neceſſary to cure the bite of a ſnake, than the application of a little pot-aſh.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:032239_0048_0FF19EB5DD8167E0"/>
Hunger, which we had diſregarded in the moments of terror, now came on with the utmoſt force; and our dried beef and other proviſions growing ſhort, it was neceſſary that we ſhould ſeek for ſome freſh proviſions. We were not ſufficiently remote from the <hi>Galla</hi> men to truſt to our fire arms; but <hi>Hurdee</hi> being expert with his bow and arrows, we reſolved to uſe them and ſpare our powder and ſhot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:032239_0049_0FF19EB8C820C3C8"/>
He accordingly let fly at the firſt animal we met, and it fell, we could find no wound but a ſlight one in the leg. We collected wood, made a fire, and were about to dreſs our prey, when lo! it diſappeared. We were about to go in ſearch of ſome other animal, when we found it ruſtling in the buſhes, and ſoon retook it. In ſhape and colour it reſembled the <hi>Opoſſum,</hi> except that it had no pouch or falſe belly; the hair alſo was much ſhorter—However, when dreſſed, it taſted deliciouſly; and after breakfaſt, for the firſt time, we lay down to ſleep.</p>
            <p>We awoke about 10 o'clock, tolerably refreſhed; and having yet to paſs a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which we hoped would be the laſt, we judged it prudent to keep on the verge of the woods, between that and the top of the aſcent. About 4 o'clock we diſcovered fires at a diſtance, and veſtiges of population in the pathways which interſected each other, and appeared newly trodden. The appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of population to the northward were
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032239_0050_0FF19EBA6229D598"/>very diſtinguiſhable; and therefore, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that we approached ſome of thoſe numerous nations, that conſtantly inhabit the luxurious countries in the neighbourhood of the <hi>Congo</hi> River near its ſources, and the charming vallies at the feet of the <hi>Galla</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the ſouth and eaſtern ſides; we determined to be circumſpect, and proceed by eaſy journies to avoid falling into the hands of either of them.</p>
            <p>Night was approaching faſt, we had deſcended the mountain towards the E. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſouthwardly, and the ſun was already hidden from us by the heights we had paſſed, which threw their ſhadows over the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful vallies that we could juſt diſtinguiſh, expanded to a boundleſs diſtance before us. We determined to proceed ſlowly towards the low country, and repoſe once more ſecure from the terrors of the foreſt; to view the country the next day, and to take ſuch ſteps as might be moſt like to enſure our ſafe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032239_0051_0FF19EBF154C31B8"/>arrival, now that we could not be remote from the place of deſtination.</p>
            <p>A few monkies, whoſe chattering was no longer deemed an annoyance, after our acquaintance with ſounds ſo chilling and terrific, were our only diſturbers during the night;—we ſlept peaceably, and roſe with the dawn.</p>
            <p>Having agreed to reconnoitre the country before we ſhould proceed, we made a kind of feſtival of this charming morning. We unpacked our powder, and repacked our flints, and trinkets; we cleaned our arms, and by the time we had partaken of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful breakfaſt, the ſides of the green hills and plains beneath us, were diſcloſed to our view by the opening ſun, in a ſtyle of verdure and beauty truly delighting. The light ſhades of the ſloping hill on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſtern aſpect, contraſted by the duſky hue of the valleys on the ſouthern and weſtern
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032239_0052_0FF19EC0E35C1020"/>ſides; and the irregularity of the ſhades caſt by the profile of the more elevated hills, on the plains ſcattered through the winding vallies, gradually deſcending, and the whole proſpect vividly brightning without miſt or cloud in the horizon, altogether exhibited, a ſcene of ſerene grandeur that warmed my heart and made me almoſt forget the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences I had ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>The country was thickly peopled, the marks of cultivation were viſible on the ſides of the declining plains, and on the level; but no river could be ſeen. We conſidered it however, as at no great diſtance, and reſolved to paſs the day as a time of reſt, and to purſue our journey under the protection of night to avoid diſcovery, until we ſhould judge that we had gained the country of the <hi>Ebo</hi> King.</p>
            <p>After a pleaſant dinner we went to repoſe preparatory for the nights travel, we awoke about ſun-ſet, immediately deſcended to the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032239_0053_0FF19EC3D528C368"/>valley, and ſet forward; we continued this courſe for four nights, frequently meeting with ſettlements, and changing our courſe thro' the neareſt woods to avoid the haunts of men; living upon cold proviſions, or the fruits which we gathered in abundance as we paſſed along.</p>
            <p>The country we had now gained was once more apparently very fertile and watered with little rivulets, which promiſed us the pleaſure of ſpeedily gaining the banks of that river, for which we had long looked with aching eyes. On the morning of the fifth day before ſun-riſe, we reached the bank, and were fortunate enough to find means to paſs it without difficulty or danger; now we conſidered ourſelves, as the mariner after a long voyage, arrived at the deſtined port.</p>
            <p>The paths from the river were now no longer objects to be ſhunned, we purſued
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032239_0054_0FF19EC991376CC8"/>that which appeared to be the greateſt; and about 9 o'clock we entered a handſome village.</p>
            <p>Our appearance alarmed the inhabitants, who fled from their huts, and collected in conſiderable numbers, with their ſimple arms in their hands. <hi>Hurdee,</hi> whoſe countenance lighted up with pleaſure, ſeeing they were friends, gave his gun to me, and made the uſual ſignal of peace, by ſheathing his arrows and hanging his bow over his ſhoulders. They then approached near us, and he delivered to them his bow and knife, telling them we were on our way from the <hi>Congo</hi> to the <hi>Ebo</hi> King to trade, on which they returned his knife and bow, and told him we were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſhould be well received.</p>
            <p>I propoſed delivering my arms likewiſe, but <hi>Hurdee</hi> adviſed me not, thinking that as they were very ſcarce in that country, and conſequently highly valuable, they might be prompted to detain them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:032239_0055_0FF19ECB2182CFC8"/>
The eaſe and good humor with which we were received was to me moſt conſolitary, and I took it to be a moſt flattering preſage of the ſucceſs to attend our laborious and dangerous enterprize. We were conducted into one of their houſes, or huts, compoſed of ſlight timbers or branches ſunk in the earth, or in an artificial bank of earth raiſed about a foot above the ordinary level of the ſcite of the village. The tops of the huts are round, or dome like, formed very rudely into that ſhape, by bending the tops of the branches toward the centre, and there tying them with ſlender ſaplings to each other. The broad and fan-like branches of the palm and date tree, tied by their ſtems on the outſide, and the points downward, form their covering or thatch. Repeated layers of theſe materials, and the ſkins of animals, are further uſed to defend theſe humble habitations from the moſt ſevere rains; and as the domeſtic offices of cookery, and their rude handicraft works are performed in the open air, or in the ſhade of branching trees,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032239_0056_0FF19ED11B255740"/>which here are never diſrobed of their foliage, their ſmall dwellings are not incommoded by this ſort of family buſineſs. The inſects ſo troubleſome in warm countries, eſpecially adjacent to woods or low grounds, are kept aloof by the inartificial expedient of a thick ſmoke produced by fires kept conſtantly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and compoſed of the dung of their cattle, or a compoſition of leaves of trees or reeds and rotted timber kept in a ſtate of moiſture.</p>
            <p>Theſe artificial clouds had not yet diſſipated in my new habitation, and the effect on my eyes was conſiderably painful: through my friend <hi>Hurdee</hi> care was taken to eaſe me on that head, and a repaſt was ſoon ſerved up, of which we partook with minds and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites that converted the habitation of the ſavage into a palace, and gave a reliſh to the food equal to that enjoyed by the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Seated on the floor, on ſkins and mats ſpread for us, we feaſted on freſh beef and ears of maize roaſted, and for our deſſert
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032239_0057_0FF19ED40ADA59D0"/>on the fineſt <hi>bannanas:</hi> our drink was new milk and palm wine.</p>
            <p>The people had caught the information, on all ſides, of the arrival of one of thoſe extraordinary animals a white man, and all thronged, eager as it appeared to diſcover whether it reſembled the men or the monkies of their own country; for ſuch it appeared were the compariſons they made, and in a manner, as I afterwards underſtood, no wiſe flattering to the pride of a fair ſkin.</p>
            <p>The women appear among the Africans to be endowed with the ſexual attribute of curioſity, in common with thoſe of all other colours and countries: they thronged foremoſt around me, and ſo crowded that I found it neceſſary for the ſake of air, and to gratify curioſity at once, to walk abroad. The children looked with wonder, and the women according to their age or temper tittered, roared out in laughter, or claſped their hands,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032239_0058_0FF19ED6FA2FF730"/>as they were each affected. Some opened my hair, others examined my jacket and trowſers; my ſleeve buttons amuſed one, and the frill of my ſhirt another; my hair, which had by their curioſity or accident become looſe, was the object of admiration to all.</p>
            <p>Their familiarity ſurpriſed me for a time; but reflecting that it muſt be the natural conſequence of innocent curioſity excited by novelty, I returned their freedom with good humour, and ſound that they were pleaſed with my manner of treating them.</p>
            <p>Fatigued with the previous travel, and tired with trifling, I ſignified to <hi>Hurdee</hi> my wiſh of retiring to reſt: he accordingly informed the villagers, and we were ſoon left alone. After this we partook of a ſecond repaſt conſiſting of boiled rice, mutton, and palm wine, and agreeing to ſet out for the reſidence of the <hi>Ebo</hi> king on the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032239_0059_0FF19EDA01CE3438"/>morrow, retired to a comfortable and ſecure repoſe.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning we were awakened by the villagers, fifteen of whom had been appointed to eſcort us on our route. They were armed with lances pointed, ſome with bone, others with a hard burnt wood, and ſome with iron. They had bows and arrows, the former more than three feet long, the arrows of irregular lengths, from about eighteen inches to two feet, coarſely barbed.</p>
            <p>After a ſlight refreſhment of fruit and palm wine, we proceeded to the ſouthward, it being about 4 o'clock in the morning. A great croud of the villagers had collected to view the prodigy once more, and many of them accompanied us, not tired of gazing, till near mid-day; when we lay by for reſt, and retired from the heat which was now daily encreaſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:032239_0060_0FF19EDE4A2221A8"/>
We did not reach the next village until after dark: one of our eſcort had preceded us about an hour, and had provided a hut much more commodious than that in which we had laſt lain: here we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable beds of neatly formed mats, and here marks of ingenuity were evident in a ſpecies of wicker work on the walls, or rather partitions; refreſhments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us in like manner, without their ſeeking for recompence of any kind.</p>
            <p>We roſe early as uſual, but our fame was up before us with the villagers; who here and on the greater part of our courſe incommoded and ſometimes obſtructed our paſſage by their numbers.</p>
            <p>The country through which we now tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled was extremely pictureſque, and the towns thickly ſcattered diſplayed to me much more enlarged ideas of their civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than I had before conceived. Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed to be carried on with much
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032239_0061_0FF19EDFD7D71E70"/>induſtry, but not indeed with any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of regularity or ſyſtem. The grounds in open places appeared ſown with grain in detached patches, without fences or ditches. A rivulet not unfrequently bounded a piece of land newly turned up, on the other ſide of which was obſervable either a copſe, or a field of corn advanced in growth, a ſpace of vacant ground, or interſperſed with reed or ſugar cane, and maize. In the midſt of theſe a ſolitary palm tree ſometimes ſtood, and a declivity, a ſwamp, or a thick wood, broke upon the line of culture and habitation. Roads appear next, which owe nothing to art, and their exiſtence only to the conſtant ſucceſſion of travellers obſtructing the progreſs of rapid vegetation when not in the ſhade, and when beneath it, to an abſence of the ſun's rays.</p>
            <p>We reached a very populous village at the noon of the fifth day; when finding myſelf extremely alarmed with feveriſh ſymptoms in conſequence of the croud which
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032239_0062_0FF19EE2CBAD8468"/>preſſed round me, was obliged to requeſt by my interpreter, that we might have a retired and ſeparate habitation, and be ſecured from the intruſion of the curious. My wiſhes were anſwered, and I determined to perſevere in the journey which now promiſed to be ſo ſhort. The villagers procured horſes for us, but without the convenience of ſaddles. In this circumſtance, and in a warm climate I would have preferred walking, but was perſuaded to accept offices dictated by ſuch hoſpitable intentions, and accordingly ſet forward. A perſon was diſpatched before us to announce our arrival; we determined to repoſe during the heat of this day in a pleaſant valley deſcribed by the natives, and to travel in the night ſo that we might reach our deſtination by the enſuing morning. My fever had entirely abated, and I found myſelf after the mid-days repoſe, perfectly able to ride the reſt of the way during the night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:032239_0063_0FF19EE5BB7B7678"/>
We were now near our journey's end; and about 11 o'clock we had the pleaſure of ſeeing our courier return accompanied by about 100 perſons armed with long lances, who we were informed, compoſed a part of the <hi>Ebo</hi> Kings guard, and had been ſent to receive us. Upon their approach, they opened on each ſide of us in good order, with their lances pointed downward behind, and as we paſſed thro' them cloſed in files and followed with much regularity.</p>
            <p>It was now about 2 o'clock, and we had advanced half a mile in this form, when a large body of people appeared who we were given to underſtand, were the principal perſons of the town, diſpatched to conduct us to the kings preſence. The roads were covered with people, ſo as to render our progreſs ſlow and irkſome—at length we entered the town about 4 o'clock.</p>
            <p>The capital of <hi>Ebo,</hi> or <hi>Quappa Ebo,</hi> is pleaſantly ſituated on the ſides of two hills,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032239_0064_0FF19EE8B0EA79E8"/>which are cut at an acute angle by a caſcade that deſcends through an agreeable wood, and diſcharges its waters in a ſhallow pebbled rivulet that biſects the valley in the center. Thoſe parts of the town that occupy the ſloping grounds, form two ſides of a triangle, the remaining ſide is formed by a river of about four hundred feet wide, into which the rivulet falls; our entrance was from the wood acroſs this river which we forded. The open country along the river downward was highly cultivated, and beautifully contraſted in its verdure with the brown appearance of the town, which excepting the few trees here and there diſperſed, exhibited a view of conſiderable population and regularity. The ſtreets were laid out with a conſiderable regard to order, ſo as even to be obſerved at a diſtance; there was not any thing of grandeur, it is true, but certainly a degree of elegant ſimplicity and neatneſs which I did not expect to find.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:032239_0065_0FF19EEBA048B988"/>
We were conducted to the kings hut, he received us at his door, and after ſhaking me by the hands very earneſtly for a minute, retired and beckoned us to follow, which we did. This hut was oblong as large as ſome of our barns, and divided into rooms by wicker partitions covered with neatly coloured mats, and ornamented with cane and reed baſkets with other fancy works of the kind.</p>
            <p>When we had reached the third apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where was a number of women already ſeated, he ſat down on a bench covered with a mat and holding out his hands to me ſhook mine very earneſtly again. He then ſhook <hi>Hurdee,</hi> ſpeaking to him in the Ebo language; I was then directed to ſalute all his wives, <hi>ſeventeen</hi> in number; I would willingly have diſpenſed with this branch of the ceremony, but <hi>Hurdee</hi> told me with a ſmile it was the cuſtom—and I accordingly, with no little
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032239_0066_0FF19EEE9FDEB8D0"/>diſcompoſure of my ſtomach, complied with all the form.</p>
            <p>Having completed this buſineſs without ſhowing evident marks of diſſatisfaction, was handed round to the elders, or what I ſuppoſe ſome ſubject of an European monarch would call the <hi>nobility.</hi> With all theſe I ſhook hands in turn, and was then led to a mat placed for me nearly in the front of his <hi>ſable</hi> majeſty, with whom by means of <hi>Hurdee</hi> I entered into converſation on the ſubject of my miſſion.</p>
            <p>He informed me that he had been made acquainted with the object of my journey, that he was pleaſed at my prefering him to his neighbours; that he was willing to trade with me in <hi>gold, ivory,</hi> or <hi>priſoners;</hi> that he ſhould wiſh to trade conſtantly, and to be furniſhed with goods from the <hi>ſea countries,</hi> as he called them, in abundance, for which he would pay largely. Having ſtated my ſatisfaction at his kindneſs, and my thanks
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032239_0067_0FF19EF1AB887C48"/>for the attention beſtowed by his favour on me then and while on the road, I told him it was my wiſh to put his propoſals into practice by keeping the trade open conſtantly and ſupplying it abundantly. He then entered on general converſation, enquiring into the manners, cuſtoms, and ſituation of my country, of which he appeared to have already had ſome accounts. He related ſome particulars concerning himſelf and the people of <hi>Ebo,</hi> his wars with ſome neighbouring people and frequently enlivened his ſpirits and our converſation with draughts of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent palm wine.</p>
            <p>We continued thus, partaking occaſionally of pine apples and other fruit, till duſk, when a large fire being lighted, a banquet of roaſted veniſon, ſome birds, and milk, with rice, was ſerved to us as we ſat. He aroſe and beckoning to a woman on his left, ſix others were called in, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me and offered as wives. This piece of politeneſs and hoſpitality I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032239_0068_0FF19EF5F6C37090"/>to decline, <hi>Hurdee</hi> had previouſly apprized me of this cuſtom, but I conceived that my informing them that I was already a married man would releaſe me from this dilemma; I was diſappointed; the king femed ſurpriſed at the nature of my objection, and inſtanced himſelf who was alſo married but yet took other wives. Finding myſelf in this <hi>delicate</hi> predicament, and deriving no reſource from the advice of my interpreter, I reſolved to accommodate myſelf to my ſituation with as good a grace as poſſible. Judging one wife ſufficient for any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man; I reſolved not to be burthened with ſix; but thinking that I muſt in ſome degree ſacrifice to cuſtom I reſolved to chuſe <hi>two</hi>—and with theſe I was directly conducted to a handſome, but newly built apartment near what I muſt, <hi>for the honour of the thing,</hi> call the palace!</p>
            <p>My reſidence conſiſted of a long open building like a piazza, without any ſide covering; within this was a long croſs room
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032239_0069_0FF19EF786F1E4A0"/>divivided into two by a partition; and in the rear another room the floor of which was a few inches higher than that of the outer apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Lamps, (if I may ſo call ſmall earthen miſhapen cups with <hi>cocoanut</hi> oil,) darkly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated theſe appartments;—the outer was covered with ordinary mats, the inner with one neatly woven and of various colours, with ruſhes and palm tree fibres, At one end of this appartment was half ſpread a large kind of mattraſs made of cotton, thin but not uncomfortable; and here it was that for the firſt time in my life, I was to repoſe with the duſky daughters of Africa.</p>
            <p>Readers of different humours will view this ſcene with varied ſentiments;—the jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar will anticipate the embarraſſment of a qualmiſh youth, ſhoved into a neat hovel with a tall ſlender and comely but ſedate African girl who ſat half averted from me in the part of the room moſt remote from the door and the place of repoſe, while another plumy, middle ſized wench ſtood laughing
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032239_0070_0FF19EF9169BC010"/>and giggling, by turns looking at me and then at her female partner, as if anxious to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which ſhould enter upon, or avoid—converſation.</p>
            <p>I could not for a time determine whether to lie down in my clothes or undreſs—I really forgot every thing but the aukwardneſs of my ſituation.—The lamps, however, had fortunately nearly conſumed their oil, and I took advantage of the glimmer, to diſpoſe of my apparel, and lay down—like many a fond huſband—with my face averted from my Ebon companions, who contrived to approach and partake with me of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, and with it as I infer from my own experience, of a pleaſant repoſe.</p>
            <p>When morning appeared, a wicker woven aperture admitted the light, and diſcovered to me my two wives (for ſo I muſt hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call them) wrapped in the arms—of ſleep;—one at each ſide of me; but at a reſpectful diſtance. I lay a while reflecting
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032239_0071_0FF19EFC2117BDA0"/>on the oddity of my ſituation, and call to mind the graces of my own more favored country-women: I was ſoon however, diſturbed from my reveries, by the awakening of my two ladies, whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances I thought ſeemed to rebuke me with diſſatisfaction or contempt—for my want of politeneſs to, or neglect of them.</p>
            <p>I could not ſpeak a word of their language, and we were thus lying compoſed in ſilence, when <hi>Hurdee</hi> announced a viſitor. I ſallied forth without the ceremonial of a bow, or a farewel; and found the old Chieftain was waiting for me. He propoſed a walk after I ſhould have refreſhed myſelf; we accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſat down to breakfaſt, and I was joined by my wives, as we were about to proceed on our little tour; I was ſhewn the greater part of the town; we aſcended the hill to the ſouth weſtward, and the old man explained to me by means of <hi>Hurdee,</hi> every particular that he thought worthy of notice, or that I aſked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:032239_0072_0FF19F00910738F0"/>
The town conſiſts of about 1200 houſes, laid out into very regular ſtreets, not ſo much the effect of a previous plan, as of the judicious arrangements taken to prevent any dwelling encroaching on the line of a ſtreet. The weſtern ſide of the ſhallow rivulet that paſſes through the town was firſt planned, and laid out in one great ſtreet along its margin, not following its irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, but preſenting a ſtrait front. On the oppoſite ſide, the ſame ſyſtem was purſued, but the ſtreets, diverging from theſe to the feet of the hills, were wider on one ſide than the other; they terminated each in a large ſtreet at the feet of each hill, beyond which were gardens or maize ground, orchards, or walks of orange or citron trees, with ſome of the date and cocoanut—here was likewiſe to be ſeen the ſugar cane, and the fineſt maize I had ever beheld, and the tree from which the <hi>caſſava</hi> is procured, with a conſiderable quantity of large ſpecies of millet, the broom, or guiney corn. The whole town formed almoſt a regular triangle;
<pb n="74"
                   facs="unknown:032239_0073_0FF19F03793B8CE0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>the little rivulet divided it into two irregular triangles, owing to diverging more one ſide than the other; the other ſtreets were ſtrait, but at unequal diſtances.</p>
            <p>I have before in ſome degree deſcribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the houſes of the natives: I had now an opportunity of hearing the proceſs of their building art deſcribed, and witneſſing the truth of the deſcription.</p>
            <p>When they purpoſe building a houſe, they firſt determine upon the form and extent of it, by fixing ſtakes and making a large bank of earth within the line, either circular, ſemicircular, oblong or ſquare, for they have houſes of all theſe forms:—this earth or clay being well tempered and mixed with ſand, is beat down and ſmoothed with an inclination of the plane to the door. They leave it expoſed to the heat of the ſun, which is here very conſiderable, for ſome days before they proceed further. When they find it ſufficiently hard, the frame is
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032239_0074_0FF19F07CFAAECE0"/>raiſed, roughly as may be ſuppoſed, and connected by ropes of the cocoa bark, or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed canes, or the withes or ſaplings of young trees. When they have fixed timbers round the cornice or eaves, if I may ſo call it, they elevate two long ſlender timbers at each end of the building. Theſe they tie firmly at the corners, when the houſe is angular, and again at the elevated points where they meet, longer timbers are raiſed about the middle, and what may be called a ridge pole, conſiſting of one ſlender timber, firmly laſhed above throughout the whole length. Light branches are now laid on, and the whole is covered over like the round huts, with the leaves or bark of trees, &amp;c. This ſpecies of building may be conſidered ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and is rare; the ſtructure of the round buildings requires leſs labour and combination. When the roof is covered, they proceed to fill up the ſpaces between the corner poſts in the ſides and ends: for this they drive ſtakes in regular order, leaving fit openings by their interſections for
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032239_0075_0FF19F095DD68108"/>doors or windows. Theſe laſt are very narrow and numerous, admitting a conſtant draught of air, and capable of being eaſily cloſed: cane works formed with much inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, ornament the inſide. When the walls are thus far compleated, the outſide plaiſtered with clay well kneaded, which being ſmoothed, really has a handſome appearance, but ſuffers upon the fall of heavy rains, againſt which every houſe is provided with a deep ditch, leading all round to carry off the water as it falls. Each dwelling is ſeparated from the other by a ſmall yard, marked by a fence or ſtockade of poſts, of four to ſix inches diameter.</p>
            <p>The king's houſe alone was unencumbered by a cloſe neighbourhood, having a greater ſpace of yard in front. It had eight rooms, but was in reality, two houſes united: a handſome graſs plot, ſhaded by about ten or twelve lofty trees lay behind, and through this a path ſtrewed with a brown and yellow
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032239_0076_0FF19F0C6E0F7D18"/>glittering ſand, led winding to the ſummit of the hill, where was a neat hut erected with only a light roof, and ſides compoſed of mats that admitted of being raiſed or let down at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Before we had arrived at this place, I took care to ſend <hi>Hurdee</hi> for a few articles that I purpoſed preſenting to the king; and when we ſat to reſt, after aſcending to this beautiful eminence, I took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of preſenting to him, a handſome ornamented claſp knife, a ſmall oval looking-glaſs, ſome braſs rings for bracelets, and a pair of ordinary paſte ſleeve buttons, with red tinſel and a gilt knot in them. The old man was highly delighted, and did not ſpeak for ſeveral minutes, being ſo much engaged in admiring his riches. He at laſt broke out into expreſſions of thanks, and propoſed ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me where he had lately fought a great battle with the <hi>Galla</hi> king, who had invaded his kingdom, attempted to carry off his people, and reduce the country to be under his own government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:032239_0077_0FF19F0F5F8584E0"/>
We proceeded along the weſtern ſide of the hill, about three miles, paſſing by a ſine cultivated country, and large fields of corn. Huts were ſcattered here and there along our courſe, and goats and ſheep grazed on the rich paſtures as far as the eye could reach. We now deſcended through a wood, and entered a large plain: on our way to this place, he related the cauſe of the invaſion to have ariſen from the following adventure.</p>
            <p>A party of hunters from one of the remote towns of the <hi>Ebo</hi> country, had purſued their game beyond what the <hi>Galla</hi> king conſidered his boundary, and were met by a party of the latter people, likewiſe hunting. They now commenced a purſuit of the game, that had been nearly run down by the <hi>Ebo</hi> people, but were not ſucceſsful, for one of the <hi>Ebo</hi> hunters, brought it down with his ſpear. The <hi>Galla</hi> hunters ſought to appropriate it to themſelves; a fray enſued, one of the <hi>Galla</hi> people was killed, the reſt put to flight, and the game brought off in triumph though
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032239_0078_0FF19F125F362C60"/>ſeveral of the <hi>Ebo</hi> people were wounded ſeverely.</p>
            <p>Both parties were highly enraged; the <hi>Galla</hi> king raiſed an army, invaded the country, burned two villages, carried off ſome cattle, and a few priſoners, which he ſold for ſlaves. The <hi>Ebo</hi> people were terrified with the firſt ſucceſſes of the enemy: they alloted a conſiderable force to oppoſe them; ſeveral actions were fought, but the <hi>Ebo</hi> king was ſo much the ſufferer in each, that his army was nearly deſtroyed. The <hi>Galla</hi> king encouraged by theſe ſucceſſes, and relying too much on the weakneſs of the <hi>Ebo</hi> people formed the reſolution of ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the whole country to his rule. For this purpoſe he collected all his force, and ſpreading deſolation as he paſſed, croſſed the great ſwamp to the N. W. in order to avoid the circuit of the upper lands, and had already approached within the diſtance of three miles from the capital, where all the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032239_0079_0FF19F1556649AE0"/>fugitives from the deſolated towns, had taken refuge.</p>
            <p>The city could be approached only by a narrow defile, through which the river paſſed, leaving a road on that ſide next the city; or be attempting the road over the hills and through the woods, by which we had entered. The <hi>Galla</hi> chief preferred the former: a party of the <hi>Ebo</hi> people who had eſcaped from bondage, communicated the deſign; that the old <hi>Ebo</hi> chief took his meaſures accordingly. He collected a body of 200 picked men, ſupported by a body of 300 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to guard the paſs on the ſide next to the enemy. Over theſe as the reſerve, he appointed his eldeſt ſon, and his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the reſt of his army he led himſelf, in two diviſions: his ſecond ſon heading the left, in which his principal wives<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſtout young women engage in moſt of the expeditions throughout the whole country; this being an extraordinary occaſion, and utter ruin or conqueſt being the only alternative—the young boys and girls, followed their parents to this action, and contributed by their preſence, to render it deciſive</note> and their brothers, were diſtributed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:032239_0080_0FF19F19A5E4C288"/>
The king ſhewed me the ſpot where he took his ſtation; it was an elevated ſpot of ground, covered with large ſhady trees, inacceſſible in the front; but overlooking the whole plain below, with which it communicated by two paths at ſome diſtance to the right and left. A path was opened, and a line of men ſtretched along the top of the hill, to the edge of this paſs, to which he paid conſtant attention.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Galla</hi> people attempted to march before ſun riſe, but a large fire ſuddenly appearing on their right, at the diſtance of about half a mile, occaſioned them to halt: it ceaſed in a few minutes, but had the effect of diſpiriting the <hi>Galla</hi> people; who marched on however, about an hour after. They advanced rapidly, and ſoon deſcried
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032239_0081_0FF19F1B33884E78"/>the troops under the kings eldeſt ſon, ready to receive them: the <hi>Galla</hi> people began the attack by a diſcharge of arrows, which was returned by the <hi>Ebo</hi> party; and followed by a ſecond flight before the <hi>Galla</hi> army expected it. The <hi>Galla</hi> warriors then bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed their lances, cloſed their ranks, and made a vigorous attack on the kings army, who being unprepared, threw by their bows, and cloſed in a compact body to receive them with their ſpears: this oppoſition was ſhort, for the <hi>Ebo</hi> party fled into the narrow part of the paſs, as if panic ſtruck, the <hi>Galla</hi> people purſuing them. The two parties of the <hi>Ebo</hi> army now rallied on the inner ſide of a ſloping ground; and as ſhe <hi>Galla</hi> people crouded through the paſs to purſue them, the old Chief ſallied from his receſs, and commenced the attack in the rear. The battle was now carried on with the greateſt vigour on both ſides. The <hi>Ebo</hi> army being ſenſible that this was their laſt and only hope, fought with deſparation; while the <hi>Galla</hi> troops no leſs inſtigated by the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032239_0082_0FF19F1CC4EA83B0"/>deſire of victory and plunder, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt. The ſlaughter was terrible for a conſiderable time; the <hi>Galla</hi> people, however, at laſt gave way, and fled in immenſe numbers to the river, among the foremoſt of whom was their chief. He, however, rallied his troops on the plain, in front of their camp. The numbers killed already, exceeding that of the <hi>Ebo</hi> army; what remained was ſtill as numerous. The old <hi>Ebo</hi> chief determined to purſue his ſucceſs, while his people were elated, and marched into the plain, fate as yet ſeeming to hold the balances of victory.</p>
            <p>The attack was made by the eldeſt ſon, but he was met with ſuch warmth and intrepidity by the enemy, that his ranks gave way. He called aloud to them, and drawing a circle round him with his ſword, declared, he never would quit the ſpot, but with victory. The people rouſed by his bravery, returned to the charge, but before they could reſcue him, he fell, covered with
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032239_0083_0FF19F1E59B9AD98"/>wounds, and run through by lances. When his younger brother appeared, having carried all before him on the left, a more deſperate action enſued; the ſhouting of women and children, enlivened the <hi>Ebo</hi> people, when the arrival of the old chief and his brother with their diviſions, decided the victory in their favour.—The enemy fought with deſparation, but the old chief having attacked them in the rear, no hope remained, and they who did not prefer death, were made captives. 700 were taken priſoners, thoſe who had remained in the <hi>Galla</hi> camp to guard againſt ſurprize, took to flight; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them were taken by the women and ſcattered inhabitants, who purſued them for two days. The king, with but few followers, effected his eſcape with much difficulty, while moſt of the principal warriors were among the captives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ebo</hi> king loſt, beſide his eldeſt ſon, his brother, who fell in the conflict, and three of his wives. The old man conducted
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032239_0084_0FF19F241FFC3798"/>me to the ſpot, and I could not but be ſenſibly affected at the tenderneſs which he diſplayed, when ſpeaking of them on this ſcene of their valor and death. He appeared to me on this occaſion, in a point of view very different from what he had at any time before, ſo that I eſteemed the <hi>man</hi> now, whom I before conſidered as the <hi>ſavage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His perſon was ſtrait and robuſt, and of excellent ſymetry, being about five feet ten inches high: his countenance was extremely expreſſive; his eye quick and penetrating, and his air and deportment affable, cheerful, and mild, but ſtill expreſſive of confidence and command. He appeared to be about 55 years old, but was more. He made a motion to return, and we all moved towards the city by way of the paſs: our wives who had all followed us, now joined the party; and my ladies ſought every means to divert and pleaſe me, during the walk, by plucking flowers and fruits, or picking up pieces of broken arrows or lances,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032239_0085_0FF19F2719BAAB80"/>and at the ſame time, pointing at places, and ſpeaking as if I underſtood every word they ſaid—they continued their lively gambols all the way home.</p>
            <p>This ſpecies of amuſement was at firſt to me very loathſome—but after ſome time, I muſt confeſs, the pains they took to pleaſe, and the little efforts they made in the houſe, with their labor to teach and make me underſtand their language, ſoon ſoftened my diſguſt: from laughing at their folly, I came to like it, and to be thankful for their efforts to excite it—and in ſhort, I ſoon became ſo habituated to my ſituation, as not only to be ſatisfied, but pleaſed with it. In fact, I felt a fondneſs for both my wives, although I reluctantly confeſs it to the ladies of my former acquaintance, for they never differed but in their efforts to pleaſe me, and never diſputed, leſt I ſhould be offended.</p>
            <p>In all my ſubſequent rambles, they were never from me; when I talked to others,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032239_0086_0FF19F2B74F436A0"/>they were ſilently careſſing me, playing with my hands, or hair, handling my ſide arms or pockets; if I ſat, they ſquatted at my feet, and my buckles became the objects of their care and curioſity—for all which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and favor, they appeared highly gratified, if I made but a return of bare notice, and highly familar, if I would enter into conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with them.</p>
            <p>We had now approached the town, and were met by ſeveral of the elders, and a conſiderable number of the inhabitants, both men and women, who formed a proceſſion with us into the public ſtreets. I had now ſome leiſure and opportunities to notice them; they were evidently, conſiderably blacker than the natives of the lower <hi>Congo</hi> country, and the neighbourhood of the ſea, who have generally a yellowiſh tinge in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, owing, I ſuppoſe, to their greater intercourſe with the whites. Their ſtature is generally between five feet ſix inches, to ſix feet high; the fewer number, however,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032239_0087_0FF19F2D0D1E3B08"/>approach the latter height. The women were generally more ſlender and ſmaller, as is uſual, than the men; but were evidently more variable, in the firſt reſpect particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. Both ſexes are admirably well formed, their limbs ſtrait, and bodies upright. They go almoſt entirely naked; the loins and waiſt only being covered; the women wear a ſlight garment, or bandage of cotton cloth round the waiſt, or a ſmall apron of cotton ſtuff, fancifully decorated with feathers, or ſtrips of different coloured cloths; this is about ſix inches long, and eight broad, hanging in front, and tied on by two ſtrings of cotton, which knot behind, from which hangs a little taſſel. The men, from the age of puberty only, wear a narrow bandage of cotton cloth round the waiſt, with a ſtrip of the ſame kind, but five or ſix inches in breadth tucked in before, and paſſing thro' the crutch, ſo contrived that the knot behind alſo affords a long bunch or taſſel, like that of the women. The men of reſpect among them, beſide a number of trifling ornaments
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032239_0088_0FF19F315EBA41B8"/>of ſhells, ivory bracelets, &amp;c. wear a large and broader piece of cotton, that hangs nearly down to the knees like the Scotch highlander's trews.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſimple garments, however diſplay works of ornament, diſtinct from thoſe of mere utility; feathers, pieces of cotton cloth of different colours, trinkets of copper, braſs, glaſs, and tinſel, of European fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are frequently ſeen, but theſe are uniformly the ſigns of riches or reſpect. The old chief was dreſſed with a profuſion of theſe baubles, fantaſtically arranged on a kind of dark cotton ſmock frock, that hung down cloſe to his knees.</p>
            <p>Men and women uniformly wear rings round their wriſts and ancles, moſtly of ivory, but frequently made of braſs; theſe are made merely large enough to admit the hand or foot through with ſome preſſure. Their looſeneſs renders them to appearance incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but when we conſider the numerous
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032239_0089_0FF19F32EA335458"/>aukward articles worn by both ſexes in <hi>civilized</hi> life, we will not continue to wonder at the ſacrifices which ſavages offer to that univerſal idol, <hi>vanity,</hi> ſeeing that theſe ornaments carry in their minds as lofty ideas, as any excited either by the gold or embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, the coronet, the purple, or ermine.— The ivory rings are made by ſawing the elephants tooth acroſs the hollow part, and poliſhing the rings with the duſt; there are ſome, however, who wear claſps or broad hoops, and other ornaments of gold.</p>
            <p>The women wear beads of glaſs and metal with little plates, and other figures ſuſpended from their necks in ſucceſſive ſtrings falling over their breaſts. Some of them that in infancy promiſe to be comely, by the early care of their mothers, have rings put on while young, which filling as they grow, become tight, and this ornament in their riper years is eſteemed an object of peculiar note and elegance. Their admirers are more numerous, and this ſpecies of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032239_0090_0FF19F3478E0D250"/>ornaments often exhibits the love of ſhew, admiration, and prudery in the ſimple African, in as ridiculous and natural a point of view, as any of our poliſhed faſhionable female decorations.</p>
            <p>Every man wears a knife in his girdle, the blade of which is from ſix to eight inches long, reſembling the blade of a ſpontoon, rather narrower, but ſharp at both edges: it is carried in a ſheath, generally of ruſh or reed work, and much ornamented. This inſtrument ſerves for all purpoſes, for cutting timber or food, ſlaying a beaſt or an enemy; and in occaſions of war, is worn likewiſe by the women. They employ it in their ſimple proceſs of agriculture with much dexterity, and this with a ſharp pointed ſtake, was all the implement I could diſcover them uſing, either for digging, turning up the ſoil, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reaping the crop.</p>
            <p>I have been thus particular in the outſet, from having obſerved when very young,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032239_0091_0FF19F36132FAAB8"/>that circumſtances among ſtrangers are noticed more exactly at firſt, than at a later period; perhaps familiarity with all objects leſſens our admiration of them.</p>
            <p>The next morning the king ſhewed me the ſpoils made in the late action, which had taken place as nearly as I could learn, about the month of June preceding. The bracelets and rings of gold and copper, the gold breaſt plates, ſome European ſwords, and a numberleſs quantity of trinkets, ſpears, bows and arrows, &amp;c. formed a group of objects extremely ſtriking and amuſing. The ſame apartment contained a variety of other articles, ſuch as preſents made him by his own people, and by others, together with a quantity of elephants teeth and gold duſt, which was contained in ſmall earthen pans, or pots, covered with wicker baſket work.</p>
            <p>Having ſatisfied my curioſity here, he propoſed that I ſhould go and ſee the priſoners; we accordingly croſſed to the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032239_0092_0FF19F3A94944B98"/>ſouth-eaſtern ſide of the rivulet, where at the lower ſide of the town, we found them confined in a large area within a thick ſtockade, on the outſide of which was a trench: the inſide was divided into parcels, and huts irregularly conſtructed, and the entrance as well as the whole circuit, was guarded by men with ſpears.</p>
            <p>We commonly find ourſelves impreſſed with emotions of horror and compaſſion, on entering places where our fellow men are doomed to puniſhment or thraldom. In the ſcene before me, the ear was not indeed dinned with the clanking of heavy fetters, but was horrible in its peculiar way. The captives were diſtitute for the moſt part of even their neceſſary covering, and bound indiſcriminately together by the hands and legs, the cords being again faſtened to the ground by ſtakes; they were looſed a few at a time once every day, when each was permitted to eat the only meal they were allowed, conſiſting of rice and palm oil.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032239_0093_0FF19F41B1427170"/>Benevolence, however, ſometimes broke through the rigours of a ſavage life, and occaſionally alleviated the ſufferings of the weakly, or the wounded with milk or other neceſſaries: their condition was on the whole deplorable.</p>
            <p>I had often in the courſe of the voyage, and of the journey, rebuked myſelf for having embarked in the African trade, but found a conſolation in the reflection, that it was not from a malicious inclination or avaricious diſpoſition, that I had embarked in it, but from the preſſing call of neceſſity, and at a time when my diſſent could not alter or obſtruct the undertaking. On the preſent occaſion, however, I was fully convinced the removal of theſe poor wretches even into the ſlavery of the Weſt-Indies, would be an act of humanity, rather than one expoſed to cenſure.</p>
            <p>We paſſed through the whole range of the place of confinement, the old chief
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032239_0094_0FF19F43466BBCE0"/>pointing out to me thoſe who were the greateſt warriors of the <hi>Galla</hi> nation. He then intimated to me that I might chuſe ſuch of them as I ſhould think proper, and agree on what he was to receive in return. I agreed to do ſo, but requeſted that I might have an opportunity of converſing with them, and chuſing ſuch as would go with me voluntarily, if any could be found. To this he readily aſſented; and for the next week I continued to viſit them daily, and took occaſion through my interpreter, to exhibit as flattering a proſpect of their future ſituation in America, ſhould they go with me, as I thought was juſt in itſelf, and favorable to their wiſhes.</p>
            <p>This week was occupied by occaſional excurſions, in fiſhing and hunting parties, in pleaſant evening entertainments, and at intervals by my viſits to the captives. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arranged matters on this ſubject to my mind, I mentioned to the old king the ſeveral articles which I propoſed exchanging with
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032239_0095_0FF19F44EA7AB9B0"/>him, and ſhewing ſpecimens of ſuch few articles as I had brought, propoſed diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon to the ſhip with a letter, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain to ſend a ſhallop with goods to the mouth of the little <hi>Congo,</hi> and that rafts ſhould be ready with hands to convey them up the reſt of the way. The <hi>Galla</hi> nation having ſuffered ſo much by their laſt war, had now became fearful of moleſting or interfering with the <hi>Ebo</hi> people, a circumſtance, which if we had previouſly known, would have ſaved us a long circuitous and troubleſome journey, which might now be performed with eaſe in one half the time.</p>
            <p>The old Chief was much pleaſed; three perſons were appointed to carry my diſpatches, and they departed accordingly. From this time, I had no occupation but making myſelf acquainted with the language and manners of the country, and obtaining ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as they could afford.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:032239_0096_0FF19F47E26148E8"/>
Their form of government is a limited monarchy; the affairs of the nation are comprehended in the ſimple meaſures neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the defence againſt an enemy, and ſo far the chief is abſolute.—The ableſt warrior, is generally therefore choſen to the place, but he muſt poſſeſs other qualities, he muſt merit the affections rather than excite the fears of thoſe, whom he is to govern. There is no writing, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no written law; the plain leſſons of natural equality in regard to perſonal ſafety and property, are well underſtood, ſo that parental and filial love, are among their moſt diſtinguiſhed characters.—Diſobedience to a parent in a ſlight degree is ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and in a larger extent, the puniſhment extends to death or ſlavery:—as every man has the means of obtaining a houſe by his induſtry, and conſequently will have to defend it and his family, he is obliged by neceſſity for the time, and thence by habit, to be a ſoldier. From this circumſtance there is no army, but the inhabitants are
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032239_0097_0FF19F4AD689AF10"/>called together by the urgency of neceſſity or danger, or by the immediate will and command of their chief. Before they are diſbanded, however, enquiry is made into the conduct of the different officers, whether they have done their duty, or whether any one has eminently diſtinguiſhed himſelf. Thoſe who are thus remarked for their valour and good conduct in other reſpects, obtain a conſiderable diſtinction among them, and ſoon acquire from the liberality of their king and country, rewards in ornaments and other property, ſufficient to ſupport the honours they have acquired.</p>
            <p>From among theſe the king or chief is choſen, in the event of a vacancy by death, or otherwiſe. If the king has a ſon or a brother diſtinguiſhed, and worthy of the public confidence, the preference is given to him; but either the want of approved courage, of activity, of talents, or of a family and children, are ſufficient diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to prevent his election. On ſuch
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032239_0098_0FF19F4C62306D18"/>an occaſion, the old men and warriors from all parts of the kingdom, meet and chuſe the perſon whoſe character is beſt ſuited to the important truſt. If two or more are equal in eſtimation, it falls to him who has the greateſt number of children, which from the prevalence of polygamy as well as other circumſtances, the warm climate, &amp;c. it may readily be ſuppoſed, are in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able numbers.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, however, that hoſpitality is one of the virtues which procure men diſtinction among theſe people; I ſaw two inſtances of this; during my ſtay at <hi>Quappa Ebo:</hi> a perſon who had by his own valour, with the induſtry of a daughter and ſon, acquired conſiderable ſpoil from the <hi>Galla</hi> invaders, and had ſeized a large flock of their cattle, was ſuddenly raiſed to opulence. He was eager to follow the paſſion of his countrymen, to ſhare his riches, and obtain the reputation of an hoſpitable man; his own immediate relatives were invited to his
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032239_0099_0FF19F86A0C81ED0"/>houſe, and preparations commenced for a ſumptuous feaſt for the king, with all the elders at court, and thoſe of the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns of the <hi>Ebo</hi> country. The foreſts were ravaged for veniſon, and the trees for fruit; the palm poured forth its exhilerating juices, and every ſkin ſhined in bright blackneſs with the anointing of rich oils. The elders wore their beſt <hi>makad:</hi> or dreſſes, and the young girls diſplayed their feathers and rings with all the purpoſed artifice of coquetry.—The feaſt is held on a lawn or plain, the converſation is general, on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of love, war, or hunting; the parties employed taking frequent opportunities of making it partial. The generous entertainer takes care that all are ſatisfied, encourages the warriours to valour, the lovers to fidelity, and reminds them that theſe virtues are the only ſure paths to univerſal regard. Theſe ſentiments, no doubt, are not expreſſed in their regular form, but in this way (if I may ſo expreſs it) may their ideas and expreſſions be tranſlated. The maſter of the feaſt
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032239_0100_0FF19F4E02978B30"/>thenceforward becomes a man of celebrity, and is called to the meetings of the elders of the ſeveral towns, which at ſtated times, aſſemble and conſult upon meaſures of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon utility.</p>
            <p>The repaſt terminates with a dance, to the muſic of two ſorts of drums; the one made by cutting the trunk of a hollow tree acroſs about a foot in diameter, and eighteen inches long. The bark is pulled off and the knotty parts made ſmooth; a ſquare hole is cut in its ſide, and a piece of dried ſheep ſkin drawn light over it; both ends are covered in the ſame way, and beads, rings, &amp;c. are fixed to it. The other kind is the gourd or callabaſh, cut off at one ſide, and a ſkin drawn over it in like manner, both theſe inſtruments are ſounded by ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the hand or fingers. The dance, as may be ſuppoſed, is neither pleaſant to the eye, nor agreeable to the ear of a perſon acquainted with the ſound of a violin, but
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032239_0101_0FF19F53A83B3D78"/>to them is a ſource of the greateſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>From theſe particulars, it might poſſibly be ſuppoſed that the inhabitants are of a very active character. The reverſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is the fact; they are from the natural effect of the climate, indolent to an extreme, but in caſes of exigency exhibit a vigor that is truly ſurprizing. Their wants are but few, and a warm ſun and prolific ſoil ſupercedes that powerful ſtimulus to activity—<hi>neceſſity.</hi> They know not thoſe cares which call forth labour, to provide for their children, nature is their inheritance; if they poſſeſs rice, roots, and palm wine, a cow, a few goats or ſheep to afford them occaſionally milk or meat, to feed themſelves and entertain their friends, they enjoy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate happineſs. In metals they find little value, except for occaſional ornament and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for proviſions. For this purpoſe moſtly when prompted by the ſoft paſſion, both ſexes will ſpend weeks in tedious ſucceſſion
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032239_0102_0FF19F57F267E670"/>gathering gold duſt in but ſcanty portions. The command of a parent, the deſire of a brother or ſiſter, or the order of a chief, will procure the like aſſiduity, but theſe latter occaſions are rare. This operation is performed only in the rainy ſeaſon, when the torrents which fall waſh down from the high lands, the ſands and ſoil in which theſe riches are lodged. The ſpecific gravity of the metal cauſes it to ſubſide, while lighter bodies are hurried along with the waters, and thus it is that where the roots of trees, or crevices between rocks, ſuſpend the rapid courſe of the ſtream, the gold duſt ſettles with the coarſer particles of the ſand, and is gathered by the African, and depoſited in his gourd or calabaſh.</p>
            <p>When a ſufficient quantity is collected, it is taken to a ſtanding water, where it is again cleanly waſhed from all particles of earth, and in this ſtate is reſerved for their purpoſes of trade, or for being formed into trinkets. This they perform with the rude
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032239_0103_0FF19F598456B3D8"/>clay crucibles and charcoal fires; ſome preſerve it in ſmall bars, of the value of about ten dollars, which method is much more convenient for the trader, than when in duſt.</p>
            <p>I have before noticed that polygamy is cuſtomary among them, for having no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtitutions, the practice cannot be conſidered a matter of toleration; but it muſt be obſerved, that be the number of wives ever ſo many, there is uniformly one who holds a diſtinguiſhed place in the family. She is called the <hi>makilma,</hi> and has the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of directing the domeſtic concerns and employments of the reſt; ſhe ſits next to the maſter of the family, and obtains a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and undiſputed regard from all the other members of it, whoſe labours ſhe ſuperintends and controuls; for however opulent the huſband may be, his wives muſt work, and by them are all the labours of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture uſually performed. This appears cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very laborious conſidering the heat of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032239_0104_0FF19F5B40BE0C58"/>the climate, but it muſt likewiſe be obſerved, that the ſoil is luxuriant, and the vegetation rapid, the ſeaſons of tillage though frequent, are ſhort, and the wants of the ſavage life few and ſimple; he muſt be a poor and a ſpiritleſs African, who cannot maintain three or four wives.</p>
            <p>The ſerenity and evenneſs of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers is truly admirable; their cheerfulneſs is ſeldom clouded by paſſion; and jealouſy is rare among the men, although the women are by no means averſe to gallantry. In fact, the commerce of the ſexes, as may have been already ſurmiſed by the reader, is not ſhackled by the forms of laws, or the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of etiquette or hypocriſy; the ſenſe of ſhame is totally diſconnected with their ideas on this head, though no people are more ſtrenuous and confined in their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when once formed from mutual choice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:032239_0105_0FF19F5E5B5D0140"/>
Irregularities of conduct are not, however, tolerated, though the diſcovery is not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſgrace; the gallant, if detected, is ſubjected to a fine, by the perſon aggrieved, ſuch as a ſheep, a goat, a cow, ſome rice, and the like. Inſtances have been known of a huſband conniving with his wife, to entice perſons into this ſnare, and to ſhare the exactions of their treacherous cunning; ſuch inſtances, however, are extremely rare, and not peculiar to the black children of Africa.</p>
            <p>In other reſpects they exhibit examples that would do honour to the moſt exalted people of the civilized world: in friendſhip and benevolence, no people are ſo truly ſtedfaſt and diſintereſted; and theft, the reputed vice of all ſavages, is rarely known among them; the unfortunate are ſure of the ſolacing aid and ſupport of their friends, whoſe kindneſs does not halt even at the lapſe of life. When a neighbour dies poor, they aſſemble and perform certain ceremonies with the ſame
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032239_0106_0FF19F62B516F910"/>reſpect as if he were one of their own chiefs; if he leaves children unprovided for, they are adopted and bred up; if marriageable, they are provided with ſuitable companions, and the means to commence a new family.</p>
            <p>Hearing that the maſter of a family whom I had ſeen on my arrival, was dead in my neighbourhood, I was inclined to attend, having heard that their funeral ceremonies were ſtrangely ludicrous. It is their rule never to bury the body on the day of deceaſe, the intervening night being devoted to lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the women of the family perform the clamorous part of this duty, and with little intermiſſion, until the corps is interred. They ſeat themſelves in order round the deceaſed, his favorite wife being ſeated at the head; if the deceaſed be a woman, the moſt beloved matron of the family performs the ſame office. Should the family not afford a ſufficient number of women, they call in friends, or employ ſtrangers to aſſiſt them, whom they reward according to
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032239_0107_0FF19F644582DF98"/>merit. In the preſent inſtance, the deceaſed had been rich, but had few female relatives beſides his wives, who hearing that I meant to attend the funeral, had reſolved to ſhow their reſpect for the deceaſed maſter, in the moſt pompous manner, by procuring a lamentation which they could not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves find lungs to ſupport. It appeared, however, that the perſons employed had been differently rewarded, and their tones varied in proportion to the value received, all were found too low for the occaſion. The wives were diſſatisfied, but reſorted to the expedient of further preſents to promote the vigour of their grief: a ſenſible effect was produced, for with an increaſe of ſound from the lamenters, there was an evident change in the tone of what they uttered, different from that of the widows, and very different from that of grief. The matrons had further reſort to their firſt plan, but the poor women unaccuſtomed to diſſemble, could not now conceal under their wailings, the ſatisfaction which they derived from the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032239_0108_0FF19F68C40D1C00"/>value of their preſents received, and ſcarcely reſtrain the ſmile. The wives themſelves appeared glad, when I viſited them on the morning, at the approaching period of their grief; when the good man was wrapped in a kind of mattraſs, and carried to a grave where he was interred, and further lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ceaſed. The whole then returned to the houſe of the deceaſed, and the ſcene of grief was converted into merriment; men and women regaled with palm wine, and then diſperſed to their reſpective homes.</p>
            <p>Their notions concerning death, prove that they have an idea of a future ſtate of exiſtence; they believe that after a given time, they muſt return to their own country, and remain forever free from care or pain; on this account it ſhould ſeem that they are always hoſpitable to ſtrangers on their arrival among them, as they conſider ſuch perſons coming thither, and from a judicious choice prefering it to other countries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:032239_0109_0FF19F6BB2698480"/>
Girls are uſually marriageable at fourteen, but few of them bear their virgin zone untied to the nuptial bed; this, however, is never a ſubject of ſolicitude or enquiry. The ceremony of marriage is very ſimple; a few preſents of ornaments are made by the lover to the bride, her father or friend, gives in return a few lances, bows and arrows, a knife, and ſome proviſions; the relations and friends of both ſexes meet together in the evening, drink plentifully of palm wine, and dance till pretty late, when the bride goes to her huſband's hut, and the next day enters on the employment and duties of her ſtation.</p>
            <p>Their police is as ſimple as their manners, and more efficacious than volumes of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regulations. I have before noticed that offences againſt parents, are puniſhed by ſlavery or death; thefts I alſo ſaid are rare; the catalogue of their crimes is indeed a brief one; if a quarrel ariſes, or blows enſue, or if any perſonal injury is done,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032239_0110_0FF19F6E9F937348"/>through paſſion, or any finiſter motive, a complaint is made to one or more of the elders of the village or town, who, after hearing the complainant, and the perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, give their deciſion by the plain rules of common ſenſe, from which there is no appeal: inſtances of murder are very rare, one however, took place while I was among them; the culprit was ſeized, brought before the old King, who immediately on hearing the cauſe, paſſed his ſentence of death, and ordered ſix of the beſt markſmen from among his guards to ſeize and bind him to a tree, and to ſhoot him to death with arrows. The appointed perſons could not but obey, they ſtood at about ten paces from from the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, and he died at the firſt diſcharge, from which fact may be formed a tolerable idea of their ſkill and power with thoſe weapons: the body was interred on the ſpot, and was looked at with an awe that could not fail of producing ſtrong moral impreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:032239_0111_0FF19F702D6A3C68"/>
Stealing and ſuch petty offences are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally puniſhed by ſelling the offender into ſlavery. When a thief is detected, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood aſſemble, and are bound to make it a common affair; if convicted, the full value of the thing ſtolen is made good to the perſon aggrieved, from the ſale of the culprit, with one third of whatever ſhould remain; the two other thirds as a perquiſite to the king.</p>
            <p>Perſons who have borrowed goods or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of any kind, and have failed to make reſtitution, are brought before the chief, or elders; and if found to have wilfully avoided payment, or neglected it through indolence, he is ſold, and if not ſufficently valuable, his children or wife, or wives, or all together, are ſold to make up the ſum; as they ſay the community ſhould not be made to ſuffer by the knavery or idleneſs of one man, who has rendered himſelf unworthy by neglecting the duty he owed his own children, his wives, and himſelf. The caſe of the ſavage
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032239_0112_0FF19F733B915BF0"/>in this particular, is more ſevere than in any other of their modes of juſtice; but it muſt be allowed, that the eaſe and abundance of their climate and ſoil, afford ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of vice in the man, who with ſuch advantages, ſtill contrives to wrong others without bettering himſelf, where neither faſhion, luxury, nor arts exiſt to ſeduce or allure him: indeed I believe it will be found true upon examination, that they decide with wiſdom, when they pronounce the borrower who means not to return, only a more wicked kind of robber.</p>
            <p>I have before ſaid they have no religious inſtitutions, they however, entertain certain ſentiments common to all ages and nations; they believe in a happy futurity of life in their own country; and they have ſome idea of a <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> who has made them and all things. They call him <hi>Kanno,</hi> and aſcribe to him infinite power, and all the common attributes of the Divinity, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the eternity of the perſon. They
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032239_0113_0FF19F790096D548"/>believe that he will die and be ſucceeded by another, who will puniſh the vicious, and reward the good, in proportion to their merit, or demerit. They believe likewiſe, that the deceaſed become ſpirits, and act as protectors or guardians to their former friends; under which impreſſion, one of them, when flying from danger, will hurry to the grave of his patroniſing friend, where if he eſcapes, it is all attributed to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this good genius, either perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or by interceſſion with the <hi>Kanno.</hi> This protecting ſpirit they call the <hi>Jannanin,</hi> and hold it in higher reſpect and veneration than their Supreme Being. They conſult their private <hi>Jannanin</hi> in any caſe of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and doubt, with full confidence that he will direct them for the beſt. They ſacrifice to them on theſe occaſions, a cow, rice and palm wine, believing that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leity delights in no other kind of offering. If they prove ſucceſsful in any of their undertakings, they ſacrifice for gratitude, and if unſucceſsful, they likewiſe ſacrifice to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032239_0114_0FF19F7A8DD5F630"/>appeaſe the offended ſpirit. Their prayers and incantations, although intended for the Supreme Being, are all addreſſed to theſe ſpirits as mediators for them with the <hi>Kanno,</hi> of whom as mentioned before, they hold the moſt exalted ideas that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>They are as much given to the belief in ſorcerers and magicians, as to that of the good ſpirits. Theſe they are perſuaded, have a power over the ſeaſons, are able to forward or retard the growth of their rice, deſtroy the cattle, afflict them with diſeaſe, and render their lives miſerable. They believe all the Albinos, or white Moors, are of this claſs of beings, and the poor wretches from this character, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly harraſſed and tormented by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They finding themſelves excluded from ſociety, and attacked on every occaſion, are under the neceſſity of providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome private cavern. They retire and conſtructing a hut in the neighbouring woods, remain private, and iſſue forth only at night,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032239_0115_0FF19F7C1B1EB7F0"/>not being able, from the ſtructure of their eyes, to bear the brilliant light of the day. In theſe excurſions they plunder indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, not conſidering themſelves intereſted in preſerving the laws and cuſtoms of their country; and frequently being unacquainted with them, they will deſtroy the property, and do whatever miſchief they can, without being immediately diſcovered. Their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance has conſiderable effect in exciting theſe unfriendly opinions of the Albinos in the minds of the people. They go entirely naked; their ſkin is white, but has not that animated appearance ſo perceptible in Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans; it has a dull, deathlike whitiſh caſt that conveys an idea more of ſickneſs than of health. Their hair is a red or aſhes-coloured yellowiſh wool; and their eyes are uniformly white, in that part by which others are diſtinguiſhed into the black, grey, and blue eyes. They are ſet deep in the head, and very commonly ſquint; for as their ſkin is deprived of the black mucous web, the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of theſe
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032239_0116_0FF19F7F2D680218"/>Africans, ſo their eyes are deſtitute of that black matter reſembling a pigment, ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly found in people of all countries, and ſo uſeful in preventing the eye from being injured in caſes of expoſure to a ſtrong light.</p>
            <p>Theſe people rendered unfortunate by a prejudice of their countrymen, are born of black parents, they have all the features of other inhabitants, but differ from them only in theſe circumſtances. The difference in colour cannot ariſe from the intercourſe of whites and blacks, for the whites are very rarely among them, and the reſult of this union is well known to be the yellow or mulatto. Many of the Natives aſſert that they are produced by the women, being debauched in paſſing through the woods by the large Baboon, the Ourang-outang, and that ſpecies in particular called the <hi>Quaga mooroos.</hi> No ſatisfactory diſcovery has been made to account for ſuch ſingular, but not unfrequent, phenomena in the ſpecies, it may perhaps be aſcribed to diſeaſe, and that
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032239_0117_0FF19F851428F320"/>of the leprous kind, with more reaſon than to any other cauſe that has yet been aſſigned; the generally apparent vigour of the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals being the only material objection.</p>
            <p>The time of new moon is always attended to, and celebrated as a feſtival by the <hi>Ebo</hi> nation. No work is done on this day, nor do they enter into contracts, or execute buſineſs, though the occaſion be of ever ſo ungent a nature. The different families aſſemble at an appointed place, and begin to dance by the time it is clear day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the heat becomes diſagreeable: they then retire and enjoy each others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in ſmall parties, in different places throughout the day, drinking of palm wine, and renewing the dance in the evening.</p>
            <p>Their year is divided into four parts; the ſunny ſeaſon, the tornado ſeaſon, the rainy ſeaſon, and the foggy ſeaſon, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divion, ſuch as months and weeks, are attended to, except the different periods of
<pb n="119"
                   facs="unknown:032239_0118_0FF130ABE7F7DF60"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>new moon, by which they aſcertain the time of planting their rice, hunting, fiſhing and building.</p>
            <p>The ſunny ſeaſon commences about the laſt of December, and ends about the laſt of April, continuing not leſs than four months, in which time the inhabitants collect the different kinds of fruit, intended for proviſions; gather in their rice, and provide in general againſt the more unfriendly ſeaſon. The country being ſituated between the 10° and 12° of ſouth latitude, this ſeaſon anſwers to that of ſummer in our climate; the month of February being eſteemed mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer with them. In this ſeaſon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are frequently viſited by the land cloud, called ferrino by the Portugueſe, which is moſt frequent in the dry ſultry weather, about the time of noon, and moſtly when eaſterly winds prevail. It makes its appearance like a cloud, or thick white miſt extended but a few hundred yards in breadth, but in length covering the ſpace of one or
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032239_0119_0FF19F882F3FB7E8"/>two miles, in height not exceeding one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred feet. There are many varieties, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in theſe particulars of extent, it being remarked that the largeſt are in general the leaſt diſtreſſing, from the circumſtance of their being more diffuſed, and leſs denſe than the ſmaller. When one of theſe clouds appears, the inhabitants ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, the goats, ſheep, &amp;c. fly for ſhelter to the neareſt hovels or thickets, and every animal appears anxious to avoid expoſure to its influence. When it comes in contact with the body, a ſenſible increaſe of heat is firſt obſerved, the reſpiration is then inſtantly affected in a very peculiar manner, attended with an itching, prickling ſenſation on the ſkin, increaſing with the length of expoſure, ſo as to be almoſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, with a dryneſs and actual change of colour in the negro, from the black, to a duſky grey. It does not appear to affect the reſpiration by any ſenſible quality of its own, for no ſtricture or pain is perceptible about the breaſt when taken into the lungs, but
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032239_0120_0FF19F8B4FDC93D0"/>an extravagant anxiety, an uneaſineſs of mind, a want of ſome thing to ſupport life, the nature of which we did not underſtand, was very evident. Its increaſed heat could not be the cauſe, for common atmoſpheric air of that or a much greater temperature, would not produce effects in any degree equal to this—viz. the deſtruction of life. Its colour and its continuing in contact with the ſurface of the earth, although warmer than the ſurrounding atmotſphere, will prove it to be a fluid very different from common air; probably ſome exhalation or eruption, ſimilar to the volcanic, diſcharged from the earth in the vaſt deſerts eaſtward of this, by the violent and conſtant action of heat, and wafted on by the prevalence of earſterly winds. This at leaſt is certain, that it is an air deprived of that property by which life is ſupported, for it uniformly extinguiſhes the fires over which it paſſes. This cloud is more particularly injurious in high and open ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, in the neighbourhood of the city, where the country is low, and ſheltered by
<pb n="122"
                   facs="unknown:032239_0121_0FF19F8D0F8E8F28"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>the adjoining hills; inſtances of death from this ſource are but rare; back of this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, where the country is higher and more expoſed, they are by no means unfrequent, particularly among the wild animals; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe, the domeſtic animals, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally the unfortunate inhabitants expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience its deſtructive influence.</p>
            <p>The weather continues warm without interruption, except by a few occaſional ſhowers of rain, till the laſt of April, when the ſeaſon of Tornados commences. Theſe are violent hurricanes that infeſt the warm tropical elements, throughout this part of the year. They are in general preceded by an uncommon degree of calmneſs and ſtillneſs in the air, the leaves of the trees ceaſe to move, and the ponds and other waters reſemble glaſs by the ſmoothneſs of their ſurfaces, every thing indicating a ſupenſion of circulation in the atmoſpheric air. In that night and next day, the wind riſes, but is extremely irregular, changing rapidly to
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032239_0122_0FF19F92D70FABD8"/>all points of the compaſs, and-blowing from them only in ſudden guſts, or what are called flaws. At length a ſudden and violent blaſt is obſerved from the weſt; the horizon begins now to be covered with ſcattered clouds, and one black, peculiarly thick and heavy cloud makes its appearance in ſome point weſtwardly. This advances rapidly, extending itſelf over the greater part of the horizon, attended with conſtant and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated claps of thunder, and the moſt ſevere flaſhes of lightning, which appear to contend for pre-eminence with the extraordinary darkneſs, which would otherwiſe prevail; torrents of rain ſucceed, which by their weight and violence, would threaten to force away even the earth itſelf in its courſe. To a ſcene of this kind I was witneſs, after my return from the preſent expedition, while we lay on the river receiving the remainder of the cargo. I thought it the moſt awfully majeſtic of any ſight I had ever beheld, and ſuch as would afford a moſt elegant field for the deſcriptive genius of ſome poet, to diſplay
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:032239_0123_0FF19F9731260418"/>itſelf into advantage. To ſee a partial mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, like a monſter winging its courſe through the air, darting from its horrid brow the inceſſant ſtreams of electric fire, enforcing ſilent and awful attention by the conſtant and reiterated peals of dreadful thunder, and marking its progreſs by the vaſt deluge of rain which uniformly falls as it advances, leaves an impreſſion on the mind of the moſt impoſing grandeur that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>This diſagreeable ſeaſon, in which the inhabitants live under the continued impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear, is not as lengthy as the others. It commences as mentioned before, in the laſt of April, and is generally over by the middle, or laſt of June. About this time the rainy ſeaſon ſets in, and continues without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the end of September, in all which time, ſcarcely a day paſſes without the country being drenched by one or more ſhowers of rain, the violence and force of which, can ſcarcely be conceived by thoſe who have only
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032239_0124_0FF19F9A2E32D7E0"/>lived in the northern or even middle latitudes. Next enſues the ſeaſon very properly called the Foggy, from the ſun being obſcured throughout the greateſt part of the day, by a thick denſe fog, which falling at night, covers the whole horizon ſo completely as not to admit of a view, except for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a few yards. This is doubtleſs occaſioned by the cold in the upper regions in the atmoſphere, condenſing the water evaporated from the ponds, marſhes, and low grounds, which are all overflown and covered with water, by the exceſſive rains in the preceding ſeaſon. The heat of the ſun produces the evaporation, the cold of night enſuing, condenſes the vapour which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conſequence, obſcures the proſpect, till the ſun on the ſucceeding day, reſtores it to the form of vapour, and occaſions a further exhalation. This continues until the exceſs of water is either evaporated, or has run off, which generally takes place about the laſt of December—the ſucceeding, or ſunny ſeaſon, gliding on imperceptibly
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:032239_0125_0FF19F9D1BBB3288"/>as this declines. The firſt part of this ſeaſon is properly ſpeaking, their winter, for though the weather about noon would be called warm by perſons in our climate, yet the mornings are in general, ſuch as are ſtiled raw and cold.</p>
            <p>My time was now conſtantly occupied by the cuſtoms and characters of the people, among whom I lived; and the 22 days of danger and fatigue, which I had endured on the journey, appeared but as hours of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant trial long paſt, for, from the 7th. of March, the day of the departure of the meſſengers, to their return on the 3d. of April, having no other objects to engroſs my attention, I had become ſo perfectly familiar with my company and way of life, that I could almoſt have brought myſelf, if ſelf alone were concerned, to relinquiſh the buſtle and cares of enlightened ſociety, to partake of the ſimplicity and kind manners of the cheerful African.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:032239_0126_0FF19F9EA85C32F8"/>
I had become deſirous of acquiring all their knowledge, and found the people ready to communicate what they knew;—among others of their arts, and of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to them, that of extracting the oil from the fruit of the palm tree, excited my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, becauſe the proceſs indicates a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ideas, that the Africans are alledged incapable of maintaining.</p>
            <p>The palm tree—the object which firſt attracts the obſerving eye of the ſtranger, and the regard of the natives, is called <hi>Avoura;</hi> the various uſes to which it is capable of being applied, juſtify their predilection. It riſes to the height of, from 58 to 60 feet, preſents a trunk at its full growth of from 30 inches to 3 feet in diameter, at the height of 4 feet from the ground it inſenſibly leſſens, but without branches to the top, where it may be about a foot or more, in diameter. From this part the branches, or rather fibrous leaves, expand in a beautiful tuft like rays from a centre, to the variable length
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:032239_0127_0FF19FA039742528"/>of ſix, eight, and twelve feet. In order to procure the wine and the fruit, they climb this tree, with remarkable ſpeed and adroitneſs, by means of a rope, or hoop, which encloſes the trunk of the tree, but ſo as to leave commodious room for action to the climber. He being provided with his empty calabaſhes, and a knife in his girdle, places himſelf within the hoop, againſt which he leans his back, and raiſes himſelf up by his feet, placed againſt the tree, till he can riſe no higher, when he has thus far elevated himſelf, he graſps the tree in his arms, and raiſes the hoop as far up as it will extend, and again leans againſt the hoop, thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to raiſe himſelf by his feet and the hoop, until he gains the top, where with his knife, he cuts away ſuch of the branches as are neceſſary, to afford room for his calabaſh. He then proceeds to make an inciſion in the tree, and forms a lip or ſpout, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the juice, which flows in a few days from this aperture. Sometimes they fix a ſmall piece of a hollow cane in the hole,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032239_0128_0FF19FA1CC6AA660"/>through which the liquor flows for nearly a month, they taking care to ſupply new veſſels to receive it accordingly as the others fill; when it appears to flow ſlowly, they kindle a fire at the foot of the tree, and it again flows, as faſt as formerly, but the tree is then exhauſted, and will not bear again, but it is converted to domeſtic uſes. The juice when freſh drawn, reſembles water ſlightly coloured by milk; in the courſe of a few hours, however, it undergoes a light fermentation, and becomes a wine of very pleaſant flavour, much reſembling that of the weak Spaniſh white wines, but ſoon loſes theſe properties, being unlike other wines, growing worſe by age. But the fruit is the moſt valuable part; this grows at the top between the branches; when young, it is uſed as food by roaſting, and is of delicate flavour, being covered when full grown and ripe, with a hard ſhell of a brown colour, but which when cut, appears black in the edge. The oil, ſo eſſential an article of food, and of domeſtic uſe, for
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032239_0129_0FF19FA7C0BD50D8"/>anointing their bodies, feeding their lamps, and various other uſes, is procured by expreſſion. The nuts are broken in a trough made of a hollowed tree, and planks radely hewn are then placed over each other for the preſs, the power of compreſſion being produced by a long piece of timber, acting as a lever, is made firm at one end, cloſe beyond the planks, and reſting on them, the other end is forced down by the weight of a number of perſons, who place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on it, until they find by the quantity of oil that has run off, that it has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently preſſed. The oil appears of a crude reddiſh colour when freſh, but changes to yellow, and at length to white. To the palate of the white man, this oil in any ſtate is very nauſeous at firſt, until like tobacco, from being diſagreeable, habit renders it pleaſant; the Africans employ it in all their meals, with yams, rice, millet, fiſh, and even with beef and mutton.</p>

The palm poſſeſſes many uſeful qualities beſide theſe above deſcribed; and in reſpect to beauty, it muſt certainly be ranked firſt of the graces of the foreſt, or the landſcape; of inferior trees and ſhrubs, Africa affords abundance. I have already noticed ſome on the route toward the capital; but the toils of travel, and the calls of appetite under circumſtances, ſuch as I made my tour hither, left very little room for the mental taſte to feed upon, and perhaps at times jaundiced the eye, and converted the luxuriance of the enamelled plain or fruitful wilderneſs, into ſimple unintereſting waſtes; certain it is, that on my excurſions in my hours of leiſure, the wild boar that would have appeared an object of horror, under the impreſſions of fatigue and anxiety, no longer excited any apprehenſions; I could calculate upon the whiteneſs of his tuſks, and the moroſeneſs of his aſpect, as objects of traffic and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and I would inſtead of trembling, leſt I ſhould hear, travel under the dews of night, heedleſs of ſleep, to liſten to the hoarſe
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032239_0131_0FF19FAC4D4EE7F8"/>voice of the lion. Of this noble animal, I ſaw none on my journey hither, and but two old ones and a cub, during my ſtay in <hi>Ebo.</hi> The antelope whoſe veniſon alone I ſought, now excited my curioſity by its grace, innocence, and agility; the elephant, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the wolf, are become objects too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to need deſcription. Induſtry prompted by the appetite of human curioſity, has familiarized the inhabitants of the moſt populous cities with theſe beaſts of the deſart; and we no longer have to learn from books, how cloſe deſcription adheres to nature. Goats of a large long bearded ſpecies, ſhort horned, and with a curved profile, like the Spaniſh gennet; the celebrated African ſheep with the hair coat, and tallow tail; and the horſes ſmall, but hardy. The cows are ſmall, and yielding but little milk, and the art of making butter was unknown to the people of <hi>Ebo;</hi> I endeavoured to teach my houſekeepers the proceſs, but their good humour prevailing on me, or their own want of habituated performance, always fruſtrated my efforts
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032239_0132_0FF19FB0E75D6868"/>to teach them what might have proved ſo highly uſeful.</p>
            <p>Among the plants and ſhrubs that I ſaw, and could form any knowledge of, were the <hi>ſiſban,</hi> or large thorny ſenſitive plant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the <hi>good-morrow,</hi> theſe are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant among the underwoods. The <hi>bind-weed</hi> that winds about the loftieſt trees, exhibited a beautiful object, it bears a many-leaved flower, with purple and white horns; it blows at ſunriſe, and ſheds at the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night, for about ſix weeks, (a moon and a half); it grows extremely thick, either from ſeeds, or branches torn and placed in ſoft mold within the reach of the ſun's rays; the children of the natives amuſe themſelves in planting it, and forming arbours, within which they ſpend ſeveral hours of the warm part of the day. The <hi>gum tree</hi> and the <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metto,</hi> are among the uſeful and elegant productions of the climate; the <hi>baſil</hi> and the <hi>annota,</hi> are beautiful flowering ſhrubs; the <hi>Guiney a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> of the bark of which they make
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032239_0133_0FF19FB545D7C210"/>cords; the <hi>acacia,</hi> is alſo abundant; and the ſides of the ſloping hills, exhibit the white <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and the <hi>Convolvulus.</hi> In the flat grounds, and on the edges of the rivers, the <hi>mangroves</hi> are frequently to be found, and fertility always with them; here alſo, there are ſome ſpecies of the willow, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from the European, by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its wood, and by the leaf being round at the point. Among the fruit trees that I have not mentioned before, are the <hi>Guava,</hi> of three or four ſpecies, which are eſteemed by the inhabitants as powerful remedies in the cure of dyſentery, likewiſe the <hi>Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> with all its beauties. The <hi>Amaranth</hi> that ſpends its odours in the morning, and the <hi>Lotus</hi> or <hi>night lily,</hi> the white, yellow, and red, that droop at the approach of day, and perfume the air with their intoxicating fragrance during the night only, are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant here.</p>
            <p>The brooks and rivulets yield their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance likewiſe, for beſide the <hi>Carps</hi> the <hi>Grig,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:032239_0134_0FF19FB6D27B1058"/>and the <hi>Perch,</hi> that are to be had in great numbers, with others that I cannot deſcribe, the rivers at their mouths, and up as far as the tides flow, afford lobſters, crabs, prauns, cray-fiſh, ſoles, mullets, &amp;c. in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; while the thickets on their banks, afford the <hi>Guiney-hen,</hi> the <hi>Moor fowl,</hi> the <hi>Ortolan,</hi> and innumerable others.</p>
            <p>Between the amuſements in the villages, and the pleaſures of various expeditions into the country, I could bear with perfect eaſe, the long abſence of accounts from the ſhip; it was not the 1ſt. of April, and the people were not yet returned, although I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they could reach the ſhip in ten days by the courſe of the river; I amuſed myſelf in ſhooting birds and other curious animals, or in purſuing the monkeys, in the vallyes and woods. Of theſe animals, beſide the ſmall green and brown ſpecies, I ſaw ſeveral of a large kind, of a yellowiſh caſt, and with white bellies; greet parrots, ſcarlet birds, honey-birds, the long tailed fly-bird,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032239_0135_0FF19FB86126E870"/>grey parrots, and green and red paroquets; the vulture and many other birds well known to the naturaliſts. I was frequently accompanied by the old chief, who was delighted with the execution of my gun, and made himſelf acquainted with its uſe, as well as the nature of gun-powder, ſo far as to underſtand that it was compoſed of very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple materials.</p>
            <p>On the 3d. of April, while I was on an excurſion abroad, one of the meſſengers returned from the ſhip, and I found him before me at my hut in the evening, with a packet from the Captain, adviſing me of the goods which he had ſent by the ſhallop, to the mouth of the little <hi>Congo,</hi> and giving me directions how to proceed.</p>
            <p>The information being communicated to the old chief, he informed me he would ſend a number of experienced old men with me, to chuſe ſuch articles as they ſhould approve; and after three days, proviſions and horſes
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032239_0136_0FF19FBB5586ECE0"/>being provided, we ſet out, the company conſiſting of ſix of the deputation, with ſome of their families, a number of perſons to carry proviſions and goods, and my two wives. We had nearly 100 miles to go, which engaged us ſix days; riding proved very unpleaſant to me, on account of the heat and the want of a ſaddle. We found the boats as we were directed, and a cargo of brandy, rum, gin, and tobacco, a few coarſe guns, ſome ammunition, ſwords, knives, ſpears, and ornaments, ſuch as rings of various kinds, for the legs, arms, and fingers, ſome gilt and plated breaſt plates for their warriors, tinſel laces, and ſome glaſs-ware. An aſſortment ſo extenſive and rich in their eyes, had never been there before; and bargains were very ſoon made for goods, in exchange for 100 ſlaves, (being ordered not to bring down more) for the reſt I procured ivory and gold, in duſt and bars. In theſe dealings I found my wives of more uſe to me than my companion <hi>Hurdee,</hi> for they
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032239_0137_0FF19FBFB4C5E340"/>ſincerely ſtudied my intereſt, while he ſtudied to profit himſelf.</p>
            <p>Being informed by my wives, that if I had a quantity of goods at the capital, I ſhould be likely to turn the whole to valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account, I determined to take with me as much as the horſes we had could bear, and the people for a reaſonable reward, would be prevailed on to carry. Accordingly we ſet out on our return to the city, where we arrived without any other difficulty, than what aroſe from the ordinary labour of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and the heat of the weather, for I was now too well acquainted with the <hi>comforts</hi> of repoſe under the canopy of heaven, without any other furniture than the thick leaved trees, to complain at trifles.</p>
            <p>I was conſiderably diverted during my return by the effects which ornaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the vanity of thoſe who had acquired them, either by traffic or labour. Their
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032239_0138_0FF19FC2A3DD6198"/>paſſion for ſpiritous liquors, was likewiſe exceſſive, but I was both ſurpriſed and pleaſed, to find their effects on the tempers of the Africans, ſo very different from that of our American ſavages. Thoſe who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them, uſed them at firſt divertingly, trying the taſte of them in ſmall ſips, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated until their operation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, or the experimenters became toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably intoxicated. A rude ſcene of drollery then was acted; fits of laughter and antic pranks were played; the parties running, hallowing, climbing trees, and the like, without the leaſt diſpoſition to miſchief or ill humour. I reflected frequently on the outrages and crimes committed in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the American Indians, but could not account in any ſatisfactory way, for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular contraſt between their behaviour, and that of the Africans under ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>We were received with great ſatisfaction by the old chief and his family, and by our
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032239_0139_0FF19FC42FE640B8"/>general acquaintances in the city; the goods brought by the deputation, gave him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſatisfaction, and I contrived to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of my gratitude for his attention, by a preſent of ſome paſte jewellery, which though coarſe in the eye of one acquainted with their true worth, were of a luſtre and value, in the eyes of the <hi>Ebo</hi> king and his people, comparatively ſuperior to the diamonds of the Indies; a handſome hanger with a plate hilt, completed my preſent, and made him in his own eſtimation, one of the richeſt of potentates.</p>
            <p>Having arranged affairs for the ſale of the remaining effects, the intelligence was ſoon ſpread around the adjacent villages, and the whole as ſoon converted into ivory, and gold in bars and duſt. It ſoon became neceſſary for me to prepare for the chief, but moſt irkſome and difficult part of my duty. The ſlaves that I had purchaſed were young men, many of whom being eager to eſcape from their bondage in <hi>Ebo,</hi> preferred the evil that
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032239_0140_0FF19FC897F60C68"/>they "knew not of" to that which they then felt; but the majority were evidently affected with grief at their approaching departure.</p>
            <p>Arrangements were made, and a ſufficient body of the <hi>Ebo</hi> people undertook to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me as a guard to the place of embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; proviſions were provided for the journey, ſo that each of the ſlaves was well fed, and a load of proviſions or goods given him to carry. They were tied to poles in rows, four feet apart; a looſe wicker bandage round the neck of each, connected him to the pole, and the arms being pinioned by a bandage affixed behind above the elbows, they had ſufficient room to feed, but not to looſe themſelves, or commit any violence; and as the guard was provided with arms, we had nothing to apprehend during the night, as we divided the <hi>Ebo</hi> people into parties, one of which ſlept while the other watched.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:032239_0141_0FF19FCB8FE83848"/>
We ſet out from the city about 5 o'clock in the morning; the old King and his family, the elders and their families, and my two wives; of the former I took my leave, with evident marks of regret; the old man telling me if I ſhould come that way ſoon, he would be fond of ſeeing me at my own houſe, for he ſhould continue henceforth to call that part of his own, mine, which I had occupied; my wives accompanied me.</p>
            <p>This journey was extremely different in its nature from that in which I had laſt paſſed this way; the giddy pranks of the vain, or the inebriated <hi>Ebo,</hi> was woefully contraſted by the ſullen melancholy, and deep ſighs of the poor <hi>Galla</hi> priſoners: often did they look back with eyes flowing with tears, turn ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den round and gaze, ſeeming to part with reluctance, even from their former bondage. It was exceſſively affecting to me, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that death night have been their ſure otherwiſe, and I endeavored to reconcile them to their condition, by repreſenting flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032239_0142_0FF19FCE828249C8"/>accounts of the country to which they were going; that the bonds they then bore were only to prevent their flight; that they ſhould be at their liberty where they were going, and have plenty to eat, drink, &amp;c. Theſe aſſurances occaſioned a temporary compoſure, and we at length arrived at the place of our embarkation; two boats had been brought up, as the ſhallop drew too much water; the ſlaves were put on board, and neceſſarily in irons brought for the purpoſe.—This meaſure occaſioned one of the moſt affecting ſcenes I ever witneſſed: their hopes with my aſſurances had buoyed them up on the road; but a change from the cordage to iron fetters, rent their hopes and hearts together: their wailiags were torturing beyond what words can expreſs; but delay at this criſis would have been fatal; the boat's crews were acquainted with the duty, and they were all ſafely embarked.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I had retired from the painful ſcene, and had to arrange my departure ſo as
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032239_0143_0FF19FD1890D0C10"/>to leave the two affectionate creatures who had been ſo anxious to procure me every ſatisfaction during my reſidence with them. It was a taſk more delicate (although affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be ſuppoſed as concerned) than may be believed by thoſe who are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with viciſſitudes of an adventurous life, and ſuch as would be deemed abſurd to thoſe whoſe ſtandard for judging the feelings and actions of all mankind is formed by the education, the habits, and prejudices of a particular ſociety. I had prepared ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for them, conſiſting of ſuch trifles as I deemed ſuitable to their ſex and tempers; <hi>Koomla</hi> the talleſt was a graceful young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and poſſeſſed a degree of ſenſibility and diſintereſtedneſs that might be deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common even under a fair complexion and a more temperate climate. <hi>Yanee</hi> whoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was more lively, diſplayed her feelings in a different way; <hi>Koomla</hi> with her head reclined, expreſſed herſelf by ſighs and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings that I ſhould go without her; <hi>Yanee</hi> believed that I would, as I ſaid, ſoon
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032239_0144_0FF19FD32A38AF70"/>return again; the former would not accept my preſents, the latter enjoined her to keep them for my ſake, and told me ſhe would make it her care to pleaſe <hi>Koomla</hi> till I ſhould return: ſhe would ſtill fain that both ſhould go with me.—I promiſed ſhortly to return, and enjoined them to take care of each other, that on my return I might find both well as I meant to reſide then with them. They followed me to the edge of the river and held me by the coat till I broke from them and jumped on board the boat, when they both burſt into tears, and were carreſſed by the reſt of the natives among whom I had diſtributed ſuch little baubles as remained with me.</p>
            <p>We ſoon loſt ſight of them in a winding of the river; and continued going down with the current till night; the ſlaves ſeemed every hour to feel their ſituation more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and I ordered them each a dram of liquor which for a while exhilerated their ſpirits, and quieted their cares. The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the river, and the difficulty of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:032239_0145_0FF19FD778650300"/>rowing from the ſhoals, and fallen trees that thwarted the current, obliged us to lie too; we accordingly made faſt an anchor, and lay with the two boats along ſide of each other, keeping a regular watch during the night. We furniſhed the ſlaves with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but whether through grief or ſulleneſs, very few of them would partake of any refreſhments beſide water.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we had light we unmoored, and before noon we reached our ſhallop, extremely fatigued from the heat and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the air, the banks of each ſide as we paſſed, being overgrown with wood and thicket, obſtructing its free circulation. We had now another diſagreeable piece of duty to execute, viz. the removal of the ſlaves from the ſmall boats into the ſhallop; they were in want of room, and it was ſuggeſted to looſe ſix of them at a time; we accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to the centre of the river, and being moored by a grapling, began to remove them; they appeared generally more quiet,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032239_0146_0FF19FDA66A74768"/>and willing to act as we directed by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter than uſual, and had now all been removed, and placed below, but the laſt ſix, whom we ſuffered to remain on the deck; when we had not under weigh, and were paſſing through a narrow part of the river, two of them found means to jump overboard; a ſailor who was in the ſmall boat aſtern, ſeized one of them by the arms, and the end of a rope being thrown to him, the ſlave was taken on board, though not without ſome difficulty. The others who had been at the oars, ſeeing their fellows, one of them ſeized, and the other ſtruck on the head with a pole, ſet up a ſcream, which was echoed by the reſt below; thoſe that were looſe made an effort to throw two of the ſailors over board; the reſt, except the one in the boat and at the helm, being aſleep: the noiſe had now rouſed them, and the ſcream had impreſſed them with ſome degree of terror; they ſezied on the guns and bayonets that lay ready, and ruſhed upon the ſlaves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of whom from below had got looſe, and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032239_0147_0FF19FDBF4FB7DE8"/>were endeavouring to ſet the reſt free, while thoſe we had to deal with above, were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to ſacrifice us to their deſpair. Theſe tranſactions were but the events of a moment; I had neither gun nor ſword, and to retire in ſearch of either, would have been to give the ſlaves a deciſive ſuperiority; I laid hold of the <hi>palloon</hi> ſtick, and had raiſed it to ſtrike one of them who had nearly wreſted a gun from one of the ſailors, but before I could give the blow, I received a ſtroke of an oar, which ſevered my little finger from my hand; I know not how it was that I felt nothing of the ſevere pain for the moment, a ſlight twitch on the hand was the only ſenſation I experienced; the blow was broken that I had intended, but I renewed the effort, and with effect, for I levelled the fellow, and the ſailor recovered his gun, whom I could not prevent from running the poor negro through the body; the hatch was open, and he fell among his fellows, who had, crouded tied, and ironed as they were, to aſſiſt as far as they were able, by holding our legs,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032239_0148_0FF19FDD8DC9A9C0"/>encouraging their companions, and ſhouting whenever thoſe above did any thing that appeared likely to overcome one or other of us. We at length overpowered them; one only having eſcaped and one being killed, the reſt we immediately bound in double irons, and took care from thence till our arrival at the ſhip, not to ſuffer any of them to take the air without being made faſt. Five of the ſailors were conſiderably, but not dangerouſly hurt, and of the ſlaves, thoſe who had been riotous above and below, nine were ſeverely wounded.</p>
            <p>We reached the ſhip in five days from our firſt embarkation, where we were received with much ſatisfaction; the officers had all provided themſelves with three or four wives each, and rebuked me for not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mine along, alledging that they would, according to the account given by their meſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, bring a good price when we arrived in America. I was ſorry, however, to find that two of our beſt ſeamen had expired
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032239_0149_0FF19FE35A9CFD00"/>during my abſence, from the exceſſive fatigue of the ſhips duty, and the heat of the climate.</p>
            <p>While I was away, the Captain had opened a trade in another channel, he had obtained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſlaves in the place where he lay, beſide gold and ivory; and had contracted with ſome French and Engliſh factors up the river <hi>Reyo Naunus,</hi> for the remainder of his cargo, and for his ſea ſtores. We accordingly weighed anchor and ſtood for that river, which lies about 40 leagues N. of the <hi>Reyo Pongo,</hi> or in 10 deg. 40 min. ſouth, and on the 16th. of May arrived off the Cape, which forms one ſide of the ſouthern outlet of that river.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reyo Naunus</hi> is navigable above 150 miles from its mouth; its banks are low, fertile, and moderately inhabited, but within a few miles of the ſea; for, advancing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the country it is ſwampy, unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and uninhabited for ſeventy or eighty miles above; beyond which, the ground again obtains its elevation, ſo that health and
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032239_0150_0FF19FE66101E7C8"/>population are ſeen in union with a luxuriant country, and a pleaſant climate. Here the factors of European nations have eſtabliſhed a ſettlement, and lead a life of heedleſs extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and diſſipation. The American and European traders to this country, ſupply them with all the luxurious produce of the world, with wines, jewellery, and coſtly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>thing. The produce of their gardens, uniting the productions of every climate by being maintained at a great expence of negro labour, is obtained in great perfection by a few, and in abundance by all. Although a plenteous climate and limitted ſociety, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hoſpitality ſcarcely praiſeworthy, and although every individual, even of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate property, ſupports his own eſtabliſhment, of houſe, gardens, horſes, and ſlaves; theſe ſettlers unqueſtionably deſerve notice, for among them hoſpitality exiſts, in a degree unknown in other countries.</p>
            <p>The Captain and I on our arrival, went on ſhore to lay in ſtock and water, but had
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032239_0151_0FF19FE9529D3A70"/>contemplated returning as ſoon as we ſhould have engaged with ſome perſon to ſupply us; we were met, however, and invited to the houſe of an Engliſhman, who had once fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſea; he entreated us to ſpend the day with him, and that in the meantime, our buſineſs could be done by ordering what we wiſhed from his houſe. It was early, and we were provided with a ſumptuous breakfaſt of chocolate, tea and coffee, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly ſerved up in beautiful China and plate, with fruits of various kinds in glaſs ware. Several of the neighbouring factors joined us, and appeared jealous of our accidentally becoming gueſts of one and not of the other; however, that the ſociety of the place ſhould be kept up, they agreed (without aſking our conſent) that we ſhould ſpend a day with each of them, in order. We objected to this exceſſive liberality, but were obliged to ſtay dinner with one, and ſup with another, to take a bed with a third, and a glaſs of wine <hi>en paſſant,</hi> with half a dozen more; we were conducted to the gardens that I have
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032239_0152_0FF19FEC44E5B150"/>before noticed, and heard the anecdotes of the ſeveral plantations, and poſſeſſions from the firſt ſettlement. As the heat of the day increaſed we retired, and the ſacrifices to Bacchus commenced, with what they called a <hi>whetter</hi> before dinner. Some of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, however, had been rather earlier at their devotions;—but as the minutiae of the <hi>two</hi> days which we were obliged to ſpend with them, would be tedions, a general deſcription of their cuſtoms and mode of life, will be more ſuitable and comprehenſive.</p>
            <p>Theſe factors moſtly conſiſt of perſons who have led a ſeafaring life, but being left in the country either by deſign or accident, have gradually become attached to the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and indulgence which the climate affords. The woods, the rivers, and the labours of the Africans, afford all that luxury can require for the table, and trade ſupplies the reſt. One of them, John Stone by name, whoſe houſe we had firſt entered, was from the north eaſt of England, and
<pb n="154"
                   facs="unknown:032239_0153_0FF19FEF432E4138"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>had reſided at the <hi>Colong</hi> about 8 or 10 years. He had at firſt ſight, (theſe were his words) attached himſelf to me partially, and took much pains to induce me to remain there, pointing out the advantages that I ſhould derive from being the only American in the ſettlement, and the independence I would ſpeedily acquire by trade in the interior, from the experience in that line which he learned I already had. Theſe temptations offered in the moments of hilarity made but a feeble impreſſion on me, and the laxity of manners and intoxication that I ſaw, did not appear ſo much the effect of common and general cuſtom, as of a ſuppoſed deſire of theſe ſettlers, to contribute to the comfort and pleaſure of perſons who had partaken of none, but the few enjoyments of an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous life, for a long time previous.</p>
            <p>But I propoſed deſcribing their way of life, I need not remark on the cuſtomary plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of women in the domeſtic eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but will only obſerve that the whites
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032239_0154_0FF19FF22FFDB0B8"/>adopt this faſhion of the country in all its extent; the morning beverage of Madeira or Liſbon wines, ſpiritous liquors, or the more palatable <hi>liqueurs</hi> of the <hi>belle nation,</hi> circulate during the forenoon, which is devoted to viſiting from houſe to houſe. The hour of dinner is that which fixes company to a point, as all keep open and ample boards; it is not ſo much the queſtion whether they ſhall all dine together, as with what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular one that ſhall be, and each perſon wiſhing to be the favoured man, the beſt accommodation has generally the preference, which makes every one emulous to have the moſt tempting viands and agreeable fare. This ſpirit ſo liberal in appearance, is yet not the effect of an amiable paſſion, but rather the contrary, and the exceſſes of which, is the parent will, be perhaps the beſt teſt to prove its miſchievous tendency.</p>
            <p>The board is ſcarcely ſpread, and the gueſts ſeated when the <hi>debauch</hi> begins; for their behaviour is unteſtrained by that taſte for
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032239_0155_0FF19FF3C21B7590"/>decorum which is always inſpired by the ſociety of amiable and accompliſhed women, while the rudeneſs of the converſation is generally aſſorted with the uncourteous way of life, to which the company has been habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. They come to the table nearly intoxicated, and before dinner is completed, they become downright drunk; the vacancy which marks the uncultivated mind, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no room here for uſeful converſation or agreeable hilarity, folly and wantonneſs ſupply their place. The coarſe jocularity of deſtroying their apparel or waſting the food, is their amuſement; while the moſt exquiſite viands are waſted without utility, and the appetite being palled by ſuperabundance, loſes all its value but that which gratifies the vanity of the provider, by indulging the waſte and abſurdity of his gueſts. After the wine has circulated freely, the meats are even occaſionally daſhed about at the heads of the beſt humoured, or moſt patient of the company, and the empty diſhes, plates, and tables are demoliſhed to ſhew the ſpirit of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032239_0156_0FF19FF56649F0E0"/>the party, and the lengths to which they could carry <hi>a joke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man of high ſpirit on an occaſion of this kind, has been known to furniſh a ſecond, and a third courſe for a like entertainment, each of which met with a ſimilar fate—and the whole was afterwards celebrated as a <hi>high frolic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the concluſion of theſe debauches, the black wives who know their duty, attend and convey each exemplary maſter to his own houſe. This, with the ſimple variation of hunting, ſhooting, and fiſhing parties, at particular ſeaſons, giving orders for the management of their gardens, their meals, and occaſionally their traffic, is the round of life the white people lead in this ſettlement.</p>
            <p>My landlord had contrived to acquire convertible property, to the amount of between 3 and 4000<abbr>l.</abbr> he had originally hoped to have returned to Europe, and
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032239_0157_0FF19FFE03773CD0"/>ſpend the remainder of his life happily, but he confeſſed he did not then think he could be <hi>comfortable</hi> any where elſe, and had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſtay where he was.</p>
            <p>I had however, conceived different ideas of comfort, and though I could not ſhun their noiſy and mad feſtivity for the time, was convinced that if I poſſeſſed the means which my hoſt then did, that I ſhould find ſcenes on the banks of the <hi>Hudſon</hi> or <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> where it could be converted to more rational and deſirable purpoſes.</p>
            <p>As our cargo was now complete, and our ſtock and water provided, ſufficient for the paſſage home, it was high time to depart, which we did not without much obſtruction from our madly hoſpitable factors, and with aching heads and ſick ſtomachs, not likely to let us ſoon forget them.</p>
            <p>Our entertainers determined to accompany us to the ſhip, and the Captain with ſome
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032239_0158_0FF19FFF90FB8CA8"/>others of the factors having taken one boat, my hoſt accompanied me in the other; on the way he took much trouble to perſuade me to leave the ſhip and ſtay with him, and offered me 300<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum to quit the ſhip and keep his books. It was in vain that I told him I could not obtain a diſcharge from the veſſel, that all the accounts were kept in my hand writing, and that I was not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine enough of advantage to induce me to ſtay, even if I had the power; he ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to urge his propoſal. I was however, indeed much allured on further reflection, by the knowledge I had of my own reſolution againſt a diſſipated life, and particularly by the proſpect of making a rapid fortune, ſo much within my power, by my acquaintance with the <hi>Ebo</hi> King and people, and by the progreſs I had made in their language; ſo much, that could the difficulties which I ſaw in my way, be removed, I ſhould have embraced the offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:032239_0159_0FF1A0011E32DD90"/>
We reached the veſſel, and with ſuch rough fare as we poſſeſſed, endeavoured to regale our viſitors, who took leave of us with the evening, but not without a more preſſing invitation to me, to get on ſhore.</p>
            <p>We were now to prepare for ſea; our veſſel lay nearly a mile from the ſhore, and our cargo was all on board; but a very ſevere diſtemper already threatened the ſlaves; they had become ſullen and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and diſcontented with their food, and confinement. The air of the ſhip, and the ſcene before me, perhaps together with the remaining fumes of debauch on ſhore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to render me diſcontented with my ſituation. I revolved in my mind that I had now diſcharged my duty to the owners, that I had but a few entries to make to complete the accounts, and while the hope of fortune and the temptations of the Engliſh factor, preſſed upon my recollection; I determined finally, to finiſh my buſineſs, and embark in
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032239_0160_0FF1A002B8BA9158"/>the enterprize that now occupied every turn of my mind.</p>
            <p>The work being executed in the heat and enthuſiaſm of my reſolution; I had now to contrive the means of my departure. The Captain could not according to his articles, give me a diſcharge, but this obſtacle was only a ſtronger inſtigation to perſevere in the attempt. Every perſon of the ſhip's company but the Captain, Surgeon, and myſelf, had ſtated duties in the watch, which from the arrival of the ſlaves, was conſtantly and rigdly kept up: the only boat not on board was chained aſtern, and this it would be impoſſible to get clear without exciting alarm.</p>
            <p>I had marked the advice of the factor, not to leave the ſhip till on the verge of her departure; we had dropped down with the tide, and moored by the beſt bower and ſtream anchor, in a fine ſandy bottom, but the oppoſite ſhore was marſhy: the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032239_0161_0FF1A005D0BFF2D8"/>was to be that of our departure. My determination to eſcape was confirmed by my accidentally ſeeing as I paſſed the main hatch, one of the ſlaves in the pangs of death; the ſickneſs had already made conſiderable progreſs, and I was ſtruck with the danger that muſt follow when out at ſea, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe had already inflicted death.</p>
            <p>My whole mind was now concentred on my eſcape, and I ſoon prepared two bottles of ſpirits to give the watch, after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould have gone to ſleep: a few articles of linen, my beſt hat, and my hanger, I ſet apart; and when all had retired, about ten at night I came upon deck, and offered the boatſwain, who commanded the watch, a can of grog, of which I knew him to be not a little fond; he freely ſhared it with the reſt, and I was not backward in repleniſhing the quantity, which had its deſired effect; for I then retired, and ſoon after coming up with my things, found them all extended on the deck, and faſt aſleep. I fixed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

I meant to float aſtern, but from want of means to manage the plank, it had got entangled in the man ropes, I endeavoured to make for the boat, which with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, after having diſengaged my clothes and hanger, letting them go adrift, I effected. Perſiſting in my purpoſe, I once more made the attempt; but the tide was now rapid, and I unfortunately ſwept againſt the ſtream cable, by which I was turned over, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the plank. My only reſource now was to adhere to the cable in order to get ſafe on board if poſſible, and after much difficulty, I got out of the water and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered up to ſome diſtance: having reſted for ſome time here, and the tide ſlackening, I once more thought of committing myſelf
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032239_0163_0FF1A00E7B4F0778"/>to the water and ſwimming to ſhore, when I diſcovered by the occaſional ſcintillations of lightning, three or four aligators floating below me in the current; my blood was chilled, and I congratulated myſelf for the moment on my happy eſcape. I now concluded to make my way back on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board as well as poſſible, which having effected, I found my ſhipmates all ſtill happy and heedleſs; and ſlunk to my birth, cooled and fatigued, and ready for repoſe. On the morning as the anchors were about to be taken up, I was called to take the uſual beverage which ſeamen call their morning, but pleaded illneſs, and was waited on by the Doctor, to whom I without reſerve, but in confidence ſtated the plain truth. He was much ſurpriſed, promiſed ſecrecy, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with ſome of his own clothes, in which I made my appearance upon deck, the Captain condoling with me upon my illneſs, which he ſaid was viſible in my countenance, and expreſſing his fears that I had caught the ſickneſs which had already killed ſeveral

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>of the people; though I could with difficulty refrain from laughter, I was ſatisfied to find all had gone ſo far well.</p>
            <p>We had now dropped down a conſiderable length, and I had nearly deſpaired of effecting my eſcape, when accident threw an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in my way, that I directly embraced. It was found neceſſary to take in ſome ballaſt, and the boatſwain having ſurfeited himſelf <hi>with watching</hi> the previous night, and was unable to go on ſhore with the boat, I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly offered my ſervices; but had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of taking any conveniencies with me, except a ſmall cutlaſs and jack knife. I determined upon effecting my purpoſe now once for all.</p>
            <p>When we reached the ſhore I ſet the men to work, urging them to make haſte, while I took a ſhort walk along the bank, to return by the time they were ready, if not, for them to call me. Inſtead of taking to the water ſide, I ſoon got out of ſight of the boat's
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032239_0165_0FF1A0131BD93DF0"/>crew, and made the beſt of my way inland from the water; but finding it was populous in that direction, I judged it better to take the ſhelter of ſome bruſh wood and high graſs that was near. They hailed as directed, and I heard them; they ſearched in all directions, and paſſed ſeveral times cloſe by me, calling my name, and at length returned concluding me loſt or devoured by wild beaſts. The Captain was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find the ſailors return without me, and determined to go on ſhore himſelf that evening, and engage a party of the natives to go in ſearch of me. I, inſenſible, and unſuſpecting of this, had not ſtirred before midnight from my covert, but having marked where the ſun went down, ſet forward from that direction, and travelled till daylight; having found plenty of fruit, I feaſted, and choſe a receſs once more, and committed myſelf as I hoped, to ſleep. The monkeys, however, were leſs civil than I had before found them, they collected in numbers about, and annoyed me by their inceſſant ſcreaming
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032239_0166_0FF1A01616B6E160"/>and chattering, which made me uneaſy, as I feared that their noiſe would attract ſome of the natives to the place. To avoid this, I determined to move forward, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by this noiſy peſtiferous crew, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from tree to tree before and on all ſides of me, crying louder if poſſible, than before. Frequently did I, with the deſire of revenge, wiſh for a gun that I might ſacrifice ſome of them; but in the afternoon having obtained ſome quietneſs, I lay down to ſleep; and about 9 o'clock purſued my route. Several pathways croſſing convinced me that the country was thickly peopled; I endeavoured to take that which was leaſt trodden, but ſhortly after diſcovored five perſons croſſing the path which I was purſuing, I changed my courſe up an aſcent, and eſcaped unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, but had not gone above a mile when I diſcovered two others ſomewhat ahead of me. The openneſs of the country now deprived me of ſhelter, for a few ſcattered trees were all that this riſing ground afforded; the two men approaching, and I had placed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032239_0167_0FF1A017A4604950"/>myſelf behind a tree, ſhifting my poſition as they drew near—I thought they would have heard my heart beat as I ſtood againſt the tree, ſo great was my apprehenſion; they paſſed me, however, and I turned into a path that led down into the woody country. I had plucked ſome fruit and ſat down by a rivulet to refreſh myſelf, when fatigue and want of ſleep overcame me, ſo that I lay down under ſhelter of a bank. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, as I computed by the time I had been aſleep, I was awakened by violent claps of thunder, the lightning ſtreamed along the verge of the horizon, and illumined the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; the dark heaps of clouds, riſing volume over volume, diſplayed a variety of the moſt ſublime ſhadows, through the intervals of which, the coruſcations burſt in a thouſand points, breaking into angles, and exploding in deep reſounding peals that gradually were loſt undulating on the ear, and this ſtill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by another louder, and accompanied by a torrent that ſeemed to pour from the heavens like the waters of a cataract. The
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032239_0168_0FF1A01C097ED4F8"/>ſtorm began now to abate, and was faintly heard muttering at a diſtance; but the winds roſe, the trees of the foreſt ſhook, and in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate moments was all horrible, awful, dark, and ſtill.—Drenched with rain and overcome with a depreſſion, from the awful ſcene that had paſſed, a momentary conſideration of my preſent circumſtances, produced ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I cannot deſcribe; my eyes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with tears which eaſed me of my anxiety, and I then felt an unconquerable propenſity to ſleep.</p>
            <p>The day had been far ſpent when I awoke; the heat of the ſun was conſiderable; I ſtripped off my dripping clothes, dried them, and bathed in the rivulet on the banks of which I had lain. Having collected a few fruit, and being further refreſhed, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to purſue my route over the hill from which I had before deſcended; but found I had ſuffered more than I previouſly ſuſpected by fatigue and by the rain: of this I was convinced by my weakneſs, and the length
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032239_0169_0FF1A0205DC68730"/>of time employed in aſcending the hill. I took advantage of a few trees that ſtood near each other to reſt myſelf, and ſat down for about half an hour, when I was alarmed by the ſound of human voices. I roſe up, and to my aſtoniſhment ſaw a body of the natives of about twenty, armed with fire arms and ſpears, and within 100 yards of me. I was immediately ſtruck with an apprehenſion that they were in purſuit of me; but concluded that the ſhip muſt have ſailed before this time. I then felt a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to accoſt them; but ſtill undertermined I found myſelf creeping along towards the oppoſite ſide of the hill on all fours. As ſoon as I conceived myſelf out of ſight I fled towards the valley with all the ſpeed in my power; but I fled in vain, I was diſcovered, and to my aſtoniſhment and alarm, three or four ſhots fired after me. I redoubled my ſpeed; but the purſuers were too fleet, and uncertain what fate awaited me, I turned ſhort round and faced them; they ſeized and were about to tie me; I endeavoured
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032239_0170_0FF1A021E9228868"/>to make them underſtand what I had to ſay in the <hi>Ebo</hi> tongue without effect but by ſigns informed them that I would go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-oppoſition. They conducted me back by almoſt the ſame route I had come, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me cloſely, and ſome of them occaſionally ſhewing the marks of my ſhoes, by which I ſuppoſe they had traced my courſe. We arrived that night at a village, where I had a dry hut and plenty of rice ſtraw to ſleep upon; a party was placed to watch me, but I was ſupplied with food and palm wine—I ſlept ſoundly, but awoke feveriſh, and was obliged to riſe early in that condition. I felt extremely weak, but determined to go whitherſoever they led, provided my ſtrength ſhould be ſufficient; to my ſurpriſe, however, upon clearing a wood through which we paſſed, I ſaw the ſhip cloſe in by the ſhore. Mixed emotions overcome me, and I fainted; on recovery I found the Captain, the Doctor, and ſome of the ſhip's crew around me; the Captain received me with great coolneſs;
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032239_0171_0FF1A024DB03D138"/>but the Doctor, the mate, and ſailors all with the greateſt cordiality.</p>
            <p>Having arrived on board; the Captain upbraided me with deſerting him; I alledged in my defence that I had completed his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſignified the apprehenſions I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for my health; apprehenſions which have ſince proved to my ſorrow, were but too well founded. I did not heſitate to declare my expectations of ſoon realizing a property, could I reach the <hi>Colong</hi> factory, and deſired as the ſhip's buſineſs was all brought up, that he would permit me to go thither in the beſt manner I could. He told me that there was yet further buſineſs to do, that he had ſhipped in my abſence, an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional number of ſlaves, brought to him down the <hi>Reyo Naunus,</hi> and that he could not agree to it, even had that buſineſs not interfered; finding it in vain to ſtrive far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt difficulties, I relinquiſhed my ideas of fortune, and reconciled myſelf to return home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:032239_0172_0FF1A027E91209C0"/>
I was afterwards informed, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had gone on ſhore, finding me not return with the boat, and learned from the people of the next village that they had ſeen the footſteps of an European in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood on the preceding day; he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hired 25 of the natives to go in one direction, and an equal number in the other, as they ſaid I could only get out of that part of the country by two paſſages, owing to the large rivers then filling with the rains that had fallen on the inland mountains. The party that took me had diſcovered my tracks, and purſued their courſe till they overtook me, in conſequence of which, they received a runlet of rum as a reward.</p>
            <p>The whole number of ſlaves that we had now on board, I found about 500, of whom above 50 were then lying in a dangerous ſtate of illneſs; it was time for us to depart, being now the 13th. of June, 1795. We accordingly got in our anchors, and procured ſix of the natives boats, with ſix men in
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:032239_0173_0FF1A02AD9422408"/>each, to tow us down night and day, when the tide ſerved.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 15th. while waiting for the tide, about 9 o'clock, we were alarmed on beard by a quarrel in the boats. Some of our people who had been on this coaſt before, had excited a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition between the natives in the boats that towed on each of our bows; each party claiming the greater merit, to enſure it, they proceeded from hard words to actual blows; the party offended had drifted a little aſtern, the others preſerved their place; the offended now united their force, and rowed up to attack the aggreſſors. Theſe being preſſed, flew up the ſides of the ſhip, and were purſued by the others, which made it time for us to interpoſe. Our only reſource was to drive both parties over the ſides of the ſhip, we were then ſwinging round, and it would be vain to expect further ſervice from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants; all hands were, therefore, ordered to quarters, and the Captain directed he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032239_0174_0FF1A02DC51400C8"/>to order them from off the deck, and the ſhip's ſide, or we ſhould fire upon them. They directly made to their boats, but aſſailing each other with knives and other weapons: ſome of them, to eſcape, attempted to get in the cabin windows, where I was ſtationed with two men, I diſcharged a muſket over their heads, which ſcared them ſo that they jumped into the water; their boats were cut adrift, and the tide ſerving, we left them in a warm conflict, wherein ſeveral muſt have been killed.</p>
            <p>We cleared the Capes without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther event worthy of notice, on the 17th June; the wind at S. E. we ſteered a N. N. W. courſe. From thence to the 27th. there was little to note, but the ordinary variations of wind and weather, except the increaſed ſeverity of the diſorder that raged on board; it was an inflammatory fever, attended with ſymptoms of dyſentery in ſome, but moſtly with a violent inflammation and ſwelling of the eyes and eyelids, with a diſcharge of
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032239_0175_0FF1A030B3C3FFB8"/>fetid rheum. The ſlaves were almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly afflicted with this diſorder in the eyes, even more than had been ſeized with the dyſentery. Both diſeaſes ſoon communicated to the crew, and by the 30th. of June, we had ſcarcely men enough to work the ſhip.</p>
            <p>Hitherto by exerciſe and an open air, by keeping conſtantly on deck, refraining as much from ſalt food as poſſible, and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent bathing on board, I had kept myſelf in perfect health, though in conſtant terror, from the frequent deaths of the ſlaves, and the ſickneſs of the crew around me.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt. of July, I found my precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had not availed, and the goodneſs of my conſtitution not ſufficient to ſupport me againſt the prevailing diſeaſe any longer. The fever attacked me, and my eyes ſwelled to ſuch a degree that I could ſcarcely open them, my ſpirits, however, ſtill kept me up, and after the eleventh day I began to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: on the 20th. I could go upon deck,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032239_0176_0FF1A033BB83F640"/>and continued to do ſo, regaining my ſtrength hourly. Early on the morning of the 24th: a veſſel of war hove in ſight, and as we had heard on the coaſt of Africa, that war was expected between the United States and Great Britain, we were much alarmed leſt it ſhould prove a Britiſh man of war.</p>
            <p>The crew were divided in opinion regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhips form, ſome aſſerting that ſhe was not a Britiſh veſſel; I took the glaſs, intending to ſatisfy myſelf and ſettle the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and went forward;—I ſaw that the ſhip carried the Britiſh colours, but alas! I had ſtrained my ſight, and never ſaw more. The inflammation returned, a relapſe took place, and the light of the ſun became to my eyes, as indiſtinct and dark as the gloom of death; the beauties of nature to me were "blotted out for ever," and in my 23d. year, when I looked forward to days of eaſe and comfort, from the reſources of my activity and induſtry—my path is ſhut up, and the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032239_0177_0FF1A036C20011D8"/>world become a blank of indiſtinctneſs and uncertainty.</p>
            <p>A termination of this kind to the voyage, could afford me neither amuſement nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for upon reaching my native country, and returning to my once cheerful home, the reader will eaſily conceive how melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly muſt the impreſſion have been, which my misfortunes had made on my friends and family; and how ſorely I was diſtreſſed by the want of ſight, and its invaluable and conſoling bleſſings.</p>
            <p>But it becomes man to ſubmit to that range of toward or untoward circumſtances, which is the birthright of his being—to perſevere calmly and bear patiently with the changes of fortune, and the ſhocks of black adverſity; If he be fortuate, never let him be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he is placed beyond the reach of affliction,—and he will thus be always wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032239_0178_0FF1A039ADCA7150"/>to act the <hi>man,</hi> and able to ſtem the torrent of misfortune, though equal to that which I now ſuſtain.</p>
