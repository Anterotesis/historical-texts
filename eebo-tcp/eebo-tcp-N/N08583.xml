            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I AM perſuaded, that every one who feels the leaſt regard for the wellfare and happineſs of his country; and the peace and comfort of his fellow-ſubjects and countrymen, will look upon the ſubject as highly proper, and ſeaſonable at this time.</p>
            <p>FOR who can reflect upon ſo many wretched and unthinking men, thus madly attempting to ſubvert the laws of the kingdom; thus inconſiderately involving friends, relations and neighbours, in the moſt direful calamity, and fooliſhly bringing upon themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction here, and damnation hereafter:—who can look upon ſo deplorable a ſeene, without feeling the moſt earneſt deſires, that every ſuch raſh and miſguided perſon could be made duly ſenſible of the dreadful impiety of ſo daring and wicked an action, as well as of the certain miſery that muſt inevitably be the conſequence?</p>
            <p>IT is poſſible this alarming conſideration may prevail with ſome perſons, when every other more laudable motive fails of its proper influence; and, it is to be hoped, that a ſight of their danger may bring them to a ſenſe of their duty.</p>
            <p>WITH this view, I have ſingled out the words of the text for the ſubject of our preſent meditation: And though I have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to think I am ſpeaking before thoſe who ſtand not in need of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010977_0005_0F8530DF26EF9720"/>
the admonition they contain, yet I thought it not improper for us to conſider the ſeveral arguments which enforce this great duty here enjoined; that we may not only be preſerv'd ſtedfaſt in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it ourſelves, but may be able to convince others of the danger, as well as error of their ways; and keep them, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the paths of duty and allegiance, from which they have lately ſo unhappily wandered.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot but obſerve then, in the firſt place, that this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty of ſubjection to lawful authority, is one plain and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal doctrine of chriſtianity. It is here delivered to the world by an inſpired Apoſtle of CHRIST; by <hi>Him,</hi> whom our LORD, in a viſion to <hi>Ananias,</hi> honours with the diſtinguiſhing title of <hi>"a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen veſſel to Himſelf."</hi> He it is, who, thus commiſſioned from above, gives us, in the name of the moſt high GOD, this ſolemn command in the words of the text; to which we are, all of us, both high and low, rich and poor, wiſe and ignorant, indiſpenſably obliged to pay the higheſt reverence and regard; and no rank nor ſtation in life, can poſſibly exempt any one from the ſtricteſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it: For it is directed to all men in general, without any exception—<hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers</hi>—and it comes to us by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the ſame GOD and SAVIOUR, who has given us every other precept that we meet with in holy ſcripture:—It comes to us from that ſovereign LORD OF ALL LORDS, whoſe name we have the honour to bear; whoſe ſubjects we profeſs ourſelves at preſent; and whoſe eternal kingdom we hope to become inheritors of hereafter: 'Till men, therefore, have renounced CHRIST, and apoſtatized from <hi>his</hi> religion—'till they have diſowned <hi>his</hi> ſovereignty and dominion over them, and given up all expectations of future happineſs from his favour, they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves bound, by the ſtrongeſt ties, both of intereſt and gratitude, to comply with this ſacred injunction, no leſs than with every other command of <hi>his Divine Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we may ſtill further judge of the ſingular importance of this duty enjoined us in the text, from that remarkable ſtreſs laid upon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010977_0006_0F8530E027840338"/>
it by the great Apoſtle in ſeveral other of his Epiſtles. When he is delivering his apoſtolical injunctions to <hi>Titus,</hi> and inſtructing him in the ſeveral branches of his duty as a miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he gives it him in charge, in a very ſolemn manner, to put men in mind, to be ſubject to principalities and powers; to obey <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>; to ſpeak evil of <hi>no man</hi>; to be no <hi>brawlers,</hi> but <hi>gentle</hi>; ſhewing all <hi>meekneſs</hi> to <hi>all men.</hi> Theſe things, ſays he, I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, that is, they who have acknowledged the truth of that revelation <hi>he</hi> has made us in the Goſpel, might be careful to maintain good works: Theſe things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
            <p>AND in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he carries this requeſt and reverence for the powers that are lawfully ſet over us, to a ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter height; making it our duty, not only to be ſubject unto them, but to implore the favour of Heaven upon them, and the divine bleſſing on their endeavours for the public happineſs and tranquility. <hi>I exhort firſt of all,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; for this is good, and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JUDGE therefore in yourſelves, my beloved brethren, and beſeech others, in the name of God, to conſider how dreadful a breach of this duty they muſt be guilty of, who, inſtead of praying for the ſafety of our governors and protectors, preſume to threaten their ſacred perſons with violence, to whom God has commanded us to pay the higheſt veneration, becauſe they derive their authority from <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this leads me to a ſecond very material argument, ariſing from the words of the text, which ſtrongly enforces this duty, and to which it becomes every one ſeriouſly to attend: For ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould more fully convince us of our obligation to pay the moſt ready obedience to this precept of chriſtianity, than the ſolemn reaſon which the Apoſtle has immediately ſubjoined: <hi>Let every ſoul
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010977_0007_0F8530E05ADB9470"/>
be ſubject to the higer powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAD this precept been delivered to mankind without pointing out to them at the ſame time, this particularly awful ſanction; yet even then our obſervance of it would have remained indiſpenſible: For when God commands, man is to obey.</p>
            <p>THAT God, from <hi>whom</hi> we have received life and breath, and all things, and to <hi>whom</hi> we are indebted for every comfort and bleſſing we enjoy—that God, upon <hi>whom alone</hi> we are to depend to all eternity, and by <hi>whom</hi> our unalterable fate is to be finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;—this great and adorable BEING has an uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right over <hi>his</hi> dependent creatures, to lay upon them whatever commands <hi>his</hi> wiſdom ſees proper for them, without being obliged to ſatisfy them of the reaſons for ſuch his ſovereign will and pleaſure. But in the caſe before us, you cannot but take notice, in how very different a manner God has been pleaſed to deal with us; for while he gives us this command by his holy Apoſtle, he graciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to inform us of thoſe weighty reaſons upon which the duty is founded, and which would be moſt likely to engage us in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obſervance of it.</p>
            <p>WE are commanded, therefore, <hi>to be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> becauſe the authority they are inveſted with is from HEAVEN: <hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God!</hi>—They are God's vicegerents upon earth, and inſtruments in the hand of his providence, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the grand purpoſes of protection and government, and for ſecuring the peace and happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>AND though, indeed, they are ſometimes unhappily obliged, through the perverſeneſs and wickedneſs that is in the world, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>unwilling</hi> avengers, to execute wrath upon every one that doth evil; yet are they, in general, the miniſters of God to us, for good, and for the praiſe and reward of them that do well.</p>
            <p>WAS it not for this neceſſary power which has been committed to them by the ALMIGHTY, every thing muſt ſoon be involved in the moſt dreadful anarchy and confuſion. Every man's own will
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010977_0008_0F8530E10DAACB68"/>
would then be his law; and no language can fully deſcribe thoſe various ſcenes of miſery and horror which would continually ariſe before us, from the diſcordant paſſions and divided intereſts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But God, in his infinite goodneſs, has provided a natural ſecurity againſt all theſe miſchiefs in thoſe different ranks and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men, which his wiſdom has thought proper ſhould ſubſiſt in the world; and in which ſome are allotted to govern, and others obliged to obey, that ſo the happineſs of the whole community might the more effectually be preſerved. And upon theſe <hi>guardians</hi> of the public and general wellfare, God has been pleaſed to confer a divine authority, to render their perſons, as well as ordinances, the more ſacred and venerable.</p>
            <p>IT is by <hi>him,</hi> therefore, that kings reign, and princes decree juſtice; by <hi>him</hi> princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth: And as it is very beautifully expreſſed in the book of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>power</hi> is given them of the LORD, and <hi>ſovereignty</hi> from the <hi>Higheſt:</hi> To the truth of this important point, we have a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> bearing teſtimony; even our bleſſed Saviour himſelf; <hi>who,</hi> when <hi>Pilate</hi> was boaſting of that power he had over <hi>him,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to crucify or to releaſe <hi>him,</hi> puts him in mind from whence he had received his authority; and gives him this mild and inſtructive anſwer, <hi>Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we learn from the mouth of our <hi>Redeemer himſelf,</hi> whence is derived that dignity and ſacredneſs, which belongs to thoſe who are inveſted with any public power and office.—Here we behold the God of the univerſe ſubmitting to that ſupreme authority <hi>he himſelf</hi> has conferred upon man; and acknowledging the reverence due to that very power, which was ſhortly to pronounce the ſentence of death againſt <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we have a ſtill more ſtriking and remarkable inſtance of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reſpect to the <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> which our bleſſed Lord, upon another occaſion, condeſcended to ſhew, and which highly deſerves every one's ſerious attention and regard: It is recorded by the

Evangeliſt St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the 17th chapter of his Goſpel, that when our Lord was come to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> they who received the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute money, which was required of every Jew above the age of twenty, demanded of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whether his <hi>Maſter</hi> intended to pay it. St. <hi>Peter</hi> very readily engages for his Lord's willing and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compliance; as he well knew how exact had ever been <hi>his</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of every civil, as well as religious duty: But when he came into the houſe to inform his maſter of this demand, our <hi>bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> by an eaſy ſimilitude, leads him to underſtand, that he had been too haſty in his promiſes for <hi>him</hi>; for ſurely, if the children of earthly princes could plead a freedom from paying any cuſtom or tribute, (as appeared by his own reply to the queſtion our Lord had propoſed) much more reaſonably might <hi>he</hi> be exempted from it, who was <hi>himſelf</hi> the <hi>Lord of all things,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>King,</hi> for the ſervice of <hi>whoſe</hi> temple this particular tribute was paid.—But notwithſtanding our Lord might have juſtly claimed this privilege and exemption; yet, you ſee, <hi>he</hi> willingly declines it; and, <hi>Leaſt we ſhould offend them,</hi> ſays <hi>he</hi> to the Apoſtle, <hi>go thou to the ſea, and caſt an hook, and take up the fiſh that firſt cometh up; and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhall find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for me and for thee.</hi>—What condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was this in the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God!</hi>—Who but muſt be ſtruck with admiration at this amazing inſtance of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> in thus vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing to work a miracle, rather than not ſatisfy the demands of public authority; leſt, by refuſing compliance <hi>himſelf,</hi> he might countenance others in diſobedience and rebellion! And who is there that will preſume to offer inſult to the powers that are in authority, or ſhew the leaſt reſiſtance, when he conſiders how remarkably our Lord was pleaſed to honour them, by expreſſing the moſt cautious fear of diſpleaſing them, and thus wonderfully providing againſt giving any offence?—In order, therefore, to guard men from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the guilt of ſo heinous a crime, let us, in the third place, briefly conſider the dreadful conquences that muſt attend it.—This the Apoſtle gives us, in theſe few, but awful words, <hi>They that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010977_0010_0F8530E291579EF8"/>
reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves</hi> DAMNATION; not only condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this <hi>world,</hi> but <hi>eternal vengeance</hi> in the <hi>life</hi> to <hi>come.</hi>—And here again, we cannot but obſerve, the great importance of this duty of ſubjection, from that tender care which the goodneſs of GOD has taken to ſecure our obedience to it. Some precepts are delivered to us without any particular intimation of the puniſhment attending our neglect: But this was a matter of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the general comfort and happineſs of the world, that the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> thought it neceſſary for us, while we read the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred injunction, to have before our eyes that future miſery which muſt follow the violation of it: So that, if the love of God, and reverence for <hi>his</hi> commands, ſhould fail to produce this becoming ſubmiſſion, a regard for our own <hi>Everlaſting Intereſt</hi> might poſſibly prevail.</p>
            <p>GOD has, therefore, been pleaſed, by <hi>his</hi> holy Apoſtle, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence of <hi>inevitable perdition upon all thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſubjection to lawful power and authority</hi>; as hereby, they not only ſhew the higheſt contempt of <hi>his</hi> poſitive command, but do all in their power to obſtruct the gracious deſings of <hi>his</hi> providence, for the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wellfare</hi> of <hi>mankind.</hi> So that, upon calm conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, every one muſt acknowledge, there cannot poſſibly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a greater inſult to <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, than thus contemptuouſly to diſregard <hi>his</hi> will, and diſpiſe thoſe ſacred powers whom <hi>he</hi> has ordained and appointed to carry on the beſt and nobleſt purpoſes in the world: And what wonder then is it that ſo terrible a portion is reſerved in ſtore for every ſuch bold and preſumptuous offender?—GOD is repreſented in ſcripture as the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Lover</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>; and we are, for this reaſon, commanded, in another place, to follow peace with <hi>all men</hi>; becauſe, without this, no man ſhall ſee the LORD. Every one, therefore, ſhall hereafter be baniſhed from <hi>his</hi> preſence and glory who dares to diſturb, in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that peace and harmony; or endeavours, in any reſpect, to deſtroy that good order and government, which it is the intention of HEAVEN ſhould be ſupported in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010977_0011_0F8530E35061C190"/>BUT though we were not able to aſſign any particular reaſon for this ſevere judgment mentioned in the text, yet ought it to be a ſufficient warning to every rebellious ſinner, to find how poſitively it is there denounced: For what God has ſo ſolemnly threatened, <hi>he</hi> will moſt aſſuredly inflict.</p>
            <p>THESE then are the principal reaſons which enforce the duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the Apoſtle; but there are ſeveral others, which, if duly attended to, cannot but add conſiderable weight to the arguments already offered, and which I ſhall, therefore, beg leave briefly to mention.</p>
            <p>LET it be conſidered then, that reſiſtance to that lawful power and authority which God hath ſet over us, can never poſſibly be productive of any thing but the wildeſt uproar, and moſt univerſal confuſion; and, in the end, can never fail of being attended with the moſt ſhocking and diſmal effects.</p>
            <p>OF this we would have ſeen a dreadful and melancholly proof; and God only knows what worſe conſequences might have enſued, had they not been happily prevented by the good conduct of thoſe brave men, who diſtinguiſhed themſelves as remarkably by their HUMANITY, as by the VALOUR, they ſhewed on that trying oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>To their courage and intrepidity will ever be due our warmeſt gratitude and thanks; which, bleſſed be God, gave ſo timely a check to the deſperate fury of thoſe raſh men who were engaged in that execrable attempt; and to their humanity theſe very men muſt ever acknowledge themſelves obliged, which bore ſo long and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently their repeated and exaſperating inſults, and treated them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with greater lenity than they could reaſonably expect; for where one has not fallen, twenty ought to have ſuffered.</p>
            <p>LET every one learn, that outrage and violence can never anſwer any other end but to ſpread ſlaughter and deſolation around us; and to introduce the moſt wretched ſcenes of miſery and diſtreſs: Let them conſider further, how impoſſible it is that any good can ever be brought about by ſuch wicked means; and that tho' ſome
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010977_0012_0F8530E40FBD76F8"/>
may only meet the ruin their raſhneſs has ſought, yet many others muſt unavoidably become partakers in the calamity, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partners in the crime.</p>
            <p>THE conſideration therefore of the preſent misfortunes, in which many of their fellow-creatures muſt be involved, as well as the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſtruction to which others are expoſed by ſuch daring acts of rebellion, will naturally reſtrain every man from uniting in them who has the leaſt ſpark of humanity and compaſſion remaining in his breaſt.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER motive which cannot but have great weight with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generous mind, is the reflection that every the leaſt Inſult offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to magiſtrates and governors, is an act of the baſeſt ingratitude againſt thoſe who are, under god, our protectors and guardians, not only from foreign Enemies, but from every domeſtic foe: To them we owe our ſecurity from all that numerous train of miſchiefs to which we ſhould be daily liable, from the corruption and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the world, if under no reſtraint from human laws, and and unawed by by proper authority!—To them are we indebted for the ſafe and comfortable enjoyment of all the bleſſings of private life, and all the advantages we derive from civil ſociety!—Were there not ſome who would take upon them the arduous buſineſs of public government, the execution of laws, and adminiſtration of juſtice, how would vice and iniquity every where triumph! And what muſt become of the welfare and tranquility of every individual, were men left at full liberty to plan their malicious ſchemes againſt them, and knew they could ſafely execute them whenever they pleaſed? What muſt become of the general peace and happineſs of the whole community, when fraud and injuſtice, oppreſſion and violence, with every other crime that is injurious to ſociety, might be perpetrated with impunity, and without controul? How infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely then are we obliged to thoſe perſons who willingly undertake ſo important a truſt, and by whoſe care, abilities and vigilance, theſe evils are prevented, and the public felicity preſerved? And how very
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010977_0013_0F8530E60BDCBA58"/>
enormous and ſhocking is the offence, when in the diſcharge of their laborious office, they are treated with inſolence inſtead of honour, and meet with threatnings inſtead of thanks!</p>
            <p>BUT laſtly, there is one remark I have further to make, and which ought to have a peculiar force with the people of this land, in leading them chearfully to that ſubjection which is repreſented in the text, as the common duty of all men.—I would beg leave to obſerve therefore, that for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to oppoſe the laws of his country, is an inſtance of the higheſt folly and contradiction we can conceive: For ſuch is the ſingular excellence of our happy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that the laws to which our obedience is required, are, in reality, no other than what we ourſelves have been partly concerned in making.</p>
            <p>ALL men muſt know, that it is impoſſible for a whole province to meet together for this important work; and every one, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will acknowledge, that were they ſo aſſembled, very few would be found capable of carrying it on: For as the wiſe ſon of <hi>Sirac</hi> very juſtly obſerves, <hi>How can he get wiſdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad; that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours; and whoſe talk is of bullocks? They ſhall not be ſought for in the public council; nor ſit high in the congregation; they cannot ſit in the judges ſeat, nor underſtand the ſentence of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Since therefore, we cannot all be preſent in this great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, wherein the weighty buſineſs of public government is tranſacted, we have this peculiar privilege, <hi>and a glorious one it is,</hi> of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch perſons, in whoſe abilities, underſtanding, and integrity, we think we may ſafely confide, to appear for us, in that auguſt aſſembly; and who are, upon that account, very properly ſtiled <hi>our repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN conſequence then of this choice, which we have the liberty to make, and that full power we voluntarily give into their hands; we not only yield our conſent before-hand, to whatever laws they may judge it expedient to enact, but may be juſtly ſaid to have had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010977_0014_0F8530E691B7DF98"/>
a principal ſhare in enacting them ourſelves; inaſmuch as they are framed by their wiſdom, and eſtabliſhed by their authority, whom we have appointed for that very purpoſe.</p>
            <p>So that every man, of the moſt common underſtanding, if he will allow himſelf a moment's reflection, may eaſily ſee how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it is the duty of every one of us, to ſubmit to the laws of his land; and, how aſtoniſhining an abſurdity it muſt appear to all the world, if ever we refuſe that becoming ſubjection.</p>
            <p>How happy would millions think themſelves at this hour, who know no other law than the imperious will of ſome arbitrary prince, could they change ſituations with us, and taſte the ſingular bleſſing we enjoy, in being govern'd by the laws we ourſelves have made! Let us take care, we ſet a due value upon this ineſtimable privilege; leſt, if we ſlight theſe diſtinguiſhing marks of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and diſturb that excellent form of government which his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has ſo long preſerved among us,—<hi>He</hi> may be provoked to deprive us of it, and bring upon us the miſery which ſuch ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would deſerve.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now briefly ſum up what has been ſaid in this diſcourſe, that we may ſee how many, and powerful, are the arguments we are furniſhed with, to engage us in a ſtedfaſt obſervance of this duty, and enable us to convince others of their indiſpenſible obligations to practice it.</p>
            <p>YOU find, then, it is a duty which is guarded from viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by all the moſt ſacred and awful ſanctions that could poſſibly be thought of; and bound upon us, by every tie, civil, moral, and divine.—The peace and tranquility of our fellow-ſubjects and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen demand our obedience to it.—The well-being and happineſs of ſociety in general, and the comfort and felicity of our dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, friends and neighbours in particular, depend upon it; and without our conſcientious performance of it, an univerſal ſcene of confuſion muſt ſoon prevail, and all be involved together in the deepeſt calamity and horror.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010977_0015_0F8530E7443193F0"/>LET all ſuch perſons therefore who dare to think of engaging in any act of rebellion and diſobedience, be intreated to contemplate a little thoſe various and horrible miſeries they will unavoidably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and that may poſſibly deter them from it:—Let them liſten to the cries of the diſconlate widow;—behold the tears of the helpleſs orphan; and conſider, how they will be able to endure the ſad upbraidings of thoſe miſerable mourners, who may juſtly take up againſt them the lamentation of the prophet <hi>Jeremiah: Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? behold, and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto our ſorrow, which your raſhneſs and iniquity have brought upon us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT particularly let them remember, that the blood which may be ſhed by their means, will hereafter be required at their hands; and that every one of thoſe unhappy ſouls who ſhall be brought to an untimely end through their evil counſels and wicked inſtigations, and ſent into another world with all their ſins about them, will riſe up in judgment againſt them at the laſt day, and call for tenfold vengeance on their devoted heads.</p>
            <p>LET them be farther put in mind, that gratitude to thoſe who afford us a peaceful ſecurity from every ill, ſhould engage us in a ſteady adherence to this duty, at all times and upon every occaſion: Should lead us to return obedience for protection, and repay the kind exertion of their abilities and endeavours for the public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with the eaſy tribute of reverence and affection.</p>
            <p>BUT ſome men may have neither humanity nor generoſity enough in their tempers, to be affected by ſuch conſiderations as theſe. To them therefore we muſt open the ſacred page, (which, perhaps, they have never before looked into) and point out the ſolemn and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command of God enforcing this great duty; and tho' they may not regard an earthly potentate, yet ſurely they will ſtand in awe of the MAJESTY of HEAVEN: Or, as holy <hi>Job</hi> emphatically puts the queſtion; <hi>Shall not HIS EXCELLENCY make them afraid? and ſhall not His DREAD fall uopn them?</hi>—Shew them, moreover,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010977_0016_0F8530E7CE8767F8"/>
the foundation upon which the reaſonableneſs of this duty is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Tell them, that obedience to the civil powers is required of us, not only becauſe God has commanded it, but given us alſo this very ſolemn reaſon, enforcing that command;—that they were inſtituted and ordained by Himſelf. When they read therefore, that there is no power but of God, beſeech them ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how deteſtable they muſt render themſelves in His ſight, who, inſtead of ſummitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, (as we are taught by another Apoſtle, is our bounden duty) dare to riſe up themſelves, and compel others to unite with them, in oppoſition to any law that has been legally eſtabliſhed; or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the miniſters of juſtice in the execution of that high office they are obliged by oath to diſcharge, and which has been derived to them from the authority of the <hi>Almighty</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>NOTHING, one would think, could ſo effectually ſtrengthen our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the duty of ſubjection, as this ſingle conſideration, that whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; and that every ſuch wicked and deſperate attempt is not only treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an earthly ſovereign, but rebellion againſt the moſt high God.</p>
            <p>AS a farther motive to this duty, and becauſe example is more prevailing than precept, bid them turn their eyes upon the meek and bleſſed Jeſus, and behold him in that gracious and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act of ſubmiſſion, I mentioned in the former part of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.—Ask them, if they are not ſenſible, that He who could feed five thouſand men with a few loaves and fiſhes, could have ſupported millions with the ſame eaſe, to have protected him from the reſentment of the civil powers, if he had thought fit to have made the leaſt oppoſition? but inſtead of ſhewing reſiſtance, we behold Him here manifeſting the moſt tender concern and regard for the ſupport of their authority; and by that miraculous method he took to pay obedience to it, convincing mankind of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and importance of this great duty.</p>
            <p>SHALL man then preſume to refuſe that ſubmiſſion which God himſelf has thus condeſcended to pay? This aimiable pattern we
<pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:010977_0017_0F8530EAB196EA70"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
have before us in the perſon of our great <hi>Redeemer,</hi> ought to have an irreſiſtable influence upon all who call themſelves by <hi>his</hi> name; and was, no doubt, intended for our imitation by that gracious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who came from HEAVEN with this peculiar deſign, to leave us an example that we might follow his ſteps.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, whereas the more various and powerful the motives are, which enforce any duty, ſo much more aggrevated will be the crime which leads us to break through them: Oh! beſeech them therefore, in the pathetic words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to repent of this their wickedneſs; and pray God, if perhaps the thought of their heart may be forgiven them. This repentance and contrition, if accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with future obedience, may not only procure them pardon at an earthly tribunal, but when they come to ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of CHRIST, will be one means of their obtaining mercy from the Lord in that day, and eſcaping the vengeance which will otherwiſe fall upon them. And this leads me to the laſt motive we have, to enforce their obſervance of this chriſtian duty enjoined in the text; the conſideration of that eternal miſery denounced againſt thoſe who neglect it.</p>
            <p>IF men have no love for their country; if they have no regard for the peace and happineſs of thoſe around them; if they have neither humanity nor compaſſion; neither gratitude nor generoſity in their breaſts; if they have no veneration for their king, nor reverence for the beſt conſtitution in the world; yet they muſt have ſome affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for themſelves: And though they may diſpiſe the commands of GOD, and the example of a SAVIOUR, yet they cannot diſregard their own everlaſting wellfare. This motive then may poſſibly bring them to repentence, and a better mind, when every other has failed of its influence; and let us not omit inceſſantly, and importunately, to urge it upon them.</p>
            <p>WARN them of the certain perdition they muſt inevitably bring upon themſelves; and exhort them to conſider in time, how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the LIVING GOD! Tell them our God is a conſuming fire to ſuch workers of iniquity, and able
<pb n="15"
                   facs="unknown:010977_0018_0F8530EAD4FBBC10"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
to deſtroy both body and ſoul for ever; and bid them therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that though they may eſcape from the ſword of juſtice in this life, they cannot eſcape the DAMNATION OF HELL.</p>
            <p>MAY the good grace of God preſerve us at all times from falling into the like crime, that we may never incur ſo dreadful a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And as we of this land are peculiarly bleſſed at this time with one of the moſt aimiable and excellent Governors that ever adorned a province, who has given us his <hi>promiſe,</hi> that the felicity of his people ſhall ever be his principal care; let it be our perpetual ſtudy and delight, by every means in our power, and particularly by all dutiful ſubmiſſion to <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> whom <hi>he</hi> ſhall ſet over us, to render <hi>his</hi> government as peaceful and happy to our affectionate SOVEREIGN, as he will endeavour to make it to us his grateful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>SO ſhall we ſecure the bleſſings of Heaven on ourſelves and our poſterity; and whenever we are removed out of this troubleſome world, ſhall become members of that bleſſed kingdom, where uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace and love, and uninterrupted concord and harmony, will reign for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
