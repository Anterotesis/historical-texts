            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the follwing Diſcourſe may probably fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of Some, not acquainted with the ſpecial Occaſion, on which it was preached; 'tis apprehended the following brief Account may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. The joyful News of the Repeal of the <hi>Stamp Act,</hi> arriving while the General Aſſembly were ſitting in this Town, they thought fit to direct that the two Military Companies in the Town, ſhould be raiſed, and the Cannon fired, &amp;c. at the public Expence. In Purſuance of this Order, on the <hi>23</hi>d of May, a large Quantity of Powder was removed from the Colony's Store, into the New-Brick School-Houſe, to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the Soldiers and uſed for other Purpoſes, on this Joyful Occaſion. A Number of Young Gentlemen meet in the Chamber of the Houſe over the Room where the Powder was depoſited, to prepare Sky-Rockets, &amp;c. to be played off in the Evening. In delivering out the Powder to the Soldiery, a conſiderable Quantity was ſcattered on the Ground round about the Houſe: This being obſerved by ſome Children at play, they careleſsly put Fire to the ſcattered Powder, which communicated itſelf to that within the Houſe, inſtantly blew it up, and buried about Thirty Perſons in its Ruins. Thus did GOD in a Moment turn our Rejoicing into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our Merriment into Lamentation and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row——When this Exploſion firſt happened, every One expected that all Thoſe within the Houſe, at leaſt, were gone to the Place of Silence; but GOD was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to us than our Fears; they were all taken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile, and ſave Six, who are ſince dead, <note n="†" place="bottom">

Doct.</hi> Nathaniel Ledyard, <hi>Meſs'rs</hi> William Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, Levi Jones, John Knowles, Richard Lord, Richard Burham.</note> in a great Meaſure recovered. In the Midſt of this ſore Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the Goodneſs of God was very remarkably ſeen in ſundry Inſtances—One of the Military Companies had but juſt left the Houſe, before the Exploſion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; a conſiderable Number of Children were ſent away, almoſt that very Inſtant, by ſome Gentlemen who had the Conduct of the Affair. As I am told, had this Exploſion happened almoſt at any other Time of the Day, between Nine in the Morning, and Five in the Afternoon, much greater Numbers would have been expoſed. Both the Miniſters in the Town being by Sickneſs confined from public Service, the worthy Author, then on a Journey, was prevailed with to tarry over the Sabbath, to aſſiſt in our Diſtreſſes, and to ſupply the Pulpit. The following Diſcourſe, then delivered, is now made public, at the Deſire of the Hearers. And I take this Opportunity to return him my ſincereſt Thanks, for his great Humanity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this People in that Time of ſore Viſitation, when I was providentially hindred from being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them myſelf: Alſo to expreſs my moſt earneſt Wiſhes, that his Labour of Love might be rewarded. And that the following Diſcourſe may be ſanctified, for the beſt Good of this People, for whoſe Benefit it was more immediately intended.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010282_0004_0F7E711FA0828668"/>PROVIDENTIALLY with you, at a ſhort Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in all the Confuſion and Conſternation of ſuch a Diſaſter, I mean to aſk your Candor for much Inchoherence; and intreat the Auditory to accept the ſincere Deſires of a Stranger, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to aſſiſt your Minds upon this ſad Occaſion.</p>
            <p>LET me attempt a brief Explanation of the Words before us, to ſhorten the Work, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enſuing Diſcourſe more eaſy to the Mind.</p>
            <p>CUSTOM determined the eaſtern Nations to the Uſe of long Garments, very unhandy for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and to the Uſe of the Girdle, wherewith they girded up their Garments enwrapped about their Loins, that they might not be entangled with them; but as much as poſſible, conſiſtent with ſuch Dreſs, be unincumbered, and ready for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.—Thus our SAVIOUR uſeth the Phraſe more than once, <note n="a" place="bottom">Luke 17, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Make ready, wherewith I may ſup, and gird thyſelf, and ſerve me.</hi>—<note n="b" place="bottom">John 21, 18.</note> 
               <hi>And another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldſt not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TWAS alſo a Cuſtom among the Jews to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their Nuptials by Night; and 'tis common for our SAVIOUR to repreſent Death, the final Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of our probation State, by the coming of the Bridegroom. Theſe Words are an Alluſion to thoſe eaſtern Cuſtoms, pregnant with Inſtruction to them that live in the Belief of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Here then I would,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Endeavour to ſhow what we may underſtand by this Command: <hi>Let your Loins be girded about.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That this, and this only, will prepare us for the immediate Summons of Death.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHAT we are to underſtand by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: <hi>Let your Loins be girded about.</hi> As it was the Garment, ſomething neceſſary for us in this fallen State; ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is a plain Command, not indeed to throw off all Concerns and worldly Incumbrance; no, not even that which Cuſtom and Ornament may dictate; but 'tis a Direction to put our near, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, worldly Concerns in ſuch a Poſition, as ſhall leaſt hinder and embarraſs us in our LORD's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. We muſt have Food and Raiment, and conſequently Care in providing, and ſome little Time, at leaſt, in uſing them. What our LORD would, is, that we ſhould not ſuffer theſe, which are deſigned for the Comfort of the outward Man, deſigned to help us forward in the Way; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to perplex, confound, hinder, or embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs us in our chriſtian Warfare, our faithful Service —let them not hang upon us like dead Weights, nor drag after us, to hinder our Advance, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our Feet. Many the Snares, many the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements, from outward Things, unleſs they are kept in proper Decorum, and wiſe Arrangement, by human Prudence, and Direction of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, all-wiſe GOD.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides all Embarraſment from outward Things, 'tis a Direction to us, to have and hold our Minds, free for Service, ſo unincumbred with the Cares of worldly Things, Plans, Purſuits, Engagements, or Enjoyments, that we can any Moment, calmly advert to Death, look forward to the Grave, and view the final Judgment, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet, the Books opened, the Judge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the Award juſt ready to be given, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Deeds done in the Body.—<hi>Gird up the Loins of your Minds,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1, 13.</note> &amp;c.

               <p>Were your departed Friends, Acquaintance, and Companions, to addreſs you from the World of Spirits, could it be more nervous, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, than what naturally ariſes, from this ſad Providence, and theſe Words of our Text? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, you that are ſpared, behold the Ruins of that Houſe, where we have aſſociated, where we have had Mirth and Gladneſs, as well as Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, blaſted in a Moment; made a Kind of a Grave to us in an Inſtant, before we had Time for Reflection; aſk them who ſurvive, whether they had known the Cauſe of Death, had they been cut off with that Blaſt. <hi>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like unto Men that wait for the Lord.</hi> Was it a Day appointed for Rejoicing, and who tho't what a Day, what a Moment would bring forth. Boaſt not in your Mirth, boaſt not of To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, boaſt not of a Moment. Young Men, we exhort you to be ſober-minded; let your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be known to all Men: The LORD is at Hand. Improve your Time, in trimming your Lamps, that your Lights may burn. See how inſtantly, how immediately the Bridegroom came to us, and left us little if any Time to gird our

                  <note n="r" place="bottom">Rom. v. 2.</note> To you, young Friends, the Voice of Providence is loud, <hi>be ye alſo ready.</hi> Let not this Viſitation paſs over, without engaging a few at leaſt, to put on the Wedding Garment, if this Providence will not arouſe your Minds, if this Opportunity be neglected by you, when the Eye affects the Heart, when Death is all around you, when dying Groans are in many Houſes, what do you expect, in Nature or Providence, will ever awaken you! Cry then to GOD, cry mightily to him, to aſſiſt in lighting up your Lamps, to draw you with his loving Kindneſs, inſtruct you with his Word, Spirit, and Providence, that Iniquity may not prove your Ruin. And may GOD grant in Mercy, that this Diſpenſation, which proves natural Death to ſome, may be a Means of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life to others, yea, as Life from the Dead to your Souls.</p>

May the Goodneſs of GOD to us ward, lead us to Repentance: We have our Space lengthened out, and if we do not improve it, to gird up our Loins, ſeek Light, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep it burning: we may well fear, that GOD will quickly ſay of us, <hi>Cut them down, why cumber they the Ground.</hi>
