            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> now read in your Audience, we have ſet forth one principal and important Branch of the miniſterial Office, and the grand Scope and Deſign of it. What he here affirms, with Reſpect to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters of the Goſpel, is incumbent upon all who are ſolemnly ſet apart, according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment, to the Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry. For whatever Diſtinction there may be between the Office of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and that of an <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> in the chriſtian Church, their Work, with Reſpect to Preaching, is the ſame, as to the Subject-Matter, compleat Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and true Scope and End of it: So that the Apoſtles, and firſt Miniſters of Chriſt, were, in this Point, Enſamples to all their Succeſſors in the miniſterial Office; and it is now, as much
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009394_0005_0F7345E616A5A738"/>
as ever it was, the ſpecial Duty of thoſe, who are put in Truſt with the Goſpel, to <hi>preach CHRIST, warning every Man, and teaching eve-Man, in all Wiſdom; that they may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, in diſcourſing upon theſe Words, I ſhall, without any critical Remarks upon them, immediately apply myſelf to the Conſideration of the ſeveral Things, clearly held forth in them, touching the Duty of Goſpel-Miniſters, viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>That they ſhould preach Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>That they ſhould do this in a clear, full and perſuaſive Manner,</hi> "warning every Man, and teaching every Man in all Wiſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</item>
               <item>III. <hi>That their principal View and governing Aim herein ſhould be,</hi> "that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus."</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſay then,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That Goſpel-Miniſters ſhould preach Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpend Time to prove what is here ſuppoſed, viz. That Preaching is a principal and important Part of the Work of Goſpel-Miniſters. The Characters by which they are deſcribed— the Duties injoined upon and Directions given to them in holy Scripture—and the Examples of the firſt Miniſters of the chriſtian Church, imply and ſhew this to be a Duty ſpecially incumbent on them,—a Buſineſs belonging to them, ſo as it does not to others, who are not intruſted with the ſame Office. But the main Point here to be conſidered is, What they ſhould make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Matter, the grand Theme of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009394_0006_0F7345E96DEFA4C0"/>
And this is JESUS CHRIST. Chriſt is, by Way of Eminency, the great Subject of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Revelation, and Goſpel-Miniſters, in their Preaching, ſhould have a ſpecial Reference and Regard to him; not meerly glance at, but point directly to him, ſo as to diſpenſe and <hi>make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Savour of the Knowledge of him,</hi> and lead Men to a thorough, and, if poſſible, to a ſaving Acquaintance with him. As they are Chriſt's Miniſters by Office, ſo they ſhould preach Chriſt, as he is revealed and ſet forth in the Goſpel, as they would faithfully diſcharge their ſacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and anſwer the true End and Deſign of it. So did the Apoſtles of Chriſt, notwithſtanding the great Oppoſition and Ill-Treatment they met with for it. Acts V. 42. <hi>Daily in the Temple, and in the Houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and to preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Phraſe of <hi>Preaching Chriſt</hi> is ſeveral Times uſed in the New-Teſtament: And it is with a particular and immediate Reference to him, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the Text—<hi>Whom we preach.</hi> Now to preach Chriſt, as the Apoſtles did, and every one of his Miniſters ought to do, is to preach the Doctrine or Goſpel of Chriſt; <hi>even the Myſtery</hi> (as it is expreſſed ver. 26.) <hi>which hath been hid from Ages and from Generations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints.</hi> It is not barely inſiſting upon, or frequently mentioning the Name of Chriſt, but preaching <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus;</hi> declaring the whole Counſel of God to Mankind revealed by Chriſt; always, in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009394_0007_0F7345EA33CFAFE8"/>
Courſe of their Miniſtry, making the peculiar Doctrines of the Goſpel, which immediately concern the Kingdom of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the principal Topics of Diſcourſe; and <hi>teaching Men to obſerve all Things whatſoever he hath commanded;</hi> explaining and urging the Precepts of Chriſtianity in a Manner agreable to the Nature, Spirit, and Genius of it.</p>
            <p>More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To preach Chriſt is to preach the perſonal Dignity of Chriſt:</hi> To ſet him forth, in a ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, both in his <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>human</hi> Nature, as <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> This is one of thoſe Myſteries of Godlineſs, which, however inconceivable by us, is expreſsly revealed in the Goſpel, and to be preached by the Miniſters of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt's Perſon is to be taught and maintained againſt thoſe who deny it. He is to be preached, <hi>that he is the Son of God:</hi> yea, <hi>the only begotten Son of God</hi> by Way of Eminence and Diſtinction; not only fully reſembling, but alſo partaking of the Nature and Perfections of the Deity, <hi>being the Brightneſs of his Father's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon:</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 1.3.</note> Who <hi>was in the Beginning with God, and was God,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Joh. 1.1.</note> poſſeſſed of divine Excellencies, <hi>the Image of the inviſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> or before all Creatures, and <hi>by whom all Things, both in Heaven and in Earth, were created, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Cont: Ver. 15, 16, 17.</note> and to whom divine Titles are given, and divine Attributes and Works are aſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009394_0008_0F7345EB0E8EE208"/>He is likewiſe to be repreſented in his <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and preached, that he is <hi>the Son of Man</hi> — that he became incarnate, or <hi>was made Fleſh and dwelt among Men</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. 1.14.</note>—aſſumed the human Nature, and <hi>was made in all Things like unto his Brethren,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 2.17.</note> whom he came to redeem and ſave—a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and righteous Perſon, who, altho' he really partook of the eſſential Properties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, was yet, by his extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Birth, exempt from human Sin and Guilt, and was ever perfectly <hi>holy, harmleſs, and undefiled</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 7.26.</note> — one who was <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt without Meaſure,</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John 3.34. Col. 2.9.</note> and <hi>in whom dwelt the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> ‖</p>
            <p>And it is of no ſmall Importance that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt ſhould preach up his perſonal Dignity and Excellency; not only to lead Men to juſt and worthy Conceptions of him, but alſo to convince them of his Suitableneſs and Ability to ſave them, and to ſhow what ſolid Ground there is to hope and truſt in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To preach Chriſt is to preach him in his Office-Character and Work, as the only Mediator between God and Man, and the Saviour of loſt, guilty and periſhing Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Goſpel contains the glad Tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to fallen Men by Jeſus Chriſt, and in it we have the cleareſt and fulleſt Diſcovery hereof. Yea, it is the ſpecial Buſineſs, and peculiar Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of the Goſpel, to unfold this great Myſtery of ſinful Man's Redemption by Chriſt. Herein
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009394_0009_0F7345EB58A5C4C8"/>
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is repreſented, not only in his perſonal Character and Dignity, as <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Fleſh,</hi> but alſo as being appointed and ſent of God, to mediate between himſelf and us, to effect a Reconciliation, and procure eternal Redemption and Salvation for us; and, as acting in this noble and exalted Character, performing the Buſineſs of a Mediator and Saviour for us. And ſurely this, which is ſo much the Buſineſs and Drift of the Goſpel, ſhould be made the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Scope of Miniſters Preaching, to whom the Diſpenſation of it is committed. Nor can they be ſaid truly and fully to preach Chriſt, and to anſwer the ſpecial Buſineſs and Deſign of their Office, if they wholly, or in a great Meaſure, neglect to treat of thoſe peculiar and important Doctrines of the chriſtian Revelation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Chriſt's Office-Character and Work.</p>
            <p>They ſhould not only treat of the human A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and Guilt, which is ſuppoſed in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Goſpel, and upon which it is grounded, and labour, by the Precepts and Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Law, to convince Men of their Sins and Obnoxiouſneſs to God's eternal Wrath and Curſe, and of their own Inability to obtain Righteouſneſs, Juſtification and Life by the Deeds of the Law, and conſequently of their abſolute Need of a Saviour; but alſo be eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful to point out the glorious Remedy which divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and <hi>teſtify that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.14.</p>

upon the plainer Truths and Duties of Religion, they ſhould be concerned to uſe Uncorruptneſs, <hi>Gravity, Sincerity, and ſound Speech, that cannot be condemned;</hi> ſetting them forth, not altogether in the Dreſs of human Wiſdom and Oratory, and the Flouriſhes of Rhetorick; but repreſenting them in their own true, naked, and ſcriptural Light, that they may come with their native Force, and make a more deep and laſting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Hearts and Conſciences of their Hearers.</p>

            <p>I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That their principal View and governing Aim herein ſhould be,</hi> "That they may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus." <hi>For in him</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 2.9, 10.) <hi>dwelleth all the Fulneſs of the God-head bodily. And ye are compleat in him, which is the Head of all Principality and Power.</hi> To be compleat in Chriſt may ſignify both our being compleatly juſtified through his perfect Righteouſneſs and Atonement, and alſo our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed and ſanctified by his Spirit, and ſo

formed to his Image and Likeneſs, and gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built up in a Conformity to him, in all chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Graces and Virtues, unto final and compleat Glory and Bleſſedneſs in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But this Expreſſion of being <hi>perfect,</hi> as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Saints in Scripture, has, I think, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reference to their internal Sanctification, their moral Character, or that holy Temper and Life they are of: In which Reſpect, indeed, it can be ſtrictly affirmed of none, that they are <hi>perfect</hi> in this Life; yet, in a qualified and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Senſe, they may be ſaid to be more or leſs <hi>ſo,</hi> according to the Progreſs and Attainments they make in chriſtian Knowledge, Grace, and Holineſs, and thoſe Virtues of Mind and Life, which reſemble them to God and Chriſt, and in which the true Dignity, Happineſs and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Nature conſiſt. And ſo, to preſent Men perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, may imply, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſimply, winning or eſpouſing them to him, by a cordial Faith in and Subjection to him, as their Lord and Saviour, but alſo training them up in the Knowledge of Chriſt, and a growing Conformity unto him in all chriſtian Graces and Virtues, that they may be <hi>meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> and finally <hi>preſented, without Spot or Wrinkle, before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the grand Deſign of the Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Eph. 4.11, &amp;c. <hi>He gave ſome, Apoſtles: and ſome, Prophets: and ſome, Evangeliſts: and ſome, Paſtors and Teachers; for the perfecting of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009394_0022_0F7345FB05FD4F58"/>
the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt: Till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt: That we henceforth be no more Children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lie in Wait to deceive: But ſpeaking Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all Things, which is the Head, even Chriſt.</hi> And this is what the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould aim at, and make the grand Scope and End of their Preaching.— Love to Chriſt, and a compaſſionate Concern for the Welfare and Salvation of precious Souls, ſhould be the animating Principle and Motive in the Whole of their miniſterial Work. Whatever other ſubordinate Views they may lawfully have, their principal and governing Aim ſhould be, to win Souls to Chriſt, and to preſent them perfect in him. With this View and Deſign ſhould they engage, and conſtantly proceed in their great Work; <hi>preaching Chriſt, not out of Envy, but of good Will;</hi> not ſeeking for themſelves, as their ultimate End, ſecular Honors and Profits, but the Honor of Chriſt, the Advancement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the ſpiritual Profit of the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Care, that they may be ſaved; <hi>travailing,</hi> as it were, <hi>in Birth,</hi> by earneſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Prayer, <hi>for them, that Chriſt may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them;</hi> labouring to <hi>build them up in all Things,</hi> and to <hi>perfect that which is lacking in their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009394_0023_0F7345FB169F2EF8"/>
Faith</hi> and Obedience; affectionately warning and admoniſhing, counſelling and exhorting, comforting and charging them, and <hi>becoming all Things to all Men,</hi> as far as is allowable, <hi>that by all Means they may ſave</hi> their Souls.</p>
            <p>Not that the moſt faithful Preaching is always attended with deſired Succeſs: So far from it, that the wiſeſt and beſt Miniſters often have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to complain and ſay, <hi>We have laboured in vain, and ſpent our Strength for Nought,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to many, if not the Bulk of their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But notwithſtanding all Diſcouragements of this Nature, they ſhould proceed in the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and faithful Diſcharge of their Duty; as knowing that <hi>their Judgment is ſurely with the Lord, and their Work with their God: and though Iſrael be not gathered, yet they ſhall be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord, and their God ſhall be their Strength;</hi> and that whether many, or few, are ſaved by their Miniſtry, yet, if they are faithful in the Diſcharge of it, they ſhall deliver their own Souls, and their Labour ſhall be accepted in the Lord, and meet a divine and everlaſting Reward.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe we have been upon ſuggeſts ſeveral uſeful and important Reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How illuſtrious is the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs in the Inſtitution of the Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry?</p>
            <p>The Goſpel is, by Way of Eminence, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Grace, and the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs are illuſtriouſly diſplayed, in the Whole,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009394_0024_0F7345FEC860F178"/>
and in the ſeveral Parts and Branches of it. The Goſpel-Miniſtry, in particular, is a wiſe and gracious Inſtitution, and ſheweth the tender and faithful Care of Chriſt toward his Church, in providing ſo well for its ſpiritual Inſtruction and Support, Edification and Comfort. It was one of the great Bleſſings which God promiſed to his People of old, <hi>I will give you Paſtors according to mine Heart, which ſhall feed you with Knowledge and Underſtanding.</hi> Jer. 3.15. And Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are to be acknowleged, with all Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as precious Gifts of our aſcended Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; beſtowed for moſt important Uſes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Purpoſes, even for the Propagation and Defence of Religion, for teaching, explaining, and inculcating the great Truths and Duties of it, and perfecting Men in the Knowledge and Practice of them. And however the Preaching of Chriſt by weak and frail Men, may, by ſome, be accounted Fooliſhneſs, and treated with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; yet the Wiſdom, Power, and Grace of God are clearly manifeſted, in pitching upon, and making Uſe of ſuch Means for effecting the Salvation of them that believe. And very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous is the Care of divine Providence, in continuing the Goſpel-Miniſtry in the Church, and in raiſing up a Succeſſion of Men in every Age and Place of it, whom he is pleaſed to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify for, and to employ in this ſacred and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Office, and in ſucceeding their faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Miniſtrations, for ſaving Good to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009394_0025_0F7345FF9FE7D4D8"/>2. What hath been diſcourſed ſheweth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Dignity, Importance, and Difficulty of the miniſterial Office.</p>
            <p>Mean and contemptible as this may appear in the Eyes of ſome, it is an Office of high Dignity, and a great Honor to be employed in it. The <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf, who ſurpaſſes the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven in Dignity, and is far more excellent and glorious than they, was a <hi>Teacher ſent from God,</hi> anointed to <hi>preach the Goſpel to the Poor</hi>—to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <hi>the acceptable Year of the Lord:</hi> And Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters are his Servants by Office, his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, authorized and ſent by him, to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in his Name and Stead, and to manage in the Affairs of his ſpiritual Kingdom. The Embaſſy they are charged with is of the nobleſt Kind, and greateſt Importance: They are ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Meſſages of Grace and Salvation to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, and to perſuade them, through him, to be reconciled unto God. And thoſe, upon whom Chriſt conferreth this diſtinguiſhing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, are to be <hi>eſteemed very highly for their Work's Sake:</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.13. They are to be received with Gratitude and Joy, and treated with a hearty and welcome Reſpect; ſuitable to the Dignity and Importance of their Office. <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things.</hi> Rom. 10.15.</p>
            <p>And the Importance of the miniſterial Office beareth Proportion to the Dignity of it. They, who are called to it, have aſſigned them a Work
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009394_0026_0F73460066BDF418"/>
of a moſt intereſting Nature, and of the greateſt Concernment both to themſelves and others: They have the Care of precious and immortal Souls committed unto them, for which they are to <hi>watch, as they that muſt give an Account:</hi>—They are intruſted with <hi>the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> which they are intimately concerned, as far as in them lies, to preſerve pure and entire, and with Fidelity and Prudence to diſpenſe unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: —That Goſpel, the Preaching of which is attended with the moſt awful Conſequences to them, to whom it is diſpenſed: To ſome it proves a <hi>Savour of Life unto Life;</hi> but unto O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death;</hi> according to the different Reception it meets with from, and the different Effects, which, in Conſequence thereof, it hath upon them. A Buſineſs this, O! how weighty, ſolemn, and important! The Thought hereof, joined with a proper Senſe of their own Inſufficiency for it, may well check the Forwardneſs, and Preſumption, of thoſe, who are eager to run before they are ſent, and influence thoſe who are regularly called unto it, to undertake it with pious Fear and Trembling.</p>
            <p>And the Difficulties, attending this honorable and important Work, are very great: They are beſt known to thoſe who have had moſt and longeſt Experience of them. Beſides the Study and Labour, Prayerfulneſs and Vigilance, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the due Performance of it; the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſcouragements, that are commonly to be met with in it, from the Ignorance and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009394_0027_0F7346012073FBC0"/>
Corruptions, the Prejudices and Luſts of Men; and the Unkindneſs and Ill-uſage occaſioned thereby, render it peculiarly difficult: And it requires no ſmall Degree of Wiſdom and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Fortitude and Patience, to diſcharge it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſo as to be <hi>pure from the Blood of all Men,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 20.26.</note> and <hi>unto God a ſweet Savour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They who engage in the Work of the Miniſtry, or are introduced into it, ſhould be, in ſome good Meaſure, qualified for it.</p>
            <p>It is not every one, that is furniſhed for, or fit to be employed in the Work of the Miniſtry. This is a Buſineſs too great, difficult, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be ſafely committed to, or well managed by, weak, unſkilful, and wicked Hands. They who enter upon, and are ſet apart to this ſacred Employment, ſhould be Men of good Parts and Learning, ſincere Piety, and univerſal Integrity and Virtue; <hi>holding Faith, and a good Conſcience.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.19.</note> They, whoſe ſpecial Buſineſs it is to <hi>preach Chriſt</hi> unto others, ought to be well acquainted with him themſelves, and have his Glory, the Intereſt of his Kingdom, and the Good of precious Souls at Heart.</p>
            <p>They ſhould have a good Underſtanding, a competent Knowledge of thoſe important Truths of Chriſtianity, which they are to teach and inculcate. In this Reſpect, they ſhould be as <hi>Scribes ready inſtructed to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> —as good <hi>Houſeholders,</hi> who from that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009394_0028_0F734601DD7703B8"/>
Fund of chriſtian Knowledge, which they have acquired by Study and Experience, are able to <hi>bring forth Things new and old</hi>—ſkilful to <hi>divide the Word of Truth aright,</hi> and to <hi>give to every one his Portion in due Seaſon;</hi> ſo as to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, and to the Conſciences of their Hearers, <hi>Workmen, that have no need to be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſhould have that ſupreme Love to Chriſt, and affectionate Concern for the Souls of Men, predominant in them, which will cauſe them to love their Work, to engage in it with Delight, and to perform it with becoming Fervour and Diligence, and enable them to ſurmount the Difficulties and Diſcouragements that lie in the Way.</p>
            <p>And they ſhould be Men of ſuch blameleſs Behaviour, and <hi>good Converſation in Chriſt,</hi> as to adorn their <hi>chriſtian</hi> and <hi>miniſterial</hi> Character, and, by the Influence of their Example, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and enforce the holy Religion of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which it is their Duty, in all ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ways, to promote.</p>
            <p>Perſons of this Stamp and Character only are duly qualified for the Office of the Evangelical Miniſtry: Nor ſhould any but thoſe, who are viſibly, and in the Judgment of Charity ſuch, ever be introduced into, and dignified with it. The Want of theſe Qualifications renders Perſons utterly unfit for it, and uncapable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a right and acceptable Manner. And it is doing great Injury to Religion, and to the miniſterial Character and Office, to put ignorant,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009394_0029_0F734602D3895BA8"/>
or vicious Men into it: Such, I mean, as are apparently ſo; whoſe weak Heads, and woful Ignorance, render them uncapable of inſtructing others in the important Principles and Duties of Chriſtianity; or, whoſe ambitious and worldly Views lead them to <hi>ſeek their own Things, and not the Things which are Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s; or, whoſe corrupt Hearts and perverſe Diſpoſitions prompt them to corrupt the Word of God, and ſpeak Things which they ought not, to the ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hearers; or, whoſe immoral Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is a Scandal and Reproach to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and hath a direct Tendency to defeat the glorious Deſign of it, and to obſtruct the Influence and Efficacy of the moſt pertinent and wholſome Inſtructions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may infer from the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the diſtinguiſhing Privilege, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Obligations of a People, who ſtatedly enjoy the Goſpel-Miniſtry and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>As the Goſpel-Miniſtry is a moſt wiſe and gracious Inſtitution of Heaven, and deſigned for the greateſt Good to Men; ſo they who ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly enjoy it, are greatly privileged and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged above others. Happy, in this Reſpect, is that People, to whom Chriſt is preached, by thoſe who are qualified for, and appointed to this Buſineſs—Happy is the Church and People of God in this Land, who, from the earlieſt Days of our Fathers to this preſent Time, have enjoyed the Goſpel in ſo great Purity, and been favoured with a Succeſſion of able and faithful
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009394_0030_0F7346035CC789D8"/>
Miniſters, that have gone forth into the ſeveral Parts of it, and been ſtatedly employed in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching Chriſt to their reſpective Charges, with a View to inſtruct, eſtabliſh, and perfect them in the Principles, and Practice of his holy Religion. This is, with all Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to be eſteemed a great and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Privilege, as, by Means hereof, a People are put under the beſt Advantages for knowing the Things of their everlaſting Peace, and ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſpiritual and ſaving Bleſſings. And great are the Obligations lying on ſuch a People diligently to improve the Privileges they enjoy to the good Ends for which they are granted, and to <hi>walk worthy</hi> of them <hi>unto all well-pleaſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It greatly concerneth them, in particular, to receive, and treat with a cordial Affection and Reſpect, thoſe who are ſent to them in Chriſt's Name, with the important Meſſages of Grace and Salvation—to reverence them as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Chriſt—to <hi>eſteem them very highly in Love for their Work's Sake</hi>—and to do what in them lies to encourage and ſtrengthen them in it, by ſhewing an affectionate Regard to them, liberally ſupporting them, and, above all, by their friendly Counſels, fervent Prayers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and profitable Attendance on their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. If it be the Duty of Miniſters to preach Chriſt, it is the Duty of thoſe, to whom he is preached, to receive with Faith and Love the important <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: Without this, the preached Goſpel will have no ſaving Efficacy upon them:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009394_0031_0F73460419F6F518"/>
It is only to them that believe and obey the Goſpel, that it becomes effectual to Salvation. 'Tis not in the Power of the moſt ſkilful, holy, and zealous Preacher to impreſs the Truths, which he delivers, in a ſaving Manner upon his Hearers. <hi>Paul</hi> may <hi>plant,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> may <hi>water, but</hi> it is <hi>God</hi> only, by the Energy of his Spirit, <hi>that giveth the Increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And happy is it when the preached Goſpel reaches its true End, and hath its deſigned Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the Hearts of thoſe that hear it. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the Miniſtry affords abundant Support and Conſolation under the Burdens and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it. 1 Theſſ. 3.7, 8. <hi>Therefore, Brethren, we were comforted over you, in all our Affliction and Diſtreſs, by our Faith: For now we live, if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord.</hi> It gives a moſt delicate and ſenſible Pleaſure and Joy to faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to reap this Fruit of their Labours.—To ſee thoſe, for whoſe eternal Welfare they are deeply concerned, ſenſibly touched with the important and very intereſting Truths, which they preach to them, earneſtly concerned about the Salvation of their own Souls, ſollicitous to learn, and ready to obey the Truth in Chriſt, and with all Humility embracing the Offers and Tenders of a compaſſionate Saviour, an all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Redeemer, and to behold the Foundation Principles of Religion hereby laid, and fixed deep in their Hearts, branching out in all the excellent Graces and manly Virtues of the chriſtian Temper and Life, and growing up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009394_0032_0F73460505C510E8"/>And nothing certainly can be of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Perſons themſelves, who are thus wrought upon by the Miniſtry of the Word: For ſuch are intitled to the important Bleſſings of the new and everlaſting Covenant: They are reſtored to the Image, Favour and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and ſhall have ſolid Peace and Comfort, Hope and Joy in this Life, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be <hi>preſented perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> before the Preſence of God's Glory with exceeding Joy.</p>
            <p>But ſad and awful, beyond Expreſſion, is the Caſe of thoſe, who deſpiſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, and reject the Word of the Lord ſpoken by them, and, after all the good Inſtructions and faithful Warnings given them, remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent: Such remain under Guilt and Condemnation, lie open to, and ſhall inherit the tremendous Curſes denounced in the Goſpel againſt unbelieving and diſobedient Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: They are ever ſubject to the Terrors of Guilt here, and ſhall hereafter be doomed, in righteous Judgment to the everlaſting Torments of Hell: And thoſe Means of Grace, which were deſigned, and ought to have been improved by them to prevent their future Ruin, will ſerve, through their wicked Abuſe of them, to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Sin and Guilt; and ſink them the deeper into the Abyſs of eternal Wo and Miſery.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>my Fathers and Brethren,</hi> Let theſe imperfect Hints ſerve to remind us, whom it hath pleaſed God to put into the Miniſtry, of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009394_0033_0F7346080522C220"/>
the important Buſineſs of our Office, and the ſolemn Bonds we are under to the faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it. The Work aſſigned us is moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and honourable, important and difficult. A principal Part of it is to <hi>preach Chriſt,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the People of our reſpective Charge; <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Man, and teaching every Man in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that we may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> To ſet him forth in a ſcriptural Light, in his perſonal Dignity, divine Miſſion, mediatorial Characters, Offices, and Works, and the unſearchable Riches of his Grace, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits —to explain the Doctrines and Duties of Religion, as taught by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles —to ſhew the Truth and Importance of them— and to perſuade, if poſſible, our Hearers to the ſincere Belief, and uniform Practice of them, by the moſt powerful Arguments and Motives which the Goſpel, and Reaſon, furniſh us with. And although ye know theſe Things, yet it is meet, ſo long as we are continued in this Office, to be put in Mind of, and frequently to reflect upon them; the more to affect and impreſs our Minds with them, and to excite us, in a humble Dependance on divine Grace and Help, to the vigorous and faithful Diſcharge of the Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us, and ſo to <hi>take Heed to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which we have received of the Lord Jeſus, to fulfil it;</hi> as that <hi>we may ſave our own Souls, and the Souls of them that hear us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay unto you, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> whom we are now aſſembled ſolemnly to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009394_0034_0F734608B97CFEC8"/>
and ſet apart to the Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry in this Place? <hi>It is a faithful Saying, If any Man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, he deſireth a good Work.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3 1.</note> This is the Office, in the ſcriptural Senſe, which you deſire to be inveſted in. And it is with Pleaſure, that I ſee you this Day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating yourſelf to the Service of Chriſt in this good and excellent Work, for which, I hope, he hath in ſome good Meaſure qualified you; yet I cannot but feel a tender and trembling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for you, knowing the Difficulties of the Work, and conſidering the infinite Importance, and awful Conſequences of it.—Suffer me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> both <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>in the Lord,</hi> ſuffer me, I ſay, <hi>in the Bowels of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and with all the Tenderneſs of fraternal Affection, to impreſs upon your receptive Mind the Things, which have been offered in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Diſcourſe, with a ſpecial View to your Inſtruction and Aſſiſtance in the Work you are engaging in.</p>
            <p>One principal Part, tho' not the Whole of your Buſineſs, is to <hi>preach Chriſt,</hi> even <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel—the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt,</hi> unto Men, for their ſpiritual Inſtruction, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation. — A Work, O how excellent, ſolemn, and weighty! It is not the Bodies and Eſtates, but the Souls of Men, that you are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be concerned with—not ſo much their ſecular and temporal, as their ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſt, that you are to labour, to your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to promote: Your great Concern, I ſay,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009394_0035_0F7346098F821BA8"/>
lies with the Souls of Men—with the Souls of this Church and People, in ſpecial, who have invited you to take the <hi>paſtoral</hi> Care and Charge of them. And although your Care and Labours are not to be wholly confined to them, yet are they to be chiefly employed for and among them; in diligently inſtructing, and training them in the Knowledge of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Belief and Practice of the holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Goſpel. And however ſmall the Vineyard is, in which you are called to labour, you will find Work enough to be done in it, to employ all your Time, and Talents. You have more Souls than your own to take Care of; and you greatly hazard your own, by taking upon you the Care of others. Not more ſtrict and awful was the Charge given to the Man, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 1 Kin. 20.39. to whom one Man brought another, ſaying, <hi>Keep this Man; if by any Means he is miſſing, then ſhall thy Life be for his Life,</hi> than that which is now to be given unto you. — To your Cuſtody are to be committed the Souls of this People, with a ſolemn Charge to keep them with all poſſible Care, that none of them may be loſt, and periſh eternally, through your Fault; each of which is of infinite Value, and for each of which you muſt watch, and give an Account unto Him, that <hi>ſhall judge the Quick, and the Dead,</hi> at his Appearance. And, O, how happy will it be, both for your Self and Them, if you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep this Charge. But alas!

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009394_0036_0F73460A37ABDC90"/>You will therefore <hi>take Heed unto your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to fulfil it.</hi> You will, from Love to Chriſt, and a tender, compaſſionate Concern for the Souls committed to your Care, endeavour, in the moſt full, clear, and perſuaſive Manner, to <hi>preach Chriſt</hi> unto them, in his perſonal Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Dignity; in his mediatorial Offices and Works; in his ſaving Benefits; and in his Laws and Ordinances; <hi>warning every Man, and teaching every Man in all Wiſdom, that you may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> With this View you will enter upon your Miniſtry: This you will make your principal End, and governing Aim, in the curſory and ſtated Diſcharge of it. To this End, you will be concerned <hi>to know Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> and to gain, not only a competent and thorough, but alſo an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and ſaving Acquaintance with the Truths, which you are to preach unto others: And in order hereunto, you will <hi>give yourſelf continually to Reading, Meditation, and Prayer;</hi> and in this Way, labour after thoſe noble Attainments in chriſtian Knowledge, Grace, and Holineſs, whereby you may be well furniſhed, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to every good Work, both as a Miniſter, and a Chriſtian, and become an able and ſkilful Inſtructor, a faithful Guide to others, in the Matters of their Salvation, and <hi>approve yourſelf unto God, a Workman that needeth not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi> You will diligently improve all your Gifts and Talents in promoting the Honour and Kingdom of Chriſt,

and the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls; and <hi>willingly ſpend, and be ſpent for them, though the more abundantly you love them, the leſs you be loved.</hi> For you muſt expect, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you are engaged in ſo friendly a Work and Deſign, to meet with much Difficulty and Oppoſition in it: And it may be, the more faithful you are in warning, reproving, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Men, the more you will diſpleaſe them, and provoke them to oppoſe and treat you ill. But let <hi>none of theſe Things move you,</hi> to deſert your Work, or to Sloth and Negligence in it; but <hi>do thou endure Hardneſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſpeak</hi> the faithful Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Truſt, <hi>not as pleaſing Men, but God, who trieth your Hearts,</hi> and <hi>ſhun not to declare the whole Counſel of God,</hi> ſo as <hi>to be pure from the Blood of all Men:</hi> Withal making it your conſtant Care to go before them in the ſtedfaſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and uniform Practice, of thoſe Truths and Duties of Religion, which you teach, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate upon them; that by your Example, as well as Doctrine, you may forcibly recommend Chriſtianity, and <hi>hold forth the Word of Life,</hi> ſo as not <hi>to run in vain, or labour in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And under a deep and abiding Senſe of your own Weakneſs and Inſufficiency for this great Work, you will always have your Eye and Heart to Chriſt, your humble Dependance upon Him, who is the Head of all divine Influences, for his gracious Preſence with you, his all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace and Aids to be afforded you, and his effectual Bleſſing upon your Miniſtry; as knowing

            <p>May Chriſt Jeſus, the Saviour and Head of the Church, who putteth you, in his ordinary and appointed Way, into the Miniſtry, abundantly enrich you with all miniſterial Gifts, and Graces, afford you his ſpecial Preſence, and effectual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and make you the <hi>ſpiritual Father</hi> of many <hi>ſpiritual Children</hi> here; that when you ſhall be called to give up your Account to him, you may appear at the Head of a numerous <hi>Progeny,</hi> whom you <hi>have begotten by the Goſpel,</hi> and, to your and their compleat and everlaſting Felicity and Joy, <hi>preſent them perfect in him,</hi> ſaying, Here, Lord, am I, and the Children <hi>which thou haſt given me.</hi>

            <p>I would now addreſs the Church and People of God in this Place.</p>
            <p>Brethren beloved, The Wiſdom and Care of our aſcended Redeemer is thankfully to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in ſending forth Labourers into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and diſtant Parts of his Vineyard: And 'tis Matter of Joy and Praiſe, that they are come as far as unto you, and even beyond you, <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of God: How beautiful,</hi> how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to behold, <hi>are the Feet of them that preach the

Goſpel of Peace, and bring the glad Tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> in theſe Borders of the Wilderneſs, which, not long ſince, ecchoed with the horrid Rumours of War, and the hideous Yells of roaming <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,</hi> more fierce and cruel than the wild Beaſts of the Wood, in queſt of Prey? Will the Lord <hi>make the Wilderneſs like Eden, and the Deſert like the Garden of the Lord; wherein ſhall be found Joy and Gladneſs, Thankſgiving, and the Voice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai 51.3.</note> May this Place, in particular, be as a well <hi>watered Garden,</hi> and <hi>a fruitful Field</hi> which the Lord hath bleſſed.</p>
            <p>We rejoice to ſee a Church of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt planted here, and that, purſuant to your Deſires and Endeavours, he is, this Day, ſending you a Paſtor and Teacher, who, we hope and pray, may be a great Bleſſing unto you. May you eſteem this a ſignal Favour, and with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Joy and Thankfulneſs receive this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, as one of his precious Aſcenſion Gifts unto you;—ſent upon this kind, noble, and important Buſineſs, to <hi>preach Him unto you; warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Man, and teaching every Man in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And may you teſtify your ſincere Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs herefor, by always eſteeming and loving him highly for his Work's Sake, and doing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing, on your Part, to render his Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and his Miniſtry happily ſucceſsful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</p>
            <p>Ever remember, that it is your Duty to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> to him that teacheth you, <hi>in all</hi> outward

               <hi>good Things,</hi> for his Support, Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: And this, not merely as a Matter of Bounty and Charity, but as a juſt Debt—a due Reward of his Labour: <hi>For ſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi>—1 Cor. 9.14.—He hath a Right to an honourable Support from you, ſo long as he miniſtreth to you in holy Things; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you to make ſuitable and ſtated Proviſion for it, and to ſee that he hath it, leſt you incur the Guilt of Fraud and Injuſtice, and lay not only a Temptation before, but alſo ſome Kind of Neceſſity upon him, to neglect the Care of your Souls, in order to take Care of himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Conſider, altho' his Office is ſacred and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, that he is a frail Creature, <hi>a Man of like Paſſions with you,</hi> and therefore liable to like Failings and Imperfections, which it concerneth you, not ſeverely to mark, and aggravate to his Diſadvantage, but candidly to bear with, and to cover with the Mantle of Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren, pray for him;</hi> always bearing him upon your Hearts in your Families, and Cloſets; and pouring out your Souls in fervent affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Interceſſion to God, that he may be aſſiſted and proſpered in his Miniſtry, and made a rich and laſting Bleſſing to you, and to your Children.</p>
            <p>Above all, you will be careful not to deſpiſe and forſake, but diligently to attend upon, and to profit by his Miniſtry. For if it be his Duty to <hi>preach Chriſt</hi> unto you, <hi>warning and inſtructing</hi> you <hi>in all Wiſdom,</hi> it is your's to hear, and receive

            </p>
            <p>Sad and awful indeed will be your Caſe, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his faithful Warning and Inſtruction, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main deaf, obſtinate, and finally impenitent: For ſo ſhall you be found miſſing at the Right-Hand of Chriſt in the great Day of Accounts, and doom'd to an aggravated Condemnation, and <hi>mourn at the laſt,</hi> yea mourn everlaſtingly, under theſe ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflections, ſaying, <hi>How have I hated Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my Heart deſpiſed Reproof? And have not obeyed the Voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine Ear to them that inſtructed me?</hi> Prov. 5.12, 13.</p>
            <p>But happy will it be for yourſelves, as well as for your Miniſter, if you diligently, ſeriouſly, and prayerfully attend upon his Miniſtry, ſo as by it to be inſtructed in, and perſuaded ſincerely to embrace, <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and <hi>built up</hi> in the Knowledge of, and a Conformity unto <hi>him in all Things, who is the Head—till</hi> you <hi>come to a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> For ſo ſhall <hi>you</hi> be his <hi>Hope, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> here; and his <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Crown of Rejoicing</hi> hereafter, <hi>in the Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> when, together with him, you ſhall be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented perfect in Chriſt Jeſus before the Preſence of God's Glory with exceeding Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOW the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good
