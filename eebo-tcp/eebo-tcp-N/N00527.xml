            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Blessed Medicine for Sinful Madness.</head>
            <head>A Discourse, Occasioned by a Sentence of DEATH, passed upon several Malefactors, who were then in the Congregation.</head>

               <bibl>Ecclesiastes IX,</bibl>
               <q>

            <p>IT is a very doleful Thing, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reading of this Text, I may do as our Saviour, upon a better Occasion did; even shut the Book, and <hi>Begin</hi> to say, <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfiled in your Eyes.</hi> The <hi>Beginning</hi> of it ha's been wofully ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the <hi>Mad Lives</hi> of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and condemned <hi>Malefactors,</hi> who make a <hi>Sight</hi> in this house at this Time, very moving unto all Spectators. The Endeavour of one Sermon more is to be bestow'd upon them before
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000655_0003_0FA9A45C6E1BECB0"/>
they <hi>Dy,</hi> that their <hi>Madness</hi> many not accompany them unto their Execution, to be cured only by <hi>Death,</hi> which is indeed an <hi>Effectual,</hi> but a very misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Cure for all Diseases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have in our Text, A <hi>Wise</hi> man, describing of a <hi>Mad</hi> man. Tis an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and an unreclameable Sinner, which hath here the Title of a <hi>Mad man</hi> too justly put upon him; and the <hi>Madness</hi> of such a man hath both the <hi>Cause</hi> of in and the <hi>End</hi> of it, here Assigned.</p>
            <p>First, For the <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>Madness.</hi> A great thing that inspires wicked men with so much <hi>Madness</hi> is, their Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>That there is one Event unto all.</hi> Many a man is too <hi>Pore-blind</hi> to see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difference between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> men in the World. As to the <hi>Comforts</hi> of this Life, he sees an <hi>Ishmael</hi> to live as long as an <hi>Isaac,</hi> an <hi>Epicure</hi> to fare as well as an <hi>Abraham.</hi> As to the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of this Life, he sees a <hi>Job,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Lazarus</hi> in as terrible Distresses, as any that befall the worst of men, and <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> in <hi>their Deaths not Divided.</hi> What follows now? <hi>Madnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is in their hearts while they live.</hi> Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

passage, <hi>While they live,</hi> notes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and Obstinacy of the Malady. And for an Instance, this <hi>Madness</hi> Expresses it self particularly, in that one <hi>Mad</hi> Imagination, <hi>That the basest Life here, is better than the best hereafter;</hi> or as the Proverb in our Context has it, <hi>A Living Dog is better than a dead Lyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Tis here concluded in that clause, <hi>After that, they go to the Dead.</hi> A clause capable of a Various Interpretation. Some carry it, as a further Account of the <hi>Promiscuous Events</hi> happening both to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> men. They both <hi>Go to the Dead.</hi> But we may rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Issue</hi> of the <hi>Madness</hi> that is in wicked men, here pointed at. It Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in <hi>Death;</hi> of which <hi>Death</hi> we must understand, That it is Agreeable to the <hi>Life</hi> which went before; and therefore a Wretched, Woful, Shameful <hi>Death,</hi> a <hi>Death</hi> in <hi>Madness,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Death</hi> in <hi>Misery,</hi> must be imply'd in this Assertion. Wherefore the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which demands your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> is, the Condition which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Ungodliness is attended with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000655_0005_0FA9A45DED407CE8"/>
We have Two very Sorrowful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to discourse upon; and therefore my whole Sermon must be like <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> Roll, full of <hi>Lamentation and Mourning and Wo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first PROPOSITION which do's Arrest our Thoughts, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a Mad Life, that Ungodly men use to Lead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an Horrible <hi>Madness</hi> which do's possess the <hi>Hearts,</hi> and thereupon pollute the <hi>Lives</hi> of all ungodly men. Every Penitent in this Assembly, will in much Bitterness of Soul, confess the Truth of this <hi>Proposition,</hi> and say, <hi>None but Mad men would ever do as we have done!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Word</hi> of God calls every thing by its <hi>Right Name;</hi> and Ungodly men are called <hi>Mad men</hi> in those unerring Oracles. As the Preacher tells us, in Ecc. 2. 2. <hi>I said of Laughter, it is mad;</hi> So do's the Bible assure us concerning the Merry Jolly Sinner, <hi>He is Mad, &amp; there is a Madness in all his wayes.</hi> It assuresus concerning all that Renounce and Forsake the Blessed God, in Jere. 30. 38. <hi>They are mad upon their Idels.</hi> Our First Father by his Fall, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000655_0006_0FA9A45F59218478"/>
a sore blow in his Head; he Crack'd and Craz'd his own <hi>Brain;</hi> and the <hi>Madness</hi> hath ever since run in a Blood; his poor Children derive it from him. Hence tis the Name of a Sinner, in Psal 14. 1. <hi>He is a Fool!</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who Preach't and Wrote with some Imitation of his Father, do's es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse that <hi>Phrase,</hi> as the most proper to denote, A <hi>Sinner,</hi> by. Now it speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies but a Degree of the same Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; the <hi>Dotage</hi> of a Sinner quickly grows up into <hi>Phrensy,</hi> which makes a perfect <hi>Mad man</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>Truly, the World is almost an <hi>Entire Bethlem,</hi> and none but that infinite Wisdom, which keeps the <hi>Waves of the Sea,</hi> within their Bounds, could Govern the <hi>Madness,</hi> and manage the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies and Confusions of it.</p>
            <p>Let us a little reflect upon the <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> of MADNESS, which appear in the <hi>Lives</hi> of ungodly men.</p>
            <p>First. An ungodly man, <hi>Believes</hi> like a <hi>Mad man.</hi> His <hi>Fancy,</hi> like a <hi>mad mans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is disturbed and depraved, and he hath very Ridiculous Opinions in his mind. His <hi>madness</hi> lies in that, in Isa. 5. 20. To <hi>

darkness for light, and light for darkness.</hi> He hath such <hi>Frantick Whimseys</hi> in him! What thinks he of God? He <hi>madly</hi> thinks, <hi>God is altogether such an one, as my self.</hi> What thinks he of Christ? He <hi>madly</hi> thinks, <hi>Christ is a Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block and Foolishness.</hi> What will he think of Religion? He <hi>madly</hi> thinks, <hi>What is the Almighty that I should serve Him, and what profit shall I have, if I pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him?</hi> He hath <hi>mad</hi> Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Sin,</hi> as if, <hi>The Stolen Waters of it were sweet.</hi> He hath <hi>mad</hi> Thoughts about the <hi>World,</hi> as if, <hi>Here were his Resting place.</hi> And he hath as <hi>mad.</hi> Thoughts about himself: with a <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean madness</hi> in him, he counts himself, <hi>Rich and Increased in Goods and having Need of Nothing,</hi> when he is <hi>Wretched and Miserable and poor and blind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Go into a <hi>Case de Locos</hi> among the proud Spaniards, and you shall see one fancying himself a <hi>King,</hi> another a <hi>Pope,</hi> and a third, an <hi>Emperour.</hi> Such a Swelling <hi>madness</hi> is in every ungodly man; he do's really count himself, <hi>The best man in the World.</hi> The Word used for <hi>madness,</hi> in our Text, is one that carries <hi>Pride</hi> in the Signification of it.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000655_0008_0FA9A4602EE26D18"/>
The Vapours of <hi>Pride</hi> have disordered the Head of an ungodly man. And in all his Thoughts, he will be sure to Contradict whatever the Blessed God ha's Revel'd unto us.</p>
            <p>Secondly. An Ungodly man, <hi>Chooses</hi> like a <hi>Mad man.</hi> We say, <hi>Quis nisi ment is Inops?</hi> Who but a <hi>mad-man</hi> will Refuse offered <hi>Gold,</hi> and prefer a Counter, or a Gew-gaw, before it? It is the way to Try a <hi>Fool;</hi> set a piece of <hi>Gold,</hi> and some sorry <hi>Trifle</hi> before him; if he choose the <hi>Trifle</hi> rather than the <hi>Gold,</hi> he is, <hi>A Fool.</hi> Such a <hi>Mad fool</hi> is every ungodly man! His <hi>Choise</hi> is mentioned in Isai. 66. 3. <hi>They have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their Abominations.</hi> There are Various Objects presented unto the <hi>Choise</hi> of the Sinner; but what a <hi>Choise</hi> do's he make? There is both <hi>Life Eternal</hi> and <hi>Eternal Death</hi> set before him; but so <hi>mad</hi> is he, that he chooses <hi>Death</hi> rather than<hi>Life.</hi> His prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Choise</hi> is that in Jere. 2. 13. <hi>They have forsaken the Fountain of Living waters, and have hewenthem out Cisterns, broken Cisterns, that can hold no water.</hi> What a <hi>mad man</hi> is he?

side, <hi>Wisdom</hi> offers unto the Sinner, <hi>Spiritual Riches and Spiritual Honours, &amp; Eternal Priviledges;</hi> on the other side, <hi>Satan</hi> offers unto him. <hi>A few Short-liv'd sensual Delights, that shall forfeit all the Blessings of the New Covenant forever;</hi> but like a <hi>mad-man</hi> he chooses the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of <hi>Satan</hi> before those of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> He may have his <hi>Choise,</hi> and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is made unto him, <hi>Ask what thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly. An Ungodly man ha's the <hi>Rashness,</hi> and <hi>Boldness,</hi> of a <hi>mad-man</hi> in him. He troubles not himself with any, <hi>Wherefores,</hi> and, <hi>What if's?</hi> He do's not ask himself, <hi>Wherefore did I come into the World?</hi> Nor, <hi>What if I go out of the World before I have made better Provision for it?</hi> He is one of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000655_0010_0FA9A461AFAB0890"/>
those, whose Pourtraiture we have in Prov. 27.12. <hi>The Simple pass on and are Punished.</hi> He Drinks all that he sees before him, and he never ponders, <hi>Is there no poison in it?</hi> He is not Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about the Dangers, and the Downfalls, which he is continually Expos'd unto. And hence he permits himself to be cheated, worse than ever any <hi>mad-man</hi> was. Doubtless, <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Mad,</hi> when he suffered himself to be cheated of his Innocence and his Paradise, with an <hi>Apple?</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is a notable Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster and Juggler! and he cheats the <hi>mad</hi> Sinner of all he ha's; the <hi>mad</hi> Creature will part with his precious <hi>Time,</hi> though all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven cannot Recal one <hi>Lost Hour</hi> of it; and he will part with his Immortal <hi>Soul,</hi> though the <hi>Gain of the whole World,</hi> would not Repair the <hi>Loss;</hi> The Devil gets these things of him, for a <hi>Song.</hi> And he runs as <hi>Mad Ventures,</hi> as he makes <hi>Mad Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains.</hi> There is that foaming <hi>Madness</hi> in him, that he Values not the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Almighty God; He hears the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God; He sees the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, for Sin, and yet he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000655_0011_0FA9A4626DFA89D0"/>
will, <hi>Go on still in his Trespasses.</hi> He do's, as we read in Jere. 8. 6. <hi>As the Horse rusheth into the Battel.</hi> Though he is fairly Warned, that if he Venture on in his Evil ways, the Omnipotent God will make him feel the force of His Iron Fiery Arms, <hi>What cares he?</hi> He goes on in the <hi>Rage</hi> of Sin, and <hi>mocking at fear,</hi> he playes with Folly before the Canons Roaring Mouth. Such a furious <hi>Mad-man</hi> the ungodly Sinner is!</p>
            <p>Fourthly. An ungodly man, like a <hi>mad-man,</hi> endeavours the <hi>Hurt</hi> of all are about him; especially of those by whom his own <hi>Good</hi> is most Endeavoured. His <hi>madness,</hi> makes him given to <hi>mischief.</hi> We read in Eccl. 10. 13; about, <hi>Mischievous madness.</hi> That is it which the Sinner is under the continual Hurries of; and as tis said in Prov. 10. 23. <hi>It is a Sport unto a Fool to do mischief.</hi> He is always doing <hi>mischief</hi> to <hi>himself.</hi> He do's what is worse than tearing his own Hair, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own <hi>Flesh,</hi> and killing his own <hi>Children,</hi> which <hi>mad-men</hi> use to do for with a Thousand Stabs and Wounds he <hi>Wrongs his own Soul.</hi> And, he is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000655_0012_0FA9A4632DEC31F0"/>
doing <hi>mischief</hi> to <hi>where</hi> too as fast as he can. The <hi>Estate,</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> of his Neighbours all fare the worse for him; they find him, <hi>A Mad-man casting Fire-brands and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Death.</hi> Nor is he content to Go to Hell alone, but he draws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as many with him thither as he can. But especially, if any man shall go to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him or Oppose him in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, this <hi>mad-man</hi> will grow yet more outrageous at it. It was a Quality which <hi>Balaam</hi> was marked for, in 2 Pet. 2. 16. <hi>The Madness of the Prophet.</hi> Wherein did he show his <hi>Madness?</hi> In this; That when he met with a Stop in his way, it flung him into such a Passion, that there was no coming a near him. Tis thus with such a man; <hi>Tell him the Truth,</hi> and hee'l treat you like the most mortal and cruel Adversary: Go to Stop him, or bind him, or thwait him, and you had as good <hi>Meet a Bear bereaved of her Whelps.</hi> And hence his Vexation Spends it self upon the Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God with a peculiar Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if he see such an one, he crys out, <hi>That man, I hate him!</hi> if he meet
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000655_0013_0FA9A463EDEB1C98"/>
such an one, he crys out, <hi>Have I found thee, O mine Enemy?</hi> He cannot En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be Controlled in his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. The ungodly man has, <hi>The Devil in him.</hi> There is an Unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablean Unexpressible Interest of <hi>Satan</hi> oftentimes in the Distemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>madness.</hi> It was a common sentiment among the Jews of old, That <hi>madness</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes produced by an <hi>Invasion</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of Evil Spirits; Especially, if the <hi>madness</hi> were <hi>Sine Febri.</hi> Hence they said in one of their Slanderous Blasphemies against our Lord, as in Joh. 10. 20. <hi>He hath a Devil, and is mad.</hi> It is often some <hi>Devil,</hi> which takes Advantage of the Poisonous <hi>Fires</hi> which madness is inflamed with, to carry on the hideous Hurly Burly's that are in the minds of the Distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Hence also t'was said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that was <hi>mad,</hi> in Match. 17. 15,18. <hi>He is Lunatick;</hi> that is, one Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted at certain Times of the <hi>Moon.</hi> And it follows; <hi>Jesus rebuked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Be sure, An ungodly Sinner ha's this point of <hi>madness</hi> in him, That he is under a Remarkable Energy of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000655_0014_0FA9A464ADE2AC70"/>
               <hi>Devil.</hi> It was said unto a Cheater, in Act. 5. 3. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart?</hi> And so it may be said of every other Sinner, <hi>Satan hath a Strong-hold in the Heart of such a Sinner.</hi> He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himself up to the Devil, resolving and engaging, <hi>To walk after the Prince of the power of the Air.</hi> He ha's a thousand times over said unto <hi>Satan,</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> to the Syrian, <hi>I am thine and all that I have.</hi> And hereupon, He is mov'd by the <hi>Devil,</hi> and led by the <hi>Devil</hi> in his whole Conversation. This is his <hi>Madness while he Lives!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what becomes of him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: This is the Business of</p>
            <p>The Second PROPOSITION,</p>
            <p>Which we ought <hi>Soberly</hi> to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate a while upon. You are now to hear, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Sad Death is that which the Incureable Madness of ungodly men brings them at length unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Thing that should reach the Heart of every Person here; but especially of those who by a more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Approach of Death, have it said unto them, <hi>Set thy Soul in Order, for thou shalt Dy and not Live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000655_0015_0FA9A4656DEA3620"/>
First, there is a <hi>Natural Death</hi> which ungodly men must have Experience of. They must <hi>Go to the Dead,</hi> which by Rotting in the <hi>Grave.</hi> This is a thing which there is no avoiding and, <hi>There is no discharge in this War</hi> Will the <hi>Wealth</hi> of the ungodly man Excuse him from Dying? No. Tis said, in Psal. 49. 6. <hi>They that boast themselves in the multitude of Riches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact Redeem from the Stroke of Death.</hi> Will the <hi>Strength</hi> of the ungodly man Excuse him from Dying? No. Tis said in Job 21. 23. <hi>One Dyes in his full strength.</hi> Will his <hi>Hunour</hi> Protect him from it? No. T'was said in Psal. 82. 6,7. <hi>I have said, ye are Gods, but ye shall Dy like men.</hi> Will his <hi>Wisdom</hi> defend him? NO. T'was said in Psal. 49. 10. <hi>The Wise men Dy.</hi> The man must come to it, whether he will, or no. And there is a double <hi>sadness</hi> in the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death</hi> of an ungodly man.</p>
            <p>First. His <hi>Natural Death</hi> is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of a Divine and a Dreadful <hi>Curse</hi> upon him. It was Gods <hi>Curse</hi> for our <hi>Sin,</hi> in Gen. 3. 17. <hi>Thou shall surely Dy.</hi> The <hi>Sting</hi> is taken out of that <hi>Curse,</hi> to the true Believer, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000655_0016_0FA9A46630B44EB8"/>
the <hi>Snake</hi> ha's more of <hi>Cordial</hi> than of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in it. But the Death of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> comes upon him, as part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not let such a Transgressor Live; but will <hi>Pay</hi> him home the <hi>Wages;</hi> that his Faults make due unto him. The Blessed God will not let his Creatures any longer <hi>groan</hi> under the <hi>Burden</hi> of serving such a Monster, and therefore. He gives to His Officer <hi>Death,</hi> such an order as this, <hi>Go Marshal, Take some away, carry him to his own place!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. His <hi>Natural Death</hi> hath often some very Dismal <hi>Circumstances</hi> to Embitter it. It is said of some, in Jere. 16. 4. <hi>They shall Dy of Grievous Deaths.</hi> There occurs frequently some <hi>Grievous</hi> Accident, in the Death of a notoriously ungodly man. Perhaps there may be some <hi>Grievous</hi> Plagues and Pains upon him in his Dying Hours. Or, an <hi>Early Death,</hi> and also a <hi>Sudden Death,</hi> which is a <hi>Grievous Death</hi> to a man that ha's not made his Peace with God, though it be not so to a Believer; <hi>such</hi> a Death may be his portion. Yea,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000655_0017_0FA9A466EF4B6048"/>
it may be that a <hi>Violent Death</hi> may sieze upon him, and this by the Hands of a Common Executioner; the <hi>Sword</hi> of Civil Justice may take him off, and <hi>Men Clapping their Hands at him, hiss him out of his Place.</hi> This is the <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Death</hi> which many a forlorn Creature comes unto. But it were well if <hi>This</hi> were all. There are yet more terrible things to be laid before you. For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is an <hi>Eternal Death</hi> which ungodly men are Obnoxious unto. They must <hi>Go to the Dead</hi> which ly Roaring in the Fiery Bottom of Hell forever. <hi>Death</hi> arrives unto them, with such an horrible Train, as we have represented in Rev. 6. 8. <hi>Behold, a Pale Horse, and his Name that satt thereon was</hi> Death, <hi>and Hell follow'd with him.</hi> Ay, This is that which makes their <hi>Death</hi> look so <hi>Pale,</hi> so Ghastly, so Hideous; <hi>Hell followes!</hi> It is that whereof we are told more than once in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, as in Psal. 9. 17. <hi>The wicked shall be turned into Hell.</hi> And that it may no want <hi>Sufficient Witnesses,</hi> we have it over and over Confirmed in the <hi>New,</hi> as in Math. 25. 46. <hi>The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000655_0018_0FA9A467C64869E8"/>
Wicked shall go away into Everlasting Punishment.</hi> If a man go Christless and Graceless out of <hi>This</hi> World, he passes unto Various Torments in <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and these make up the <hi>Second Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Sadness</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> which falls upon an ungodly man, ha's these Aggravations in it.</p>
            <p>First. It is an <hi>Intolerable Anguish</hi> which he shall then be Tortured with. Doubtless there will be multitudes of Miseries to Cruciate the ungodly man among the Damned In all those things wherein he can be <hi>Sensible,</hi> he shall be <hi>Miserable.</hi> But there are especially two things which <hi>Hell</hi> consisteth of; and those two the Scripture calls in Mark 9. <hi>sin.: A Fire,</hi> and, <hi>A Worm.</hi> There shall be a <hi>Fire,</hi> to Vex and Scald upon a Damned Soul; and what shall that <hi>Fire</hi> be? Truly, It shall be the <hi>Wrath,</hi> the fierce and hot <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Great God, making Immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions upon the souls. It is said, in Heb. 12. 29. <hi>Our God is a Consuming Fire. Our God,</hi> Will then flash in very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Rebakes upon the Sinner, and (as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks) he shall be; <hi>Destroy'ed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000655_0019_0FA9A46929673E40"/>
By the Presence of the Lord.</hi> There shall also be a <hi>Worm,</hi> to Gnaw the very Vitals of a Damned Soul; and that <hi>Worm</hi> shall be an Enraged <hi>Conscience,</hi> making most Angry and Horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Condition of the Soul. It is said in Prov. 1. 31. <hi>They shall be Filled with their own Devices.</hi> Out of the Sinners own <hi>Corruption</hi> will be bred a <hi>Viper,</hi> that shall keep feeding forever upon his very Heart within him. Alas, my Friends, what a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable <hi>Death</hi> is this? They that have only tasted the Beginnings of it, in a <hi>Wounded Spirit</hi> here, have made the Town Ring with the Noises and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their Agonies. One so Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, over-hearing some body to speak about some Exquisite Anguishes, Cry'd out, <hi>All that is but a Metaphor to what I am feeling of!</hi> O what a <hi>Death</hi> is that unto which the worst of Deaths is but a <hi>Metaphor!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Eternity of that Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Anguish,</hi> will render the <hi>Anguish</hi> yet more <hi>Intolerable.</hi> We have it thrice ever told unto us, in Mark 9 <hi>sin. The Worm Dyeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Fire is not</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. That the Calamities of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000655_0020_0FA9A46939E5E640"/>
Damned will be <hi>Truly</hi> Eternal, is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Consent.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> asserts the <hi>Eternity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Expressing it by the very same word which is used to declare the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> of God Himself; and it were easy to multiply Quotations for it. The <hi>Consent</hi> of Good men hereabout, hath been such, <hi>That the Church in all Ages hath Agreed in Receiving it as an Article of Religion.</hi> The <hi>Consent</hi> of Bad men hereabout, is discovered in the Indelible <hi>Suspicions</hi> and <hi>Jelousies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which can by no means be wholly rooted out of their minds. That these Calamities will be <hi>Justly</hi> Eternal, is evident from This, That it is very <hi>Just</hi> for the measures of a <hi>Poenalty</hi> to be taken from the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Object Affronted and Offended by the <hi>Fault.</hi> As now; To kill a <hi>Fly,</hi> is a Sport for a <hi>Beggar,</hi> as well as an <hi>Emperour;</hi> but to Kill a <hi>Man,</hi> this is justly counted, a <hi>Capital Crime.</hi> Thus, It is an <hi>Infinite God</hi> that is Injured and Provoked by Our Sin. Hence an <hi>Infinite Wrath</hi> is but proportionable thereunto. We cannot sustain a Revenge <hi>Infinite</hi> for the <hi>Intention</hi> of it; hence one <hi>Infinite</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000655_0021_0FA9A469EDD65830"/>
for the <hi>Duration</hi> of it, is but very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable. Here then make another Pause! What an Astonishing <hi>Death</hi> is this? To be under Inconceivable Vexations, for as many Millions of Ages, as there are <hi>Stars</hi> in the Sky, or <hi>Sands</hi> on the Shore, or <hi>Drops</hi> within the Ocean, and yet be no nearer to the period of them, than the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they began! <hi>Ah! Lord, I am afraid of thy Judgments!</hi> Well might once a poor Sinner say, <hi>If I were to Endure the wrath of God for a Thousand years, I might go through it; but Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eternity, that Amazes me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what Improvement is to be made of such things as these? For the</p>

               <p>There is both <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Counsil</hi> hence to be laid before those that have beed Cured of their <hi>Madness</hi> by a true Conversion unto God. Some of us there are that have been brought unto a <hi>Right sense</hi> of things, by the <hi>Renewing of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and unto a just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and Reformation of our Manners. We may indeed with much Humility look back, and say with the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000655_0022_0FA9A46AB1074500"/>
Apostle, in Act. 26. 11. <hi>I was once Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mad.</hi> We were <hi>Mad</hi> and worse than so, when we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>without God,</hi> and <hi>without Christ,</hi> and <hi>without Hope,</hi> and went along without <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> in the Lew'd Courses of our Unregeneracy. But our God ha's reduced us unto a blessed measure of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> by <hi>Changing of our Hearts</hi> within us. Now,</p>
               <p>First. There is Rich matter of <hi>Comfort,</hi> in our Cure. Our Deliverance foretels many <hi>Comfortable</hi> Things unto us; but <hi>This</hi> Particularly, <hi>That</hi> it will not be a <hi>Sad,</hi> but a <hi>Sweet</hi> kind of <hi>Death,</hi> which we must quickly Encounter with. We shall shortly <hi>Go to the Dead;</hi> and this is one of the Greatest, the Blackest Fears that we are Afflicted with. But, be now assured, <hi>Ye Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Souls,</hi> That when you <hi>go to the Dead,</hi> you shall not <hi>Go to the Mad.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you shall then be <hi>Gathered unto your People,</hi> as tis said, <hi>Abraham</hi> was. But who are they? Not the <hi>Mad people,</hi> whose boisterous Excesses were unto you alwayes Abominable here. No, a Departing Saint sometimes pleaded that with God, <hi>Lord, Let me not go to be with the Wicked forever, for
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000655_0023_0FA9A46B6E1E88A8"/>
I did not care to be with them here!</hi> But the people which you shall go unto, will be <hi>that,</hi> in Heb. 12. 22,22,24. <hi>An Innumerable Company of Holy Angels, and the Spirits of Just men made Perfect and Jesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant.</hi> Happy Souls, Never then be Afraid of <hi>Dying</hi> any more.

               <p>First, Let us be <hi>Thankful</hi> that we are <hi>Cured</hi> our selves.

Christians, Tis our own Case. As he said of old, <hi>This I know, that I was Blind but now I see;</hi> So may we say, <hi>This I Know, I was mad, but now tis otherwise.</hi> Let us then with a <hi>Right mind</hi> admire and adore the <hi>Lordour Healer.

               </p>
               <p>But, Secondly. Let us be concern'd for others that are not <hi>Cured</hi> yet.

Let us mourn over them with a very deep Affection; and if they give never so much Affront and

Abuse unto out selves, Let us resent it no otherwise, than we would the Tricks of a <hi>Mad-man:</hi> but say for them, like out Saviour in Luke 23. 34 <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Let us do them all the Good we can; If it be in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Let us <hi>Govern</hi> and <hi>Restrain</hi> all the Freaks which they are <hi>madly</hi> ready to run into; and Let us carry them in the Arms of our Supplications unto the Lord Jesus, for His Help, as the Friends of such people did of old.

               <p>Secondly, That a true <hi>Repentance</hi> is the Thing your <hi>Madness</hi> must be Rectify'd withal. Tis <hi>Repentance,</hi> which must <hi>Undo</hi> now in a few days, all that you have been <hi>Doing</hi> ever since you came into the World. <hi>Repentance,</hi> I say; a Great-Word: What is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but a <hi>Growing Wise-again?</hi> You have been <hi>mad;</hi> but by <hi>Repentance</hi> you must Bewayl, and Confess, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all your <hi>Madness;</hi> and by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> you must Repair to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus for the Redress of all thee. <hi>Guilt,</hi> and all that <hi>Wo,</hi> which by your <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> you are involved in.

You are <hi>mad,</hi> and worse than so, till a Profound <hi>Repentance</hi> be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in you. Among the Romans of old, They that were under a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Accusation,</hi> betook themselves to a Squalid and Ragged <hi>Habit,</hi> a dejected <hi>Countenance,</hi> and the <hi>Hair</hi> of their Head; and Face neglected; and One famous man procured a Banishment, because he would not submit unto the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

            <p>First, If you would know, WHEN, the Displeasure of God shall break upon the Heads of ungodly Sinners, You are here informed, <hi>They Dy in Youth.</hi> It seems, That an <hi>Early Death,</hi> a <hi>Death</hi> in the Prime, and Spring of their Days, is that whereunto they make themselves Obnoxious.

            <p>Secondly, If you would know WHY, these ungodly Sinners are thus, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, with the Indignation of God, You are here advised, <hi>Their Life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Unclean.</hi> It may be rendered, <hi>Among the Sodomites:</hi> and it is possible, that here may be an Allusion to the Destruction, that came upon the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> when our Lord Jesus Christ, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Type</hi> of the Conflagration which He will shortly make upon this Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rained from Heaven the <hi>Vengeance of Eternal Fire,</hi> upon the <hi>Cityes which He Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not.</hi> q. d.

            </p>
            <p>We have two <hi>Assertions</hi> here to be Advanced and mentioned.</p>
            <div n="1" type="assertion">
               <head>Assertion. I.</head>
               <p>As a <hi>Wicked</hi> Life in general may be called, an <hi>Unclean</hi> one, so an <hi>Unclean,</hi> Life, in particular is a very <hi>Wicked</hi> one. It is true, That all <hi>Wickedness,</hi> is called <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi> in those Oracles, of Truth, which never miscalled any thing. Thus, the <hi>Wicked</hi> Nature which we were all born into the World withal, ha's that said of it, in Job 14.4. <hi>It is an Unclean thing.</hi> Thus, the <hi>Wicked</hi> Person who do's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God, ha's that said of him, in Eccl. 9.2. <hi>He is Unclean.</hi> All our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, is call'd, <hi>A Filthiness of Flesh &amp; Spirit.</hi> When a Child of God ha's asked, for a Deliverance from Sin, he so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, <hi>Wash me thoroughly from my Iniquity, and Cleanse me from my Sin.</hi> And a man that Lives in Sin against the God that made him, is denominated in Job 15.16. <hi>An Abominable and Filthy man.</hi> Why? Because the most Loathsome. Dirty, Nasty Object in the World, is not so Distastful unto us, as all <hi>Wickedness</hi> is unto our God, who is, <hi>Not a God that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000655_0042_0FA9A479ADDBEDE0"/>
hath pleasure in Wickedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then there is One peculiar sort of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> which the Term of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi> is more strictly put upon; tis the Violation of that <hi>Chastity,</hi> which is Enjoyned upon us, by the Seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in the <hi>Holy, &amp; Just, &amp; Good,</hi> Laws of our God. And why is this <hi>Luxury</hi> called <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> but because of a Special <hi>Filthiness,</hi> and <hi>Ugliness,</hi> which this Vice is attended with? Indeed, such is the Wretchedness of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in man, that it is hardly safe so much as to mention in his Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing, the Several kinds of his Damnable <hi>Wickedness.</hi> It was the Apostolical Council, in Eph. 5.3. <hi>All Uncleanness, let it not be once Named among you.</hi> And accordingly, The Holy Spirit of God here in our Text, as well as else where, has used a Notable <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,</hi> to describe the worst <hi>Uncleanness</hi> by. The word for, <hi>The Unclean,</hi> is <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> because tis not easy to find any word Convenient and Emphatical Enough, to set out the detestable <hi>Unholiness,</hi> that is in such <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> However, we may with some Scripture-Phrases indigitate the Chief of those Diabolical Pranks, that are Committed by those whose
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000655_0043_0FA9A47A6F81BE40"/>
                  <hi>Life is among the Unclean.</hi> Breefly,</p>
               <p>There is then a Cursed <hi>Self-Pollution,</hi> which is usually the first Pit of <hi>Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> where into they fall, that are, <hi>The Abhorred of the Lord.</hi> Wretches there are, that like Wicked <hi>Onan,</hi> do so Sacrifice their seed unto the Devil: and these are meant by those <hi>Effoeminate,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom tis said, in 1 Cor. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>9,10. <hi>Be not Deceived, They shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is next, an Odious <hi>Fornication,</hi> which is a further Step, of that <hi>Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> where unto the Raging Lusts of men do carry them. Tis that, wherein <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedded</hi> Persons, of both Sexes, do pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute themselves; and it is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those <hi>Works of the Flesh,</hi> whereof we are assured in Gal.5. 20,21. <hi>They which do such Things, shall not Inherit the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they that have been thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Unclean,</hi> do come to <hi>Marry,</hi> it is well if the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit</hi> still haunt them not. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And sometimes, the <hi>Uncleanness</hi> grows into <hi>Adultery;</hi> Yea, Perhaps a doubled <hi>Adultery:</hi> wherein the <hi>Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is fearfully broken by Sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that shake off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of God, imposed from <hi>the Beginning.</hi> The Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity so often Damned in the Word of God; but especially in Prov. 6. 29,32. <hi>Whosoever touches his Neighbours Wife, shall not be Innocent; whose Committeth Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with a Woman, Lacketh understanding; he that doeth it, destroyeth his own soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes also, There is an <hi>Incest</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated in that <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> whereto the Hellish <hi>Fires</hi> in the Hearts of men do carry them. They will needs invade that Comfortable, and Profitable, <hi>Order,</hi> which God has Established in Humane Society, as now increased, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of mankind. It was the Edict of Heaven, in Lev. 18.6. <hi>None of you shall approach to any, that is near of kin to him.</hi> And to show, that such and such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were not forbidden unto <hi>Israel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the Lord adds, <hi>For in all these the Nations are Defiled, which I cast out before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, which is horrible to be Spoken! such a Vile <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> do some among the debased Children of men, sink down

into, that <hi>Sodomy</hi> and <hi>Buggery</hi> it self, ha's been among their Crimes. The Great God ha's had Occasion to issue out such precepts, as those, in Lev. 18.22,23—against such unutterable <hi>Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Confusions.</hi> Alas, There is in <hi>Europe,</hi> a Land Professing the Christian Religion, where such Devillish Practices are, they say, very frequent; but flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven will shortly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy that <hi>Accursed Land.</hi> Nay, And in this <hi>Land of Uprightness</hi> too there have been some that have thus <hi>Dealt Wickedly.</hi> And I have one very wonderful Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to tell you of it.

You hear what the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Uncleanness</hi> are; but I am to tell you, That there are <hi>Unclean Thoughts,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:000655_0046_0FA9A47CAED1D318"/>
which are Prohibited by the Lord our God; even as in Math. 5.28. <hi>A Looking upon a Woman to Last after her.</hi> And there are <hi>Unclean Words,</hi> which are also Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; Even, as in Eph.5.4. <hi>Filthiness &amp; Foolish Talking.</hi> In all of these things, there is <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> But what shall be said of this <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> In one Word, It is a <hi>Wickedness.</hi> Tis Rebuked every where the whole <hi>Bible</hi> over. Bat indeed, I need not Appeal unto the <hi>Bible,</hi> to prove the <hi>Wickedness</hi> of <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> The Natural <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> in man, will testify unto it.

is, like also to be a <hi>Woful Death.</hi> There are indeed Innumerable <hi>Woes,</hi> which they that Live in <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> are, while they <hi>Live,</hi> Exposed unto.

               <p>If you Enquire, <hi>Wherein</hi> the Death of the Unclean will be a <hi>Woful</hi> One?

they go off the Stage. It brings a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but a Certain I last, upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of men: <hi>Job</hi> said of it, <hi>It is a Fire that consumes to Destruction, and it would R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Uncleanness,</hi> is that also, whereof we are told in Prov. 6.33. <hi>A wound &amp; a Dishonour shall he get, &amp; his Reproach shall not be wiped away;</hi> that Committeth it. However <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> a man may be otherwise, <hi>Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will soon lay his <hi>Honour</hi> in the Dust; there is a Hot in the <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> when <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi> has defiled it: <hi>Paul</hi> said of it, <hi>It is a Vile Affection.</hi>

mountain here, would not be enough to serve the Executions.</hi> Instead of that, I might say, If all the <hi>Young People,</hi> that have many ways, <hi>Polluted themselves, from their Youth up,</hi> were turned out of our Assemblies, we should have Thin Assemblies Left! And there are especially two of the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Seasons, that <hi>Young People</hi> take to multiply those their Diabolical <hi>Pollutions.</hi> There is the Close of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and there is the Joy of the <hi>Harvest;</hi> these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being improved in <hi>Thankfulness</hi> to God, are Employ'd in spreading of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi> through the Land. Yea, But for this very Cause it is, that God Almighty is by His Desolating Judgments apace turning of them out of our Assemblies. God from Heaven, is denouncing of that Wofulness upon us, in Jere. 6.11. <hi>I am full of the Fury of the Lord, I will pour it on the Assembly of the Young men together;</hi> and that in, Jere. 42.26. <hi>Her Young men, shall fall in her Streets.</hi> But I now tell you, <hi>Why</hi> such Things do come to pass? The Time was, that there were <hi>Unclean</hi> Young men among the people of God; Yea, even those Young men that were set a part for the Service of the Tabernacle, were, how <hi>Unclean!</hi> It was then said, <hi>The Sin of the Young men was very great before the Lord.</hi>

And what comes of it, but this? The Lord Slew the Young; men with sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Desolations. Mark what I say, The Omnipresent God, He is a Witness to all the Unclean Things done by you in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places, which, as the Apostle says, <hi>T were a Shame to speak of.</hi> The All-seeing Eye of God is upon you, in all the Revels, and all the Riots, and all the Baudy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Exorbitancies, wherein you, <hi>Work out all Filthiness with all Greediness.</hi> Yea, but the Jealous God immediately then says to the Angel of <hi>Death; Go Brand those Young Wretches, for Destruction; set a Mark upon them, that so the Beesom of Destruction of may sweep them away, among the Generation of my wrath.</hi> So tis, that so many of you come to <hi>Dy in Youth!</hi> Leave off then, O Young people, all these Evil wayes. Let me call upon you, as the Angel did upon <hi>Austin; Take up the Bible &amp; Read! Take up the Bible &amp; Read!</hi> And now turn, as <hi>Austin</hi> did, unto that place in the Bible, Rom. 13.11,12,13. <hi>It is High Time to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of Sleep; cast off the Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Walk Honestly,—not in Chambering and Wentonness.</hi> Unclean <hi>Austin</hi> was thus Reclamed; <hi>Good God,</hi> That we may now see many an Unclean <hi>Sinner</hi> so!</p>

I Am a Miserable Sinner; and I have Justly Provoked the Holy God to leave me unto that Folly of my own Heart, for which I am now Condemned to Dy.

I do Warn all People, and especially, <hi>Young</hi> People, against the Sin of <hi>Uncleanness</hi> in particular; 'tis that Sin, that hath been m<hi>y</hi> Ruine; well had it been for me, if <hi>I</hi> had answered all Temptations to that Sin, as <hi>Joseph</hi> did, <hi>How shall I do this Wickedness and Sin against God?</hi> But, I see, <hi>Bad Company</hi> is that, which leads to that, <hi>&amp;</hi> all other Sins; and <hi>I</hi> therefore beg all that Love their Souls to be familiar with none but such as fear God.
