            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Frequently we have convened on mournful occaſions; but never have we experienced a period of ſuch general lamentation as the preſent. Our eyes have ſeen the burſting tear. Our ears have heard the painful ſhriek of the diſconſolate. We have beheld huſbands taking the laſt full gaze of their deareſt companions; parents weeping for their children and refuſing to be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they were not; and feeble, helpleſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans bereft of their only guides. But this day's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, theſe badges of mourning indicate the keeneſt ſenſations, at the loſs of a man, great beyond an equal, the father of his country, and the friend of the human race.</p>
            <p>Propriety and the intent of this diſcourſe, ſuggeſt it as ſuitable, that we feel no leſs ſolemn, than though the remains of this wonderful perſonage were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to be entombed in our full view, and by our own hands.</p>
            <p>You will therefore let me have your ſerious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious attention, while I attempt to ſtate ſomething from God's word ſuited to the very important and mournful occaſion.</p>
            <p>The words to be the theme of the diſcourſe, you will find written in the 2d Book of Samuel, the 1ſt Chapter, and the 27th verſe:
<q>"How are the mighty fallen!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The text is part of the Eulogium ſpoken by king

David on the death of Saul and Jonathan.

               </gap> of his lamentation, he repeats the text no leſs than three times; "<hi>How are the mighty fallen!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words pertinently apply to the character of General Waſhington; he was "<hi>mighty.</hi>" They are applicable to his end; he has "<hi>fallen</hi>" a prey to death the king of terrors.</p>
            <p>The words <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>great</hi> have nearly the ſame import, I ſhall, therefore, uſe them promiſcuouſly in the enſuing diſcourſe, as ſhall be moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall obſerve ſome traits in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of General Waſhington in which his greatneſs was very apparent. Secondly, I ſhall notice the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in raiſing up ſuch a character, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his active ſervices for ſo great a length of time. Thirdly, I ſhall conſider the important inſtruction to be derived to the people of this country from his character, and the improvement, if wiſe, they will make of the Providence of God in taking him out of the world.</p>
            <p>In illuſtrating the character, the following may ſerve as a ſummary. The greatneſs of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington appeared from his ſingular diffidence in accepting the firſt honors conferred on him; from his refuſing pecuniary compenſation for his many ſervices both in the field and cabinet; from his familiar condeſcenſion to inferiors; from his remarkable intrepidity and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge in warlike enterprizes; from his profound ſkill in in perceiving the reſult of preſent meaſures, thro' a complication of the moſt difficult and perplexing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038304_0005_10119D2D17520C08"/>
from his unequaled patience and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare of mind on the moſt trying occaſions; from his never having been elated by thoſe many and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honors conferred on him; from his retiring from the firſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce in the nation to the place of a common citizen; and from univerſal conſent.</p>
            <p>This ſummary, I ſhall endeavor to unfold, with as much brevity and clearneſs, as I am capable.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of General Waſhington appeared from his ſingular diffidence in accepting the firſt honors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him. The greatneſs of this man was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the early part of his life. In Braddock's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat he ſignalized himſelf ſo as not to be forgotten, tho at this time he was no more than about nineteen years of age. On the commencement of hoſtillities between the United States and Great-Britain, the continental Congreſs were unanimous in appointing him to the command of the army. The manner of his accepting the appointment, was a ſtrong proof of his greatneſs. Not made vain, nor at all moved by the honor confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him, his mind was occupied with the arduouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the undertaking, and the importance and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of the reſult. He expreſſed his own inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and dependence on the Diſpoſer of events. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious there was a higher power who over-ruled, he did not depend on an arm of fleſh; but with every mark of modeſty and diffidence he accepted his appointment, from a ſenſe of duty and not from motives of ſelf-exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Almoſt any other man would have betrayed, either directly or indirectly, undue gratification at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed at once to the higheſt poſt of truſt and honor in the nation. But General Waſhington, with cheerful reluctance, bids farewel to Vernon's beauteous height, with a diffidence unequaled; and yet with ſuch intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and valour as could not fail rouſing the timid, and inſpiring every boſom with freſh reſolution. Steady and unmoved, like a mighty rock, a crown of laurels at the concluſion of an eight years victorious war, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038304_0006_10119D2EC5371158"/>
not the man. With the ſame ſteady ſmile, he leaves the field and retires to the ſweets of private life. Called again, by the free and unanimous ſuffrages of the people, to the Preſidency of the United States; he expreſſed his reluctance. With modeſty he viewed himſelf unequal to the betruſtment. But ſwayed by the voice of his country, he comes diffidently to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred book and is qualified to office. Through the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of time, the modeſty and diffidence of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on theſe occaſions will ſet him up as one of the greateſt of the human race.</p>
            <p>His greatneſs appeared from his refuſing pecuniary compenſation for his many ſervices both in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and cabinet. Without any regard to preſent poſſeſſions, whether they be great or ſmall, there is a native thirſt in the mind to amaſs more. This is a maxim which meets univerſal credence and is corroborated by fact. But in this reſpect General Waſhington muſt be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſingular and almoſt entirely alone. His mind was ſo elevated and his paſſion for wealth ſo ſubordinate, that the annual compenſation of eight thouſand pounds weighed not a feather in his conſideration. In this feeling of mind, he was ſteady and perſevering. He was great in wealth; but it was not his idol. This part of his conduct is at leaſt an indication of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of General Waſhington appeared from his generous condeſcenſion to his inferiors. His ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the firſt. He was honored more than any other man in the world; but all this did not make him proud and haughty. He did not view it beneath him to mingle in ſocial intercourſe with the loweſt peaſant. Look to the deſpots of the eaſtern continent. At what cringing diſtance do they hold their ſubjects. If they ſpeak, they die. With Waſhington how differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent! Tho elevated to the higheſt pinnacle of honor, he did not forget that he was a man, and that others were ſo too. He wanted not flattery nor the parade of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038304_0007_10119D33EA360BA8"/>
adulation. He was never more in his element, than in friendly intercourſe with thoſe of ordinary ſtation. This his greatneſs will never be forgotten.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of Waſhington appeared from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable intrepidity and knowledge in warlike enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes. All the talents of generalſhip united in him. His integrity was ſo far paſt ſuſpicion, that the nation could repoſe entire confidence in him, without the leaſt imaginary hazzard of fallacy. Beſide, he held the eſteem and affections of thoſe under his command to a man. His counſels were cool and deliberate; and yet ſeaſonable and adequate. The lives of thoſe under him, he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precious, and he would not expoſe them contrary to the ſoundeſt policy, and the dictates of the pureſt reaſon. If he retreated from his enemy, after re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſanction the meaſure. If he entered the combat, his valour and intrepidity were exceeded by none. Never was a man farther from cruelty. Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war felt ſafe at his diſpoſal Compared with him, Alexander and the Caeſars looſe all their glory, as the ſtars their light by the riſing ſun. In ſhort, language can hardly expreſs his talents. He was uniform, and yet amazingly various. When we look on other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals we find one to excel in this thing and another in that. But Waſhington excelled in all. He was great in planning; and yet he was no better in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than carrying into execution. But that in which he ſeemed as it were to riſe above himſelf, was this, ſame did not reach him. He ſtood aloof from the eclat of an admiring world, like a ſtatue unmoved.

            <p>The greatneſs of this man appeared from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſkill in the ſyſtems of national policy After this great man retired from the field, the public opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of him was in part as it is of other men.

               </gap> be impoſſible he ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to equal greatneſs and fame. No ſooner was he promoted to the Preſidency, than the public mind was turned upon him, and prepared, at leaſt, to diſcover ſome weakneſs, ſome deficiency common to great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters. This idea which occupied the mind was the fruit of obſervation and analogical reaſoning. That tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſo numerous, ſo various and ſo extraordinary ſhould meet in one man was paſt credibility. Without proof equal to viſion it could not be admitted. This was the prepoſſeſſion of the public mind. But ſo ſoon as General Waſhington had opportunity to diſplay his political wiſdom, he roſe as a ſtateſman to as elevated a pinnacle, as by his military exploits. The truth was, his mind was great and his conceptions adequate to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry undertaking. He was a lover of mankind, and therefore he could not be a tyrant; and for the ſame reaſon, he could not ſettle into the oppoſite extreme. To exalt human felicity was his object, and he had genius to diſcern the meaſures and principles which would accompliſh the end. The beſt conſtitution of civil government ſeemed to be the natural growth of his mind, and to adminiſter to the greateſt advantage, was none beyond his abilities. When he took the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, he diſcovered the difficulties. The jarring and claſhing intereſt and paſſions of the various ſtates of the confederacy, would have been an infurmountable embarraſſment to any other mind. But in the firſt outſet, each ſtate of the union felt his impartiality, and was linked by his ſkill, and make willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce party conſiderations, and to look to Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as the patron and friend of the whole. When he came to the chair of ſtate, it was a ſeaſon of peculiar difficulty. Far were we from organization. Our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were miſerable, and our national credit beneath mediocrity. Foreign kingdoms looked to ſee us crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038304_0009_10119D398CB1E890"/>
but they were diſappointed in the reſult. This great chieftain and ſage of the nation, drew order from confuſion, and ſoon made America an aſylum for the oppreſſed, and the pride and aſtoniſhment of the whole world. As a ſtateſman, his character ſtands alone. The kings and politicians of ancient and modern Europe, are ſullied by Waſhington, as the moon by the uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the brightneſs of the morning. This his greatneſs will live to the lateſt ages.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of General Waſhington appeared from his wonderful foreſight in perceiving the reſult of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meaſures, through a complication of the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and perplexing circumſtances. Not to diminiſh from the wiſdom of others, nor to detract honor from any man, Waſhington, in this reſpect, was without a parallel. And herein his greatneſs will ever ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. His acquaintance with men and things was amazing. He knew their paſſions: he was appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of their views and objects. He let all circumſtances have their juſt weight and no more. And hence little changes did not affect him. He could ſee through a miſt of darkneſs which would wholly eclipſe the ſight of others. His mind was original, exact and clear in its conceptions. He was not haſty in accompliſhing his deſigns; and yet he was familiar with the reſult thro' a complication of the moſt intricate circumſtances. Cloſely did he cleave to the maxim of the wiſe man, that "<hi>in the multitude of counſellors there is ſafety;</hi>" yet his mind was independent and his actions without the leaſt tincture of party conſideration. This trait in General Waſhington's character can have no juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, becauſe ſo rare. It is too delicate and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to be touched with the pen. We may glance at it and wonder and that is about all we can do.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038304_0010_10119D3C2FB0F430"/>
in his private capacity, knew no other than the moſt eaſy fortune; and hence we might ſuppoſe him leſs likely to ſubmit with reſigned feelings to trying ſcenes. But, tho exalted by fortune, he was not voluptuous and effeminate. He had the hardihood of antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the beſt modern improvement. To meet extreme difficulties his patience and compoſure of mind were the moſt extraordinary. This example he exhibited both in the field and in the chair of ſtate. Without permanent reſources; with a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing body of troops, and the country very much diſheartened, he endured a whole year's embarraſſment in Jerſey and Pennſylvania. He could not fight for want of men. All he could do was to worry the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the chaſe of him; except by mere generalſhip, which inſtances were not a few. But, with almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to diſcourage and backen, he diſcovered not a ſymptom of impatience. Reſtleſs diſcontent was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him. If ever a perſon could be juſtified for want of compoſure, Waſhington would, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oudtedly, be the man; and yet he was at the fartheſt diſtance from any thing of the kind. This part of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did not appear to be a ſtudied buſineſs; it was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive feature in it. His patience was not apathy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, for no man had more tender and ſublime ſentiments than he. In his Preſidency many things occurred which would have diſcompoſed him, had he not been like a ſtrong fortreſs, perfectly above the reach of receiving the leaſt impreſſion in this part of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. As a vaſt rock in the midſt of the ſea, againſt which the beating billows roll without effect, ſtood the mighty Waſhington. He could bear inſults without complaining. He could receive the vileſt aſperſions for the beſt deeds, and be as compoſed and patient as if nothing had been done.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of General Waſhington appeared from his never having been elated by thoſe many and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed honors conferred on him. This feature in the character before us has been partly anticipated, and yet
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038304_0011_10119D3F357FA9D8"/>
ſomething more, I conceive, may be pertinently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. In the eſteem of the people at large through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the United States, this patriot ſtood vaſtly higher than any other man. He had his enemies, but even they were under the neceſſity of reſpecting him. The praiſes of Waſhington were reſounded from one end of the Union to the other. People differently educated, of oppoſite views and principles, varied not any in ſetting him up as the greateſt General and Stateſman in the world. This was not only done by the people at large; the great and the learned conſidered it as indubitable. It was not a mere ſilent opinion; but it was a matter expreſſed in the ſtrongeſt terms, and by actions of the moſt unequivocal import. General Waſhington was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly apprized of the light in which he was holden. It was none of it concealed from him. Let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that theſe honors were heaped upon him, at a period of life in which they would be very likely to flatter and elate. But his mind was ſo ſteady, ſo weighty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in its apprehenſions, that all theſe were without the leaſt apparent effect in giving him a more exalted opinion of himſelf. We know that to feel lifted up at ſame, is incident to human nature. Few have wiſdom and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſufficient wholely to conceal i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, even tho the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honor conferred be very moderate. Waſhington was an exception of ever diſcovering a ſymptom. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he even wept at the amazing parade in crowning him with laurels; and when he could decently, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the reach of thoſe who were prepared to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their ſentiments of reſpect in forms the moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Than this nothing could be a more ſtriking mark of General Waſhington's greatneſs.</p>
            <p>His greatneſs was farther manifeſt in his voluntarily retiring from the firſt office in the nation to the place of a common citizen. When he drew near the cloſe of the time, for which he had been elected to the Preſidency, he could not but have known, beyond heſitancy, that the people, with unanimous ſuffrages, were ready to raiſe him again to the ſame dignified ſtation. But this
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038304_0012_10119D41EA0825A8"/>
great man had a preference for the peaceful retreats of private life. In the boſom of man there is a thirſt for hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; but Waſhington had gained the maſtery over this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And what ſeemed greatly to corroborate it, was his accepting the appointment of Lieutenant General, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior office to that he had before bolden. If we trace antient and modern hiſtory, where ſhall we find a parallel inſtance. Cincinnatus may be mentioned; but this in every reſpect does not equal it. Do we find the kings of Europe, Aſia and Africa pulling off their crowns, and giving them to others, and humbling themſelves to the condition of common ſubjects? Not an inſtance of this kind can be produced. They hold power as long as they can, and this without conſulting the choice of thoſe over whom they reign. How different was Waſhington! He was willing to take the loweſt ſeat, and this was exaltation and greatneſs of the pureſt kind.</p>
            <p>Finally, the greatneſs of this man appeared from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent. It is almoſt univerſally the caſe, that characters which riſe the higheſt, do ſomething toward the concluſion, to fully their glory; but this great General and Patriot did nothing. His character was a finiſhed one. The laſt part was equal to the firſt. It grew brighter and brighter till the ſun went down. It was all greatneſs. And thus it was conſidered, not only by Americans; but by all the nations of the world. They gathered the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent in part from his writings, in part from his military achievements, and in part from his political knowledge and wiſdom diſplayed in the firſt office of the government. Attention to all theſe ſources entitled him to an acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſuperiority to any other man upon the globe. His legacy, how replete with wiſdom and depth of conception! His deeds, how unexceptionable, and fraught with every thing that was noble and conducting to national felicity and glory! So much in one man could not be hidden. It was beholden by an aſtoniſhed world, and Waſhington ſtands acknowledged the firſt, the greateſt of the human race. Thus I have obſerved ſome traits in General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's character, in which his greatneſs was very apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038304_0013_10119D44A0EE38B8"/>
I proceed in the ſecond place to notice the goodneſs of God, in raiſing up ſuch a character and continuing his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſervices, for ſo great length of time.</p>
            <p>We ſhall greatly fail in this part of the ſubject, if we omit conſidering, and letting it ſink into our minds, that the Lord God was the great potter and former of the character we have been unſolding. The greatneſs of it, in every reſpect, in all the inſtances in which we have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, was an effect of Almighty efficiency. It was the will of God to have ſuch a character, a veſſel of ſuch vaſt dimenſions; and, therefore, he ſaid, let it be, and Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was raiſed up. God's ultimate end in thus doing, as in every thing, was to diſplay himſelf. And his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs herein is very viſible to all of ſpiritual diſcernment.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſearch into the goodneſs of God in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter above ſpecified; and to help our memories and guide our judgments, let us take the following out-lines as a ſummary. The goodneſs of God in raiſing up General Waſhington and continuing his active ſervices for ſo great length of time, is ſtrikingly apparent, from the bleſſings conferred on the people of this country through his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality; from his example to future generations; from the influence his conduct may probably have with thoſe, who hereafter ſhall be raiſed to the ſame elevated ſtations; from the very weighty inſtruction and reproof herein giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to all tyrants and deſpots; and that God has hereby eſtabliſhed, by a viſible and acknowledged providence, one of the moſt eſſential points in the ſyſtem of revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> his abſolute ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>The goodneſs of God in raiſing up General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and continuing his active ſervices for ſo great length of time, is ſtrikingly apparent, from the bleſſings confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the people of this country through his inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. In eſtabliſhing our national independence, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington was an inſtrument greater than any other. By this no one will imagine there is the leaſt deſign to detract from other characters and fully their ſame. We have had many heroes and great ſtateſmen whoſe names will never be forgotten by a grateful people, and through whom God's
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038304_0014_10119D4649FD3C58"/>
goodneſs has been ſtrikingly exhibited. It is pleaded, however, that General Waſhington was undoubtedly the firſt and greateſt. To ſever this country from foreign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, was the will of heaven, and it was the decree, to do it by inſtruments and not by miracle. The man whoſe leſs we now mourn, was the principal inſtrument, and how great the goodneſs of God in raiſing him up! This may be ſet in the moſt obvious point of view, by conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering our national and individual bleſſings. As a nation, we are the proprietors of a free and happy country. We have not to croſs the wide Atlantic to conſult the pleaſure of our ſovereign. Our property is our own by indefeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tenure. We are built on the broad baſe of freedom, and our national government is in every view ſuch as good citizens will prize as one of the greateſt of temporal bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Nothing is wanting but good and pious hearts to make us the happieſt people on the globe Taking into view our civil privileges, the goodneſs of God is moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in raiſing up the inſtruments by which they are ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us. Among theſe, Waſhington was the principal. He, under God, has guided us through indeſeribable haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards to independence and national felicity. God was the efficient cauſe of the whole; and yet he gave exiſtence to the talents of this great man, and uſed them to accompliſh his benevolent deſign. And how good is the Lord, that he ſhould endow one in this country, with ſuch unequaled portions of integrity, wiſdom and fortitude, as to take us by the hand and lead us ſafely to a field of ſuch invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able privileges as thoſe we poſſeſs? We can never adore this goodneſs enough. And what heightens the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in raiſing up this great and diſtinguiſhed character, is, that we were favored with his active ſervices for ſo great length of time. We had the uſe of his abilities in ſituations the moſt hazardous for twenty-five years in ſucceſſion. When a nation begins to exiſt, then is moſt wanted the wiſdom of the wiſe. God ſaw our neceſſities, and did not withhold the bounty of his goodneſs. He gave us Waſhington to go before us, and to be with us, and to nouriſh us up to our preſent ſtate of national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038304_0015_10119D48E8C40130"/>
It would be infidelity itſelf not to notice the goodneſs of God in this matter. The eminent uſefulneſs of this great man we do not deny; that his being and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were from God is beyond heſitancy; and that the whole was the fruit of unmerited goodneſs, will be felt by all, but the vile and abominable.</p>
            <p>Our privileges in ſmall ſocieties and individual capacity are handed to us by God through the ſame channel of conveyance. The leaſt obſervation muſt lead us to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice it If foreign power could tax away our property at option and demand our young men to ſight their bloody battles, could any of us do otherwiſe than go mourning, and acknowledge ourſelves to be ſlaves and penſioners? But bleſſed be God it is not ſo with us; and why is it the reverſe? The Lord has wrought through the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of him, whoſe wiſdom and proweſs have given us freedom and independence and ſecured to us our property beyond the fear of having it divided without our conſent.</p>
            <p>The goodneſs of God is manifeſt in his raiſing up Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington and promoting him to the high offices he ſuſtained, from the conſideration, that his example ſtill exiſts and will never be obliterated from the memory of man. The force of example, experience teaches, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. Nothing can have a more baneful effect on a community than bad example, eſpecially in thoſe of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtations. Virtuous example has the contrary tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The reign of David over Iſrael was very unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and the happy influence of his example deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to future generations. We have the character of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington portrayed before our eyes, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's children will be the objects of its influence. And what ſpecial leſſon doth it enforce? To anſwer in a word, it bears teſtimony againſt immoral practices of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and paints virtue in charms which cannot eaſily be reſiſted. Waſhington is no more; but his example is a living monitor. This is a ſharper reproof to vice, than the threats of majeſty, or the terrors of the halter or the gibbet. The value of the example is greatly heightened, from the conſideration that it is well-known to all claſſes
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038304_0016_10119D4D64D70BA8"/>
of citizens from the higheſt to the loweſt. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is very viſible in this particular.</p>
            <p>From the influence his conduct may probably have with thoſe, who hereafter ſhall be raiſed to the ſame important ſtations, we may alſo ſee the goodneſs of God. If Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals in the field and Preſidents of Congreſs, ſhould be at a loſs how to ſteer amidſt perplexities which ſometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, they have a character before them from which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flows as a ſtream from its fountain. Having caught the mantle of this great ſtateſman, thoſe who fill the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeats in the government, it is ſanguinely hoped, will transfuſe its bleſſing to ages yet unborn. Waſhington, ſtanding at the head of the ſeries, will give complexion and features to what ſhall follow in the adminiſtration of this great and flouriſhing empire. At leaſt the ſentiment is not chimerical nor wholely improbable. This is a fruit of divine goodneſs.</p>
            <p>The goodness of God is manifeſt in raiſing up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this great man at the helm of the nation ſo long, from the very weighty inſtruction and reproof hereby giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to all tyrants and deſpots.</p>
            <p>The greater part of the eaſtern continent is ſubjected to deſpotiſm. The life and property of the ſubject are at the ſole pleaſure of the prince. Thirſt for power and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement is the governing paſſion. The obedience they receive is of the ſlaviſh kind; it proceeds not from love, but from fear of their vengeance. Well might they look to Waſhington and be inſtructed, that the higheſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a ruler, is to be juſt and benevolent, and that to have obedient and faithful ſubjects, is to prove himſelf their patron and friend. How reproved muſt ſtand thoſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots and hard hearted tyrants who have embrued their hands in innocent blood, by the bright example of this mighty hero and ſtateſman? Through the goodneſs of God, we have reaſon to conclude, they have felt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, at leaſt in ſome ſmall degree. The high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which General Waſhington has been holden by all the kings and princes on the globe ſeems to imply it. If ſo, the condition of millions in ſervitude is hopefully me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038304_0017_10119D50434F0FA8"/>
and rendered more tolerable in conſequence of the exiſtence of ſuch a character. If in this way th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of all events, be ſoftening the rigor of deſpotiſm, then his great goodneſs in raiſing up and continuing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington in the important ſtations he held ſo long, cannot but be clearly ſeen.</p>
            <p>The goodneſs of God is very ſrikingly exhibited in raiſing up the character we have been contemplating, ſince, through this providence, he has eſtabliſhed one of the moſt eſſential points in the ſyſtem of revealed religion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> his abſolute ſovereignty. By the ſovereignty of God is meant nothing which claſhes with infinite goodneſs. It is not an arbitrary procedure contrary to the reaſon and fitneſs of things. It is his creating and governing the world and all beings according to his own righteous pleaſure. The point is eſtabliſhed by natural religion. It is confirmed with additional clearneſs in the two teſtaments. Such paſſages as theſe evidence it to demonſtration. "<hi>He work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi>" "<hi>All things were made by him and for him.</hi>" "<hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy and compaſſion on whom be will have compaſſion.</hi>" "<hi>We are the clay and thou our potter.</hi>" The ſelf ſame ſentiment is forced upon the mind, by the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter we have been conſidering. The fact is this; God Almighty formed Waſhington a greater veſſel than almoſt any other, and in this way has proved his ſovereign right to make men to differ. In making ſome great and others ſmall he is juſtifiable, becauſe the clay is his. Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to object, why haſt thou made me thus? is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a moſt material point in the ſyſtem of revealed religion, corroborated by the goodneſs of God, in the acknowledged fact under conſideration. Let us then not diſpute the abſolute ſovereignty of God, till we ſacrifice our judgments on the altar of obſtinacy, and put out our eyes for fear of the light.</p>
            <p>Having noted inſtances of the goodneſs of God in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continuing this illuſtrious character for ſo great length of time; I ſhall thirdly, conſider the important inſtruction to be derived to the people of this country from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038304_0018_10119D55172C01C0"/>
his character, and the improvement, if wiſe, they will make of the providence of God in taking him out of the world.</p>
            <p>From the character of General Waſhington, the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of this country may derive many very ſpecial leſſons of inſtruction. With the help of this character they can have no heſitancy on whom to turn their thoughts to fill the moſt important offices in the government. It may be admitted as a ruling maxim, that thoſe who poſſeſs the neareſt likeneſs to this great warrior and ſtateſman, will have the firſt claim on our ſuffrages and influence. Waſhington poſſeſſed all the virtues and abilities requiſite to fit him to preſide over a nation, and, of courſe, thoſe who approach the neareſt to him in theſe reſpects will in future adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſt; till the bleſſed period ſhall arrive, when the Prince of Peace ſhall ſolve all nations into a happy kingdom and rule by his heavenly ſceptre.</p>
            <p>The people in this country may be farther inſtructed by this character, that vice and immorality utterly diſqualify a man for an important, public ſtation. The confidence of a people is not attainable by baſe characters. A man of diſorderly life will always be ſuſpected of a radical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Thoſe who fill the firſt offices ſhould be men in whom entire confidence may be repoſed without ſuſpicion. Waſhington was ſuch a man. And how happy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted have we been under his adminiſtration! And hence the people in this country, if ſuitably impreſſed, will cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avoid all characters of the oppoſite complexion in filling the chair of ſtate.

            <p>But it is time to deſcend to the laſt clauſe of that part of the ſubject under conſideration, and to ſearch after the improvement thoſe who are wiſe will make of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in removing General Waſhington by death. He who hath loved us, fought for us and worn out his life in the ſervices of his country, is now entombed in the ſilent grave. Never will he be ſeen more by mortal eye. Never will another ſpeech fall from his lips. He is gone where all muſt go, and this has been ordered by the wiſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038304_0019_10119D56ACD7D008"/>
diſpoſal of God. And what improvement ſhall we make of this affecting providence? Perhaps we may be almoſt ready to ſay, wherefore is it thus! Why ſhould the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner be ſuffered ſo ſpeedily to do his work! Could not his haſty ſteps have been a little retarded! Such thoughts muſt not be indulged. God's "<hi>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. Though clouds and darkneſs are round about him; yet juſtice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</hi>" It becomes us to ſubmit and kiſs the rod which is laid ſo heavily on us, and open our mouths in the language of inſpiration, "<hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>"</p>
            <p>In improving this death, we of this nation cannot but behold a thick and diſmal cloud ſuſpended over us. Our head, our greateſt counſellor, the man the moſt beloved and truſted to, is taken away. We have, therefore juſt occaſion for mourning. Our loſs is greater, than we yet imagine. It may well be ſenſibly felt, by every ſtate in the Union, by every ſmaller community, and by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. O Waſhington, thou are gone, but we will not forget thee! Thy great deeds, thy glorious achiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be engraven in letters of gold. When we look on our dear-bought freedom we will think of thee. When we count our treaſures, when we ſee our children growing up in a garden of delights, diſtant from the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of deſpotiſm, we will teach them to liſp thy name. We do weep for thee, and in broken accents, bid thee a long, laſt farewel.</p>
            <p>In improving this death, it becomes all the inhabitants of united America to lift up their ſervent prayer to God through his ſon, that the wiſdom and virtues of this great man deſcend and reſt on thoſe who hold the firſt offices in the nation. Ye civil fathers, we cannot but mingle the tears of condolence with you. You are deprived of a brother and a father. In perplexing ſituations, you looked to him for wiſdom and counſel; but he is taken from your head, our prayer is, that you, with ſubmiſſive hearts, catch hismantle, and ſtay yourſelves on the Lord.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>REVELATIONS xi, 17,</bibl>
               <q>"<hi>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned.</hi>"</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are an inference drawn by the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four elders from ſomething which preceded. They ſat before God on their ſeats and were furniſhed with the text I have read to you by the ſeventh angel. The declaration of the angel, or rather the found which proceeded from him, was followed with great voices in heaven, ſaying, "<hi>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign forever and ever.</hi>" On the hearing of this, the twenty-four elders, who ſat before God, fell upon their faces and worſhipped God, ſaying, "<hi>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art and waſt, and art to come; becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned.</hi>" What particularly dilated their hearts with praiſe and thankſgiving to God, was the wonderful effect produced by his almighty efficiency in cauſing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt. The twenty-four elders traced the effect to its true ſource and origin, and aſcribed it to the governing power of almighty God; "<hi>becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned.</hi>"</p>
            <p>When they ſaw Chriſt's kingdom riſing out of the ruins of the apoſtacy, and the wicked nations of this world ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his divine and heavenly ſceptre, they could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it on no other principle, than that God had the control of the diſpoſitions of men, to turn them according to his ſovereign pleaſure. In view of this, they proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves before him with the profoundeſt reverence, and ſhouted his praiſe in grateful thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>It would be an undue conſtruing of the text to ſuppoſe its ultimate reference to any other period, than to Chriſt's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038304_0022_10119D601C46B948"/>
ſpiritual reign in the ſeventh millinary; and yet it has a pertinent application to other times, and may be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated to very great advantage in the age in which we live. If all the bleſſings to be experienced, when all ſhall know the Lord, ſhall owe their origin to God, and derive their exiſtence from the conſideration, that God hath taken to himſelf his great power and hath reigned; then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a neceſſary conſequence, that all other bleſſings of whatever kind and whenever received, are of the ſame heavenly extract. This reaſoning, I conceive, will not be viewed by any, ſophiſtical and inconcluſive. If not, it is hoped the minds of the auditory are prepared with all readineſs to embrace the ſentiment, that all the bleſſings they receive, whether private, ſocial, national, or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſpring directly from this ſource, that God almighty hath taken to himſelf his great power and hath reigned. You will, therefore, let your minds go along with me in the diſcuſſion of the ſubject, with hearts uplifted to God, and not the leſs that this thankſgiving was not by public, but private notification.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a uſual cuſtom in the place in which this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was delivered, to have an annual thankſgiving lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho no proclamation be iſſued from authority.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In proſecuting the ſubject, I ſhall, in the firſt place, take into conſideration ſome of the peculiar bleſſings and benefits we enjoy. Secondly, Shall ſhew that theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and bleſſings are to be accounted for ſolely from this plain truth ſtated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to himſelf his great power and doth reign. Thirdly, I ſhall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his adminiſtration and abſolute control.</p>
            <p>Firſtly, We are to conſider ſome of the peculiar bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and benefits we enjoy. It is a great bleſſing to have ſuch an exiſtence as that of man.</p>
            <p>This will appear from a variety of conſiderations, ſome of which I ſhall enumerate. When we compare ourſelves with the various ſpecies of creatures that fall under our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038304_0023_10119D63020D5C30"/>
obſervation, how decided is our preference to be men, rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than animals of any other order. All creatures upon earth, except man, move by inſtinct and blind paſſion. They are capable of no improvement in ſubjects of a moral nature, and to diſcover the leaſt degree of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween virtue and vice, they have no ability. But man is endowed with noble faculties and is a capable ſubject of riſing higher and higher in knowledge and virtue to all eternity. A foundation being laid in us for ſuch vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, muſt endear exiſtence to every one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates the matter in a juſt light: To ſay the leaſt, to have ſuch an exiſtence, is a great benefit and bleſſing. But when we take into conſideration the amazing value conferred on our exiſtence by the Chriſtian religion. the favor is augmented beyond conception. The exiſtence of any creature is ever to be eſtimated according to the felicity it is capable of receiving. Man is to exiſt forever, and, if a Chriſtian, as he may be, if he will give Chriſt his heart, nothing ſhort of happineſs "<hi>which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard,</hi>" will be his certain and unfailing por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus contemplating the matter, we cannot but ſee the immenſe value of our exiſtence, and that to be endowed with ſuch improving faculties is a bleſſing of indeſcribable importance.</p>
            <p>It is a great bleſſing to have bodies ſo curious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made. The very ſhape and motion of man excite awe and reverence in the inferior orders of creatures and challenge ſuperiority. Our bodies are organized to be a ſuitable repoſitory for a rational ſpirit. They are ſo ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contrived as not to ſhackle the ſoul and prevent its moral and intellectual improvements. Well ſaid the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; "<hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, and in thy book all my members were written. How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Health is a peculiar benefit and bleſſing. The body, tho curiouſly organized, is yet delicate and expoſed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable diſadjuſtments. If any of the parts looſe their proper tone, the effect is ſenſibly felt through the whole. If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038304_0024_10119D66E09ABDA0"/>
it. Great exactneſs muſt be maintained in the human frame, or health will be impaired. Viſit hoſpitals and rooms of the ſick, and hear the groans of thoſe who are racked with pain, and deny, if poſſible, that health is a peculiar bleſſing.</p>
            <p>To have and enjoy a competency of the good things of this life, is a benefit which it would be ungrateful to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look. Laid in the balance with religion, theſe things are lighter than vanity; and yet, during our abode upon earth, they are indiſpenſible. God does not ſupport man by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, nor warm and clothe him otherwiſe than by means. In the cold of winter, without clothing, food and fuel, man would be immediately wretched. The piercing froſt would benumb his limbs, and gnawing hunger make him a prey to death. Looking, therefore, upon the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequences of being deprived of every worldly good thing, the benefit of the means of bodily ſupport cannot but be ſeen in its proper light.</p>
            <p>The benefits and advantages reſulting from ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in ſociety may well hold a high place in our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Man is formed for ſociety, and this is a great ſource of his happineſs. Exclude him from holding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with any of his ſpecies, and he is wretched. All his trials and difficulties muſt remain locked up in his own boſom. The organs of ſpeech and hearing would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to him. Here he muſt ſpin out his life without one kind look from any creature, or the hearing of one articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late note. To roam in ſolitude, how tedious, days and nights! but, on the other hand, open to man all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſociety, the family circle and every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, of friendly intercourſe, and what a large field of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and advantages diſcloſe to view. Is he under a cloud of adverſity, his friends ſtand ready to ſympathize. Has he pleaſures, they are doubled by imparting. It is to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety our moral and intellectual faculties are indebted for a great ſhare of their improvement, and, by often ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to another, Chriſtians are excited to a more vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous animation in the duties they owe to God and men. Thus ſociety is a peculiar bleſſing and benefit.</p>
            <p>Civil government is another diſtinguiſhed privilege and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038304_0025_10119D69DE040948"/>
bleſſing. Such are our paſſions, and ſuch the connection between men, that civil inſtitutions are abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. God has over-ruled in this matter, that men might be ſecured in their rights, and that the lawleſs and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient may be checked in their abominations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is written; "<hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ordinance of God; and they who reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good and thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have praiſe of the ſame. For he is a miniſter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain, for he is the miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi>" Thus we ſee the deſign of civil government. Its end is noble and a privilege granted to man of no inferior importance. That we might realize its utility, let us contemplate ſociety independen of it. Let us view the wicked and lawleſs without reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, at liberty to invade life and property at option. Were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thus circumſtanced, who would be ſafe and not be continually expoſed to the moſt baſe aggreſſions? All muſt be convinced, that wretchedneſs would be the unavoidable reſult. Neighbour would rob neighbour, and our ſtreets would be drenched in blood. Civil government is that, which, under God, ſecures life and property and ſtamps them with value. It is, therefore, an evident bleſſing, a benefit unſpeakably rich.</p>
            <p>Having purſued the ſubject thus far, bleſſings of another kind offer themſelves to our conſideration. By theſe are meant ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt. The goſpel, which brings life and immortality to light, is a treaſure ſo great, that every other dwindles to nothing holden in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it. The ultimate deſign of it, is not to teach men the arts and oeconomy of this world. It diſcloſes glad tidings of great joy, ſtates the grounds of admiſſion to the favor of God, and what we muſt do to be ſaved. The goſpel, therefore, is a bleſſing by itſelf and without a parallel.</p>
            <p>The philoſophers of antiquity had their conjectures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting a future ſtate, but they were the idle chimeras of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038304_0026_10119D6BB733AEF0"/>

               </gap> darkneſs. Ariſtotle, Socrates and Plato made attempts to reclaim men from the arms of vice; but their attempts were fruitleſs. If they preſcribed formularies, they had no authority to enforce them, and to ſhew of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>mmitted, they were as incapable as their moſt ignorant pupils. But the Son of Righteouſneſs has chaſed away every cloud of heatheniſh ignorance and ſuperſtition, and explained, to the loweſt capacity, the way of life. The goſpel aſſerts the doctrine of the atonement, and yet it has other concomitant bleſſings. The atonement and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are two things. In perfect juſtice, God might have made apropitiation for ſin, without ſaving the ſinner; and yet he grants eternal life to whomſoever he pleaſes. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſuppoſes an exemption from the penalty of God's righteous law, and admiſſion into his heavenly kingdom. In this is compriſed conviction of ſin, regeneration, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and a crown of righteouſneſs which fadeth not away. Thus I have noticed ſome peculiar bleſſings and benefits conferred upon man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhow that theſe benefits and bleſſings are to be accounted for ſolely from this plain truth ſtated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to himſelf his great power and doth reign. The reaſoning by which it may be made to appear that God governs, is eaſy, it is not far fetched. It is a neceſſary conſequence reſulting from the perfections of his nature. If God be the author of all things he muſt govern them. His government muſt be as extenſive as his works. Our ideas of God's government are too limited, if we ſuppoſe only ſome great things under his control, and others more minute, left out of his plan. The falling of a ſparrow to the ground and the numbering of the very hairs of our head, are matters of which he has the particular diſpoſal. And hence all the bleſſings we have enumerated are the immediate fruit of his almighty, governing efficiency. God governs in the matter of our exiſtence. For preſervation we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely dependent. In him we live, move and have our being. The favor of having a rational exiſtence above
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038304_0027_10119D705317C970"/>
other creatures, is becauſe God is at the head of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and has ſo ordered. When we contemplate our bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies ſo curiouſly formed, our improving faculties, the means of improvement, our health and ſtrength, our food and raiment, and con over the whole ſum of bleſſings generally called common, we can trace their origin no farther than to the reigning power of God. Men ſpeak of theſe things as matters of mere chance, and often praiſe their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for having planned affairs ſo luckily. They arrogate to themſelves all the glory, and conduct as if there were no God. Nevertheleſs, by arguments, a priori, the being of a God is found to be neceſſary, and by fair deductions <hi>a poſteriori</hi> his attributes and univerſal government are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively maintained. And hence, it is no infringement on the beſt <hi>logic</hi> to ſpeak as in the following ſentences. He maketh rich and he maketh poor, he exalteth and he ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Every ſpire of graſs, every blade of wheat, every degree of growth in an animal, is an effect of his mighty agency. He gives ſtrength to beaſts, and cauſes them to exerciſe it for man, as ſtrictly as he gave birth to creation, and governs in little things as eſpecially as in great. It is juſt ſo in reſpect to civil government. It is the Lord's. He holds the heart and volitions of every ruler from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt. By him kings reign, and princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree juſtice. If men mean evil, God means it for good. If they deſpiſe and refuſe to retain him in their knowledge, he will, nevertheleſs, be exalted, and from that very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter get to himſelf a great name.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity, with all its bleſſed effects, is known and enjoyed, becauſe God hath taken to himſelf his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and hath reigned. The covenant of redemption ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the Father and the Son, before the world began, was of the Lord. The coming, life, death, reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſuperintendence. He reigns in the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. "<hi>Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</hi>" Aſide from this, men will never know themſelves. They will glide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the broad road to ruin and perceive it not. Finite
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038304_0028_10119D749BDDAAC0"/>
art is inadequate to diſcover to them their hazardous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when diſplay of God's power is made, they will be pricked to the heart, and ſee themſelves to be poor, and wretched, and miſerable, and blind, and naked. Man is naturally diſinclined to ſee the light. His eyes are faſt ſhut againſt it. And to keep him blind, ſatan is always buſy. But the power of God ſupercedes every obſtruction, and produces the wonderful effect of convincing him of his real condition.</p>
            <p>The renovation of the heart, is becauſe God reigns and has the diſpoſitions of men at his command. The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect in the millennium, in cauſing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of Chriſt, is traced to this ſource. And there is no other way of accounting for the regeneration of any ſinner. "<hi>The new birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man; but of God.</hi>" Men are not converted as a reward for any thing previouſly done by them to purchaſe the change. They do not put themſelves into a ſalvable ſtate, by ſinning leſs, and ſo invite God to renew them. He is found of them, who ſought him not. He conquers the ſtubborn heart in the full ſtrength of its oppoſition, and, by his inviſible draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, captivates the ſoul to the obedience of faith.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians are kept from final apoſtacy by the ſame power by which they are regenerated. Chriſt takes care of his flock. He is the great ruling ſhepherd, and, therefore, none are loſt from his ſold. They are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto ſalvation. Thus the matter of ſaving ſinners, from beginning to end, is through the infinite reigning power of God. This has always been the caſe and will be till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his adminiſtration and abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol. Men, in general, will grant they are under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude to God; but what this gratitude ought ultimately to reſpect is not ſo commonly perceived and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. God is good to us, and therefore that we ought to make grateful returns to him, will not be conteſted.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038304_0029_10119D7780E75E78"/>
But if we love God on no higher principle, than that we ourſelves are made gainers by his goodneſs, our love is of a ſelfiſh kind, and our gratitude the fruit of a ſinful heart. "<hi>If ye love them that love you, what thank have ye:</hi>" For ſinners give to ſinners, in hopes to receive as much again. There is no love acceptable with God, ſhort of that which eſteems and adores him for what he is in himſelf; nor any gratitude fit to be ſo denominated, except thankſgiving which is put into exerciſe by the conſideration, that he takes to himſelf his great power and doth reign. Our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to gratitude remain to be unfolded. One obligation to give thanks to God for his univerſal reign, may be gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from analogy. Reaſoning from analogy reflects great light on many ſubjects in divinity. The point before us is not an exception. Holy beings are excited to devout thankſgiving, in view of the pleaſing truth, that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and things are under the abſolute control of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. We may be aſſured this was the caſe in regard to the twenty-four elders. "<hi>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned.</hi>" The ſaints in light and all the holy angels, are continually ſhouting, "<hi>Amen: bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdom, and thankſgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever.</hi>" The ſpring of the whole is, that God's reign extends to all events and circumſtances, and ſecures a final reſult in every view moſt eligible. Do then the inhabitants of the glorious world feel themſelves obligated to render thanks to God, becauſe he hath taken to himſelf his great power and doth reign? Is this the buſineſs of all pure and holy beings? If ſo, all men, yea, every rational creature in the univerſe is obligated imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to exerciſe a ſimilar diſpoſition toward God, and from the ſame conſideration. Becauſe, what is ſuitable for one order of rational beings, is ſo for another, ſince there is but one law and one lawgiver. Hence the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from analogy is concluſive, in eſtabliſhing our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible obligation to give thanks to God; becauſe he hath taken to himſelf his great power and doth reign,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038304_0030_10119D794CABD1F8"/>
and that we, and all creatures and things, are under his adminiſtration and abſolute control.</p>
            <p>Another obligation of gratitude ariſes from the infinite wiſdom and goodneſs of the divine government. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely powerful, wiſe and good, the plan of admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration which he hath adopted muſt be the beſt. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, would be to deny the perfections of God Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will act like itſelf, and hence, any other government than that which embraces the higheſt poſſible good, all things conſidered, is unworthy of Jehovah. Here then is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſufficiently excellent to awaken every ſoul to the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt thankſgiving. It is the beſt poſſible ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing of all beings and worlds. As our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to love God reſults from the moral excellency of his character, ſo one of the principal ſprings of gratitude origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates from the conſideration that he takes to himſelf his great power and reigns in infinite wiſdom and goodneſs. In the view of this particular, it will be obligatory for ever on all finite beings to exerciſe the higheſt ſtrains of thankſgiving, and this aſide from every thing ſiniſter. To do it, will be the glory and felicity of the ſpotleſs hoſts of heaven, and to refuſe it, will be the miſery and torment of the wicked in hell. A farther conſideration, which lays us under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing obligation to give thanks to God that we, and all creatures and things, are under his adminiſtration and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute control, is, that this is the ſource whence all true happineſs ſprings. Separate from a full perſuaſion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that God reigns, the glorified ſpirits above and all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians would ſink into a ſtate of wretchedneſs. If it be given up that God reigns, then it muſt be granted, either that ſome other being reigns, or that events are at the diſpoſal of blind chance. On either of theſe hypotheſes, what have the friends of God to rejoice their hearts, what have they to expect? If fatan governs, nothing but the fruits of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence can be in proſpect. And if the affairs of the univerſe are left to the guidance of chance, our very exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is caſualty, and every expectation of good to come is vain and groundleſs. But, bleſſed be God, the affairs of the univerſe are not ſo circumſtanced. All government

is his. He hath taken to himſelf his great power and doth reign. Here is happineſs, here is comfort for the friends of Zion. "<hi>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitudes of the iſles be glad.</hi>" In this belief there is no room for deſpondency. In the darkeſt hour, under the greateſt preſſure of affliction, there is joy for the upright in heart. "<hi>Altho the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine, the labor of the olive ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ail; and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut from the fold, and their ſhall be no herd in the ſhall; Yet I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>" The divine government, therefore, being the principal ſource, whence all holy intelligences do and will forever derive their felicity, it is ſuitable the grateful incenſe of our hearts ſhould aſcend to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his adminiſtration and abſolute control.</p>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>In conformity to the preceding diſcourſe, I ſhall ſuggeſt ſome conſiderations, which, by God's bleſſing, may ſerve to awaken your gratitude a freſh. Every favor you enjoy whether private, ſocial, national or ſpiritual, is the fruit of the reigning agency of the Almighty. Your daily ſupplies are his free donation. Is your cup full? the Lord hath fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Have you good meaſure, preſſed down and running over? you have received it from your divine benefactor. This has been a year of fat things. Your houſes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries will bear me out in the aſſertion. No blighted har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, no deſtructive hurricane, no deluging flood, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring inſects, hath God ſent this year, to cut you ſhort of a plentiful ſupply for yourſelves, your children and your cattle. He has not ſuffered the deſtroying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to come nigh your dwellings. You have heard of the raging peſtilence in ſome of our capital cities; but you are alive this day with your little ones. You ſet under your own vines and fig-trees and have none to moleſt you or make you afraid. As citizens you enjoy a government founded on benevolent principles and happy in its admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration. Not another nation on the globe can compare with us in freedom and felicity. We have been envied
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038304_0032_10119D7F43A08338"/>
our privileges, and numerous attempts have been made to deprive us of them. Times not a few, thick darkneſs has hovered over our heads, and we have been threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with devaſtation and death. Our profoundeſt politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have been often perplexed and could ſee no light. But the ſhades of night are diſſipated, and proſpects the moſt pleaſing open before us. All theſe favors and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſult from the governing agency of the Almighty. This being true, will any be backward to come into the ſentiments and feelings of the twenty-four elders and ſay, "<hi>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come; becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned?</hi>" God has a juſt right to the grateful emotions of your hearts. And do you enter his gates, this day, with thankſgiving and his courts with praiſe? Do your hearts burn within you in view of God's univerſal reign? Are your ſouls in haſte to break forth in theſe holy ſentiments? Thou art our God, and we will praiſe thee; thou art our God, and we will exalt thee. In return for thy bleſſings, we have no equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent to repay thee; but we will not ceaſe to adore thy government. Thou ſhalt have our humble thankſgiving. It is thy claim, and our reaſonable ſervice.</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe the ſubject, I cannot omit bringing up to your recollection the marvellous work of God in the converſion of ſinners within the compaſs of the preſent year. Converts have been multiplied in places in every direction. Miniſters and miſſionaries have been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bleſſed. Saints have ſhouted for joy, and Chriſt has been glorified. But, not to burthen your memories and ſwell the diſcourſe to an undue length, the diſplay of God's ſovereign grace in this town, to which you have been eye witneſſes, calls for the grateful emotions of your ſouls, and all that is within you. When we contemplate the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord, the diſmal night of ſtupidity and darkneſs which preceded it, and the inſufficiency of means and inſtruments to effect any thing of the kind, we are neceſſitated to aſcribe the whole to the reigning power of almighty God. The
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038304_0033_10119D83C06983B8"/>
Lord hath wrought wonderfully, becauſe "<hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion.</hi> Not to acknowledge his ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this matter, implies a heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. You will not heſitate to ſay: "<hi>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>" How precious the blood of Chriſt, and how infinite his grace to pave the way for ſuch a work! The ſalvation of one ſinner in point of importance, is as far beyond every thing temporal, as the heavens are high above the earth. And have you come prepared to give God the glory which is due to his name? In looking and pondering on the matter, let us never forget, that this work hath been wrought becauſe, he hath taken to himſelf his great power and hath reigned. This being true, there is every encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement for prayer. All hearts are in his hand and he can turn them whitherſoever he will. Does God thus reign, and are the fruits of his government ſuch? We ought to be humble in the duſt, that we have not ſeen more of it, been more delighted with it, and praiſed him in higher notes of thankſgiving. Is the Lord ſuch a God? reſolve this day to be entirely his.</p>
