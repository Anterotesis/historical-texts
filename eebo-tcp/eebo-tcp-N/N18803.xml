            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>TAKING advantage of the prevailing rage for Novels, the vehicles by which the moſt fatal poiſon is often conveyed to the heart, I ſend theſe Volumes into the world, with the humane intention, perhaps preſumptuous hope, of counteracting the effects of ſuch productions, by inſpiring my young Readers with juſter ſentiments, and a more correct taſte, than what is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acquired by peruſing books of mere amuſement.</p>
                  <p>To beguile the remembrance of real and recent misfortunes, by relating a ſtory, the incidents of which are partly fictitious, I have been inſenſibly led to compile this little Work: But though the ſtory is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to fancy, the reflections with which it is interſperſed, are thoſe of ſentiment, and flow directly from the heart.</p>

Should the friends in whom mine is moſt tenderly intereſted, reap either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or improvement from this Work—ſhould I, by means of it, inſpire one vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous aim, or cheriſh one pious ſentiment in the minds of youth, I ſhall ſubmit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly to the award of an impartial Public with reſpect to its literary merit, of which I am not qualified to judge; but which, in my eſtimation, is comparatively of little importance.</p>

                  <p>THE ſpirit of true valour which animated the heroes in the age of Louis XIV, was not confined to France. The contagious manners of a voluptuous monarch, and a licentious court, had not yet diffuſed themſelves through the people of England; and their ancient ſpirit ſeemed to revive, at the very moment when the rival powers of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope required that England ſhould take a decided part in their quarrels, in order to preſerve that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance on which their mutual ſafety depends.</p>
                  <p>Adverſity is often the parent of virtue. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic troubles in which that kingdom had lately been involved, not only gave a check to the progreſs of vice and luxury, but led men to think juſtly, which is the firſt ſtep towards acting nobly.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe who, diſguſted with the purſuit of pleaſure, or indulgence of ſloth, wiſhed to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves in the field of glory and fame, were the young Earl of Granville, and his friend Mr. Seymour.—The name of a Condé inſpired them with an ardent ambition, not only to ſhare in his glory, but to emulate his virtues. Accordingly, having no parents to controul them, or combat what ſome would deem a romantic enthuſiaſm, they embarked for France; reached the army
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024442_0005_0FC73B12C27BF0C8"/>
which was then encamped at Siennes, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced themſelves to the Prince, as two young ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of fortune, who wiſhed to fight under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whilſt oppoſing their common enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is needleſs to ſay that our young heroes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no opportunity to eſcape of ſignalizing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo ſucceſsful were they in their various enterprizes, that at the peace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville was poſſeſſed of a Captain's and Mr. Seymour of a Colonel's commiſſion. The former returned to England, but the latter entered into the ſervice of the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>Tired at length with the fatigues of war, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Seymour determined to abandon them for a life of domeſtic quiet. He returned to his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which acquaintance with others had only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to endear. With part of his paternal fortune he purchaſed a retired and beautiful farm. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an amiable woman, reflected on the various bleſſings he poſſeſſed, and reſolved to be happy.</p>
                  <p>Habit, however, is often more powerful than principle. Accuſtomed to an active life, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his mind languiſhed for want of employment. His haughty and imperious temper, which he had been at no pains to ſubdue, having now no objects for its exerciſe, degenerated into peeviſhneſs, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, and diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>His gentle partner bore her ſhare of this unequal yoke with patient ſubmiſſion. Perhaps, had ſhe exerted a little more ſpirit, the demands made on her forbearance would neither have been ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor ſo frequent; but her ſoul was of that ſenſitive nature, which ſhrinks from the approach
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024442_0006_0FC73B14365AEEA8"/>
of ſtrife or unkindneſs; and ſhe reſolved quietly to bear, what ſhe had neither ſtrength to oppoſe, nor ſkill to remedy.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Seymour was determined in the choice of his reſidence, from its vicinity to the Caſtle of Haſtings; the ſeat of his ancient friend Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, who was in truth one of the moſt reſpectable characters of that age. He had early imbibed thoſe juſt notions of honour, that fortitude, magnanimity, and love of true glory, and all thoſe exalted virtues which were diſplayed in the conduct of a Villeroy, a Condé, and a Turenne. But, along with theſe, he had cheriſhed alſo the gentler virtues of the heart: The former ſerve to recommend us to the eſteem of others; but it is from the latter we muſt derive our ſelf-enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>With all theſe advantages, the character of Lord Granville was ſtrongly marked by ambition and high notions of birth. Conſcious of having deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the favour of his ſovereign, his claims, perhaps, bore a juſter proportion to his deſerts than to the power of his maſter; whoſe profuſion and love of pleaſure deprived him of the means of rewarding merit, by leading him to beſtow his favours chiefly on thoſe who contributed at once to his enjoyment and his infamy.</p>
                  <p>Diſguſted with the Court, the manners of which incurred both his hatred and contempt, he retired to the ſeat of his anceſtors, where, following the natural bias of his exalted mind, he ſtrove to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs, as he had formerly done the glory, of his country.</p>
                  <p>He married his couſin Lady Louiſa Howard; who, by the prudence of her mother, had been
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024442_0007_0FC73B19B3275258"/>
ſheltered in the quiet of retirement from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral contagion; that lady chooſing rather, by living in the country, to deprive her daughter of the high poliſh of a court, than to ſtain the purity of her mind, by expoſing her to its corrupting manners and example.</p>
                  <p>A year after their marriage, Lord Granville's happineſs received a greater addition than he thought it could admit of, by the birth of a ſon; and before other two expired, his lady preſented him likewiſe with a daughter. But the laſt only ſurvived long enough to make her excellent parents experience the whole bitterneſs of ſorrow; by giving early proofs of talents fitted to adorn a public ſtation, and virtues to endear a domeſtic character.</p>
                  <p>The ſtricteſt intimacy had ſubſiſted in early life, between Lady Granville and Mrs. Seymour, whoſe education had been carried on together under the inſpection of Lady Howard. And though neither of theſe young ladies poſſeſſed that ſanguine temper and lively imagination, which gave birth to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of friendſhip, they felt for each other that ſettled eſteem and complacency which often forms the moſt laſting attachments.</p>
                  <p>Theirs was afterwards ſtrengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by conſtant intercourſe between the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and acquired a peculiar tenderneſs from their mutual diſtreſſes: For it is certain, thoſe ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable connections are ever the moſt laſting, which take their riſe from mutual dependence and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy.</p>
                  <p>In the kind and gentle boſom of Mrs. Seymour, Lady Granville repoſed that tender ſorrow which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024442_0008_0FC73B1C76DCEFE8"/>
the loſs of her daughter occaſioned, and which the fear of increaſing the diſtreſs of a huſband ſhe fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, made her repreſs in his preſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſufferings of Mrs. Seymour from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bad humour of the Colonel, were of a very different nature; and though they could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the obſervation of her friend, yet ſo ſacred did ſhe hold the weakneſs of a character, with which ſhe was ſo nearly connected, that ſhe never mentioned them, but with a view to palliate what ſhe vainly endeavoured to hide, and never could hope to amend.</p>
                  <p>The temper of Colonel Seymour, however, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſibly changed, by an event equally agreeable and unexpected. After having been ſeveral years married without children, Mrs. Seymour was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a fine girl, who awakened in the boſom of her father ſenſations the moſt tender and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and agreeably employed his mind in forming ſchemes for her future education and improvement.</p>
                  <p>The birth of this child was conſidered by Lady Granville as the happieſt circumſtance that could befal her friend; nor did it ſeem of much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to herſelf. The young Lord Haſtings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſent about this time on a viſit to his grandmother, Lady Granville felt, that the death of her daughter, and abſence of her ſon, was a trial too great for her weak ſpirits to ſupport: Heaven ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſent this child to ſupply, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the void thus left in her heart. She viſited Springwood every day, and never failed to careſs the ſweet innocent with all a mother's fondneſs. Mrs. Seymour, well knowing the attachment Lady
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024442_0009_0FC73B1DF79C5018"/>
Granville had to the name of Louiſa, which her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented child had borne, requeſted her to become godmother to the little ſtranger, and to allow it to be chriſtened by that name.</p>
                  <p>"I receive with gratitude this inſtance of your delicate attention," replied Lady Granville; "but, indeed my beloved friend, though I accept the name, you muſt pardon me for declining the office of godmother. An oath is of two ſacred a nature to be unneceſſarily undertaken; the parents are certainly the moſt proper ſponſors for their children: I have never aſked any perſon to ſtand for mine, becauſe I think this not only a uſeleſs ceremony, but, with the generality of the world, a criminal profanation of a moſt ſacred engagement."</p>
                  <p>For ſome time the lovely Louiſa ſeemed to reſtore peace and even cheerfulneſs to the boſom of her parents.</p>
                  <p>Their fondneſs for her was great, but it was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the beauty and ſweetneſs of their little dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Her time was divided between them and Lord and Lady Granville, whoſe affection for her ſeemed almoſt equal to that which nature inſpires.</p>
                  <p>Her education, during the firſt years of her life, agreeably occupied thoſe hours which uſed to hang heavy on the hands of her fond father; and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued to ſuperintend himſelf her progreſs in thoſe branches which required the aid of ſuperior maſters. In the midſt of theſe agreeable occupations, however, the family at Springwood received a ſhock, which being alike unfortunate and unforeſeen, produced the moſt fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:024442_0010_0FC73B2035D89B60"/>
The Colonel's fortune, conſiſting of fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, he was adviſed to ſecure in the funds; and for that purpoſe had collected and placed it in the hands of an eminent broker, who was to have tranſacted the buſineſs the very day on which he died. His affairs were found in the greateſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and after every attempt to aſſert his juſt claims, the Colonel could only recover three of the fifteen thouſand.</p>
                  <p>This blow, to a man advanced in years, chagrined in temper, and declining in health, was indeed a dreadful one. The Colonel was neither poſſeſſed of that philoſophy which teaches us to bear patiently what we cannot eſcape, nor ſoothed with that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which palliates the bitterneſs of diſappointed hope with the aſſurance of certain felicity.</p>
                  <p>To a perſon about to quit life, one would think the goods of fortune would ſeem trivial and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; but the mind graſps at thoſe objects in which it has long delighted, and feels its fondneſs for them increaſe, by the near proſpect of a ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel ſtrove to brave the ſtorm, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this ſtroke with the reſolution of a ſoldier. The hardy oak proudly oppoſes the whole fury of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is ſcorched by the lightning, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the tempeſt; whilſt the humble willow, by gently yielding to its force, preſerves ſecure its unenvied ſtation. Such were the different tempers with which the Colonel and his amiable wiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered adverſity, and ſuch too were the different effects produced by it.—Colonel Seymour did not long lament his loſs of fortune; a ſudden ſtroke of the palſy put a period to that life, which was already wearing towards its cloſe.</p>

Though the diſtreſs and conſtant inquietude which his caprice and illhumour had inflicted on his gentle partner, were now no more; yet after his death, ſhe experienced pangs a thouſand times more ſevere than any his harſhneſs had occaſioned. In the grave of a friend we bury all his foibles; there we ſacrifice our little diſguſts and reſentments: Time, whilſt it throws a ſacred veil over his errors, ſerves alſo greatly to magnify his virtues. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them without thoſe ſhades which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of human nature had mingled with them,—we feel our irreparable loſs,—we deplore it,—and the tenderneſs of melancholy, uniting with the admiration of virtue, gives birth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a ſentiment too exquiſite to be defined; and which, by conſtantly accompanying the idea of our departed friend, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our mournful recollection of paſt pleaſures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more delightful than the enjoyment of ſuch as are preſent.</p>
                  <p>At leiſure to reflect on the various ſituations and infirm health of Colonel Seymour, his afflicted wife found a thouſand reaſons to excuſe, and even juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his capricious temper. A thouſand proofs of his tenderneſs ruſhed on her mind; and ſhe accuſed herſelf continually of having been impatient under the one and ungrateful for the other. Unhappy effect of an exceſs of the moſt amiable virtues, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ingenuity!</p>
                  <p>The friendſhip of Lady Granville ſuſtained at this trying juncture the feebleneſs of her mind, and aided the efforts of her reaſon, to diſpel the cloud with which grief had enveloped it. Her heart found its chief conſolation in the innocent endearments and watchful attentions of her charming daughter,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024442_0012_0FC73B2A11D552A8"/>
who was now become the only ſource of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the only object of her care.</p>
                  <p>The ſingular beauty of her perſon, whilſt it flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the vanity of a mother, awakened in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom a variety of apprehenſions. She never regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the loſs of fortune on her own account; but when ſhe conſidered the dangers and mortifications to which it would ſubject her child, accuſtomed to aſſociate with people in a ſuperior rank, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the proſpect of an independent fortune, her heart died within her; nor was this the chief ſource of her inquietude. She early diſcovered in Louiſa, that refined and ingenuous ſenſibility, which would at once expoſe her to the moſt exquiſite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and incapacitate her for ſupporting them.</p>
                  <p>The various anxities that preyed on her mind, enfeebled her body, and impaired her health with terror and anguiſh. Louiſa ſaw her daily declining. Afraid to awaken thoſe apprehenſions in the boſom of her mother, which ſhe could no longer baniſh from her own, ſhe communicated her fears to her ſympathiſing friend Lady Granville; who, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a call in paſſing, brought an eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to viſit Mrs. Seymour. He made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pronounce her in danger of a decline, and adviſed immediate change of climate as the only poſſible means of prolonging her life.</p>
                  <p>It was a neceſſary, but painful office, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this information to Mrs. Seymour. Lady Granville did ſo in the moſt cautious manner.—<q>Think not, my watchful friend, replied ſhe, that I am either ignorant of my malady, or ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my danger. Death has for ſome time
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024442_0013_0FC73B2B80AA5578"/>
been familiar to my thoughts, and, as far as was allowable, the object of my wiſhes. That I have hitherto been ſilent on this ſubject, proceeded entirely from averſion to give you pain, and to afflict my beloved child, whoſe heart, alas! is but too ſenſible to every diſtreſs of her mother's.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If we muſt part, to you I confide my treaſure; on you I rely for ſupplying her loſs, and even teaching her to forget it, by your generous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant friendſhip.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lady Granville was deeply affected by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and after the moſt ſolemn aſſurances of fidelity to the truſt repoſed in her, urged Mrs. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to conſent to going abroad without delay. She oppoſed her arguments with a variety of pleas; at laſt, looking tenderly at her friend, and pauſing for a moment, <q>Why, why, my deareſt Lady Granville, ſhould you be thus anxious to preſerve a life, which is evidently haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to a period; and which I cannot even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but at an expence which my little fortune can ill ſupport. You know the whole amount of Colonel Seymour's effects does not exceed three thouſand pounds; a ſum by no means adequate to the expenſive education of Louiſa, and which, if I cannot increaſe by my oeconomy, I will at leaſt never diminiſh in the way of a doubtful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. With me, indeed, its effects are not doubtful, ſince I am convinced by my feelings, that I never can recover.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lady Granville ceaſed to urge her friend; but on her returning home, wrote her the following letter, incloſing a draught on her banker for a thouſand pounds.</p>

                  <p>It being now the month of September, there was no time to loſe in making preparations for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Mrs. Seymour and her daughter. About this time, Lord and Lady Granville received the moſt lively ſatisfaction by the return of Lord Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from an academy where he had ſpent the laſt ſix years. The maſter of it, having long officiated as chaplain in the regiment commanded by Colonel Seymour, had recommended himſelf to the eſteem of all the officers, by his good ſenſe, liberal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unaffected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ety; and by his unaſſuming manners and ſtrict regard to his duty, was revered even by thoſe who lived in the conſtant violation of theirs—Such is the power of real goodneſs!</p>
                  <p>The advantages to be reaped from ſuch an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, were too many, not to over balance, in minds like Lord and Lady Granville's, the natural deſire of having their only ſon placed near them. And as Dr. Melville complained, that the frequent avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons occaſioned by the holidays, had a bad effect in diſſipating the minds of his young pupils, and giving them habits of inattention, his fond parents ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their indulgence to his improvement, and never brought him home but a Chriſtmas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:024442_0017_0FC73B39F0170130"/>
Nine months had elapſed ſince his laſt viſit at the caſtle, and the change which that time had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on his perſon, was remarked with admiration by all its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>He had juſt reached his twenty-ſecond year; a period, when young men of rank too often appear in a diſagreeable light, either from the rude indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or affected petulance of their manners. Equally remote from the clown and the coxcomb, Lord Haſtings appeared with that modeſty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve which agreed ſo well with the dignity of his aſpect, and ſingular elegance of his perſon, that it was as impoſſible to behold him without complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as to liſten to him without admiration. His fine intelligent eyes convinced one before he ſpake, that one had every thing noble to expect from the mind that informed them; and as their expreſſion varied with every varying ſentiment, the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart took an immediate intereſt in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>It is highly flattering to our ſelf-love, to find our firſt impreſſions confirmed. The character of Lord Haſtings did more than fulfil the agreeable preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to which the firſt ſight of his perſon gave birth.</p>
                  <p>It was impoſſible that two young people, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly amiable as Miſs Seymour and Lord Haſtings, could behold each other with indifference; but wholly unaccuſtomed to the ſociety of women, he felt himſelf embarraſſed in her preſence; and from a ſort of ſecret conſciouſneſs, appeared deficient even in ſuch little attentions as politeneſs teaches thoſe who do not feel their propriety; but which his natural ſenſibility and good taſte would certainly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024442_0018_0FC73B3B3AB140D8"/>
have led him to pay any other woman. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration her beauty excited was a ſentiment wholly new and delightful; but his heart was in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from any other, as the opportunities of ſeeing Miſs Seymour ſeldom occurred; and her attention was ſo entirely engroſſed by her mother, that ſhe ſcarcely ever ſpent an hour at the caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Every thing being adjuſted for their departure, Mrs. Seymour and her charming daughter took a very tender leave of Lord and Lady Granville. Lord Haſtings was preſent at this interview, and felt himſelf deeply affected by the behaviour of Louiſa; who, on embracing her benefactreſs, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly to forget that there were any witneſſes of her emotions, and burſting into tears, with much difficulty articulated theſe words: "Oh Lady Granville! what do I not owe you?—Perhaps the life of my beloved parent!—But heaven will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you,—I never, never can."</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings preſented her his hand; her's trembled exceedingly from the agitation of her mind. He conveyed her to the chaiſe, in which her mother waited for her; he wiſhed Mrs. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour every advantage ſhe could poſſibly deſire from her journey; he would have ſaid ſomething to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, but the ſight of her lovely face, bedewed with tears, deprived him of utterance. He had time only to bid her adieu, the chaiſe drove off, and left him in a ſtate of mind equally new and agitating; the cauſe of which he did not diſcover, becauſe, perhaps, he was at no pains to inquire.</p>
                  <p>On his entering the parlour, the converſation na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally turned on the travellers. Both Lord and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024442_0019_0FC73B3CB5EE0F90"/>
Lady Granville joined in the higheſt encomiums on the character of Mrs. Seymour, and the ſingular beauty and ſweetneſs of her daughter; whoſe filial piety Lady Granville praiſed, with the enthuſiaſm of a friend, and the fondneſs of a mother.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech Louiſa had made at parting dwelt on the mind of Lord Haſtings; and no ſooner did his father leave the room, than he eagerly demanded an explanation of it from Lady Granville.</p>
                  <p>She heſitated a few moments, and then taking out of her pocket the two letters ſhe had received a fortnight before—"The occaſion of theſe, my dear Henry," ſaid ſhe, "was my ſending a draught to my valuable friend, to defray the expence of a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which ſhe would not undertake, for fear of encroaching too far on her daughter's ſlender fortune.—Heaven grant this journey ſucceſs!"</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings read the letters with the moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt attention; on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iniſhing that from Louiſa, he aroſe with viſible emotion, returned them to his mother, and graſping her hand, which he preſſed to his lips, he looked at her for ſome moments with eyes that ſpoke both love, gratitude, and admiration; then, heaving a ſigh, he exclaimed,—"Oh may I never, never give pain to a ſoul ſo tender, ſo gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as yours!" and haſtily quitted the room.</p>
                  <p>He retired to his own apartment, and full of the ſcenes which had juſt paſſed, took up his pen, and addreſſed his friend Mr. Beaufort, with whom he had long been accuſtomed to ſhare every thought; and who had gone lately to the univerſity at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, whither he was ſoon to follow:</p>

                        <p>As I never can enjoy any ſatisfaction in which my dear Beaufort does not partake, I haſten to tell you, that the tenderneſs with which I am treated by the beſt of parents, makes me almoſt forget the abſence of my friend. Often have we admired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the great, the awful virtues of a Cato, a Brutus, and a Fabius: but with what ſuperior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light do I contemplate thoſe of a mild, gentle, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic nature, which are daily diſplayed at the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Haſtings! With what reverence do I behold the generoſity, with what gratitude feel the affection of Lord and Lady Granville; who, forgetting the authority of parents, condeſcend to treat me with the confidence and familiarity of friends.</p>
                        <p>Upon my arrival here, I was introduced by my mother to her moſt intimate friend, the widow of Colonel Seymour; and her daughter, a beautiful girl about ſeventeen. The former appears to be ſenſible, modeſt, and agreeable, but in a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate of health. I would attempt a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latter, but am aware of your raillery. I will confeſs, however, I never ſaw ſo intereſting a countenance, or ſo much beauty joined with ſuch engaging ſimplicity. For the laſt quality, ſhe is probably indebted to her retired manner of life, which has been ſpent here at a ſweet romantic farm called Springwood, purchaſed by Colonel Seymour, on account of its nearneſs to the caſtle; he and my father having been intimately acquainted when abroad.</p>

The delicacy of her form agrees with that of her mind; I fear ſhe poſſeſſes too great a ſhare of that ſenſibility, which, though the ſource of our moſt exquiſite enjoyments, often too occaſions our moſt laſting inquietudes; by expoſing us to danger from every quarter, and rendering us vulnerable on every ſide. To be ſerious, Beaufort, I ſhould reckon an attachment to Miſs Seymour a very real misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. She ſeems perfectly amiable, and qualified to adorn any ſtation; but you are no ſtranger to the high ſpirit of my father, and cannot doubt that he would greatly diſapprove of his only ſon entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſerious paſſion for the daughter of a private gentleman, with ſcarce any other patrimony than the liberal education he has beſtowed on her.</p>
                        <p>I am extremely concerned for the ſituation of poor Talbot; his misfortunes will not be the leſs ſeverely felt, for being the conſequence of his own folly.</p>
                        <p>Poor fellow! he has many good qualities; but a certain pliancy of diſpoſition, joined to an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate love of pleaſure, is his ruin. Could you wean him from the worſt of all vices, gaming, I ſhould ſtill have hopes of his reformation; but that I fear is impoſſible. Take what method you judge moſt proper of conveying the incloſed to him; do not mention my name; but, if poſſible, prevent its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laviſhed on villains and ſharpers.</p>

                        <p>I am pleaſed, my dear Henry, by my promiſe to you, to be under the neceſſity of indulging myſelf. You may be aſſured no employment can be half ſo agreeable as that by which my ſon may reap either pleaſure or improvement.</p>
                        <p>It was with peculiar ſatisfaction I remarked during your laſt viſit, that your ſtudies had not been confined to what was only elegant and entertaining, but that you had made ſcience rather than literature the object of your purſuit.</p>
                        <p>The poſſeſſors of the former are ever modeſt and reſerved; thoſe of the latter are generally proud and loquacious. The ſphere of real knowledge is very narrow, but the immenſity of ſpace lies open to hypotheſis, the favourite buſineſs of Literature.</p>
                        <p>The extent of her domain renders her inſolent, and the deference paid to her opinions teaches her to over-rate her powers. The caſe is quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with Science. Not content with the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, ſhe explores truth by the help of her own eyes; but conſcious that theſe are liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and take in only a very limited proſpect, ſhe is afraid to pronounce dogmatically on any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She never impiouſly attempts to paſs the boundaries which have been aſſigned her by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is ever more ready to aſſume the character of the pupil than the preceptor.</p>
                        <p>Good taſte, my dear Henry, is a powerful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor to reaſon in the conduct of life. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

of moral beauty is much akin to that of natural; and a mind capable of receiving vivid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the latter, will eaſily feel the influence of the former. Strive then to cultivate the love of every thing great, ſublime, and beautiful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the natural or moral world; you will find this a powerful preſervative againſt thoſe dangers to which your youth, rank, and fortune peculiarly expoſe you. Unhappily they attack us moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully at that period, when we have neither ſtrength to reſiſt, nor ſkill to elude their force; but good taſte, uniting with good principles, will enable you to ſtand your ground, and even baffle all the arts of ſeduction.

                        <p>Poliſhed, or, in other words, luxurious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are peculiarly favourable to the growth of ſelf-love; there, individuals feel ſo many wants, that their attention is chiefly engroſſed by private concernments.

yet let me warn you, not to be impoſed on by thoſe who are improper objects of your bounty. In this caſe, your intended charity not only deprives the virtuous poor of their claims, but proves an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to vice and ſloth. It is neceſſity, not choice, that incites the lower claſſes of mankind to action; and were the indigent ſecure of food and clothing from the opulent, there would be a final ceſſation of induſtry; and then what dreadful diſorders would enſue?</p>
                        <p>The deſire of knowledge at your age is both natural and proper; but take care that your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit be properly directed. Metaphyſical refinements and diſquiſitions, whilſt they flatter the pride of man, miſlead his judgment, and corrupt his heart; and whilſt they deceive him with promiſes of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior light, ſteal from him inſenſibly thoſe hopes and fears, which Omniſcience has aſſigned as the great ſprings of human conduct; and plunge him at length in darkneſs and deſpair. Religion is the only ſure baſis of morality. Do not even its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies confeſs this, when they term it a political en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? In truth, human ſociety cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of religion; and the wiſeſt legiſlators have acknowledged, that it was ſafer for the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to have a fabulous creed, than none at all.</p>
                        <p>Make religion then, my dear Henry, a ſubject of attentive enquiry; but always remember it is its evidence, not its doctrines, of which you are to conſtitute reaſon the judge. Whatever is derived from a Being of infinite wiſdom muſt be ſuppoſed to contain many things above human comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                        <p>I have juſt been examining with attention, the abſurd and monſtrous opinions entertained by the heathen world, of the nature and attributes of the Deity, and confeſs myſelf ſhocked beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at human weakneſs and error. Where was that reaſon which philoſophers proudly boaſted as an infallible guide in their reſearches after truth, when they adopted notions ſo repugnant to her dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates?</p>
                        <p>I am perſuaded, we who are enlightened by Revelation are very incompetent judges of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of unaſſiſted reaſon; and often attribute to her natural force, what is the effect of ſupernatural il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination. Some trifling critics have condemned the ancient poets for aſcribing the victories of their heroes to the interpoſition of their gods. "What merit," ſay they, "is there in obtaining a conqueſt by the aſſiſtance of Jove?" Homer has had juſter notions of the importance of divine aid, than many who call themſelves Chriſtians. He ſaw that it was abſolutely neceſſary to the performance of any great or good action.</p>
                        <p>The ſtudy of hiſtory I would particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to my dear Henry. It preſents a wide field, in which you may collect a variety of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024442_0027_0FC73B581A9246D0"/>
highly uſeful for the conduct of life. It has likewiſe the ſtrongeſt tendency to exalt our ideas of the Divine government, by diſplaying to us the ſupreme Diſpoſer of all events, educing good from evil, order from confuſion, and rendering the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt laid plans of treachery and violence, not only ſubverſive of the ends propoſed, but evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>There too, you will diſcover the ſuperior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſtianity wherever it has had its full effect. Its internal evidence, and natural tendency, is what I would chiefly have you to conſider. In truth, my ſon, however abuſed by the weakneſs or wickedneſs of mankind, the Chriſtian ſcheme is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably the only one worthy of its great Author. Adopt its principles, cheriſh its hopes, rely on its promiſes; they will give dignity and conſiſtency to your character. Frequently contraſt that of a man who joins piety to God with benevolence to men, and maintains his integrity through life, with that of the boaſting infidel ſo ſtrikingly deſcribed in theſe words:

Mrs. Seymour and her daughter reached Dover without any croſs accident. While they waited for the pacquet, a coach drove into the yard, the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of which Mrs. Seymour inſtantly recollected to belong to the Honourable Mr. Stanhope, with whoſe family ſhe had become acquainted, whilſt on a viſit at London. He was poſſeſſed of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fortune, but had the affliction to ſee his only ſon in ſo alarming a ſtate of health after a fall from his horſe, that, by advice of his phyſicians, Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope were reſolved to carry him abroad, to try the effect of a warmer climate.</p>
                  <p>Few things could have proved more fortunate or agreeable to the two families, than this rencounter; they immediately joined companies; the anxieties of Mrs. Stanhope's mind were conſiderably alleviated by communicating them to her ſenſible friend; and the languor inſeparable from bad health, awakened in the compaſſionate boſom of Louiſa a degree of ſolicitude to amuſe young Mr. Stanhope, which often made him forget that he had any cauſe of complaint.</p>
                  <p>They arrived at Paris at a time when travellers would have found objects ſufficient to gratify both taſte and curioſity; but, health being the ſole end of their purſuit, they declined accepting the many polite invitations they received from people of the firſt faſhion, to whom they had brought letters of recommendation. In conſequence of one of theſe, the Marchioneſs de St. Croix waited on Mrs. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and urged her in ſuch ſtrong, yet polite terms, to accompany her for a few days to her delightful villa on the borders of the Foreſt of St. Germain's, that it was impoſſible to refuſe her requeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:024442_0029_0FC73B60EB241910"/>
The Marchioneſs was a widow; her family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a ſon and three daughters, all of whom were educated in a manner ſuitable to their birth; but their fortune being very ſmall, as is cuſtomary in France, two of them were deſtined to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual life.</p>
                  <p>Adelaide, the youngeſt, who had been ſome time a boarder in the Nunnery of St. Cire, was now on a viſit to her mother, before entering on her novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate there. She was about two years older than Miſs Seymour; alike amiable and engaging, though not poſſeſſed of ſuch regular beauty. When theſe two ladies met, the impreſſion they made on each other was too ſtrong ever to be eraſed. Philoſophers tell us, when kindred ſouls come within the ſphere of each other's influence, they as naturally attract and are attracted by each other, as homogeneous bodies.</p>
                  <p>An air of melancholy, ſpread over the ſoft fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Adelaide, ſenſibly touched the heart of Louiſa, which vibrated to every expreſſion of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
                  <p>Strangers to ſuſpicion or diſguiſe, the unhappy fruits of commerce with the world, their friendſhip commenced at firſt ſight.</p>
                  <p>In forming an amicable connection, there is no need of laying down rules, or ſpecifying the duties incumbent on the ſeveral parties. The ſoul which is capable of that exalted union, will itſelf ſuggeſt every ſentiment, and lead to every action, which real friendſhip involves in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:024442_0030_0FC73B6236BE4070"/>
During her reſidence at the Villa de St. Croix, Mrs. Seymore was ſo much recruited, that ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevailed with her daughter to accompany the Marchioneſs to Paris, in order to ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in the public amuſements. But how inſipid to her were the moſt brilliant aſſemblies, in which her heart took no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, compared with thoſe placid hours which ſhe ſpent with her favorite Adelaide in the country! Indeed, the hurry and buſtle of public life only ſerve, with perſons of her character, more to endear the quiet of retirement.</p>
                  <p>She returned to St. Germains, with a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for its peaceful ſhades and innocent amuſements; and looked back with pity on thoſe who purſue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with ſuch eagerneſs, that they generally run it down in the chace.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Seymour received a letter from Mrs. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope, informing her of her reſolution of ſpending the remainder of the winter at Montpellier, and entreating her to accompany her thither. The heart of Louiſa was divided on this occaſion; as her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſenſibly better, ſhe was ſtrongly tempted to yield to the ſolicitations of her gentle friend, who urged her to ſpend ſome time with her in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent before the awful ceremony of her admiſſion.</p>
                  <p>As there were ſome branches of education, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly muſic, in which Louiſa required ſtill further inſtructions, Mrs. Seymour joined her entreaties with thoſe of Adelaide; and at laſt perſuaded her duteous and affectionate child, to commit her, for a ſhort time, to the care of Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope, and return with Adelaide to St. Cire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:024442_0031_0FC73B63B68A8A28"/>
By an application to the reſpectable foundreſs of this noble inſtitution, Miſs Seymour was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there as a boarder; though not being of the nobleſſe, this was an infringement of the eſtabliſhed rules; but that convent being then in its infancy, engaged Madame Maintenon to diſpenſe with them on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>She was greatly ſtruck with the firſt view of this noble edifice, and the magnificent park of Verſailles, in which it is ſituated; but her walks were chiefly confined to the gardens, where alone ſhe could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſociety of her beloved friend.</p>
                  <p>The melancholy which Louiſa had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in Adelaide, ſeemed to increaſe every day; and was become ſo habitual, that ſhe could not help ſuſpecting it aroſe from diſlike to the manner of life on which ſhe was about to enter.</p>
                  <p>She queſtioned her with much earneſtneſs on the ſubject; and conjured her, by their mutual friendſhip, to lay open her heart to her without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; to receive the conſolation of her ſympathy, and confide in her inviolable attachment.</p>
                  <p>Adelaide appeared ſo much affected during this diſcourſe, that Louiſa began to repent having intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it. At length burſting into tears, "O my Louiſa! cried ſhe, why ſhould I longer ſtrive to conceal from you the ſorrow that preys upon my heart! Yes, my friend, I am indeed unhappy, but not from the cauſe you imagine.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>You have a claim to my utmoſt confidence; and believe me, the only reaſon for withholding it,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024442_0032_0FC73B6CD47BAAE8"/>
has been a regard to your eaſe and honour. I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſt my mother ſhould have queſtioned you on a ſubject, which would have forced you either to have ſacrificed your own ingenuity, or the peace of your friend.</p>
                     <p>You have heard my brother mention the name of Grammont, with thoſe encomiums which are due to his merit. Before joining his regiment, in which he holds only the rank of a captain, he came to ſpend ſome weeks with my brother at St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Prepared to admire his talents by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic praiſes of his friend, I ſoon learnt alſo to love his virtues by acquaintance with himſelf. Oh, Louiſa! what ſcience is ſo eaſily acquired as that of admiring merit; what tranſition is ſo natural as from admiring to loving it?</p>
                     <p>But I will not tire you with a repetition of the various circumſtances which confirmed my opinion of Grammont's uncommon virtues; ſuffice it to ſay, that I revered them in my heart, which could not withhold its moſt tender affection from a man, who ſolicited, with timid modeſty, that eſteem he had a right to claim, and implored my forgiveneſs for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to love me; a fault which my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proved to be involuntary, my own feelings taught me to excuſe.</p>
                     <p>For ſome time we were ſo intoxicated with the delightful indulgence of our mutual tenderneſs, that we forgot the obſtacles which oppoſed our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am convinced, Louiſa, the world affords not a happineſs equal to that of indulging a tender reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal affection, founded in virtue, approved by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, endeared by confidence, and ſecured by delicacy.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024442_0033_0FC73B6E37F4F768"/>
There is even a peculiar charm connected with the ſecret poſſeſſion of joys, that are not common.—Our youth, want of fortune, and the life to which I was deſtined, were obſtacles in the eye of reaſon, which were altogether inſurmountable; but,
<q>Love bids us hope, where Reaſon bids deſpair:—</q>
and either from a natural activity, or conſcious elevation of mind, we take pleaſure in conquering difficulties in the attainment of our favourite purſuits.</p>
                     <p>The time for joining his regiment drew near, Already the King's troops had taken the field, and thoſe of the Marſhal inveſted the fortreſs of—. What a ſeparation for two hearts that ſo greatly loved and feared as ours did! The evening before his departure, Grammont prevailed on me to meet him in the garden, at an hour when the reſt of the family were engaged with cards and muſic, that our parting might be without witneſſes.—Oh Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa! ſhall I ever forget that hour? How often, when ſitting in the arbour that borders the canal, have you chid me for my penſive looks and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incoherent expreſſions! Ah, my friend! you know not the tender recollections that then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered my ſoul. Alas! at this moment I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tempted to wiſh I had never known him who occaſioned them.</p>
                     <p>After a thouſand proteſtations of inviolable affection and fidelity, a thouſand adieus, interrupted by our ſighs, and prolonged by our apprehenſions, Grammont, dropping on his knees, and holding both my hands, which he bathed with his tears, pronounced this ſolemn farewel: "Almighty God!
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024442_0034_0FC73B6FD91CC988"/>
the protector of virtue and innocence, protect and bleſs my Adelaide; and grant that the ſtroke of death alone may divide two hearts, which from this moment are eternally devoted to each other." He aroſe, claſped me to his boſom, which ſeemed burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the violence of his emotions, and haſtily withdrew.</p>
                     <p>There was no need for pretending indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to account for my retiring to my apartment; I was indeed violently ill for ſome hours. In the morning, however, I aroſe, about the time I ſuppoſed Grammont would ſet out. From the window of my dreſſing-room there was a view of the court-yard. He had once ſeen me there, on occaſion of looking at a beautiful horſe which my brother had purchaſed, and was deſirous to ſhew me. I leaned my aching head againſt the ſhutter, which I kept half cloſed for fear of obſervation: I had not ſtood long, before the ſervant appeared with the horſes; Grammont followed ſlowly, pale and dejected, with his eyes fixed on the ground; when ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, he ſtopt, and waving his hand for the ſervant to go on, he turned towards the window. I ventured to open the ſhutter; he inſtantly perceived me; a bluſh overſpread his pale cheeks, and claſping his hands together, he raiſed his fine eyes to heaven; then, turning them on me with a look—O, Louiſa! that had ſomething I fear of prophetic ſadneſs in it; gave a deep ſigh, flew to the gate, mounted his horſe, and diſappeared in a moment.</p>
                     <p>Pardon, my friend, this minute detail of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the recollection of which ſupports my weak ſpirits, and forms all my enjoyment.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:024442_0035_0FC73B7280ACDA00"/>
For three months Grammont contrived to write to me almoſt every poſt. How ſoothing, how delightful is that ſecret intercourſe, to which an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment like ours gives birth! The whole creation, animate and inanimate, ſeems ſubſervient to the happineſs of thoſe whoſe hearts love hath joined, but whoſe hands fortune hath put aſunder.</p>
                     <p>Averſe to entruſt our ſecret with a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reſolved never to require from any of my domeſtics, for my convenience, a violation of that duty which they might plead my example for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to their own, I made Grammont addreſs his letters under cover to a young lady in the convent; from whence I received them without incurring ſuſpicion, as I correſponded with ſeveral of the boarders.</p>
                     <p>Ah, my Louiſa! how tender, how ſenſible, how pathetic is the language they breathe! But you ſhall judge for yourſelf. The two laſt, which I received about a month before leaving St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, I have now in my pocket: Judge of the happineſs they afforded me; and oh! tell me, what am I to think of the dreadful ſilence by which it has been ſucceeded?</p>

women, is ſtill ſtronger than I could have believed. It has convinced me more than ever, that I love you—O Adelaide! that I love you with a fondneſs, an admiration, an unremitting conſtancy, which no words can expreſs. Surely, nothing ſhould diſturb me, whilſt I read aſſurances of your happineſs, and the moſt enchanting expreſſions of your affection; yet, oh, my Adelaide! my heart is a prey to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs anxieties. The diſtance that divides us, my dangerous ſituation, our circumſtances—yet let me not cruelly add my inquietudes to thoſe of my gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle love. Hope is the ſweeteſt as well as the moſt ſalutary ingredient in the cup of life. Let us che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hope.</p>
                        <p>Let us truſt, that the benificent Author of our being, who hath conducted us to each other, and blended our fates in that delightful union in which our chief happineſs conſiſts, will continue our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent felicity, till that period arrive, when age ſhall ripen both of us for an unreluctant paſſage into that world, where love, ſecure againſt all apprehenſion, is indulged without meaſure and without fear.</p>
                        <p>The time I employ in reading your letters ſeems the only valuable portions of my exiſtence. Write to me then, my beloved Adelaide, every little plan you form, and every incident that occurs in the execution of it. Think nothing that regards you too trivial for me. It will gratify me in a thouſand ways; particularly by aſſiſting that conſtant propenſity of my imagination to accompany you in every ſituation. The heavenly bodies are now the only objects which we can behold at the ſame time; they are vehicles of a kind of ſilent intercourſe between thoſe who ſigh at a diſtance from each other. Look up, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024442_0037_0FC73B7BA444E598"/>
remember me at the hour of nine, the laſt we ſpent together. I will not fail, at the ſame hour, to think of my Adelaide, and fervently commend her to the protection of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>We have often agreed, that to us there are pleaſures even in abſence, more exquiſite, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined than any of thoſe which bear that name in the world. What then, O Adelaide! will be our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city when we meet?—When, every anxious care and apprehenſion baniſhed from our hearts, they ſhall glow with the conſtant aim, the delightful conſciouſneſs of rendering each other completely happy?</p>
                        <p>If theſe expectations are romantic and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, time alone can correct them; for reaſon aſſures me, that there is no wiſh my heart can form, which the merit and tenderneſs of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of women is not capable of fulfilling.</p>

                        <p>See, my beſt love! does not fortune already relent, and ceaſe to oppoſe our wiſhes?

                  <p>While Louiſa was peruſing this letter, a lay-ſiſter entered haſtily, and acquainted Adelaide, that a young man, in the habit of a domeſtic, demanded to ſee her alone, and was waiting in the parlour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:024442_0039_0FC73B7E15C1D300"/>
Louiſa put the letter in her pocket, and was about to retire, but Adelaide entreated her to accompany her to the grate, as ſhe found herſelf ſeized with ſo univerſal a tremour, that ſhe could hardly walk, and was afraid of fainting. Miſs Seymour ſupported her friend into the parlour; on entering which, they perceived a genteel young man, in a ſuit of plain clothes, with whoſe face, though concealed in part by a handkerchief, Adelaide thought ſhe was not entirely unacquainted.</p>
                  <p>On ſeeing Louiſa, he pauſed, as if averſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his meſſage before any witneſs. Adelaide gueſſed the cauſe of his ſilence: This is my friend, ſir, ſaid ſhe, you may acquaint me with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands without heſitation.</p>
                  <p>He moved towards the grate; and preſenting a letter to Adelaide, with inimitable grace, "I am ſorry, Madam," ſaid he, in a low voice, "to be the bearer of this: I wiſh the contents could have been for ever concealed from you; but that cannot be. May this be the laſt pang that ſhall wound your gentle boſom; and in this aſylum, if you cannot hope for happineſs, may you at leaſt attain reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!"</p>
                  <p>The young man retired; but the aſtoniſhment into which his words and manner had plunged the two friends, left them neither power to detain, nor reſolution to interrogate him concerning their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious meaning. Adelaide unfolded the letter, from which ſomething dropt on the ground, which her agitation prevented her from obſerving. The hand was unknown to her, but the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle at the bottom was not ſo; ſhe inſtantly
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024442_0040_0FC73B87ADBFB738"/>
recollected that the young Count who bore that name, had accompanied Grammont on his firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to St. Germains, and ſhe had heard him laviſh in his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>A thouſand confuſed and terrible images crowded into her mind; and ſhe trembled ſo violently, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty ſhe peruſed theſe lines:</p>

                  <p>The letter dropt from the hand of Adelaide, and ſhe fell without life into the arms of her friend.</p>
                  <p>After a few moments ſhe opened her eyes, and fixing them on Louiſa, with a look that pierced her to the ſoul: "At length," ſaid ſhe, "my fears are confirmed, my happineſs is no more. O God! why was I permitted to enjoy ſupreme felicity, that I might feel the whole miſery of being deprived of it! But I will not murmur. I know I am blind and ignorant; thou art ever juſt and good:"</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:024442_0041_0FC73B8939DF4EC0"/>
Afraid of being obſerved in this diſtreſſing ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Louiſa raiſed her friend from the ground, in order to convey her to her cell. At that moment ſhe obſerved the billet which had dropt out of the letter, and which ſhe immediately ſlipt into her pocket. Having given orders that nobody ſhould enter till called, ſhe put Adelaide to bed; and throwing herſelf down by her ſide, gave free courſe to thoſe tears which ſerved to relieve her burſting heart. Adelaide remained a long time without ſenſe or motion. Her eyes were open, but neither ſighs nor tears eſcaped her. A coldneſs, like that of death, ſeized her trembling limbs, and Louiſa became ſo terrified with her danger, that ſhe had recourſe to the bell for aſſiſtance. Having procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome cordials, which Adelaide ſwallowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition or remonſtrance, ſhe became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eaſier; and at laſt ſo far recollected herſelf, as to inquire about the billet, whoſe contents ſhe at once dreaded and longed to peruſe.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa knew it would be in vain to deny her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and hoped by granting it, ſhe might procure her friend the relief of tears. Beſides, ſhe was not ignorant of the danger Adelaide would incur, if nature, thus wholly overpowered and inſenſible, ſhould not be awakened, to feel and to deplore its own wretchedneſs. What a mournful proof of human imbecility does ſuch a ſituation exhibit, when to a total ſuſpenſion of its powers, the mind is indebted for their preſervation; and when our boaſted reaſon, reſtored to its ſeat, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating our ſorrows, only ſupplies new excuſes for indulging them. She preſented her with the billet, which Adelaide requeſted her to read aloud, but the taſk was impracticable. Almoſt ſuffocated with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024442_0042_0FC73B8AB6CE3E30"/>
the violence of her emotions, ſhe returned it to Adelaide, who, on peruſing its melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, caught the infectious tenderneſs of ſorrow from her friend, and diſſolved in a flood of tears.</p>

                        <p>A few moments are granted me by Heaven, to take a long, a laſt farewel. Oh, Adelaide! Oh, my adored miſtreſs!—my fondly expected wife!—where are now our dreams of happineſs? They are fled for ever; and have left me equally unable to tear myſelf from this world, or to prepare for another. Even whilſt I write, my vital current ſtops; a wound in my ſide has almoſt drained its ſources.

                  <p>Language can but faintly expreſs the mingled emotions of grief, admiration, and deſpair, which alternately agitated the boſom of the unhappy Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024442_0043_0FC73B8D7150EC78"/>
Louiſa was not ignorant, that to attempt by reaſoning to moderate a ſorrow ſo juſt, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to add to its violence. In truth, ſhe knew not to reaſon, though exquiſitely to feel; and the ſilence of her ſympathy produced that effect on the heart of Adelaide, which neither religion nor philoſophy for ſome time could have wrought. The paſſions exhauſt themſelves with their own violence; and where ſo many contend for dominion in the human ſoul, the powers of each are weakened.</p>
                  <p>God is to the moral and intellectual, what the ſun is to the natural world,—the ſource of light, life, and joy. And man can no more be happy without intercourſe with his Maker, than plants can thrive and vegetate without the benign influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that glorious luminary. Cold and darkneſs are felt by the heavenly bodies in proportion to their diſtance from the ſun; juſt ſo does it fare with the ſoul of man. In proſperity, the bountiful Giver is obſcured by the multiplicity of his gifts. Theſe, like vapours from the heated earth, riſe and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between man and his Maker. But no ſooner does the tempeſt of adverſity deſcend, than the cloud is diſperſed, and, deſolate and forlorn, he feels all the neceſſities of his nature; his weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, his hopeleſſneſs and need of Divine aid; and returns, repentant, to duty, to happineſs, and God.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks ſaw Adelaide reſtored to that calm and ſettled melancholy, which ariſes from the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of enjoyment, but is often miſtaken by the world for a ſpecies of it. One yet remained to her, that of pouring her ſorrows without reſtraint into the faithful boſom of friendſhip, and indulging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024442_0044_0FC73B900FAAF898"/>
thoſe tender recollections, which were ſo ſoothing to her mind, that at times they made her almoſt forget the fatal event which gave them birth.</p>
                  <p>During the remaining months of her noviciate, which was ſhortened at her requeſt, Adelaide ſtrove to prepare her mind for the ſolemn dedication of herſelf to Heaven. It required but little reſolution to abandon a world, where her peace had been wrecked, and from which ſhe neither expected nor wiſhed to receive happineſs.</p>
                  <p>As the ſpring was now advanced, and Mrs. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour felt her ſtrength rather decreaſing, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extremely anxious to return to England.</p>
                  <p>Her young fellow-traveller had experienced much happier effects from change of climate; the pain in his ſide, occaſioned by the fall, had entirely left him, and his impatience to return ſeemed to equal Mrs. Seymour's.</p>
                  <p>It originated, however, from a ſecret and very different cauſe. The humane attentions beſtowed on him by her charming daughter, at a time when the dejected ſpirits and ſoftened heart are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſenſible to kindneſs, had made a laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on Mr. Stanhope's; and eſteem and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion combined with gratitude to inſpire him with a paſſion, which he was at no pains to ſuppreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was conſcious of nothing which ſhould have oppoſed his indulging it.</p>
                  <p>At length the day was fixed, on which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and afflicted Adelaide was to enter thoſe ſacred walls, which, like the grave, were for ever
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024442_0045_0FC73B96E7DE8B00"/>
to conceal her ſorrows; Happy, if like the grave they could have baniſhed the remembrance of them.</p>
                  <p>The travellers haſtened their departure from Montpellier, that they might witneſs the awful ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; Louiſa found this a ſevere trial to her weak ſpirits, as the concourſe of nobility aſſembled for that purpoſe was very great. Madame Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenon, as abbeſs, had a ſeat placed near the altar, round which the young princeſſes attended. Miſs Seymour was allowed to ſupport her affectionate friend during the whole ceremony. She alone knew what need ſhe had of ſupport. The ſolemn ſervice began:—The pealing organ, reſponſive to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting voices of the choriſters, alternately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the ſoul in tenderneſs, elevated it with hope, or rapt it in adoration and praiſe.—The muſic ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The prayers of all preſent were requeſted to aid thoſe of the young ſaint; and the grace of the Moſt High implored to animate her faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>The prieſt aroſe an conducted her to the door of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> where ſhe was to be ſtripped of all thoſe ornaments with which, as is cuſtomary, her friends had richly adorned her for the occaſion. A ſolemn and affecting ſilence enſued. The lovely victim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, clad in her diſmal habit, and walking ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily up to the altar, kneeled before it to receive the veil.</p>
                  <p>One proof only remained to ſhew her fixed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of renouncing the vanities of the world, and to complete the ceremony of her dedication;—that of parting with her fine hair, which flowed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance over her neck and ſhoulders, and ſhaded a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024442_0046_0FC73B98701835C8"/>
face, whoſe beauty the traces of recent affliction had rendered unſpeakably touching. As ſhe bent her head forward for this purpoſe, with a look of patient and peaceful reſignation, ſhe was ſtartled by a heavy groan, which proceeded from the galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appointed for thoſe who were only ſpectators of this ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>A buſtle enſued, which directed the eyes of all towards the gallery. Her's inſtantly recognized there the face of the Count de Rochelle, who, yielding to his extreme curioſity to behold this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſcene, felt himſelf ſo violently agitated with the ſight of Adelaide, and recollection of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, that he fainted in the arms of young Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope, whom chance had placed next him.</p>
                  <p>Various were the conjectures occaſioned by this accident: The effect produced by it on the mind of Adelaide, is not to be deſcribed. She alone knew the nature of thoſe ſentiments which occaſioned it, and her grateful, though oppreſſed heart, ſighed in ſympathy with that of the generous and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Rochelle. The interruption to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſed by this affair, gave her time a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover herſelf, and ſhe went through the remaining part of it with tolerable compoſure.</p>
                  <p>As nothing is ſo irkſome to a mind in deep afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the exertion neceſſary for mixing with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling world, Adelaide found the ſolitude of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not only agreeable but ſalutary. The conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion operated there with full force, and knowing how prone the mind is, after being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agitated with paſſion, to ſink into liſtleſſneſs, ſhe endeavoured to occupy her time with ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024442_0047_0FC73B99C7B54828"/>
and amuſements as recommended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at once by their novelty and importance. By degrees, the gloom of misfortune was exchanged for the ſerenity of hope; and though ſhe ſeldom taſted of pleaſure, peace became the conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of her boſom.</p>

We feel a ſort of ſacred enthuſiaſm for the place, where firſt our tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have been awakened. The anguiſh ſhe felt on bidding Adelaide adieu, was extreme; but it was ſoon in great meaſure obliterated, by fear and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety about her mother, whoſe worſt ſymptoms now recurred with redoubled violence.</p>
                  <p>During their journey to Calais, young Stanhope had an opportunity of repaying the former attentions of Miſs Seymour, and of ſhewing the goodneſs of his own heart, whilſt every day increaſed his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her's.</p>
                  <p>The abſence of her friend was now ſeverely felt by Louiſa; and as they were obliged to remain ſome days at Calais to recruit Mrs. Seymour, ſhe employed every ſpare moment in communicating to her the diſtreſs with which ſhe was overwhelmed.</p>

                        <p>My heart ſhares tenderly in the diſtreſs of my friend; but alas! I am neither qualified by years nor experience to be her conductreſs through the difficult mazes of life. I am not yet arrived at that bliſsful tranquillity on which you congratulate me. Officious memory ſtill awakens ſuch dear, yet dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous recollections, as convey to my ſoul all the bitterneſs of diſappointed hope. Oh, Louiſa! there is a charm in loving and being beloved, in feeling one's ſelf the continual ſource of joy and happineſs to the object of one's beſt and moſt tender affections, that takes ſuch hold of the imagination, as none of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent evils of life have power to obliterate. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024442_0049_0FC73BA43A7EEA20"/>
has taught me too, that the heart will continue to ſigh, even after the ſoul is reſigned. Ah, my friend! what arrow pierces ſo deep, what wound bleeds ſo often, what anguiſh laſts ſo long, as that occaſioned by the death of thoſe we love? With what a tender mixture of pleaſure and regret do we dwell on their virtues; with what eagerneſs liſten to their praiſe; whilſt fame does juſtice to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and envy is ſilent, for there is no competition in the grave? Grammont! tears are the only tribute I can pay to thy merit; tears, due to youth, virtue, and bravery! Common laurels wither and decay, but that which is ſupplied and watered by ſuch a ſtream ſhall never fade; it towers above the ſkies, and flouriſhes to immortality.</p>
                        <p>Do not, my Louiſa, covet a life of ſecluſion from the world; we ought ever to be contented with the ſtation allotted us by Providence. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, we poſſeſs at beſt a kind of negative virtue: There our affections languiſh for want of proper objects to excite them; and our goodneſs conſiſts rather in the abſence of evil, than in any poſitive habits of rectitude or exertions of benevolence. It is in ſociety alone that the genuine character can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained. There, our virtue is tried; and if it ſtands the teſt, from that trial reſults our higheſt intellectual enjoyment,—the pleaſing conſciouſneſs of ſuperior worth, and the laſting meed of ſelf-approbation.</p>
                        <p>Philoſophy, my dear Louiſa, may enable us to talk of fortitude, but religion empowers us to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it. Think often, my afflicted friend, on that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious period, when freed from the miſt of error, the perplexity of doubt, and the ſophiſtry of paſſion, we ſhall contemplate with aſtoniſhment, and acquieſce

                  <p>We ſhall now leave the travellers to purſue their journey, which they did by very ſlow ſtages, and return to give ſome account of what paſſed at the Caſtle of Haſtings during their abſence.</p>
                  <p>The frequent letters Lady Granville received from Louiſa, and which ſhe generally communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Lord Granville, ſerved agreeably to amuſe their winter evenings, and to increaſe their eſteem and affection for the amiable writer. The admirable deſcriptions they contained, of the curioſities of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and its environs, and the reflections blended with them, ſhewed, that while Miſs Seymour ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered nothing worthy of curioſity to eſcape her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſhe made objects of ſentiment her chief ſtudy, and from them derived her higheſt enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of Wincheſter, who had a fine ſeat in that neighbourhood, came with his daughter, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Charlotte Villiers, to reſide there during the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, about the time Mrs. Seymour and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſet out for France. Lord and Lady Granville waited on the Marquis and Lady Charlotte, and requeſted the favour of their company at the Caſtle. As they did not propoſe returning to London till after Chriſtmas, they ſpent moſt of their time there. The Marquis's fortune was inadequate to his rank, which induced him to ſpend much of his time in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024442_0051_0FC73BA7384DB628"/>
the country; as his ſtrict notions of honour forbade his plunging into expence, which he knew muſt either ruin his family or injure ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Lady Charlotte poſſeſſed ſo many advantages from nature, that ſhe ſeemed in no want of thoſe of fortune. To a fine perſon, and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhe added ſuch a ſhare of vivacity and poliſhed manners, as rendered her one of the moſt agreeable companions in the world. Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville beheld in Lady Charlotte the very woman he wiſhed for a daughter-in-law; and entertained lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt of obtaining the approbation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to a marriage, which, in reſpect of fortune, was all he could deſire for his daughter. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, however, of the waywardneſs of the human heart, he deferred communicating his plan to his ſon, till he ſhould ſee the young people on ſuch a footing of intimacy, as ſhould give room to hope for their concurrence with it.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of the following letter from his father, Lord Haſtings returned to the Caſtle, about a month before the arrival of the travellers.</p>
                  <p>"Though I wiſhed my dear Henry to have made a longer ſtay at Cambridge, an accident has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened which obliges me to requeſt his immediate return home. Dr. Melville, who has been lately threatened with a decline, has, at my deſire, agreed to give up his academy, and attend you on your tour. As he fears riſking next winter in our north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern climate, I propoſe that you ſhall ſet out in a few months hence, and wiſh to enjoy your ſociety during the ſummer. Beſides, I would wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce you to ſome of the neighbouring families, many of whom are highly reſpectable; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024442_0052_0FC73BB0A016AD08"/>
you with that preference for your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that will diſpoſe you to return to it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure."</p>
                  <p>On his arrival, Lord Haſtings found the Marquis and his daughter at the Caſtle. Wholly ignorant of his father's views, and free from that embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciouſneſs which the preſence of Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour had occaſioned, he appeared with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a fine perſon, a cultivated mind, elegant manners, and a moſt engaging addreſs.</p>
                  <p>Lady Charlotte was perfectly qualified to judge of his merit. Notwithſtanding of her early intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into the gay world, her good ſenſe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her from adopting its follies; whilſt, by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, ſhe had acquired a degree of frankneſs and eaſe peculiarly agreeable to a temper like that of Lord Haſtings. Her conſtant good humour and vivacity made him find a thouſand charms in her ſociety; and as ſhe excelled in muſic, an art in which he had made conſiderable progreſs, and of which he was greatly enamoured, their time paſſed moſt agreeably.</p>
                  <p>One morning, when Lord Granville and his ſon were together in his ſtudy, concerting the plan of his future travels, he addreſſed him in the following manner:—<q>My dear Henry, I will not deny you the pleaſure of knowing, that hitherto your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been ſuch, as affords me the moſt real ſatisfaction. To complete it, one object only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that of ſeeing you marry, and form ſuch an alliance as will do credit both to your judgment and your heart. I know, by experience, that the whole happineſs of life depends on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024442_0053_0FC73BB1BA955468"/>
I do not conſider my ſelf as authoriſed to conſtrain your choice, but, as your friend, would wiſh to direct it. Lady Charlotte Villiers appears to me both worthy and agreeable; her birth is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your own; and if I am not miſtaken, your merit has not been beheld by her with indifference.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings expreſſed the moſt lively ſenſe of his father's goodneſs, and joined very cordially in praiſe of Lady Charlotte, who, together with the Marquis, was that very moment announced by a ſervant. He flew to hand her from her carriage; but the converſation which had juſt paſſed, gave an awkward conſciouſneſs to his manner, which did not eſcape the penetrating eyes of Lady Charlotte, who felt herſelf too deeply intereſted in all his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to permit the ſlighteſt of them to paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>She rallied him with much ſpirit and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on the viſible change in his manner. And after a variety of ſprightly ſallies, <q>Come, come, ſaid ſhe, I will not queſtion you any farther on this ſubject, for I ſuppoſe your father has been catechiſing you ſufficiently already, as I ſaw you come out of his ſtudy juſt now.</q> The face of Lord Haſtings was crimſoned over by this ſpeech, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ed at once to increaſe his embarraſſment and Lady Charlotte's curioſity. She was too well bred, however, to perſiſt in her raillery, which ſhe ſaw produce ſuch viſible emotion in Lord Haſtings. But though ſeveral topics were ſtarted, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation grew languid; and on returning home, Lady Charlotte bewildered herſelf in vainly ſtriving to unravel the myſtery of his behaviour. As we are prone to believe what we wiſh, and as Lord Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024442_0054_0FC73BB3C39D2FA8"/>
had been uncommonly aſſiduous about this Lady, ſhe hardly doubted of having made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on a heart whoſe affections ſhe ſincerely wiſhed to engage. But though his viſits were as frequent as ever, the eaſe of his manner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a caution which was unnatural at his time of life, and foreign to his character, and which threw a conſtraint into all their converſations, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudicial to thoſe ſentiments which Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte felt and wiſhed to inſpire.</p>
                  <p>Things were in this train when Mrs. Seymour and her daughter arrived at Springwood.</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville flew to welcome her friend, but, alas! ſhe knew not in what terms to ſpeak that welcome, when ſhe beheld in her pale face and emaciated figure, every ſymptom of approaching diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Tears of mingled tenderneſs and grief bedewed the boſom of Louiſa, as Lady Granville preſſed her to her affectionate heart. She did not attempt to deceive her with vain hopes, but to arm her with fortitude and reſignation.</p>
                  <p>As Louiſa never quitted her mother's apartment, Lord Haſtings had no opportunity of gratifying his curioſity, which was become painfully ardent, by the daily encomiums beſtowed by his mother, both on the mind and perſon of Miſs Seymour; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which, ſhe ſaid, had acquired inexpreſſible graces, whilſt at the ſame time ſhe had loſt nothing of that amiable ingenuity and ſimplicity of manners which was her greateſt charm.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:024442_0055_0FC73BB5F6A83000"/>
The anxious mind of Louiſa was ſoothed, ſoon after her arrival, by the following letter from her friend:</p>

                        <p>How many are the ſources of elegant delight which memory opens to a mind fraught with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility! Who would forego the tenderneſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for the tumults of pleaſure, or the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſympathy for the noiſe of applauſe?</p>
                        <p>Deprived of your dear ſociety, Louiſa, I have recourſe to the paſt. I wander through thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſcenes which witneſſed the reciprocations of our mutual confidence and friendſhip. I ſtrive to recollect not only your-words, but your looks and placid ſmiles. I liſten to the ſoothing language of heavenly hope and pious reſignation; I ſtill hear you breathe the ſigh of ſympathetic tenderneſs; I ſtill ſee your mild eyes bedimmed with the tear of ſincere compaſſion. Ah, Louiſa! it is ſtill due to the ſecret ſorrows of your friend! Nor is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent forgotten in the recollection of the paſt. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you in imagination through every ſtage of your painful journey.

amiable one, and for this reaſon you ought to be on your guard with reſpect to its effects. We are apt to contemn ourſelves when any perſonal affliction depreſſes our ſpirits; but when we languiſh by a ſympathetic pang, a ray of ſelf-approbation beams through the ſoul; we are flattered by our own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and cheriſh the ſadly pleaſing ſenſations, till they acquire a dangerous ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>Let us reflect, my love! that the beneficent Parent of the univerſe can, in no ſenſe, be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of evil; that the more wiſdom which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in his moral government, the leſs can we poſſibly comprehend it; and what we, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or blindneſs, perhaps too from perverſeneſs, denominate evil, muſt certainly be good in his ſight, who ſhall cauſe all the ſeeming diſorders of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſcene to iſſue in the final perfection and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his intelligent creation.</p>
                        <p>As one earthly prop is withdrawn, the heart of man fondly clings to another, till inſenſibly they drop one by one, and he is left deſolate and ſolitary to encounter the ſtorms of life.

Yes, my Louiſa, though the ſtreams of happineſs flow here in narrow channels, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by accident, and embittered by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to the pious it is matter of everlaſting conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the great Fountain of exiſtence and felicity is immutable, inexhauſtible, and eternal.

Mrs. Seymour's illneſs increaſed ſo quickly, that a few weeks brought her to the verge of the grave. One day, whilſt Lady Granville was ſitting by her bedſide, having deſired Louiſa to take a turn in the garden for the benefit of freſh air, ſhe graſped her hand, and with a voice enfeebled by ſickneſs and interrupted by ſorrow, thus addreſſed her:—I am perſuaded, my beloved friend, this ſcene is by no means unexpected to you; to me, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, it is welcome: One only tie binds me to earth—that dear, that amiable child! But I know, whilſt Lady Granville lives, Louiſa will never want a mother. The Almighty hath given me many gracious warnings of that fate which is faſt approaching;—I truſt I am prepared to meet it.—You know I have had but little ſatisfaction in reviewing ſome part of my paſt life; perhaps I have ſcanned my errors with too ſevere an eye—that of Omniſcience is now upon me! I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to repoſe on the rectitude of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or regularity of my conduct; my hope is that of a Chriſtian, and it will never deceive me.</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville ſaid every thing that piety, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and good ſenſe could dictate, to calm the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieties of Mrs. Seymour; ſhe even ventured to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her, that while ſhe lived ſhe would never ſuffer Louiſa to have any other home than her houſe.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Seymour only ſurvived a week after this converſation, during which ſhe ſtrove to recon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>e Louiſa to a ſeparation, which would confeſſedly be for her happineſs.</p>
                  <p>"Do not, my deareſt child," ſaid ſhe, O do not embitter my laſt moments by indulging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024442_0058_0FC73BBFF6FCC458"/>
ſorrow for my death! Conſider it in the light of a ſhort abſence;—look on me as having gone a little before in a journey in which you are ſoon to follow me. Perhaps our ſeparation will neither be ſo real nor entire, as that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by abſence while on earth: Perhaps I may ſtill be permitted to watch over my child; at leaſt I will not long be disjoined from her.</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething unſpeakably ſoothing in the idea ſuggeſted by the laſt part of this diſcourſe: Louiſa dwelt on it with peculiar delight; but, in the midſt of the extreme dejection occaſioned by the ſolemnity of a death-bed, her drooping heart required a firmer ſupport than a pleaſing dream or a doubtful hope. Her mother perceived this; and in directing her to the light of revelation and the proſpect of immortality, gave patience to her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and mingled conſolation with her ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>"I leave you, my beloved child," ſaid ſhe, a few hours before her death; but I leave you under the protection of that God who ſees it good for us to part; who is in a peculiar manner the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fatherleſs, and ſhield of the orphan.</p>
                  <p>Earthly friends fail us at our greateſt need; but this heavenly Friend will never forſake us. Earthly friends can only pity our misfortunes; but God is able to avert them. Fear God, then, my deareſt child, and you need have no other fear.</p>
                  <p>Though the firſt tranſports of grief on the death of her mother prevented Louiſa from deriving all that conſolation from theſe diſcourſes which they
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024442_0059_0FC73BC176E02820"/>
were calculated to inſpire, they returned to her thoughts in the calmer hours, when paſſion began to ſubſide, and carried the ſweeteſt conſolation to her heart.</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville was very deſirous that Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhould return with her to the Caſtle the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her mother expired; but ſhe would by no means conſent to leave Springwood, till ſhe had fulfilled the laſt duties to her reſpected parent. That humane friend did not urge her, but, revering her pious ſorrows, left her a while in quiet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them; and ſending for her own maid, a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſenſible woman, to attend her, returned to the Caſtle to give orders for the funeral, which Louiſa intreated might be as private as poſſible. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in three days afterwards, the corps was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred early in the morning, in a burial-place erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his lady on the death of Colonel Seymour.</p>
                  <p>Nothing could be more ſoothing to the afflicted Louiſa, than the frequent letters ſhe received from Adelaide during her diſtreſs. When the dark clouds of adverſity ſurround us, they exclude every ray of pleaſure, but that which reaches and cheers the ſoul from tender and ſincere ſympathy.</p>

                        <p>The ſtillneſs and quiet of my preſent ſituation grows every day more agreeable. Methinks, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, at the age of twenty-two, I feel a ſtrong convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>all is vanity,</hi> as Solomon did after a long
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024442_0060_0FC73BCAEE8AF678"/>
life, in which all the wiſhes of his heart and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his imagination were exhauſted, in purſuit of a felicity, which, alas! theſe ſhadows of real good could never yield.</p>
                        <p>Affliction, I truſt, has taught me true wiſdom. It has brought upon me a ſort of premature old age, which ſerves inſtead of experience. Though neither ſatiated with the pleaſures of the world, nor diſguſted by its diſappointments, I ſhall riſe ſatisfied from life's feaſt, and leave the banquet to thoſe for whom it has the charm of novelty, and whoſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its dangers makes them behold it with deſire.</p>
                        <p>With what calm indifference, Louiſa! do I mark the ſilent lapſe of time, and behold its ſeveral periods come to a cloſe! Why ſhould we indulge immoderate ſorrow for the loſs of thoſe who are gone before us, when every day, every hour, every moment, is accelerating the bliſsful period of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union?</p>
                        <p>Books are now my chief amuſement: Some of theſe repreſent life as bright and cheerful; others teach me to deſpiſe its ſtorms, or inform me that they are ſalutary; whilſt experience adds, that they are tranſient too. Methinks this conſideration ought to ſilence both our peeviſh diſcontents and fantaſtic wiſhes.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I direct my ſolitary walks to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manſions of the dead; and, forgetful of the world, and all its vexing inquietudes, ſeem to ſhare for a while their bliſsful repoſe. But I advance a
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024442_0061_0FC73BCBF7083DD8"/>
ſtep farther, my Louiſa, and find, even among the dominions of death, proofs of the ſoul's immortality.</p>
                        <p>Here is evinced, the amazing truth, that it is the ſame matter, variouſly modified, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes both the earth and its inhabitants. Animals derive their ſubſiſtence from plants, which are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the common mould; at the appointed ſeaſon all theſe return to this their firſt principle. But ſince, in the viſible creation, there exiſts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing analogous to mind, let us not imagine that the ſoul can ever be reduced to a ſtate like that of beings which are altogether different from it.—Themes like theſe, my Louiſa, cannot fail to be in harmony with your preſent feelings, ſince your laſt letters aſſure me that your dear deſerving parent is paſt all hope of recovery. Let reflections like theſe ſupport your ſoul in view of that afflicting event which either awaits you, or is already arrived. Oh, my Louiſa! how much need have I to dwell on them myſelf! This day completes my twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year, the moſt eventful of my life. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did I dream, at its commencement, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric my fond hopes had reared was ſo ſoon to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ruins! That he, for whoſe ſake alone I welcomed its arrival, and wiſhed its continuance, ſhould, ere its cloſe, be torn from my boſom, and hidden for ever from my eyes! But though theſe bodily organs no more behold thee, beſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men! thou art ever preſent to my mind's eye, in thy exalted virtues, thy ſpotleſs manners, and thy fair fame: Theſe ſhall juſtify the tears with which I embalm thy memory, and convert my ſorrows into virtue.</p>
                        <p>

Write conſtantly to me, my amiable, afflicted friend! You know how tenderly I partake in your ſorrows. Believe me, Louiſa, to ſoften one pang of yours, even at the expence of ſharing it, will be preferable, in my eſtimation, to all that the world calls pleaſure.</p>

                        <p>Your letter has reached me, my friend, and conveyed to my ſoul the only conſolation of which at preſent it is capable. Yeſterday, all my cares for the beſt of women ended;—ſhe is happy:—Shall I not then be reſigned?—I truſt I am ſo. Yet, oh, my Adelaide! it is difficult, it is impoſſible, to reſtrain the tears of nature, when the long endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacred tie of kindred and of friendſhip is rudely broken by death! Till that cruel moment, when the grave cloſes over thoſe we love, we cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire the excellence of that religion which teaches us to look beyond it. Ah, my friend, do they act agreeably to their own principles, who contend for the dignity of human nature, and yet believe that the ſoul of man—advancing daily in virtue and knowledge—aſpiring after perfection—longing for immortality—cut off in the midſt of its purſuits and wiſhes,—ſhall ſhare the ſame fate with the meaneſt reptile that crawls on the face of the earth?</p>
                        <p>Alas! how diſmal, how hopeleſs, muſt be the ſorrow of ſuch gloomy, ſuch benighted minds!</p>
                        <p>Books, you ſay, ſupply your favourite amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our opinion, both of books and characters,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024442_0063_0FC73BCEF69BDFA8"/>
is influenced by the tone of our mind at the time we become acquainted with them. Perhaps it is owing to this circumſtance that I have peruſed the following fable with peculiar ſatisfaction this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in the hope of its producing the ſame effect on you, I ſhall here tranſcribe it.</p>
                        <p>In ancient times, ſays the fabuliſt, when the Creator of the world placed our firſt parents in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>vent them from growing weary of each other, he appointed Happineſs, the faireſt of his offspring, to reſide with them.</p>
                        <p>For ſome time her charms were beheld with admiration, and her merit treated with reſpect. But beauty, by growing familiar, ceaſed to excite plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and merit, from want of novelty, ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred neglect. The favourite, even of celeſtial beings, Happineſs, could ill brook ſo unkind a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from mortals; and one day, on occaſion of a quarrel between her aſſociates, in which they both betrayed marks of altered diſpoſitions, ſhe was ſo diſguſted, that ſhe haſtily bade them adieu; and aſcending to her former abode, entreated the great Ruler of the Univerſe that ſhe might never more be ſent to dwell with thoſe who knew ſo ill to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue her ſociety.</p>
                        <p>The moment ſhe was gone, her companions became ſenſible of their error. They deplored her abſence, and conjured her to return, in terms of the moſt earneſt ſupplication. But Happineſs was inexorable; and the utmoſt they could obtain from her, was a promiſe, that, provided they were never again heard to quarrel, ſhe would depute her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

ſiſter, Contentment, to reſide with them, and even occaſionally viſit them herſelf.</p>
                        <p>How far our primogenitors complied with theſe terms, we are ſtill ignorant; but it would appear that Happineſs, like other injured females, not only continued to reſent former ill-uſage, but even entertained conſtant ſuſpicions of future mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatment. For it is univerſally known, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe deigns to viſit theſe lower regions, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtays longer than, juſt like thoſe mortals who pretend to emulate her perfections, to receive the homage of her admirers, to make a diſplay of her charms, and by beſtowing ſome ſlight favours on each, to heighten the deſires and ſecure the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all her votaries.</p>

                  <p>Immediately after the funeral, Lady Granville prepared to go to Springwood, in order to bring her young charge to the Caſtle. But the agitating ſcenes ſhe had lately witneſſed, and the loſs of a friend ſhe dearly loved, had ſo ſenſibly affected her health, that, juſt as ſhe was ſtepping into the coach, ſhe was ſeized with ſuch a faintneſs, that it was with difficulty Lord Haſtings could get her ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to her apartment. Unwilling to add af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to the oppreſſed heart of Louiſa, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering herſelf this indiſpoſition would quickly go off, ſhe ſent a note to acquaint her, that ſhe was prevented from coming for her at that hour, as ſhe intended, but would certainly call for her in the evening, when ſhe expected to find every thing in readineſs to be moved to her apartment at the Caſtle, where ſhe ſhould ſtill find a tender indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mother, ready with open arms to receive her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:024442_0065_0FC73BD988462A00"/>
The laſt ſentence diſſolved the whole ſoul of Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa in gratitude and tenderneſs, and gave birth to a thouſand ideas, which, though confuſed and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, left no traces but ſuch as were pleaſing. She haſtened to prepare for her removal; and expecting Lady Granville every minute, took out her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's picture, bathed it with her tears, and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Almighty to enable her to tread in the ſteps of his departed ſervant!</p>
                  <p>It was now the beginning of May; the air was perfectly mild, and the beautiful woods and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were gilded with the laſt trembling rays of the ſun. It diſappeared; and was ſucceeded by that ſerene glowing ſky which marks the evenings of that enchanting ſeaſon with peculiar beauty.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, from the window of her mother's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had long contemplated this ſcene; if it did not baniſh her ſorrows, at leaſt it becalmed and ſoothed them. She had marked the brightly ſetting ſun, and traced in her mind a pleaſing reſemblance between the progreſs of that heavenly orb and that of a good life. The departure of that bright lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſpired feelings perfectly congenial with thoſe impreſſed on her mind by the ſcenes ſhe had lately witneſſed. After cheering this world with his beams, ſaid ſhe, and diffuſing health and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty around him, this glorious image of his Maker retires, perhaps, to renew his ſtrength, and bleſs other regions. But the compariſon would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no farther. A few hours would reſtore to the eyes of men the cheering light of the world; but, with a pang almoſt inſupportable, ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that her eyes muſt no more behold the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhe ſo fondly loved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:024442_0066_0FC73BDB0AD72580"/>
Reſolved, before quitting Springwood, to viſit her lowly dwelling, ſhe paſſed, unnoticed, through the garden, and opening a door which led into the park, walked ſlowly towards the burial-place. The ſilence which prevailed around, the deepening ſhades of evening, and the ſudden riſing of the moon from behind a cloud, which gave an indiſtinct appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to almoſt every object, affected her weak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo much, that ſhe ſtopt, and for ſome moments heſitated about going forward; but, recollecting how ſeldom ſhe might find ſo favourable an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of indulging her ſolemn meditations, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the little incloſure, and, kneeling at the ſide of the grave, ſtrove to raiſe her thoughts from the gloomy object before her, and to fix them on thoſe which ſhe felt convey peace and even joy to her ſoul.</p>
                  <p>She continued ſome moments in this attitude when, ſtarting at the ruſtling of a buſh behind her, ſhe haſtly aroſe, and, turning towards the door, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,—"All gracious Heaven! Lord Haſtings!"</p>
                  <p>Terrified beyond expreſſion with his ſudden and unexpected appearance, ſhe fell liveleſs on the grave of her mother. Reduced almoſt to the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the aſtoniſhed Haſtings, kneeling by her ſide, endeavoured to raiſe her up, and recal her to life. Several minutes elapſed before his cares had the deſired effect. He attempted in vain to offer ſome excuſe for this intruſion; his words were ſo incoherent, and Louiſa appeared ſo incapable of attending to them, that he forbore talking. His looks, however, ſufficiently expreſſed the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his mind, whilſt he ſtrove to prevail on her to accept of his arm; by the help of which,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024442_0067_0FC73BDC847E2580"/>
with a ſtaggering pace, ſhe walked ſlowly towards the houſe.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the maid was employed in putting Louiſa's little wardrobe into the coach, ſhe recollected her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far as to inquire after Lady Granville. Lord Haſtings replied, that being a little indiſpoſed, ſhe had deſired him to wait on her, and attend her to the Caſtle. "I greatly fear, Miſs Seymour," added he, that my viſit at this time has proved an unwelcome one. Louiſa attempted a reply, but the words died on her lips.</p>
                  <p>They entered the coach; and a ſilence enſued, which would have been painfully embarraſſing, had not the preſence of the maid ſeemed to authoriſe it.—When they alighted, Lord Haſtings again preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Louiſa to accept of his arm, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to his mother's apartment; but ſhe declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſaying, with a tone of the ſweeteſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that ſhe thanked his Lordſhip, but was now, ſhe believed, able to walk by herſelf.</p>
                  <p>Afraid to witneſs a meeting ſo tender, he retired to his apartment, and took up his pen to indulge the feelings of his heart, by pouring out to his friend.</p>

to you the ſcene of this evening; till death ſhall expunge every trace from my memory, even that which it ſhall loſe the lateſt—the image of Louiſa, I will never, never forget it.</p>
                        <p>At eight this morning, I witneſſed the interment of poor Mrs. Seymour; but, though my deſire to ſee her charming daughter was inexpreſſibly great, I could not intrude on her at a moment ſo ſolemn. In the evening, my mother being indiſpoſed, ſhe deſired me to go and attend Miſs Seymour to the Caſtle</p>
                        <p>On arriving at Springwood, and enquiring for her young lady, the maid told me, that ſhe believed ſhe was walking in the garden. I followed; but not ſeeing her in any of the walks, I purſued that which leads to the park; in a retired part of which ſtands the family burial-place, ſurrounded with high trees and a wall, which concealed her from ſight.</p>
                        <p>The evening was delightfully ſtill; I ſtopt and liſtened to the ſound of a diſtant caſcade, which alone interrupted the awful ſilence. Having looked in vain for Miſs Seymour, I was juſt about to return, when I obſerved the door of the burial-place open. My heart throbbed with ſtrange emotions: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached without noiſe, and beheld—O Beaufort! an object that almoſt deprived me of my ſenſes. It was Louiſa herſelf, clothed in her mourning habit, and kneeling at the foot of her mother's grave.

                  <p>On enquiring after his mother, Lord Haſtings was informed that ſhe was ſtill greatly indiſpoſed, and wiſhed to ſee him. His agitation was not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, when, on entering the room, he beheld Louiſa ſitting by her bedſide, and holding a hand of Lady Granville in her's, which ſhe bathed with her tears. Lord Haſtings approached the bed, and enquiring anxiouſly about her complaints, took hold of the other hand, which he was ſurpriſed to feel very hot and feveriſh. "Henry," ſaid ſhe, <q>this dear child has been too much accuſtomed of late
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024442_0070_0FC73BE7C6CE0CD8"/>
to ſcenes of diſtreſs. Try to amuſe her. Go, my dear, continued ſhe, Haſtings will attend you to the drawing-room, and ſhew you ſome beautiful prints I have juſt purchaſed. Thoſe of your favourite Salvator I intend for your apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Chuſe out the landſcapes you admire moſt; and flatter me, by diſcovering that your taſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with my own.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Louiſa aroſe, and walked with Lord Haſtings into the drawing-room; but thought not of the prints. She read his apprehenſions in his dejected countenance; and inſtantly catching the alarm, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to tell her what he thought of Lady Granville's ſituation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Perhaps, Miſs Seymour, ſaid he, my fears magnify her danger; but at preſent, ſhe certainly has every ſymptom of a fever. Louiſa's affliction was inexpreſſible; and ſhe could not help ſighing in a low voice,—How unhappy am I!—will Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deprive me of every friend?—No, Miſs Seymour, replied Lord Haſtings, with much emotion, you will never want friends:—Virtues like your's ſecure the friendſhip of Heaven itſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This affecting converſation was interrupted by the arrival of Lord Granville, who had ſpent the day at the houſe of a neighbouring gentleman.—He was extremely ſhocked, at his return, to hear of his Lady's illneſs; gave orders, that Dr. Lewis ſhould inſtantly be ſent for; and never quitted her room till he came. The Doctor pronounced Lady Granville's diſorder to be a fever, probably occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the late agitation of her ſpirits; but, the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024442_0071_0FC73BE938C68FA8"/>
cauſe being now removed, he hoped the complaint would neither be formidable nor laſting.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa implored her permiſſion to watch by her during the night; but this Lady Granville abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed. She retired to her apartment, but not to bed.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as the clock ſtruck one, ſhe ventured to ſlip ſoftly down, and liſten at the door of Lady Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's apartment. Having to paſs that of Lord Haſtings, which he had left open with the ſame intention, he ſaw her go down ſtairs, and ſuppoſing his mother grown worſe, followed her in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt agitation. All being quiet, Louiſa was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoftly, when ſhe met Lord Haſtings in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. At ſight of him ſhe ſtarted with ſurpriſe.—The eagerneſs of his enquiries after his mother, the fears he expreſſed for her own health, in a tone of peculiar tenderneſs, and the earneſt manner in which he urged her to go immediately to reſt, affected the weak ſpirits of Louiſa in ſuch a degree, that ſhe could not reſtrain her tears. She pulled out her handkerchief to conceal them, and haſtily retired. By an involuntary movement, he followed her ſome ſteps; as he was ſlowly returning towards his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſaw a ſlip of paper lying in the paſſage, which he picked up without knowing what he did, and laid on his dreſſing-table. He ſat down, and, revolving in his mind the various ſcenes of the paſt day, found his admiration of Louiſa increaſe, with every new light in which her exalted character was placed.</p>
                  <p>He was about to undreſs, when the paper caught his eye; he unfolded it, and perceived that it was
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024442_0072_0FC73BF261BB9308"/>
written in a female hand; and inſtantly knew from the contents that it muſt be that of Miſs Seymour. In reality ſhe had dropt it, by pulling her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief quickly out of her pocket.</p>
                  <p>It was dated midnight; contained the laſt words of her mother; and concluded with this ſolemn addreſs: <q>Almighty God! ſhield of the orphan, be thou my guide and protector through the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paths of life: And having removed from me the beſt of parents, ſpare in mercy the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of friends!</q>

                  <p>The piety of Louiſa, and tenderneſs of her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his mother, melted the ſoul of Lord Haſtings in love and gratitude; nor did her late proofs of his filial piety and ſolicitude for her ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leſs ſenſibly affect her's. Unable wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his emotions, he encloſed the paper in a bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which contained theſe words:—<q>This paper, which I found a few hours ago, can belong only to Miſs Seymour. Pardon a curioſity which I found it impoſſible to reſtrain: I knew not the hand when I preſumed to read it, but could be at no loſs with regard to the writer.—O Miſs Seymour! may your prayer be accepted!

The origin and progreſſive ſtages of the butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly's exiſtence are beautifully illuſtrative of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, changes, and future deſtination of man. The butterfly is produced from a caterpillar, which devours garden plants, and which, having moved for a ſeaſon in its lowly, narrow ſphere, falls into a ſtate of torpid inſenſibility. Thus it continues during the gloom of winter; but when the gladſome beam of ſpring appears, it is re-animated,—burſts its confinement, ſoars aloft, acquires new beauty, power, and vigour. Its ſcene of action, its reliſhes, its exerciſes are changed; the ſubſtance is retained, but the modification is totally altered:—It is at once another and the ſame.—Have recourſe then, ye infidels, to the demonſtrations of annual experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then ſay,—Why ſhould it be thought incredible that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</p>
                        <p>Themes like theſe, my Louiſa, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed frequently to employ your thoughts, in the midſt of company and amuſements.

                  <p>Before Lady Granville was able to take an airing in the coach, ſhe was adviſed by Dr. Lewis to be carried into the garden for the benefit of fresh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> where there was an elegant little pavillion, fitted up in the moſt exquiſite taſte, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of the fineſt proſpects in the world. There, whilſt Louiſa ſat at work with Lady Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, or amuſed herſelf with training the honeyſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and jeſſamine round the windows, Lord Haſtings uſually read aloud. One day he took up a volume of Shakeſpeare, and chance directing him to the <hi>Twelfth Night,</hi> he began to read.</p>
                  <p>It was impoſſible for Louiſa not to perceive that there was ſomething particular in the whole manner of Lord Haſtings towards her; and the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the laſt month had left her in no doubt with reſpect to the nature of her own ſentiments. As his expreſſions, however, might be all juſtified on the ſcore of friendſhip and gratitude, ſhe did not dare to encourage hope, though ſhe often felt the torment of ſuſpenſe, and ſuffered extreme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs from the dread of Lord Haſtings entertaining the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of the truth.</p>

As he advanced in the play, ſhe felt herſelf great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected. When he came to that pathetic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, "She never told her love," &amp;c. the colour forſook her cheeks, and her heart palpitated with the moſt painful apprehenſions. It inſtantly occurred to her, that Lord Haſtings had artfully contrived this method of diſcovering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;—the thought was agony.</p>
                  <p>On pronouncing this ſentence,—"A murderous guilt ſhows not itſelf more ſoon, than love that would ſeem hid,"—he ſtopt, he ſighed; and venturing to ſteal a look at Louiſa, ſaw her pale and breathleſs, juſt ſinking from her chair. He flew to her, and catching her in his arms, prevented her from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Lady Granville, who was not an unconcerned ſpectator of this ſcene, aſſiſted her ſon in carrying her out to the air.—"My love," ſaid ſhe, <q>your long confinement in a ſick-room, has, I fear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured your health. Indeed, Louiſa, the journey to Bath, which Dr. Lewis urges, is not leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you than myſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From that moment Louiſa reſolved to keep the ſtricteſt watch over herſelf; and conſcious of her inability to diſſemble, to avoid for the future the company of Lord Haſtings, with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ſhe had formerly wiſhed for it. He perceived the coldneſs and alteration in her manner; but far from ſuſpecting the real cauſe, with that diffidence which often accompanies true merit, and always genuine love, he ſought for it in his own conduct; ſome part of which, though unknown to himſelf, he feared had offended her.</p>

The conſciouſneſs that haunted Louiſa, when in company with him, gave her a feeling ſo exquiſitely painful, that it even threw an air of peeviſhneſs into her converſation. When he inquired anxiouſly about her health, it increaſed her anguiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, by making her ſuſpect that her ſecret diſtreſs was beco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Lord Haſtings ſought in vain to unravel the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of her behaviour; he was convinced of her indifference; he felt diſſatisfied and unhappy; but though he knew too well the cauſe of his inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he was utterly unconſcious of having done any thing to merit the anguiſh he ſuffered.</p>

Her admiration indeed was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and unmixed with envy; but would probably have been attended with a feeling equally painful, had ſhe not inſtantly perceived the coldneſs with which Louiſa treated Lord Haſtings, and recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theſe two Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived mutual pleaſure and advantage from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſociety; and before they parted, Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte entreated Louiſa to write to her, in ſuch preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing terms, as left her no pretence for declining a correſpondence, which ſhe by no means thought herſelf qualified to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>One day, when the two young ladies and Lord Haſtings were walking in the garden, Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, with her uſual vivacity, began to rally Miſs Seymour on the number of conqueſts ſhe would make at Bath. The converſation happening to turn on the marriage of a young lady there to a rich, diſagreeable old miſer, Louiſa expreſſed her deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a conduct ſo intereſted, in the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024442_0082_0FC73C338AEA9610"/>
terms. "Very well," replied her lively friend, <q>all this is mighty pretty talking: Nay, I doubt not but you will carry your romantic folly ſo far, as to marry ſome gentle generous youth, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himſelf as capable of living on love, and hope, and vows, and nonſenſe, as you do. But indeed, my dear girl, we mortals require ſome groſſer aliment; and I'll venture to wager, you ſhall be of my opinion before ten years are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: Nay, perhaps, as many weeks at Bath will be ſufficient to effect this marvellous change. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, child, you have never yet ſeen the world. Oh! you know not the dear delight of being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, admired, and flattered! Don't you think, my Lord, that Miſs Seymour will ſoon be of my opinion?—I ſhould rather hope, madam, replied he gravely, that the empty adulation of mere admirers, would ſerve to give Miſs Seymour a juſter value for the eſteem and admiration of her real friends.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Lady Charlotte paid little attention to this ſpeech, Louiſa perfectly comprehended the meaning of it. Indeed, the whole of this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation introduced into the minds of Lord Haſtings and Miſs Seymour a train of ideas ſo unpleaſing, that they were glad to put an end to it, by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>A few hours after the Marquis and his daughter went away, a genteel young woman demanded to ſee Miſs Seymour alone, and was accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to her apartment. It being then the duſk, Louiſa could not ſee the face of the perſon who waited for her; and was not a little alarmed on ſeeing her bolt the door, and then, falling on her

knees, burſt into a flood of tears, accompanied with ſuch violent agitation, as for a while robbed her of the power of utterance. Louiſa begged to know what ſhe wanted. "Oh, Miſs Seymour," cried ſhe, with a feeble voice, interrupted with ſighs, have you forgotten your once virtuous, once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Sally Vernon? "Good Heavens!

But how came you here at this late hour?—Why have you left Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge?—What is the cauſe of your diſtreſs?—"O!" continued the afflicted mourner, why did you ſend me from you? You know, dear Miſs Seymour, I was not a vain or giddy creature. Had I ſtill been at Springwood, I would have been the happieſt, as I am now the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the human race.—</q> She then proceeded, with much difficulty, to give Miſs Seymour the melancholy relation contained in the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Louiſa diſpatched to her friend early next morning, before ſetting out for Bath;</p>

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024442_0084_0FC73C38C62E9888"/>
ſtaid there ſome days at Lady Granville's deſire, waiting my mother's return from France. She was the only child of a favourite ſervant, who dying, bequeathed her to my mother's care. Sally waited on me, till the loſs of my father's fortune obliged us to diſmiſs all our ſupernumerary domeſtics. My worthy parent, unwilling to expoſe this innocent girl to the dangers of the world, placed her with a chamber milliner at Cambridge. There ſhe has continued for ſeveral years paſt, and behaved in a manner which gained her the affection of the whole family.</p>
                        <p>Some time ago, a young gentleman, of the name of Talbot, called to look at ſome ruffles: He ſaw the unfortunate Sally, wrote ſeveral letters to her, pretending he was the ſon of a wealthy farmer in the next county; and by various arts, prevailed on the unſuſpecting girl to correſpond with him, and liſten to his addreſſes.</p>
                        <p>I cannot pretend to give you all the particulars of this ſhocking affair; I had them from her own lips, and ſpared her the painful relation. Suffice it to ſay, that in return for the moſt tender and confiding affection, he has betrayed her to ruin, and loaded her with ſhame.</p>
                        <p>Oh, my dear Lady Charlotte! how my heart ſwells with indignation againſt the perpetrator of this moſt cruel, this premeditated villany!—What will become of this wretched orphan I know not. He ſet off a few days ago for France, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farewel, or leaving one guinea for her ſupport, notwithſtanding her preſent deplorable ſituation.—

How mean, how deſpicable does vice render the human character!</p>
                        <p>She aſked to ſee me alone yeſterday; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter throwing herſelf at my feet, and ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging her fault, which indeed would admit of many palliations, ſhe conjured me, by the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my revered parent, to ſave her from infamy and want. Her words were few, but the eloquence of her diſtreſs was irreſiſtible. I diſmiſſed her with a promiſe of ſoon finding an aſylum proper for her, and deſired her to ſay to the milliner, that having heard of ſomething greatly to her advantage, I was about to remove her from Cambridge.</p>
                        <p>It immediately occurred to me, that your good old nurſe whom we viſited together, would be a proper perſon for ſuch a charge, eſpecially as ſhe has no family, and her cottage ſtands remote from any other.—If Sally's ill-fated infant ſees the light, I can eaſily find a nurſe for it in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.—Let me know if this plan meets with your approbation.</p>

I have looked to as part of my reward; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, even the indulgence of benevolence has ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratification in view.—Were we at due pains, my dear friend, to examine the motives of our actions, we would often have cauſe to bluſh for thoſe, on account of which we proudly arrogate to ourſelves the praiſe due to ſuperior merit.</p>

For my part, inſtead of caſting away care, I have got a huge addition to my former ſtock—the care of pleaſing you; which I am ſo anxious to do, that, knowing affection to be of an aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature, I am ſtriving to imitate you; and, in hope of making you what you have never appeared to be—fond of yourſelf—am encroaching on your province, and affecting your ſtyle.

                        <p>The only thing of which every perſon here ſeems careleſs, is that health, which they profeſs to make the ſole object of their care.—One, I ſhall ever anxiouſly preſerve—that of endeavouring to merit your friendſhip, and to juſtify to the world your kind partiality for me.

                        <p>I now addreſs my beloved friend, from the very centre of faſhion and folly. Is this then the world, ſo much deſired, ſo eagerly purſued, at the expence of health, peace—nay, even virtue itſelf?—Ah, my Adelaide! it has no charms for me; it never will have.</p>
                        <p>I am alarmed and diſconcerted at every ſtep: I am diſguſted with the extravagant levity of the women, and the fulſome adulation of the men; who, in praiſing others, ſeem to be wholly engroſſed by the care of diſplaying their own talents, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſuperficial accompliſhments in the moſt advantageous light.—That indiſcriminating polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the courteſy of the world dignifies with the title of good-breeding, appears to me to be nothing better than a refined ſpecies of hypocriſy. I ſhrink from the view of thoſe harſh and unamiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which the generality of our ſpecies are neither at pains to correct nor conceal; and ſeek in vain for the beloved circle of friends, with whom I am accuſtomed to converſe with freedom and delight, in the quiet of the country. My heart is ever ready to ſpeak, but there are none to hear or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it: All here ſeem to have but one care, one object, one idol—and that is ſelf—to whom they pay unceaſing homage.</p>
                        <p>How thankful to Providence ought we to be, my Adelaide, who hath preſerved our hearts from
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024442_0090_0FC73C4E787304F0"/>
being corrupted by the world!—who hath endowed them with feelings too exalted, too refined, to be comprehended by thoſe who are enſlaved by faſhion, and whoſe taſte is depraved by vice and luxury!—How thankful, that the view of the ſublime, the uſeful, and the beautiful, both in the natural and moral world, excites in our ſouls the moſt pure pleaſure, the moſt devout gratitude, the moſt lively adoration and praiſe!—Theſe are emotions at once exquiſite and ennobling! Emotions which, alas! are but little known to the bulk of our ſpecies!—Pleaſures which eſcape the regards even of thoſe who profeſs no other purſuit but pleaſure! Reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf for thoſe who love him—by rightly loving themſelves; who fear him—by fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commit what is offenſive to him; and who obey him—by following the beſt inſtincts of nature, the cleareſt deductions of reaſon; all which coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with our only unerring guide, the divine light of revelation.</p>
                        <p>Your friendſhip for me, Adelaide, gives me a jealouſy of myſelf, to which I was formerly a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. She who hopes to maintain a place in that heart, where ſuch noble candour, generoſity, and friendſhip inhabit, ought to poſſeſs no vulgar ſhare of theſe virtues. I fear to be unjuſt to a friendſhip like your's, by admitting another candidate for mine; yet, after all, my Adelaide, I feet, that though I may eſteem and admire others for various good qualities, you, and you alone, are the friend of my heart.</p>
                        <p>About a week before we ſet out for Bath, the Marquis of Wincheſter, who has a fine ſeat in this neighbourhood, came with his daughter, to ſpend

ſome days with Lord and Lady Granville.—I have never ſeen more dignity and grace united, than in Lady Charlotte Villiers: She is extremely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and poſſeſſes a ready wit, which, as it is never diſplayed either to attract admiration, or give unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary pain, has the effect of rendering her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the higheſt degree entertaining. She diſtinguiſhes me by her notice; and, when we parted, ſolicited my friendſhip and correſpondence, in a manner truly pleaſing, and which did me much honour. But ſhall I confeſs to my Adelaide, I feel more admiration than complacency for Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte? I cannot ſhake off the reſtraint which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of rank impoſes; and, through the nobleneſs of her ſentiments, I can yet perceive that ſhe values herſelf on the ſuperiority of her birth. Beſides, though highly accompliſhed, and extremely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Lady Charlotte wants that irreſiſtible charm which ſenſibility adds to the female character. She ſometimes amuſes herſelf with laughing at the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs weakneſſes of her ſpecies, but never expoſes them to public view. She deſpiſes popularity, and teſtifies her friendſhip, by placing your foibles in a light at once ſo ſtriking and ridiculous, that, being neither able to excuſe nor deny, you have no way left but to abjure them.</p>
                        <p>"I often draw a compariſon between my beloved friend, and this admired beauty: Her perfections, like the meridian ſun, dazzle and fatigue the ſight—Your's, my Adelaide, reſemble the ſoft mild luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the queen of Heaven, whoſe charming aſpect we uſed to contemplate together, with ſuch ineffable delight, in the gardens of St. Cire.—Oh! with what pleaſing melancholy, what tender regret, do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the hours ſpent there!—Is there not, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

                  <p>Soon after the arrival of the Granville family at Bath, they went to viſit the rooms. Whilſt they were walking there, a lady entered, leaning on a genteel young man, both in deep mourning; whom Louiſa inſtantly diſcovered to be her travelling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, Mrs. Stanhope, and her ſon. They mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually expreſſed their ſatisfaction on occaſion of this unexpected meeting; and Mr. Stanhope, with marks of the tendereſt ſenſibility, condoled with Louiſa on the loſs ſhe had ſuſtained, acquainting her at the ſame time with the death of his father, which had likewiſe happened ſince they parted at Dover.</p>
                  <p>As Miſs Seymour looked very pale and dejected, he could not help expreſſing great ſolicitude about her health, the loſs of which he feared had induced her to viſit Bath at that unfaſhionable ſeaſon. Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, after proper acknowledgments, and informing him of the cauſe of her journey, turning to Lady Granville, "Permit me, Madam," ſaid ſhe, <q>to introduce Mrs. Stanhope and her ſon to your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; their merit claims your eſteem, and my obligations to their kindneſs will ſecure them your friendſhip.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings, from the oppoſite ſide of the room, had obſerved with attention the pleaſing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe Louiſa expreſſed on ſeeing Mr. Stanhope.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024442_0093_0FC73C59E1449A00"/>
He came up to them at the moment ſhe uttered the laſt ſentence, and was loſt in amazement at her ſpeech, the import of which he could not poſſibly comprehend, as he had not heard the name of Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope, and knew of no friends whith whom Miſs Seymour could be on ſo familiar a footing.</p>
                  <p>He ſoon obſerved the conſtant and pointed atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid her by Mr. Stanhope, which ſhe received with the ſweeteſt complacency; and jealouſy was now added to the other reſtleſs paſſions that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his ſoul. But, though divided by turns between fear, ſuſpenſe, and jealouſy, love maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its empire there. Louiſa appeared with ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or advantages in every new point of light. Modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, humility, and ingenuity, were the conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of her gentle boſom; and ſhe appeared with the ſame unconſcious ſweetneſs, and dignified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, in public crouds of the gay and the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as when ſeated in the private circle of her cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen friends.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they returned home, Lord Haſtings enquired eagerly after the name and quality of the ſtrangers. Louiſa readily informed him; and at the ſame time mentioned the kindneſs ſhewn by them to her mother, in terms of ſuch lively gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as excited his envy, and confirmed his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa obſerved, with extreme pain, the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind, and depreſſion of his ſpirits.—The diffidence of his manner, whenever he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, and the reſpectful attention with which he treated her, convinced her, that ſhe had injured him by her former ſuſpicions.

Friendſhip annihilates their foibles and magnifies their virtues: Others loſe greatly by compariſon; and hence the ſocial and benevolent affections come at length to be confined to a ſphere far too narrow and limited for their healthful exerciſe. Intimacy with a viriety of characters gives the mind more enlarged ideas, and a more liberal turn; and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering various great and good qualities in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, we are induced to give credit to our ſpecies for many more which we want opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velop.</p>

Let me warn my beloved friend againſt cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that falſe delicacy and exceſſive refinement which would wholly unfit her for commerce with the world, and that ſtation which Providence hath aſſigned her there. Philanthropy, in ſome meaſure, conforms the human to the divine nature: Though there are harſh features in ſome characters, there are good qualities in all; and though the vices of individuals excite a virtuous indignation for our ſpecies, as a collective body, let us ever cheriſh the ſweet glow of benevolence.</p>
                        <p>Though ſenſibility adds grace to virtue, if it becomes ſo exquiſite as to occaſion more pain and diſguſt than pleaſure to its poſſeſſor, it can no longer be regarded as a bleſſing. Approbation is a pleaſant ſentiment; but it is a real misfortune to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that degree of refinement, which gives us a diſreliſh for the ordinary purſuits and ſatisfactions of life.—When we enter the great theatre of the world, we find two repreſentations of human life: One, the work of imagination, a young giddy enthuſiaſt,—the other, that of experience, a ſober ſkilful artiſt. The firſt preſents you only with exaggerated features, deceitful proportions, and random ſtrokes, which confound and miſlead the judgment. In the work of the other, light and ſhade are judiciouſly blended; and through the whole you may trace beauty, ſymmetry, and deſign: Every feature is mellowed by time; and if you are not dazzled with its luſtre, neither will you be diſguſted with its faults.</p>

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate your malicious inference; but I aſſure you, it is the ſhortneſs, not length, of your letters which occaſions my ſighing. Perhaps, I ought rather to applaud, than blame your generous caution; you know ſweet morſels are apt to pall, and tremble leſt you ſhould give me a ſurfeit.</p>
                        <p>With that diſſidence which always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies genuine merit, you diſclaim the praiſe due to your late conduct to poor Sally, and alledge that your generoſity proceeded from a deſire to indulge yourſelf. You wrong yourſelf, my Louiſa; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has been the reward, whilſt virtue was the ſource of your conduct.</p>
                        <p>I know there are ſome who arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the title of Philoſophers, but who in fact are no lovers of wiſdom, but mere lovers of paradox, that derive all our actions from the ſelfiſh principle. Let us detect the fallacy. No man could rightly
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024442_0097_0FC73C668B58FBC8"/>
eſtimate the pleaſure of goodneſs, till he had himſelf been good. From what motive then aroſe the firſt benevolent action?</p>
                        <p>Again, you affirm, that your charity was not diſintereſted, becauſe you hoped by it to obtain my approbation. Our actions, my dear Miſs Seymour, are ſeldom the reſult of a ſingle principle, but flow from a complex variety of motives. To wiſh for the approbation of the good, is at leaſt innocent, and cannot therefore contaminate the action to which it gives riſe. And, although your charity may have looked to this as a part of its reward, yet a deed which in part was prompted by compaſſion, is not therefore to be ſtripped quite naked of merit. Let us guard againſt pride, by an impartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the hidden ſprings of our conduct; but let us ſhun alſo too ſevere a ſcrutiny, leſt deprived of the ſupport of ſelf-approbation, the vigour of our minds fail, for want of that reviving cordial which our benignant Creator hath provided as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to perſeverance in virtue.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, you are ſurpriſed that a perſon with my advantages, and living ſo much in the gay world, ſhould have nothing of the coquette in her diſpoſition.—To my father, Louiſa, I am indebted for this. Deprived in infancy of my mother, his whole attention has been beſtowed on me, and I have been his conſtant companion from a child.</p>
                        <p>He knows human nature; and having made my temper his peculiar ſtudy, took advantage of my high ſpirit, to inſpire me early with the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ambition of excelling in mental, rather than perſonal qualifications. He oppoſed one paſſion to another, and taught the pride of ſuperior intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to combat the rage for admiration.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you will think he has ſtill much to conquer, when, in the courſe of one letter, I can betray two foibles, vanity and loquacity.—See the confidence I have in your friendſhip!</p>

                        <p>You rally me, my dear Lady Charlotte, on my ſeriouſneſs and love of retirement, which you term unnatural at my age. Truth is, though we may live in the world without adopting its prejudices, or being corrupted by its vices, we can hardly avoid being conformed to its cuſtoms and manners, which are utterly repugnant both to my principles and taſte.</p>
                        <p>The abſurdity of theſe will not ſtrike your mind, becauſe they have long been familiar to you;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024442_0099_0FC7388AB72F49F0"/>
but permit me to aſk, what can be more unnatural, ridiculous, diſingenuous, and even criminal, than the whole life and conduct of a fine Lady!—Let me attempt the picture: At the expence of health and duty, ſhe waſtes in ſleep or ſloth thoſe ſtill, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, delightful hours, which ought to be devoted to the improvement of her mind and regulation of her family. She gets up with uneaſy reflections on the loſſes, diſappointments, and mortifications of the preceding day; or elſe with no reflections at all. Her temper is fretted during the tedious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the toilette, by diſcovering in her face the ſure, though ſilent, ravages of time and diſſipation. Chagrined with herſelf, ſhe vents her ill-humour indiſcriminately on all who approach her; and her caprice and injuſtice teach even her children and domeſtics to deſpiſe her. Utterly ignorant of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſhe waſtes the precious hours of life in vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contriving the means of rendering them happy. To diſſipate that time, which ſhe knows not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, yet whoſe ſilent lapſe ſhe marks with terror, and deplores with anguiſh, ſhe ſets out on a round of viſits, in full confidence of being denied admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by all who call themſelves her friends, and whom ſhe would indeed rank as enemies, did they conſent to ſee her. But if, by ſome unfortunate miſtake, their doors are opened to receive her, ſhe execrates the fault; and with conſummate art, and heroic diſſimulation, inſtantly converts her frowns into ſmiles, and flies with open arms to meet the very perſon, whom in her heart ſhe hates, deſpiſes, envies, and defames.—Company joins her at her ſuperb, but joyleſs and inhoſpitable meal. There, want of confidence and eſteem throws reſtraint and coldneſs into converſation; for where there is no mutual deſire to pleaſe and be pleaſed, diſguſt and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024442_0100_0FC7388C379F4200"/>
indifference muſt take place of ſocial intercourſe, harmony, and cheerfulneſs.—Public amuſements fill up the tedious night;—amuſements! grown not only taſteleſs but burthenſome by repetition. Frivolous converſation, unmeanning gallantry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid pleaſures, and ruinous gaming, ſum up the joys of a fine lady.—She may, indeed, be ſaid to walk in a vain ſhow; for her life is a train of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful deceit, which cannot impoſe upon the world, and which neither promotes her intereſt nor comfort. Her rankling paſſions increaſe with her years; her heart is the receptacle of pride, envy, malevolence, and diſguſt:—Her youth is waſted in folly, her age has no friends: She lives without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, ſhe dies without hope!</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, my dear Lady Charlotte, you think me too ſevere. Believe me, it was Truth that guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pencil, and Experience that finiſhed the piece. The glowing colours of imagination had no place there.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs I am ſhocked and diſguſted beyond expreſſion with the levity, and even rudeneſs, of thoſe, who call themſelves the polite world. Would you believe it, I have been frequently ridiculed here, for my preſent mourning habit? The only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimony I can give, of that reverence I ſhall ever feel, for the memory of the beſt of mothers!</p>
                        <p>Two young ladies of faſhion ſtood near me laſt night; when, after diſconcerting me extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſcanning me from head to foot, with looks of ineffable contempt, This deep mourning for a mother, ſaid one of them, who has already been dead two months, is abſurd affectation.—Ah,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024442_0101_0FC7388F4DE22F18"/>
my dear, replied the other, this muſhroom beauty, whom nobody knows, is not ſo ignorant as not to perceive the effect black has, in heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delicacy of ſuch a ſkin and complexion.</p>
                        <p>I am not conſcious of being vain or conceited, Lady Charlotte; but if I am, this is not the proper way of correcting me.—I will not allow myſelf, however, to feel laſting reſentment, where, perhaps, no inſult was intended. Theſe young ladies were not conſcious of the pain they were inflicting, and, beſides—they had not loſt a mother!—With reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to changing my dreſs, I ſhall not regulate my conduct by their opinion. I can never regard the practice of wearing mourning ſolely in the light of compliance with cuſtom: It ſeems intended as a ſecurity againſt thoſe wounds, which a heart, yet ſore from recent diſtreſs, would feel, from witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extravagance of mirth, or thoughtleſſneſs of levity.—Intemperate muſt that mind be, which the preſence of a perſon, whoſe countenance and habit expreſs the real mourner, will not awe for a little into ſomething like ſeriouſneſs.—Another cuſtom, too, prevails in the world, which I think both cruel and unneceſſary—That of admitting into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one in deep affliction, all thoſe who, under the pretence of ſympathy, ſeek only to gratify an impertinent and moſt diſguſting curioſity.

                        <p>You tell me, my amiable friend, that my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at once amuſe and delight you: I can eaſily believe that a heart ſo tender, will find ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſympathiſing in the feelings of mine;—but indeed, Louiſa, the quiet and uniform tenour of the conventual life, furniſhes but very few topics of amuſement.—There is nothing, however, from which a contemplative mind may not derive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Whether we confine our views to earth, or raiſe them to Heaven, we ſhall find new cauſe to admire the wiſdom and extol the goodneſs of the Creator, God!</p>
                        <p>Like you, I am a paſſionate, admirer of the ſimple beauties of nature. Artleſs expreſſions are ever the moſt pethetic; and therefore thoſe objects which owe their charms to nature alone, are moſt in harmony with my preſent feelings.—But whilſt we, my friend, felicitate ourſelves on poſſeſſing a taſte which can derive pleaſure from ſo many ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought we not to adore that Being, who, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive not only to the neceſſities, but enjoyment of his creatures, hath adjuſted theſe to their various capacities of happineſs?</p>

The ſcenes, my Louiſa, which contribute to my inſtruction, as well as pleaſure, are thoſe to which I moſt frequently reſort. The weak ſtate of my health making change of air neceſſary, my mother, with permiſſion of the Abbeſs, has brought me once more to the ſcenes of my earlieſt, happieſt years. With what mournful pleaſure, what tender regret, do I look back on thoſe years?—Happy! healthful! and innocent!—Ah! my friend, how ignorant are we then of the value of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings? It is not till the ſtreams of proſperity are dried up, that we are ſenſible how plenteouſly they have flowed: Mine, Louiſa, are cut off for ever!</p>
                        <p>Nothing preſents a more ſtriking emblem of Time, than a ſilent and ſmooth-flowing river; ſuch as that I have juſt been contemplating. To the careleſs and inattentive eye, it ſeems always the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But a few months are paſſed, ſince we traced together the courſe of this river: Its waters were then pure and tranſparent;—we admired its beauty, and were refreſhed with its coolneſs. How is the ſcene changed? Swollen by a torrent of deſcending rains, it hath burſt its bounds; and, dark, troubled, impetuous, it rolls along, involving, in its waſteful progreſs, every herb and flower which it formerly nouriſhed!—So fares it with the human ſoul—There, whilſt the affections flow in their ſmooth and natural courſe, the ſeeds of virtue ſpring, and its flowers bloſſom. But no ſooner does the ſtorm

of paſſion ariſe, than every noble thought, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous wiſh, and uſeful aim, are violently ſwept away into the gulph of oblivion!</p>
                        <p>Be it our care, my Louiſa, to preſerve the ſtream of our affections pure from every ſtain; and to cheriſh thoſe virtues which Heaven hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our care, till they ſhall grow up to beauty and perfection, and be tranſplanted to a milder clime, where they ſhall imbibe the rays of a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting ſun, and flouriſh, with increaſing ſtrength, beauty and vigour, for ever!</p>
                        <p>Adieu, my amiable friend—Let us think of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener of the bleſſings which remain, than of thoſe which are taken away from us; and of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we eſcape, than on the ſlight evils we are obliged a little while to endure.—Adieu.</p>

There, plenty is ſeen without profuſion, and neatneſs without oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Good-taſte, good-breeding, good-ſenſe, and mild complacency, teach her gueſts to forget they are ſtrangers, and to feel they are friends.—Her huſband beholds her with mingled pride and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and his approbation, though ſilent, diffuſes joy through her heart, and cheerfulneſs through her converſation.—The evening is paſſed amidſt the choſen circle, with whom ſhe knows no reſerves, and whoſe accumulated happineſs becomes her own. Converſation, if uſeful or agreeable, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; if dull, relieved by the aids which the fine arts ſupply to thoſe who cultivate them. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, dancing, cards, are occaſionally called in; and even thoſe amuſements for which ſhe has no reliſh herſelf, ſhe cheerfully adopts, in the hope of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the enjoyment of others.—Public diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſometimes viſited, but always tend with the reaſonable woman to increaſe her love of ſocial and domeſtic pleaſures.—When in public, ſhe appears with propriety and modeſty. She envies not beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,—ſhe covets not grandeur,—ſhe ſeeks not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage attention; for, in the pleaſing conſciouſneſs
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024442_0109_0FC738B19DD39AD8"/>
of diſcharging her duty, in the love of her huſband, and eſteem of her friends, ſhe finds complete hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Such is a reaſonable woman! The very oppoſite of a faſhionable one. If we heſitate to which to give the preference, we may, perhaps, with much propriety, deſerve to be ranked in the latter claſs; but we certainly can form no pretenſions to the name or character of the former.</p>
                        <p>After all, my dear Lady Charlotte, is it not aſtoniſhing that we are at ſo little pains to become reaſonable women? We whoſe limited and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic ſituation renders the cultivation of the leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, the mild and gentle virtues, eſſential to our comfort. There are few people who are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great and generous actions, when they know by them they will excite admiration and obtain applauſe; but in private life, where our virtues paſs unheeded, we are at little pains to become diſintereſted, benevolent, or ſelf-denied. It is in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, however, that opportunities are conſtantly occurring for the exerciſe of theſe virtues, and where we can at once witneſs and profit by their effects: But mankind, in general, prefer the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning voice of the multitude to the ſoothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their own minds.</p>
                        <p>Adieu, my friend! If I continue to moralize any longer, you will with juſtice pronounce me, a moſt UNREASONABLE WOMAN.</p>

                     </gap> at Bath, Lady Granville
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024442_0110_0FC738B3398C7F88"/>
felt the ſtrongeſt deſire to have a picture of her ſon, as the time fixed for his going abroad faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe made this requeſt to Lord Haſtings, he expreſſed the greateſt reluctance to having his likeneſs taken at that time; conſcious, perhaps, that the ſtate of his mind was not ſuch as would give an agreeable expreſſion to his features. Miſs Seymour was not preſent when this ſubject was mentioned. On entering the room, Come hither, my dear Louiſa, ſaid Lady Granville, and help me to perſuade this perverſe ſon of mine to do his duty: Sure I am he can never have a fitter pattern or more able inſtructor. This is the firſt time he ever oppoſed my will; and as he can form no reaſonable pretext for his non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I am reſolved to aſſert the prerogative of a mother, and inſiſt on his immediate performance of his duty; or elſe I ſhall certainly puniſh him as a rebel.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa's colour went and came during this ſpeech, the meaning of which it was impoſſible for her to divine. Looking firſt at Lady Granville, and then at Lord Haſtings, her timid eyes ſeemed to demand an explanation of it. My mother is very deſirous, Miſs Seymour, ſaid he, of having my picture; but there is only one condition that will prevail on me to ſubmit to this tireſome operation. You muſt ſet the example of my duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me for performing it, by having your own done at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville was not aware of the conſequence of her requeſt, elſe her prudence would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024442_0111_0FC738B4C1949A20"/>
her from making it. Several circumſtances combined to perſuade her, that Lord Haſtings took a more lively intereſt in her young favourite, than ſhe thought conſiſtent, either with his preſent eaſe or future proſpects. She could not avoid, however, ſeconding her ſon's propoſal, and added, with equal prudence and politeneſs, I ſhall envy nobody when I ſhall have two ſuch pleaſant friends in my poſſeſſion.—Lord Haſtings urged his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with a warmth and importunity that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſconcerted Louiſa. Ever fearful of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſecret ſentiments, though ſhe knew not how to refuſe, ſhe greatly dreaded complying; but in this inſtance her prudence was overborne, by her ſtrong inclination to oblige him. Though Lord Haſtings remarked her heſitation and embarraſſment, without knowing the cauſe, he was ſenſibly gratified by her obliging compliance.</p>
                  <p>The coach was immediately ordered, and they drove to the lodging of Mr. Valoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; who being then diſengaged, begged leave to take the outlines of the two pictures, as his time at Bath was very uncertain.</p>
                  <p>A little diſpute now aroſe between Miſs Seymour and Lord Haſtings, with reſpect to who ſhould ſit firſt. Louiſa ſaid, that as Mr. Valois's time was uncertain, it was undoubtedly proper, that the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Lord Haſtings ſhould be firſt finiſhed; but he, recurring to his mother's ſpeech, inſiſted on her ſetting the example. This little altercation gave an agreeable heightening to the delicate complexion of Louiſa. As ſhe was dreſſed in a large morning cap, the painter found it neceſſary to have it remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to obtain a full view of her cheek, as
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024442_0112_0FC738B63A97A240"/>
ſhe was to be drawn in profile. This trifling cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance exceedingly diſconcerted the modeſt and gentle Louiſa, whoſe elegant mind was exquiſitely ſenſible to every feeling of propriety. She looked abaſhed, her colour increaſed; Lady Granville ſaw her embarraſſment; and in order to relieve it, "Come, my love," ſaid ſhe, we will retire a a moment, and I will myſelf try to perform the office of friſeur: Mr. Valois will excuſe me, tho' I ſhould not prove very dexterous in my new profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>During their ſhort abſence, the ſcene in the park at Springwood occurred to the memory of Lord Haſtings. He was ſeized with the moſt paſſionate deſire to have Louiſa drawn in the very attitude in which he had beheld her at the grave of her mother. Afraid of the penetrating eyes of his own, he had not courage to propoſe it; and not having a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to loſe,—"As this Lady, Sir," ſaid he, "is in the habit of a mourner, I ſhould imagine the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude moſt favourable for the character of her face would be that of devotion." The painter being perfectly of his opinion, he propoſed on return of the ladies, that Miſs Seymour ſhould take a ſeat near the window, and fix her eyes on the ceiling for a few minutes.</p>
                  <p>What were the agitating emotions which Lord Haſtings experienced during their progreſs! An aſſociation of ideas, altogether delightful, occupied, his mind, and his eyes were rivetted to a face, whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024442_0113_0FC738BEB277CCC0"/>
and the glow of exquiſite ſenſibility, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the novelty of her ſituation, rendered her ſo inimitably beautiful, that the artiſt, as well as the lover, was rapt in ſilent admiration.</p>
                  <p>She aroſe, and Lord Haſtings unwillingly took her place.—Some difficulty now occurred about the attitude in which he ſhould be drawn; the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having remarked the uncommon and animated expreſſion of his fine eyes, requeſted permiſſion to take his full face.</p>
                  <p>No time could have been more favourable to do juſtice both to the excellency of the ſubject and ſkill of the artiſt. The countenance of Lord Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings was lighted up by a variety of the ſweeteſt and moſt tender ſenſations; and the object on whom his eyes were chiefly fixed was not likely to diſſipate them.</p>
                  <p>The pictures were finiſhed, and met with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal approbation. But as they were confeſſedly the moſt beautiful and highly finiſhed pieces in his collection, Mr. Valois begged permiſſion to detain them a little while in his poſſeſſion, as they did him much credit by being ſhewn. One morning when Mrs. Stanhope called to take Miſs Seymour out an airing, ſhe expreſſed the greateſt curioſity to ſee the pictures, on which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe heard the higheſt encomiums laviſhed wherever ſhe went. Accordingly they drove to the painter's, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be extremely hurried.—I have juſt received accounts, Madam, ſaid he, to Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, of the death of a relation, which obliges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024442_0114_0FC738C000497898"/>
about to ſend the pictures, but perhaps you will take the trouble of carrying them home yourſelf. Louiſa took out her purſe; but Mr. Valois prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, by ſaying they were already paid for. Then ſtepping to the table, and taking out of the drawer a little ſealed packet, he ſaid, in a low voice, May I beg, Madam, that you will have the goodneſs to preſent this to Lord Haſtings, when nobody is preſent.—The aſtoniſhed Louiſa heſitated a moment, not knowing what anſwer to make, but afraid of being obſerved by her companion, ſhe put it haſtily into her pocket. Her deſire to know the contents of this little parcel was extreme, but it proceeded not from curioſity alone; a ſentiment a thouſand times more powerful, more irreſiſtible, excited it. She ſhuddered at the bare idea of doing a mean or diſhonourable action; ſhe determined to conquer her preſent temptation to it; but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inſtantly occurred, that left her no time for heſitating about what conduct ſhe ought to purſue. Having ſet down Mrs. Stanhope at her own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhe proceeded in her coach to thoſe of Lord Granville; on ſtepping out, the foot-board being much lower than that to which ſhe was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her foot ſlipt, and ſhe fell to the ground with violence. The buſtle this accident occaſioned in the hall reached Lord Haſtings, who, on hearing Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's voice, flew to her aſſiſtance. On ſeeing her pale and trembling, "Good Heaven, Miſs Seymour," cried he, eagerly, "what is the matter?" No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, my Lord, anſwered ſhe, ſmiling, but with a voice ſtill faultering with fear and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; "Indeed, I ſhall be quite well preſently." He ſupported her into the parlour, and ſpoke to her in a manner, and with a tone ſo ſoftened with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024442_0115_0FC738C17AEB09D0"/>
that ſhe was tempted to regret ſhe had ſo little excuſe for exciting it. As Lady Granville was abroad, he contrived, under pretence of giving her time to recover from the ſhock ſhe had got by her fall, to detain her in the parlour for half an hour; during which, an intereſting converſation took place; and he found opportunity of teſtifying to her thoſe watchful and quiet attentions that flow directly from the heart, and of which the heart knows the full value.</p>
                  <p>Though there never could have been a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity than the preſent for comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the requeſt of the painter, Louiſa could not find courage to give Lord Haſtings the packet herſelf; but delayed fixing on the proper means of conveying it to him till ſhe ſhould reach her own apartment. As ſoon as ſhe did ſo, ſhe took it out of her pocket; and diſcovered, with great emotion, that the ſeal had been broken by her fall. Her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity now became irreſiſtible.—"Surely," whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered ſhe to herſelf, there can be nothing in a parcel from Mr. Valois to Lord Haſtings that I may not ſee!—In any other inſtance but this, Miſs Seymour would have argued in a different manner. Too well do we know how reaſon will weigh and judgment determine, when inclination holds the balance.—She unfolded a paper, in which was a picture ſealed up, and an open billet contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words:</p>

                  <p>Whilſt Louiſa peruſed this billet, ſhe was ſeized with ſuch a faintiſh ſickneſs, and her hand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſo violently, that for ſome minutes ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to unclaſp the picture. At laſt ſhe did ſo; and with a feeling of mingled delight and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perceived that it was a copy of her own.</p>
                  <p>The pure and animated pleaſure with which this diſcovery inſpired the gentle boſom of Louiſa, is not to be deſcribed. She now indulged, without reſtraint, the enchanting conviction, that ſhe was beloved; and the ſoothing hope of being one day at liberty to avow to the deſerving object of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, thoſe ſentiments which at preſent ſhe ſo carefully concealed. She grudged every moment till the picture ſhould be in the poſſeſſion of Lord Haſtings; yet knew not how to convey it to him, without incurring ſuſpicion of having herſelf been the bearer. Conſciouſneſs made her cowardly; and in her eagerneſs to contrive the means of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her purpoſe and avoiding ſuſpicion, ſhe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the one leaſt liable to it.—At length it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her thoughts.—"O!" whiſpered ſhe, as ſhe wrapt up the picture, <q>may this lifeleſs image

                  </p>
                  <p>Recollecting that there could be no danger of any ecclairciſſement between Lord Haſtings and Mr. Valois, ſhe incloſed the letter and picture in a blank cover; and ringing for her maid, deſired her to give the parcel to Lord Haſtings's ſervant, and to bid him acquaint his maſter, that it came from Mr. Valois, who was gone out of town.—The maid returned, and informed her, that ſhe had obeyed her orders; and at the ſame time preſented her with the following letter from Lady Charlotte, which, being in perfect uniſon with the preſent cheerful tone of her mind, tended not a little to heighten the charms of her animated countenance.</p>

I verily believe the word love will be expunged from the Engliſh vocabulary, and pride, vanity, and intereſt placed in its ſtead. You know I hate to be pitied; but how can you withhold your pity, when you behold your poor friend, rivalled, at once in genius, love, fortune, and fame? I do not wiſh to kill you with ſurpriſe; but whatever is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I muſt inform you, that Miſs Nelſon, the young—the gay—the beautiful—the ALL FOR LOVE! is married to the old—the gouty—the peeviſh—the good-for-nothing Lord Weſtdale. She has wedded wealth and grandeur:—May ſhe taſte all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they are calculated to beſtow!—Is not this wiſh, Louiſa, like a REASONABLE WOMAN?</p>
                        <p>But I muſt tell you all in due order. I went to dine to-day at—A buſtle on the ſtreet drew me to the window: I threw up the faſh; but, Heavens! what was my aſtoniſhment, my mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when I beheld my quondam lover, Lord Weſtdale, ſetting out with his bride, with all the charming apparatus of marriage ſinery—carriages—liveries—favours! My heart died within me, and my pangs were increaſed by the bitter reflection, that all this happineſs might have been my own. In the midſt of my affliction, however, I have derived ſome conſolation from the prudent ſuggeſtions of good aunt Gertrude. She is of opinion, that there is ſtill room for hope, ſince he has already buried three wives; and kindly adds, that if I am fortunate enough to be ſucceſſor to the preſent incumbent, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſee him out, and remain miſtreſs of the field.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall be with you in a few days, that I may be able to judge of the effects of Bath. I doubt not it has produced a total revolution in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024442_0119_0FC738CE38918588"/>
and fitted you for living in that world where you are ſo well qualified to ſhine. May your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation become every day more complete; may I ſee you ſpend the whole morning at your toilette, the whole evening at cards, the whole night in dancing, and the whole day in ſleep.—Nay, not contented with ſeeing you become exemplary in faſhion, and eminent in folly, may I live to hear you tranſmitting your precepts and improvements to poſterity; and inſtructing your favourite grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter in the manner following:</p>
                        <p>You aſk me, my dear child, the name and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of that pretty boy with a bow and quiver, whom you ſee in the arras?—You muſt know, that long, long ago, this roguiſh archer was a mighty favourite, eſpecially among the little miſſes. But, in proceſs of time, their wiſe parents began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that he taught them a thouſand miſchievous tricks, by means of theſe very arrows; which they uſed to ſteal from him, and ſhoot at the poor harmleſs boys, who were minding not one earthly thing but their book and exerciſes. To ſay truth, I believe he had no ill intention; but being forbid the houſe, whenever he ventured to reviſit his old companions, they were obliged to conceal him with the utmoſt care. Unluckily, ſome of them, who had been expreſsly ordered to diſmiſs him (and you know good children always do as they are bid) were diſcovered harbouring him in a ſecret corner, where they thought no one could ſee him.—Upon which it was agreed by their papas and mammas, to bring a great tall fellow, called Intereſt, to chace him out of the world.—The poor boy, in terror for his life, fled with the utmoſt precipitation, till he was met by Poverty,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024442_0120_0FC738CFB75DB4C0"/>
who took him along with her into her hovel: His innocent prattle uſed to ſweeten her toil, and he aſſiſted her in her labour, in reward for the ſhelter ſhe afforded him. It is greatly doubted whether he ſtill exiſts; and as he has not been ſeen in the world theſe many years, if he does live, it muſt certainly be in ſome remote corner, with this poor ragged companion.—'Indeed, Grandmamma,' ſays Louiſa the third, with tears in her eyes, I am very ſorrow for poor little Maſter Cupid; and if I knew where to find him, I would feed him with my own victuals, and carry him in my boſom like my doll.—'No, no, my good child,' anſwers grandy, your doll is a much more harmleſs toy; beſides, you'll ſoon grow up, and become a fine lady, and get acquainted with Intereſt, who, to ſay truth, ſince he has been univerſally received into genteel company, is grown a very handſome and agreeable fellow.</p>
                        <p>Now, my dear Louiſa, to complete the ſum of my pious wiſhes, may both your inſtructions and example have their full effect in the world; and, for the good of others, I pray Heaven that your children, and grand-children, and lateſt poſterity, may in all things exactly reſemble <hi>yourſelf.</hi>

moſt tender ſolicitude.—"How," demanded Lady Granville, "has Miſs Seymour been indiſpoſed?" "Indeed, Madam," replied Lord Haſtings, "tho' Miſs Seymour is always averſe to give pain, I am confident ſhe muſt have ſuffered by the violence of her fall this morning." He then proceeded to give his mother an account of it; but was interrupted by Louiſa, who, ſeeing Lady Granville look anxious and uneaſy, roſe, and taking hold of her hand, "I am quite aſhamed," ſaid ſhe, "that Lord Haſtings ſhould make this ſo ſerious an affair: I aſſure you, my dear Madam, I do not feel the ſlighteſt uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—I am perfectly well."—"I confeſs I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to credit Miſs Seymour, Madam," ſaid Mrs. Stanhope, turning to Lady Granville, "for in ſpite of his Lordſhip's apprehenſions, I really think I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw her look ſo well in my life." A conſcious bluſh overſpread the fine features of Louiſa, which tended not a little to render all the company of Mrs. Stanhope's opinion.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, the ſubject of the pictures was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and occaſioned, in the hearts both of Lord Haſtings and Miſs Seymour, a variety of the ſweeteſt emotions. The former could not reſiſt the pleaſure of talking on it: "I know no art," ſaid he, "which furniſhes the mind with ſo many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ideas as painting."—"I ſhould certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of writing, my Lord," ſaid Mr. Stanhope.—"Writing, indeed," replied his Lordſhip, "pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with an image of the ſoul, as painting does of the perſon of our friend: But the former is not always open for our inſpection; beſides, a letter is liable to a thouſand accidents, and may never reach the perſon for whom it is deſigned;—a picture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies us at all times, and in all places;—a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024442_0122_0FC738D9881507E0"/>
does not always accord with our ſentiments—we can make a picture ſpeak the very language of our wiſhes."—"I have heard ſo many encomiums beſtowed on thoſe of Miſs Seymour and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip," ſaid Mr. Stanhope, "that I confeſs I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very deſirous of ſeeing them."—"You muſt apply to me for that favour," ſaid Lady Granville, "for I value them too highly ever to truſt them out of my poſſeſſion."—She gave him the pictures: On looking at Miſs Seymour's, "Your Ladyſhip ſurely cannot be ſo unconſcionable," ſaid he, "as to keep poſſeſſion both of this copy and the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing original?"—"Indeed, Mr. Stanhope," ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "I ſhall find very great difficulty in parting with either; but as a time will probably arrive when I muſt reſign my right in Miſs Seymour, I am reſolved at leaſt to retain her image in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion."—"That image, Madam," rejoined he, "is ſo dear to her friends, that I am perſuaded you will not refuſe them a ſhare in your pleaſure, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to have copies taken of this admirable picture.—You know Miſs Seymour," continued he, addreſſing himſelf to Louiſa, "it is long ſince you allowed my claim to the title of friend: I flatter myſelf you will not be ſo unkind as to diſpute it on this occaſion."—"Indeed, Sir," anſwered ſhe, with unaffected ſweetneſs and modeſty, "my friends and I think very differently, I believe, on this ſubject; and, to prevent any diſpute about the matter, I muſt beg Lady Granville, from whoſe partiality to the original the picture derives its chief merit, to take it again into her poſſeſſion:" So ſaying, ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the picture to Lady Granville, with a look and manner which convinced her, that ſhe wiſhed the ſubject to be dropped. Lady Granville accordingly put the pictures into her pocket.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:024442_0123_0FC738DB26304E60"/>
Lord Haſtings felt all the pleaſure of a ſucceſsful rival on this occaſion. To be poſſeſſed, even though by ſtealth, of that picture which Miſs Seymour had refuſed to Mr. Stanhope, gave him a joy ſo ſincere, that it brightened his countenance, and enlivened his converſation during the whole evening.—Mr. Stanhope, on the contrary, appeared abſent, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and uneaſy. The coldneſs of Louiſa's manner to Lord Haſtings, on their coming to Bath, had removed from his mind all fear of his being a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured rival; but he could not help remarking the mutual complacency they now ſhewed for each other, and his jealouſy and apprehenſion gave weight to a thouſand circumſtances, which, to an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſpectator, would have appeared as nothing. He had long ſought in vain for an opportunity of ſpeaking to Miſs Seymour alone; and hearing that the day was fixed for her leaving Bath, he reſolved to be relieved from the torment of ſuſpenſe, and to convey to her, by means of a letter, thoſe ſentiments which he found it impoſſible any longer to conceal.</p>
                  <p>Afraid of this letter being delivered to her before company, he contrived to convey it to her himſelf, when coming out of the rooms; yet not ſo private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as not to be obſerved by Lord Haſtings, whoſe watchful eyes were continually fixed on Louiſa, and who inſtantly perceived the agitation produced in her mind by this circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Seymour had indeed begun to ſuſpect, that Mr. Stanhope's ſentiments for her were of a nature ſtill more tender than friendſhip; and was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely his friend, that ſhe was greatly afflicted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the thought of giving him pain. She therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by conſtantly avoiding any private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024442_0124_0FC738DD36BAC9B8"/>
with him, to ſhew him the improbability of ſucceeding in his ſuit; to prevent his urging it, and, if poſſible, to ſave him the mortification of a refuſal.</p>
                  <p>This generous conduct, however, had not the deſired effect. The following letter at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her ſuſpicions, and ſhewed her the ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her meaſures:</p>

                        <p>With judgment and penetration like your's, I cannot ſuppoſe that you are ignorant of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have long taken poſſeſſion of my heart: With ſuch conſtant opportunities of diſcovering the excellence of your's, how could I remain inſenſible to your merit?—Conſcious, however, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of cheriſhing thoſe hopes it inſpired, I have long ſtruggled to conceal a paſſion, which was painful to me, only becauſe I feared it would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to you. A certain coldneſs and reſtraint, but too viſible of late in your manner, leaves me no room to doubt either of your knowledge or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the moſt reſpectful, ſincere, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, though, I fear, unfortunate attachment.</p>
                        <p>Think not, dear Miſs Seymour, that hope has dictated this confeſſion—Ah! no; it is fear—it is apprehenſion alone, which has forced it from me: It is the dread of loſing your eſteem, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling me to a meaſure that may, perhaps, for ever forfeit it. I hardly know what I write—Oh! Miſs Seymour, pity the diſtraction of my mind; ſay, you forgive my preſumption: If poſſible, allow me

to hope, from time, aſſiduity, and, above all, the exalted generoſity of your heart, that it will one day reply to the ſentiments of mine. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do this, teach me to abandon the only hope which could make life deſirable!—Ah!

I fear, you never can reſtore my loſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; yet do not, I beſeech you, by your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling indifference, add the bitterneſs of felt contempt to the anguiſh of diſappointment.</p>
                        <p>I will not offend you with my complaints—on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do not baniſh me from your ſight—do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of my only conſolation, that of juſtifying to myſelf the indulgence of a paſſion I cannot conquer, by daily beholding new proofs of thoſe virtues which firſt inſpired it.</p>

                  <p>Louiſa's diſtreſs, on peruſing this letter, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; nor was it leſſened on being told next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by Lady Granville, that ſhe had juſt been to wait on Mrs. Stanhope, to requeſt ſhe and her ſon would accompany them to Caſtle-Haſtings, and ſpend a few weeks there.—She was perplexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, with reſpect to the conduct ſhe ought to hold; and, with a degree of injuſtice, of which love often makes us guilty, felt reſentment againſt Mr. Stanhope, on account of the uneaſineſs ſhe then ſuffered, from a paſſion which too well ſhe knew to excuſe in herſelf; and which merited compaſſion in proportion to its hopeleſſneſs; and actually diſliked him, on account of that preference, for which her reaſon told her, both eſteem and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were due.</p>

                     <pb n="127" facs="unknown:024442_0126_0FC738E578E012E8"/>
Though no occaſion of ſpeaking to Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in private, occurred before leaving Bath, it was eaſy for Mr. Stanhope to diſcover how unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the contents of his letter had been to her: But though, from her ſtudiouſneſs to avoid him, he was convinced of her indifference, and even apprehenſive of her diſlike, he could not reſiſt the deſire he felt to accompany her; the pleaſure of beholding her, and the hope with which he flattered himſelf that the ardour and conſtancy of his attachment would at length make a favourable impreſſion, on a mind ſo generous, and a heart ſo ſuſceptible, as that of Miſs Seymour.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, the too families ſet off for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and, after making ſeveral agreeable excurſions in their way, arrived there in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The firſt employment in which Louiſa engaged, was that of writing to Adelaide; accuſtomed to ſhare with her every thought of her ſoul, ſhe felt as if guilty of treaſonable concealment, till ſhe ſhould diſcover to that faithful friend, the various ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which her's was agitated.</p>

                        <p>IT is with inexpreſſible ſatisfaction I learn, that the friend of my ſoul has in ſome meaſure regained the tranquillity of her's. This, more than any other circumſtance, will contribute to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of your health. Oh! may Heaven perfect it, and ſpare you for the friend, the guide, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortreſs of your Louiſa!</p>
                        <p>Truſt me, Adelaide, I almoſt envy you the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you ſo feelingly deſcribe, and which, I fear, I have loſt for ever! I cannot be ſo unjuſt to your tender and generous friendſhip, as to hide from you the anxieties that prey upon my heart.—Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ſon of my benefactreſs—the noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, accompliſhed Haſtings, has, I fear, made too deep an impreſſion there!</p>
                        <p>I will not conceal from you, that I believe I am beloved; but ſmall is the conſolation that thought ſhould afford me! Birth, fortune, every thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids my aſpiring wiſhes;—gratitude alone ought for ever to repreſs them. But my Adelaide will pity me; ſhe knows that all theſe obſtacles ſeem nothing to love.</p>

In the midſt of a thouſand tormenting inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, your friendſhip is a never-failing ſource of pleaſure and conſolation. When fatigued with company, or ſick of my own reflections, I retire to a ſweet apartment in the garden, which is elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted up, and adorned with one ornament more valuable than all the reſt—it is your picture, Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide, with which a thouſand, thouſand tender ideas are connected: This little idol hallows the place in my imagination, and I regard it as the temple of friendſhip—I look up to it with a mournful attention—I gaze on it till it almoſt ſeems animated—I try to make it ſpeak the language of my wiſhes, and your heart! It is ſilent—I unfold your letters, and there find a faithful tranſcript of both.</p>
                        <p>Write to me conſtantly, my revered friend; Remind me of what I owe to Lady Granville—to Lord Haſtings—to myſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Your letters will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire me with reſolution to perform my duty, which I too plainly ſee, but, alas! am unable to follow.</p>

                        <p>Help me to rail, Louiſa! I am out of all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.—This morning I got up earlier than uſual; I diſpatched all my domeſtications; and ordered the coach the moment breakfaſt was over, that I might fly to my beloved friend, and ſpend the whole day with her. Armed at all points,—ready alike for flirting with Haſtings, philoſophiſing with his father, or moraliſing with you, I was juſt in the very act of ſtepping into the coach, when that of Mr. Alderman Sagely, and a whole ſquad of his city
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024442_0130_0FC735BDC51302E0"/>
ſons and daughters, arrived, not for a flying viſit of a how-do-ye, as they inſtantly told me, but for a "kind neighbourly viſit of a week."—Inſupportable! Had you ſeen my countenance at that moment, Louiſa, it would have given the lie to my education, which, though confeſſedly that of a faſhionable woman, has not taught me to become a diſingenuous one. Principle, however, got the better for once of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is ſurely immoral, Louiſa, to make a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature ſuffer any ſpecies of uneaſineſs that you can prevent.</p>
                        <p>I ought to do juſtice to my own patience and meekneſs, by attempting a deſcription of this city invaſion,—but the thing is impoſſible!—I really do not think there ever was collected together in one family ſuch a miſcellaneous ſet of diſagreeables. I ſhall find as much difficulty to arrange them on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as in my drawing-room.</p>
                        <p>The Alderman, though firſt in courſe, yet laſt in command, having no character at all, we ſhall ſet aſide. His wife aſpires to that of a fine lady, which ſhe miſtakes for that of an invalid; and talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſpleen, nerves, vapours, green tea, and aſſa-foetida.—His daughters aſpire to be wits, and become maimed regiſters of low witticiſms, dull jeſts, ſtale puns, and murdered ſenſe. His ſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires with better reaſon to be a jockey; and deſcants, for aught I know, very learnedly, on the betts at Newmarket, the victories of the turf, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a cheſnut filly, whom he would not exchange for the Trojan horſe of heroic memory, nay, nor for Pegaſus himſelf. But however ill-founded the pretenſions of ſome of the family, in one thing they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024442_0131_0FC735BF4199A330"/>
all ſucceed, that of rendering themſelves ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous.—After tea, I diſpatched the young fry on a fiſhing party: ſeated the Alderman in my father's ſtudy (who was fortunately out of the ſcrape being gone to Lord Aſhbury) with "the four laſt acts of parliament" for his companion; and was preparing to enjoy all that was left me, the freſh air, and the delightful evening, when Madam arreſted me with—"La! Lady Charlotte! ſure your La'ſhip would not be ſo raſh as to walk in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den after ſunſet? I remember, laſt May—no, it was June,—no, no, I am right again, it was May,—when Mr. Sagely carried me out to ſee our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Sir Joſiah Olive's improvements, at his ſweet little box at Newington Butts—"But as it might not improve your patience, Louiſa, to hear a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the beauties of Newington Butts, and an enumeration of all the evils attending this ill-fated walk, I ſhall paſs them over in ſilence, as Mrs. Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did not do.</p>
                        <p>Can you figure a reſtraint more irkſome and intolerable, than that of being obliged to wear an air of ſadneſs for half a day, when all the while you feel the ſtrongeſt propenſity to laughter?—Who can help it, when one ſees a woman, with the appearance of health, imagine herſelf afflicted with every diſtemper under Heaven? Sure I am, I may now be qualified to preſcribe for all of them; for, not contented with tiring me to death with the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of her complaints, I really believe there is not an alterative, an anodyne, or a cathartic, in the whole materia medica, with whoſe various qualities, operations, and effects, I have not been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.—This querulous humour is the very bane of ſociety. What ſatisfaction, can this poor
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024442_0132_0FC735C0B7B76998"/>
wretch poſſeſs, whilſt groaning under a load of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, ſtill worſe than real diſtreſs?—Yes, Heaven is ever juſt; and has ſurely compenſated for her imaginary evils, by making complaint an exquiſite gratification to her.</p>
                        <p>I went yeſterday to viſit your poor Sally in her new habitation, which is very comfortable. She prayed for bleſſings on us both, and thanked me with her tears. She ſays, ſhe is in tolerable health, but ſeems very weak and low; and wears that look of quiet uncomplaining ſorrow, that makes its way to the heart, without aſking leave of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The diſtreſs of thoſe in higher ſtation meets with general ſympathy:—But who ſhall pity the obſcurely miſerable, eſpecially when they become ſo by their own miſconduct?—Ah, my friend! does this circumſtance leſſen their claim to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?—does it not greatly enhance it?</p>
                        <p>Adieu! Since I cannot hope to get to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for ſome days, have pity on me, and render them leſs irkſome by your preſence. If I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſe you pleaſure nor inſtruction from my preſent aſſociates, I can at leaſt aſſure you of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance, pertneſs, and officious politeneſs from them, and a moſt grateful and cordial reception from your</p>

                        <p>A new cauſe of perplexity and diſtreſs, my Adelaide, engages me at preſent to write to you. Were I not aſſured that no ſtate of mind is ſo irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024442_0133_0FC735C96EA74C60"/>
as that of liſtleſs indifference, too often the companion of a convent, I would not ſo ſoon make freſh demands on the patience and ſympathy of my friend.</p>
                        <p>I have long ſuſpected that the attentive kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr. Stanhope proceeded from a ſentiment ſtill more tender than that of friendſhip. Fear ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me but too quick-ſighted on this occaſion. Before leaving Bath, he wrote to me, making a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of a paſſion, which does me honour, but never can be productive of any thing but diſtreſs to us both.—I ſtrove to ſpare him the mortification attending an unſucceſsful ſuit, by ſhunning every opportunity of ſeeing him alone; but on meeting me this morning in the garden, I was obliged to hear him on the painful ſubject. What anſwer I made to his earneſt ſolicitation, I know not; but being greatly agitated, and dreading to pain a mind of ſuch ſenſibility and delicacy as his, I fear I have not been ſufficiently explicit: I reſolve, therefore, to write to Mr. Stanhope, and convince him, that the only way to ſecure both my peace and his own, is to renounce a purſuit which can never be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>His preſence here, I plainly diſcover, gives pain to a heart in whoſe every uneaſineſs mine too tenderly ſympathiſes. O, Adelaide! what can I do to ſoften that pain? I am ſhocked at my own injuſtice and inconſiſtency. I pity in Haſtings, what I diſapprove of in Stanhope; I condemn in him, what I indulge myſelf; and urge him, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its hopeleſſneſs, to abandon a paſſion, whilſt I, in oppoſition to honour, gratitude, nay hope itſelf, cheriſh it in my inmoſt ſoul. Oh, my

                        <p>The cheerful and healthful ſerenity, which I had juſt begun to recover, is already clouded with care, anxiety, and ſolicitude. What a mixed and ever-ſhifting ſcene is this of human life! What a variety of vain and reſtleſs inquietudes ſum up the term of our tranſient exiſtence here!—Ah! could I, like you, keep my thoughts fixed on Heaven, how trivial would appear all the ſorrows of earth!</p>

                        <p>At length the die is caſt, and my misfortunes are without remedy. Lady Granville, my dear ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mother, from a motive which I am at no loſs to divine, and the generoſity of which claims my utmoſt gratitude, has communicated to me in the ſtricteſt confidence, a plan of Lord Granville's, which has long been a favourite one,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

My heart is ſo ſick, and my thoughts in ſuch confuſion, that I cannot pretend at preſent to give you the particulars of this converſation. I do not even know whether Lord Haſtings is acquainted with his father's deſigns—whether he approves of them. Ah, my Adelaide! can he indeed approve of them? But let me no longer deceive myſelf with fallacious hopes; too long have they deceived me. In what a delirium have my ſenſes been loſt! It is time to return to reaſon and duty. Oh, my friend! I dare not promiſe that I will ceaſe to love Lord Haſtings; but ſurely I muſt, I ought to make the attempt. Happy Lady Charlotte! what wonder that your ſpirits are unbroken? A little time will baniſh Louiſa from the thoughts of your deſtined huſband, and he will return to you and his duty—What then will become of your wretched friend, Adelaide? Tho' the difference of our religion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids my aſſuming the veil, there is no difference in our ſentiments: Our hearts have long been united, and misfortune will rivet the ties of friendſhip!—I will come to you, my Adelaide!

                        <p>I am certainly right, my friend. Through the thin diſguiſes of a heart that abhors deceit, and is unaccuſtomed to practiſe it, Lady Granville, the humane Lady Granville, has diſcovered my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and took the ſtep I mentioned in my laſt to prevent the fatal effects of their indulgence.

thouſand little circumſtances have occurred lately to perſuade me that it muſt be ſo; and that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her gentle heart pities my weakneſs, her duty and intereſt combine with her reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it. Of this truth the following incident will ſerve to convince you.</p>
                        <p>One day, when walking with my benefactreſs in the garden, the converſation happened to turn on poetry.—You know Lady Granville had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to loſe, in early life, a daughter, who, though no more than ſix years, was every thing her ſond parents could deſire. Among her other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, ſhe ſhewed a remarkable genius for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, which her indulgent mother encouraged, as it was a ſource of much amuſement to her during the frequent confinement occaſioned by a delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;—the uſual concomitant of exalted genius. Striving to recollect a few ſtanzas written by her daughter during her laſt illneſs: and being unable diſtinctly to repeat them, ſhe gave me her keys, and told me, I would find them in one of the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of her cabinet. The firſt I opened contained the picture of Lord Haſtings. I was inſtantly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a deſire to obtain a copy of it, that I ſlipt it into my pocket; and next morning, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of purchaſing ſome things at—, a town about ſix miles from the Caſtle, I ordered the horſes to be put to the carriage; and driving directly to my milliner's aſked if ſhe knew whether there was any painter of eminence in the town? She directed me to one who was ſaid to have ſame merit; I left the carriage and wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the milliner's, who promiſed to have it conveyed in ſafety to me. There is ſomething inexpreſſibly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to an honeſt and ingenuous mind, in the little arts and ſubterfuges neceſſary in the management of all clandeſtine affairs. The mean evaſions to which they lead, wound our delicacy, and do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all our feelings. In vain, my friend, would we chicane with conſcience on theſe occaſions. Her deciſions are clear, and this is her language: "In whatever words you expreſs your meaning, if they convey not to others that ſenſe in which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them yourſelf, you are a deceiver, and ſpeak not the truth from your heart."</p>
                        <p>I was queſtioned on my return by my unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting friend, about the buſineſs on which I had gone; and having neglected to purchaſe any thing at the milliner's, felt myſelf confuſed and embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by her queſtion, in ſuch a degree, as obliged me to ſhift the diſcourſe; and, by my awkward manner of doing ſo, probably called Lady Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's attention to a circumſtance, which would have otherwiſe paſſed unheeded.</p>
                        <p>A few days after I had reſtored the picture to its place, which, in order to obtain Lady Granville's keys, again forced me to have recourſe to an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I deteſted, we received a viſit from a lady in the neighbourhood; one of thoſe good ſort of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiping people, who think it incumbent on them to talk, whatever be the ſubject.—"I hear, Madam," ſaid ſhe, "Lord Haſtings is juſt going abroad; and ſincerely congratulate your Ladyſhip on having obtained ſo fine a picture of your ſon, which will certainly be mighty agreeable to you when he is at a diſtance."—"I do think myſelf fortunate on that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024442_0139_0FC735D8C53BE7A0"/>
account," anſwered Lady Granville; but pray, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, may I aſk how came you to know of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance?"—"O," replied Mrs. Rawlinſon, with a ſhrug and a ſignificant look, "I ſaw it laſt week; but I ſuſpect there is a ſecret in the caſe, and that it is intended for a miſtreſs rather than a mother,"—"How ſo, Madam?" demanded Lady Granville.—"Why, becauſe, on my opening the drawer which contains the unfiniſhed pictures, to ſee what additions were making to his collection, Mr.—entered the room, and ſeemed in great vexation, on perceiving me hold your ſon's in my hand; telling me, that nobody was permitted to examine any of the pictures, except ſuch as were placed in the glazed box, for the inſpection of the public. But truſt me, Madam, if you wiſh this affair to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, I will be the very laſt perſon in the world to divulge it. Nobody deteſts the idea of betraying a ſecret more than I do."—"Indeed, Madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Lady Granville gravely, and fixing her pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating eyes on my face (the firſt time I ever thought them unpleaſing) "if there is any ſecret in the caſe, I am entirely ignorant of it."</p>
                        <p>The perturbation I ſuffered during this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is not to be deſcribed—Unable to ſupport the preſence of Lady Granville, I roſe and left the room. I ſaw, with anguiſh, that ſhe entertained ſuſpicions, which every attempt to remove would only ſerve to corroborate, and involve me in freſh perplexity and liſtreſs. I reſolved, therefore, to take no notice of what had paſſed, and rather to hazard the diſpleaſure of Lady Granville, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the ſtraight path of ſincerity.</p>

The day following, ſhe ſent for me into her dreſſing-room.—I entered it with the horror of a ſelf-condemned criminal.—Oh, Adelaide! what muſt be the anguiſh of guilty remorſe, when an error like mine could awaken ſuch painful conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?—Lady Granville took hold of my hand, and, with a look of earneſt ſolicitude and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "My dear child," ſaid ſhe, "your's is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul—I am going to give you a proof that I know how to admire, how to value your merit—Would it were mine to reward it!" She then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me the earneſt wiſhes of Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville to accompliſh an union between his ſon and Lady Charlotte; enumerated the various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that combined to make this union proper and deſirable for both families; and concluded with ſaying, "To you, my Louiſa, I confide the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt of my ſon's honour and happineſs: Strive, my generous Louiſa, during his abſence, to impreſs Lady Charlotte with a favourable opinion of his character; as I ſhall, to give him a juſt idea of her's."</p>
                        <p>Ah, Adelaide! is not this too much to demand from me?—Is it not enough to be forced to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don hope?—Muſt I be driven to abſolute deſpair?—Yes, Haſtings! I will ſtrive, in obedience to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid duty, to baniſh thee from my heart; but never will I be ſo diſingenuous as to recommend thee to that of a rival.</p>
                        <p>Stanhope continues to ſolicit my friendſhip—my pity—ſince he can no longer hope to convert it into a more tender ſentiment. Heaven knows, I both pity and eſteem, but never, never can love him.</p>

Is it criminal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore thee?—My offence then will end but with my life!—The walls of a convent may conceal our ſorrows from the world, but it will not baniſh them from our thoughts; its ſolitude and ſilence are but too favourable to their indulgence.</p>
                        <p>This day, my Louiſa—this memorable day—was the laſt of my earthly happineſs!—It was that on which Grammont informed me of his ſucceſs, and added to all my pleaſing hopes, that of his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy return.—Alas! how ſoon were they blaſted for ever!</p>
                        <p>Yet think not, Louiſa, that I always indulge theſe melancholy reflections.—No; I do not, in bewailing the loſs of my deareſt bleſſing, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully overlook thoſe which ſtill remain. I even at times look back on paſt pleaſures with more real
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024442_0142_0FC735E5436579F0"/>
ſatisfaction than half the world experience in the enjoyment of thoſe that are preſent. There is a conſcious dignity as well as tenderneſs in virtuous ſorrow;—and far rather would I recall to mind the virtues of Grammont, and weep for his loſs, than have lived to witneſs either the frailties or faults of a character ſo loved and revered: And who can hope, in this mortal ſtate, to be entirely exempted from either?—Though he ſhall never return to me, I ſhall ſoon go to him; and then what will all the ſorrows, ſufferings, and vexing inquietudes of this life appear, but as the confuſed ſhadows of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled dream, from which we awake to real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial felicity!</p>
                        <p>Let reflections like theſe carry peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to the gentle boſom of my friend; and let us not dwell on evils that are paſt, and which never would have been preſent, had not ſome important purpoſe rendered them neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Do not regret intereſting me in your ſorrows, Louiſa. A dead calm is the worſt ſtate of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind. Some agitation is neceſſary to maintain its proper temperament; and it is beſt when this is the effect, rather of the ſocial than the ſelfiſh principle. The one is like the breath of Heaven on the peaceful lake, whoſe gentle motion purifies and clears;—the other reſembles a vortex in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled pool, which abſorbs every thing of worth, and ſends its feculencies to the ſurface.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, that "tears of mingled admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gratitude interrupt your peruſal of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters." How ſoothing, how flattering is ſuch praiſe?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024442_0143_0FC735E64289A0B0"/>
How preferable to the applauſe of a giddy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious world? The applauſe of that world is too often obtained by the mere diſplay of thoſe talents, in the poſſeſſion of which there can be no merit; it lies ſolely, my friend, in the juſt application of them.</p>
                        <p>Adieu, my Louiſa—I pity, I ſympathiſe in your ſorrows; would I could relieve them!—You have my prayers, my wiſhes, my conſtant tender affection.

                  <p>The modeſt and engaging manners of Mr. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope conciliated the eſteem of all with whom he converſed. Even Lord Haſtings, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him in the light of a rival, with that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind which ſuppreſſes the malevolent, and conquers the ſelfiſh paſſions, joined on all occaſions in doing juſtice to his merit.—With reſpect to Louiſa's ſentiments of this gentleman, he was ſtill in painful ſuſpenſe. She often ſpoke of him in high terms; but ſhe ſpoke of him without any marks of that heſitating caution, which betrays that tenderneſs it is meant to conceal. She profeſſed herſelf his friend with ſuch unaffected eaſe, that Lord Haſtings flattered himſelf ſhe would never become his wife.</p>
                  <p>In ſpite of every attempt to conceal the diſtreſs and perturbation of her mind, the dejection of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa became every day more apparent. It did not eſcape Lord Haſtings; who, ignorant of the real cauſe, and judging of her's by his own feelings,

ſometimes ventured to hope, that regret for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching departure had a ſhare in her uneaſineſs. The ſingular ingenuity and nobleneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to Mr. Stanhope, did not tend to leſſen a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was inſpired by her merit, and whoſe chief object was her happineſs.

                  <p>Matters were in this train, when Lady Charlotte joined the agreeable party at Caſtle Haſtings.—The frequent viſits ſhe made there, had furniſhed her with opportunities of becoming pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſentiments of all parties. Her charming ſpirits were a cordial, of which they ſtood in great need.—She plainly perceived the paſſion of Lord Haſtings for Miſs Seymour; and though ſhe had once hoped to have become the object of it herſelf, ſhe was too generous now to harbour ſuch a wiſh, ſince ſhe was convinced, that any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for her, on the part of Lord Haſtings, would be deſtructive of the peace of her amiable young friend. She remarked the uncommon dejection of Louiſa, which ſhe attributed ſolely to the proſpect of being divided from the object of her ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment; being entirely ignorant of Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's views, and the converſation that had paſſed on that ſubject between Lady Granville and Miſs Seymour. She poſſeſſed too much goodneſs of heart, as well as delicacy, to rally her friend on ſo tender a point; and generouſly ſtrove to divert her thoughts from it, by ſuch lively ſallies and amuſing conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as ſhe ſuppoſed moſt likely to produce that effect.</p>

Lady Charlotte?" interrupted Louiſa, ſmiling—"Have you then ſo bad an opinion of my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as to think I am ſtill ignorant of my cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm?"—"I know not what your principles may be," returned ſhe, "but your practice is intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: All my good inſtructions go for nothing—Bath itſelf has been thrown away upon you; and you continue obſtinately attached to prejudices and opinions that will for ever prevent you from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a figure in the world."—"For pity's ſake," ſaid Miſs Seymour, "do not abandon me in ſuch deplorable circumſtances! Perhaps my reformation is not quite ſo hopeleſs as you ſuppoſe."—"There is only one chance remains for you," rejoined Lady Charlotte: "My father returns to town about

Chriſtmas; if you will conſent to accompany us, the air of London may yet do much."—Louiſa ſhook her head, but made no reply.</p>
                  <p>The poſſibility of Miſs Seymour ſpending the winter in London, where her beauty could not fail to attract a crowd of admirers, had never once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the thoughts of Lord Haſtings.

                  <p>Without perceiving his uneaſineſs, Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte thus proceeded:—"Don't you think, my Lord, there is ſome little chance, that a trip to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don might ſtill make away with theſe ſtrange anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated notions of Miſs Seymour's?"—"Perhaps, Madam," anſwered he gravely, "London might alter many of Miſs Seymour's preſent opinions; but I doubt much whether thoſe ſhe would receive there in return, would prove either agreeable or advantageous. There is more hazard, Lady Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, than you are aware of, in the manners of the great world. Too often, in clearing away the ruſt, it robs the precious metal of its intrinſic worth, and mixes with it the baſeſt alloy."—"I ſee, Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa" ſaid Lady Charlotte, "I ſhall receive very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aid from Lord Haſtings: I am therefore reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſtruct you properly in your duty myſelf—Nay, don't look ſo ſerious; I won't tire you with a "tedious homily." The whole duty of woman is comprehended in much fewer pages than "the whole duty of man."

                  <p>Lady Charlotte aroſe, and taking hold of Louiſa's hand—"Now, my good child," ſaid ſhe, "let us go and con over this firſt leſſon in the garden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and when I ſee it has made a due impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I will then inſtruct you in the hundred and fifty articles of a fine lady's religion."</p>
                  <p>"Whilſt they were walking in the garden, a ſervant from the Marquis informed Lady Charlotte of the arrival of ſome company, that made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

for her to return home immediately. Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour never parted from Lady Charlotte without regret till now. But the gaiety of her ſpirits was at preſent ſo diſcordant with the penſive tone of Louiſa's mind, that ſhe longed to be left at liberty to indulge her melancholy reflections without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption.—She daily diſcovered, however, new charms in the character of Lady Charlotte; and having once been ſomewhat prejudiced againſt her, on account of her ſuppoſed inſenſibility, ſhe was now diſpoſed to make atonement for her injuſtice, by giving her credit for perfections to which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality ſhe had no claim.</p>
                  <p>That evening, the weather being extremely hot, Louiſa left the company, which were numerous, and retired into the garden for the benefit of freſh air.—The door of the pavilion being open, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and throwing herſelf down on a ſopha, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to revolve in her mind all the circumſtances of the laſt affecting interview ſhe had there, with Lady Granville and Lord Haſtings.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stanhope, whoſe eyes were attentive to every movement of her's, having obſerved her change co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and preſently after leave the room, felt the moſt reſtleſs uneaſineſs on her account. Happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt his eyes towards the window which overlooked the garden, he ſaw her enter the pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and felt a ſudden irreſiſtible inclination to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her.—He did ſo: On approaching her, ſhe ſtarted from her reverie, and looked diſſatisfied on account of its being interrupted. "Pardon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, with emotion; "I would not for the world offend you; but ſeeing you quit the drawing-room, and fearing, from your

paleneſs, that ſome ſudden indiſpoſition was the cauſe, I could not be eaſy till I knew you was ſo."—"I am indebted to you, Sir," anſwered ſhe, with a deep ſigh, "for taking ſuch a ſhare in my uneaſineſs; it will ſoon be removed."—"Ah, Miſs Seymour!" continued he, "would it were in my power to remove it! but I greatly fear I only add to your diſtreſs. Permit me, amiable Louiſa, to enquire, whether it is my preſence, the preſence of an unhappy, or the abſence of a more fortunate lover, that occaſions your conſtant dejection? Be aſſured, if I am the wretched cauſe of your diſtreſs, I will tear myſelf from you, and every thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with happineſs.—Your peace is dearer to me than life, which I would cheerfully ſacrifice to promote it."</p>
                  <p>The ſoftened heart of Louiſa was unequal to this trial. Repeated ſighs burſt from her agitated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; her tears flowed in abundance; and ſhe did not even attempt to interrupt Mr. Stanhope.—"If I am loſt to happineſs myſelf," continued he, "tell me, deareſt Miſs Seymour," (taking hold of her hand) "is there any way left by which I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your's? Fortune, perhaps, oppoſes your wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I well remember his uncommon agitation, on ſeeing you attend Adelaide's admiſſion."—"Oh! aſk me nothing more," interrupted Louiſa, haſtily withdrawing her hand, and riſing from her ſeat, "you already know too much. But leave me, Sir, I conjure you, and bury all that has paſſed in your own boſom."</p>
                  <p>Mr Stanhope withdraw; and Louiſa turning down a path that led into a fine field, continued her
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024442_0150_0FC736012980C568"/>
walk, till ſhe reached a bench ſhaded with a large cheſnut tree, on which ſhe ſat down, and gave way to the ſorrows that oppreſſed her heart.</p>
                  <p>A few minutes after Miſs Seymour quitted the drawing-room, Lord Haſtings, on retiring to the window for air, ſaw Mr. Stanhope enter the pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. He was inſtantly ſeized with a fit of jealouſy; and ſupporting that it was the ſcene of an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, could not reſiſt the deſire, which that envious paſſion inſpired, of at leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting their happineſs, ſince he could not prevent their meeting. As he approached the pavilion, his heart throbbed ſo violently, that he was obliged to ſtop to recover himſelf. The windows being all thrown open, and ſhaded with honeyſuckle, gave him an opportunity of witneſſing this affecting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, without being obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The tears of Louiſa wrung his heart; and, utterly at a loſs of gueſs the cauſe which excited them, he drew nearer the window, at the very inſtant Mr. Stanhope pronounced this ſentence,—"If I am loſt to happineſs myſelf," &amp;c. In a moment the whole truth ſeemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>laſh on his mind; the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes in Louiſa's manner, her continual melancholy, her rejection of Mr. Stanhope's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, all convinced the unhappy Haſtings, that there was a favoured rival in the heart of Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, whoſe abſence occaſioned her diſtreſs, and whom it would be equally vain and diſhonourable to endeavour to ſupplant.</p>
                  <p>To meet with coldneſs and indifference from a heart which has inſpired us with the moſt tender ſentiments, is afflicting in the higheſt degree: But

what can equal the anguiſh of knowing that the heart we ardently covet is actually in poſſeſſion of another?</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings ſtood ſtill, till Miſs Seymour and Mr. Stanhope were both out of ſight; and then, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the pavilion, threw himſelf on the ſopha ſhe had juſt quitted. He reviewed the happy hours he had ſpent with her during Lady Granville's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inement, when he almoſt believed he was beloved; and execrated that raſh curioſity, which had for ever robbed him of the ſweet deluſion.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, after having recourſe to the ſoothing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Adelaide, ſome of which ſhe always carried in her pocket, and which, by their pious and ſolemn reflections, never failed to calm the diſturbed ſoul of her friend, being now tolerably compoſed, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to return to the drawing-room.</p>
                  <p>Unable to bear the reſtraint of company, and wholly engroſſed by his own reflections, Lord Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings took the ſame road Miſs Seymour had quitted, and wandered down the field.</p>
                  <p>As he approached the bench, his attention was rouſed, by ſeeing a paper lying on the ground. He picked it up; it was without ſeal or ſuperſcription; but as he had no doubt of its having been dropt by Miſs Seymour, he reſolved to reſtore it unopened. At that inſtant, recollecting the delight he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced on a former occaſion, from the peruſal of what ſhe had written, and ſuppoſing this might contain ſuch another tranſcript of her heart, he could not deny himſelf the ſatisfaction of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at this criſis what were its inmoſt thoughts.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024442_0152_0FC73603CDA466B0"/>
—Perhaps it is ſafer, on ſome occaſions, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſlight offence with one's eyes open, than by ſeeking for reaſons to excuſe the commiſſion of it, to endanger our mental ſight, and blind our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the miſt of falſe argument.—He opened the letter, which proved to be that from Grammont to Adelaide; which Louiſa, in the agitation of her mind immediately after reading it, had forgotten to reſtore. He ſaw that it was not the hand of a female.—What was his amazement, when he read theſe words? "At length, moſt beloved of women, your fond lover, your faithful friend, taſtes of real tranſport, by being able to convey it to you," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed the letter, a deep ſigh burſt from his boſom:—"There is then no hope under Heaven remaining for me!" cried he, in a tone of deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrow. Then after a pauſe—"Yes; that of ſeeing Louiſa happy. Fortune ſeems to oppoſe the union of two hearts formed for each other;—would I too oppoſe it? Is not the happineſs of Louiſa dearer to me than life? Thank Heaven! though I am wretched myſelf, it may ſtill be in my power to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her happy; and to reſtore peace to the boſom of the gentleſt, moſt amiable of human kind."——Full of theſe ſentiments, ſo worthy of himſelf, he ſought for an opportunity of converſing with Miſs Seymour in private, which ſhe as ſtudiouſly avoided.</p>
                  <p>The evening before his departure, obſerving her walking alone in the garden, he followed her; and on her entering the pavilion, ſtopped to reflect in what manner he ought to addreſs her. She appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loſt in thought; a heavy ſigh betrayed the deep diſtreſs which occaſioned it; and after remaining ſome time in a reverie, which Lord Haſtings was
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024442_0153_0FC736079E4D6A70"/>
unwilling to interrupt, ſhe aroſe, and retiring to the oppoſite window, from whence ſhe could ſee any perſon that entered the garden, ſhe drew out of her boſom his picture, which hung from her neck by a ſmall ſtring of pearls. The agitation of Lord Haſtings on this occaſion was extreme: What would it have been, could he have diſcovered that it was his own features ſhe was then contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting!—After looking on it for ſome time in ſilence, ſhe kiſſed and bathed it with her tears: Then, in a low and mournful tone,—"Yes," ſaid ſhe, "for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and duty oppoſe our happineſs:—Abſence may blot my image from thy heart; but no power on earth can rob me of the dear delight of loving thee tenderly,—loving thee only,—loving thee for ever!"</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings could ſupport this ſcene no longer. He came round to the door of the pavilion; at ſight of him Louiſa ſtarted back with ſurpriſe, and in great confuſion, haſtily returning the picture into her boſom, prepared to retire.—Taking hold of her hand, he led her gently back to the ſopha, and ſeating himſelf by her,—"O Louiſa!" ſaid he, "why do you avoid me? What have I done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur your hatred."—"My hatred, my Lord!" ſaid ſhe,—and again was ſilent.—"Yes, Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it is too plain you hate, you fly me!—I am not conſcious of having merited your diſpleaſure, but you cannot be unjuſt. Ah, Louiſa!" continued he, fixing his mournful eyes on her's, which were ſtreaming with tears, "where are all thoſe happy moments fled that we once enjoyed together, when I cheriſhed for you ſentiments that I dared not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that I muſt for ever hold ſacred; that I once—O forgive me!—thought you beheld without

contempt. But I deceived myſelf, and am now puniſhed for my preſumption."—Louiſa was now forced to have recourſe to her ſalts; he perceived the agony of her mind, and haſtened to put an end to the converſation.</p>
                  <p>"I am no ſtranger, Miſs Seymour," continued he, "to the cauſe of my misfortune. Permit me, ere I go, to beſtow on you the means of happineſs, which are now uſeleſs in my hands:—Think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the abſent Haſtings, who will never ceaſe to think of you; and who, though he cannot be the ſharer of your heart, muſt for ever be the friend of your virtues.—Deign to accept of this trinket; and let it remind you of a man who prefers your felicity to his own."</p>
                  <p>During this ſpeech, great part of which ſhe could not then comprehend, Louiſa was in a ſtate to be conceived, not deſcribed. The trinket with which Lord Haſtings preſented her, was a locket incloſing his hair, enamelled with the initials of his name, and richly ſet with brilliants. She received it with a look of acknowledgment; and at length found compoſure ſufficient to add, in a tone of inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tenderneſs,—"Be aſſured, my Lord, I have no need of this remembrancer. I ſhall never forget you; and wherever you go, my prayers and beſt wiſhes ſhall attend you."—She roſe;—"I have only one other requeſt to make, Miſs Seymour," ſaid he; "it is, that you will take charge of this packet till after Iam gone; you may then break the ſeal, and diſpoſe of the contents as directed."</p>
                  <p>He retired, leaving Miſs Seymour diſtracted with the variety, as well as violence of her emotions.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024442_0155_0FC7360F7A166C20"/>
She repeated every word he had uttered a thouſand times; and every time found herſelf leſs able to unravel their meaning. The packet too furniſhed her with many conjectures; but ſhe reſolved to obey his injunctions with the ſtricteſt fidelity.</p>
                  <p>She returned to her apartment with ſo violent a head-ach, and in ſuch agitation of ſpirits, that it was late before ſhe joined the company; but though ſhe wiſhed above all things to avoid a formal part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Lord Haſtings, ſhe dreaded the ſuſpicion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe might incur by appearing to ſhun it.</p>
                  <p>After a dull and ſilent ſupper, ſhe roſe to retire. "Miſs Seymour," ſaid Lord Granville, "do you remember, Haſtings ſets out to-morrow, won't you wiſh him a good journey?"—"I do, with all my heart, my Lord," anſwered ſhe. Lord Haſtings ſaluted her; and following her to the door, he ſeized her trembling hand, which he preſſed to his boſom—"O, Louiſa!" ſaid he, "may Heaven's beſt bleſſings ſurround you, and may you be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy, whatever become of the ill-fated Haſtings."</p>
                  <p>Louiſa retired to bed, but not to ſleep. Of all the paſſions which warred in her boſom, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed ſleep from her eyes, curioſity was the moſt violent, as well as painful. She aroſe by day-break; and the moment ſhe heard the carriage of Lord Haſtings drive from the door, ſhe broke the ſeal, with a trembling hand and beating heart. How great was her aſtoniſhment when ſhe read theſe words!—</p>

                  <p>It is difficult to ſay, whether admiration, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſorrow, or love, at this moment predominated in the agitated ſoul of Louiſa; but though they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately ſtrove for dominion there, they at laſt yielded to that melancholy regret, that exquiſite ſympathy in the affliction of Lord Haſtings, which excited the moſt ardent, though unavailing, wiſhes to relieve it.</p>

                  <p>Though it is painful to lie under unmerited cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there is a pride attending conſcious virtue, which makes her diſdain to ſolicit a hearing, in order to vindicate a conduct which ſhe is ſenſible merits praiſe.—Miſs Seymour either ſaw, or

thought ſhe ſaw, an alteration in Lady Granville's manner towards her, ever ſince the unlucky affair of the picture: This gave her extreme pain; but pride and modeſty both oppoſed at that time a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her weakneſs. Unaccuſtomed to reſtraint or concealment, it grew every day more painful to her; and ſhe reſolved, as ſoon as Lord Haſtings ſhould leave the Caſtle, to communicate all that had paſſed between them to his mother.</p>
                  <p>On going into Lady Granville's dreſſing-room, ſhe found her ſpirits extremely depreſſed on account of her ſon's departure. She mingled her tears with her's, and ſuggeſted every thing moſt likely to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her ſpirits. "If I cannot conſole your heart, my dear Madam," ſaid ſhe, "for the abſence of your ſon, let me at leaſt prove myſelf worthy the name of daughter, with which you honour me, by laying open mine to your view.—I am perſuaded you are not ignorant of the ſentiments he has long entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me; but however flattering to me, in juſtice to you and to myſelf, I wiſh to convince you, that I have never given encouragement to them."</p>
                  <p>She then ſuccinctly related all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and Lord Haſtings at their laſt interview; and taking out the packet, and at the ſame time preſenting her with her anſwer to the letter from Lord Haſtings,—"Read this, Madam," ſaid ſhe, "and inſtruct me, if you wiſh me to make any alterations in it."</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville peruſed the letters with viſible emotion. Then riſing and throwing her arms round Louiſa's neck, which ſhe bathed with tears of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led admiration and tenderneſs,—"No, my amiable,

                  <p>Lord Haſtings wrote to his mother almoſt every poſt; but though he never omitted enquiring after Miſs Seymour's health, he carefully avoided men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning her in any other terms than thoſe dictated by politeneſs.</p>
                  <p>As he did not entertain a doubt concerning the object of her tenderneſs, he was not a little aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to learn, on his arrival at Paris, that the Count de Rochelle had been married for ſeveral months. This at once accounted to him for Louiſa's melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and inſpired a fond hope, that it yet might be in his power, by a tender, conſtant, aſſiduous paſſion, to remove it. He knew too well the bitter anguiſh of diſappointment, not to feel moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſorrow for Miſs Seymour, on account of this ſuppoſed misfortune—of all others, ſurely the moſt inſupportable—that of the cruelty and perfidy of a perſon in whom we have repoſed unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and from whom we have expected all our felicity.</p>
                  <p>Some weeks after Lord Haſtings arrived at Paris, Louiſa received the following letter from Adelaide, in anſwer to the introductory one, of which he was the bearer:—</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To Miſs Seymour.</head>
                        <p>I wonder not, my friend, that you wiſhed me to ſee and converſe with Lord Haſtings; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024442_0160_0FC7361CFB7102B0"/>
to do either without pleaſure and admiration. He has paid me ſeveral viſits, each of which has ſerved to confirm my opinion of his noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous character.—He ſpoke but little of my Louiſa; when he did, it was the language of unfeigned praiſe. He aſked a thouſand queſtions about Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle; every one of which betrayed the intereſt his heart took in the ſubject; but inſtructed by your letter, I purpoſely avoided it: This he ſaw, and I doubt not his ſuſpicions were confirmed by it. The Count de Rochelle was married ſome time ago to Madamoiſelle St. Hermoine; and I plainly perceive, is ſuſpected by Lord Haſtings of having acted diſhonourably by you. I told him I had the higheſt opinion of Rochelle; at which he ſeemed much aſtoniſhed: But I preſently changed the ſubject, as I wiſhed not to come to an ecclairciſſement on that head.—He quits Paris to-morrow, and promiſes to viſit me on his return from Italy, where he propoſes to ſpend the winter.</p>
                        <p>I ſtill write to my friend from the Ville de St. Croix, the ſcene of my earlieſt, happieſt days: But though this ſcene has proved favourable to my health, I fear, Louiſa, it is not ſo to my peace!</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe to you that variety of painfully pleaſing emotions I experience, whilſt wandering alone amidſt theſe delightful ſhades—once the habitation of love, and hope, and joy—now the aſylum of grief, inquietude, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent melancholy! Not a tree, not a ſhrub ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears around me, that is not hallowed by memory, as having witneſſed the tenderneſs of love, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of friendſhip, or the fervor of devotion.—However whimſical ſuch a ſentiment may appear

                        <p>On entering a little arbour to-day, in a retired part of the wood, to which Grammont knew I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſorted, I beheld the initials of my name, cut on the ſmooth bark of a beech, by that hand which is now mouldering in the duſt.—To you, Louiſa, I need not deſcribe the feelings of that moment!—O, Grammont! if they are known to thee—if thou art an inviſible witneſs of my ſecret, my hopeleſs, my unceaſing ſorrows—behold them with pity, and compaſſionate the weakneſs thou canſt not approve!</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, he thought a period might arrive, when, divided from the partner of his heart, theſe proofs of his conſtant affection might ſerve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken in her's the remembrance of a paſſion which neither time nor abſence could in the ſlighteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree impair.—How unneceſſary ſuch a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer! Shall that day ever awaken me to life and conſciouſneſs, that ſhall not alſo witneſs the admiration of thy virtues, the love of thy goodneſs, the grateful recollection of thy unequalled tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cheriſhed in my afflicted heart?—No, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont! beſt and deareſt of men—till that heart, like thine, ſhall for ever be congealed by the cold hand of death, thy loved image ſhall never be eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it!—Meantime, the ſoothing recollections of the paſt, ſhall maintain a ſweet, though ſilent intercourſe between us—till that ſolemn welcome

                        <p>It is this proſpect, my Louiſa, that becalms the griefs, and ſupports the ſoul of your friend. Much, much does ſhe need every ſupport.</p>

                        <p>Amidſt a people learned in the arts of ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ardent in the purſuit of pleaſure, how much will it behove you to maintain that manly firmneſs of character, for which I have ſo often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded you.—I apprehend no danger to you from the groſsly vicious, or openly profane: Such inſpire a mind like your's, with horror and diſguſt. But I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024442_0163_0FC736275597FFF8"/>
confeſs, my ſon, I am not without fear, from the inſidious arts of the reaſoning ſceptic, and ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic libertine. The ridicule thrown on every thing ſerious, by the polite circles of our ſex, is ſeverely mortifying to the delicate ſenſibility of youth, and highly diſcouraging to virtuous conduct. And the cruel refinements of a miſtaken philoſophy, have of late years given double weight to opinions, over which paſſion and appetite had ever too powerful an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.—The ſole preſervative of popular morality, is religion. Whenever the vulgar are taught to ſcorn her reſtraints, they ſoon deſpiſe thoſe of virtue. Vice ruſhes in like an impetuous torrent, which has overwhelmed its bounds, and carried all before it.—The dim-ſighted multitude are unable to perceive the nice diſcriminations between real and apparent intereſt. Religion held forth a faithful glaſs, to aid their imperfect ſenſe: Infidelity daſhes this to earth, and in its ſtead, preſents the rabble with a deluſive mirror, which magnifies contiguous objects, and ſhews them in alluring colours, whilſt it imbibes the rays which would delineate the back ground.</p>
                        <p>You know I have always been of opinion, that piety is the only ſure foundation of moral conduct.—What ingenuous motive can affect that mind, which is regardleſs of its obligations to infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence?—Sophiſts may argue and refine as they will, but there can be no genuine virtue, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of true piety.</p>
                        <p>We daily ſee proofs of the inefficacy of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative opinions, to regulate the actions of men. The underſtanding often aſſents to truths which never reach the heart. A feeling and habitual ſenſe of Deity—a love of thoſe divine precepts—a belief of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024442_0164_0FC73629B80D9048"/>
thoſe ſublime doctrines—a hope of thoſe eternal rewards he hath revealed, will be found abſolutely neceſſary to counterbalance the ſuddenneſs of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the force of example, and the conſtant ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations to criminal indulgence.</p>
                        <p>One conſideration will have much weight with a mind poſſeſſed of ſenſibility like your's: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of your example may extend much farther than you are aware of. To a generous ſoul, how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling, how elevating is the thought, that by a truly amiable and virtuous conduct, we may induce the wicked and unhappy to quit the paths of vice and deſtruction, and purſue thoſe that are pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace; not only in their termination, but in their tenor alſo.—A corrupt ſociety is to the world, what a corrupt member is to a ſociety. The whole ſeems in a great meaſure dependent, even on its ſmalleſt parts. What ſolid value ſhould this idea give us in our own eſtimation; and how cautious ought we to be, leſt our errors prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of evil, where our goodneſs may never reach.</p>
                        <p>Should you continue, my dear Henry, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the practice of virtue and goodneſs, my utmoſt ambition in this world will be gratified; and the heart of a father, to whom you are unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dear, will triumph in the conſcious pride and joy of paternal affection.</p>

Haſtings on all occaſions, convinced her that he had made no very tender impreſſion on her heart. In cheriſhing the ſecret ſentiments of her own, ſhe was ſenſible ſhe did no injuſtice to her friend; and though honour and gratitude determined her never to deviate from the line of conduct ſhe had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo nobly purſued, a ſweet hope would often ſteal into her boſom, that a time might come when her duty and happineſs would no longer be incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with each other.</p>
                  <p>In the converſation of her revered friend, Lady Granville, and the peaceful and rational pleaſures of the country, for which ſhe had an exquiſite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Louiſa once more began to taſte that ſweet and equal ſerenity, which ſeemed better ſuited to her temper, than more animated, but often leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere pleaſures.</p>

                        <p>Though ſhe bore her ſufferings with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and reſolution, the moment ſhe heard the child cry, ſhe burſt into a violent flood of tears, which greatly agitated her weak frame. She aſked to ſee it as ſoon as it was dreſſed; on its being brought, ſhe took it in her arms, gazed on it, kiſſed and bathed it with her tears; then taking a little locket from her own neck, containing its father's hair, ſhe tied it round that of the infant, ſaying, "Unfortunate innocent!—Alas! this, and the name of Sally, is all I have to bequeath thee!—Thou muſt not preſume to claim that of thy unkind father!</p>
                        <p>This exertion was too much for her feeble bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and exhauſted ſpirits: She was ſeized with faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which threatened to put an inſtant period to her life.

                        <p>On hearing her talking to herſelf in a low voice, I ſlipped ſoftly to the bed-ſide: Her eyes were ſhut, but I heard her diſtinctly pronounce the

following ſentences: "Cruel deceiver!—faithleſs Talbot! why did you leave me?—Did I not give you my whole heart?—I never did any thing to offend you, but loving you too fondly. If Heaven forgives my offences, oh, Talbot! you might have pardoned this!—Shall theſe eyes never again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee?—Unkind Talbot! wilt thou never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, never return? But I ſhall ſoon be at peace."—Then hearing her infant cry—"Pitying God!" ſhe exclaimed, "defend this helpleſs, deſolate babe! It is guiltleſs of its mother's crime!—Oh, Talbot! hadſt thou heard this voice, unkind as thou art, thou couldſt not have left me?—Yet, do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; it would grieve thee to ſee my grave—I would die rather than grieve thee!—I ſhall ſoon go to Heaven—Ah, Talbot! could I but hope to meet thee there!</p>
                        <p>She fell into a ſlumber for a few minutes. I ſat down by her bed-ſide.—Oh, my Louiſa! who could behold unmoved ſuch a ſcene of woe?</p>
                        <p>Again ſtarting up, and haſtily drawing back the curtain, ſhe exclaimed, looking wildly round her, "Where, oh! where is he?—Did I not ſee him here?—Gone again!

                        <p>Forgive, dear and honoured Madam, forgive the boldneſs of your unhappy Sally, who preſumes once more to addreſs you—it will be the laſt time.</p>
                        <p>My hour of trial faſt approaches; and, in ſpite of all your goodneſs and compaſſion to me, I am perſuaded, it will put a period to my ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate life.—My heart is broken with unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All are humane and compaſſionate to me; but that one from whom I deſerve the moſt, will ſhew me no pity!</p>
                        <p>My dear Miſs Seymour, though you are all goodneſs, I know you dare not come to me. I have none to comfort and encourage me, at the time I ſhall moſt need comfort: Even a living child, that gives joy to the heart of a mother, will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the bitter anguiſh of mine!—No father waits to receive my helpleſs babe, and bleſs her who bore it!—If I live, I have no example to propoſe for its imitation;—if I die, I have no portion to bequeath it but poverty—no inheritance but ſhame!</p>
                        <p>Though I have forgotten your leſſons of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, O my dear, kind miſtreſs! do not abandon my

deſolate child, if that merciful Being who beholds the penitence of its mother, permits it to ſee the light!—Oh! do not ſuffer the infant of your once favoured Sally, to become an object of public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity—perhaps, of public ſcorn: It may then learn to wander from the path of innocence, like its wretched mother!—Alas! ſhe had not that excuſe for wandering!</p>
                        <p>I can write no more.—Do not accuſe any one of my death; nor reproach any one with unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me. My own credulity has undone me—the fondneſs of my weak heart betrayed and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me!</p>
                        <p>Farewel, my loved, revered miſtreſs! You muſt be happy, becauſe you are virtuous.—O! may Heaven's beſt bleſſings ever ſurround my dear Miſs Seymour; and may that ſweet peace be her's, which will never again in this world viſit</p>

                  <p>This letter, and the melancholy and unexpected fate of the unfortunate Sally, pierced the ſoul of Louiſa with the moſt exquiſite ſorrow. But though her ſenſibility was extreme, it never unfitted her for the diſcharge of any active or ſocial duty. By the care of the beſt of mothers, ſhe had early learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſs thoſe feelings, whoſe over-indulgence would have been ruinous to her own peace, and injurious to ſociety, by depriving them of thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024442_0171_0FC73641778ADF40"/>
good offices which are the offspring of genuine and well-regulated ſympathy.</p>
                  <p>She ſet out immediately for the Marquis of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter's; from whence the two ladies walked to the nurſe's houſe. At the ſight of the little infant, Miſs Seymour was greatly affected; nor would ſhe be denied the mournful pleaſure of beholding for the laſt time the aſſociate of her earlieſt years. On uncovering the corpſe, and ſeeing the pale and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, but placid countenance of her youthful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſhe claſped her hands together in an agony of grief, and turning to Lady Charlotte, who ſtood by her ſide in ſilent ſorrow—"Behold, my friend," ſaid ſhe, "the fatal effects of cruel and headſtrong paſſion! Behold the ſad remains of youth, beauty, ſweetneſs, innocence! Almighty God! ſhall the creatures of thy power, the monuments of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the daily ſharers of thy bounty, for the ſake of indulging a criminal impulſe, thus inhumanly, thus deliberately deſtroy each other?—Is it poſſible, is it really poſſible," ſhe continued, "that ſhe whom, but a few months ago, I beheld ſo blooming, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and innocent, whoſe graceful form, endearing modeſty, and ineffable ſweetneſs, excited my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is now a pale, breathleſs, cold, inſenſible corpſe?"—Then ſtooping down and kiſſing her lifeleſs cheek,—"Farewel! farewel for ever!" ſaid ſhe, "dear, unfortunate, but too credulous Sally: May thy virtues live in my faithful heart, and may thy errors for ever be buried in thy grave."</p>
                  <p>Having appointed a hired carriage to meet them at the nurſe's houſe, they bid her adieu; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carefully wrapt up their infant-charge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Caſtle Haſtings: in the neighbourhood
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024442_0172_0FC73644B3411FD0"/>
of which lived a woman, who having juſt loſt a child whom ſhe ſuckled, was glad to have its place ſupplied by a foſter.</p>
                  <p>Having diſmiſſed the chaiſe, Lady Charlotte walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlowly towards the Caſtle, to avoid obſervation, whilſt Miſs Seymour conveyed the little baby in her arms to the cottage.</p>
                  <p>The averſion ſhe felt for every ſpecies of dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, joined to her deſire of concealing the weakneſs of Sally for ever from the world, induced her to be very ſilent on the ſubject of the child. She told the good woman, however, that though the child had few friends to care for it, ſhe ſhould have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing provided for it, and be amply rewarded for the proper diſcharge of her duty.</p>
                  <p>Though this melancholy affair made a deep and laſting impreſſion on the heart of Louiſa, her humane attention to this poor babe ſerved both to ſooth her ſorrow, and fill up that joyleſs void which the abſence of Lord Haſtings occaſioned in her mind.—Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obliged her to reſtrict the number of her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to the cottage; but as it ſtood at a very ſmall diſtance from the Caſtle, ſhe frequently directed her walks that way, without hazard of incurring ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>In one of her ſolitary rambles, which ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a conſiderable length, her thoughts being occupied with thoſe tender reflections which wrap the penſive mind in a ſweet delirium, recollecting that ſhe was within a few paces of the field in which ſtood the nurſe's cottage, ſhe directed her ſteps that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024442_0173_0FC736458C523878"/>
way, in order to viſit her little charge whom ſhe had not ſeen for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>She was met at the door by the good woman, who expreſſed the utmoſt ſatisfaction on ſeeing her:—"I was juſt agoing, Madam," ſaid ſhe, "to fetch little Sally to viſit your La'ſhip to day at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that you might ſee what a charming little pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet it grows, and how ſmart and tidy ſhe looks in the new cap your La'ſhip gave her."—"I am very happy, nurſe," anſwered Louiſa, "that you are likely to have ſuch credit by your foſter; but you muſt never bring her to the Caſtle, as I will often call here to ſee her, and always take care that you ſhall want for nothing."</p>
                  <p>As ſhe was careſſing this beautiful child with much fondneſs, a ſigh eſcaped her, on recollection of his birth and unfortunate circumſtances.—"I hope, Madam," ſaid the ſimple cottager, "your La'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip does not ſee any cauſe to find fault with my care of the child? I am ſure ſhe ſucks all night long, and gets as much victuals as ſhe can eat, and my huſband never has a raſher, without giving her a bit of it; for he loves my little puppet, and our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con is pure good, an' pleaſe your La'ſhip, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bit makes the child hearty."—"Indeed, good nurſe," replied Louiſa, whith a complacent ſmile, "I am quite ſatisfied that you do your duty to the ſweet babe; but I ſigh to think what a cruel father ſhe has."—"Lack-a-day, Ma'am," replied nurſe, "there be too many ſuch fathers in the world; but, mayhap, if your La'ſhip would ſend and tell him what a fine child he has here, he might return again."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:024442_0174_0FC73646F7D57118"/>
Miſs Seymour, on looking at her watch, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was very late; ſhe therefore repeated her injunctions to nurſe never to bring Sally near the Caſtle; and bidding her a good-morning, returned home.</p>
                  <p>She found there the Marquis and his daughter, whoſe company became dearer to her every day: It was with real concern, therefore, ſhe learned, that buſineſs of importance required that the Marquis ſhould immediately ſet off for London. The two ladies took leave of each other, with ſincere expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tender regret, on account of this unexpected ſeparation; and with mutual promiſes of beguiling the length of winter, which was already begun, by a conſtant epiſtolary intercourſe.</p>

                        <p>I am perſuaded, my loved Adelaide, that it is not from agitation of mind, but vacancy of heart, our foreſt ſufferings ariſe.

Whilſt the preſence of Lord Haſtings kept my mind in continual fear and agitation, though my ſpirits were ſometimes depreſſed, they were never ſo perfectly overwhelmed as ſince theſe fears have loſt their object.</p>
                        <p>My preſent dejection, which I ſtruggle in vain to conceal, has not eſcaped the obſervation of the humane Lady Granville. She is apprehenſive on account of my health, though too delicate to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe apprehenſions, and, under pretence of improving her own, has propoſed that we ſhall ſpend Chriſtmas with Lord Saliſbury, and make a round of viſits before returning to the Caſtle.—I am grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for her kind intentions, but fear I ſhall not profit by them!—My mind of late ſeems ſunk into a kind of lethargic inſenſibility, from which no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, however vigorous, can rouſe it. Though innumerable ſources of enjoyment are in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, I can enjoy nothing: The very aſpect of nature is changed to me; the ſun has loſt its cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and the freſh air no longer revives me. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with friends, kind and attentive, I ſeem at times to myſelf the moſt deſolate being on the face of the earth. The diſingenuity and ingratitude of this rebellious ſpirit, adds remorſe to the weight of my affliction!—What can I do, my Adelaide?—O! pity, conſole, and, if poſſible, reconcile me to myſelf!</p>
                        <p>I am juſt returned from church, where I have regained that heavenly calm, and felt that ſweet elevation of ſoul which we experience, whilſt, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It is now, my dear Henry, that, laying aſide that ſtandard by which you judged of mankind, and which you found in your own uncorrupted heart, you begin to open your eyes, and to ſee them is they really are, inſtead of what you wiſhed them to be. It is with pain we firſt make this diſcovery; for the errors of the judgement are always more mortifying to our ſelf-love, than thoſe of the heart. On entering the world, the delicacy of our taſte, as well as the foundneſs of our principles, receive ſo rude a ſhock, that, for a while, we become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute miſanthropes. Time, however, and a more intimate acquaintance with ourſelves, change our ſentiments, and correct the ſeverity of our ſtrictures on others.</p>
                        <p>In reality, mankind are more deſerving of pity than contempt. Want of reflection, not malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

of intention, is their ruin. And when one conſiders how difficult it is, eſpecially in early life, to reſiſt the allurements of pleaſure, and combat the pleas of indolence, it ſeems rather ſurpriſing, that they are not always the ſlaves of vice, than that they are not always the ſlaves of vice, than that they ſhould ſometimes become the dupes of folly.</p>
                        <p>I would not have you enter the world with an unkind and indiſcriminating jealouſy of your ſpecies. But as I know, in youth, the heart generally decides before the underſtanding, and the imagination often, leads them both aſtray, I would have you cautious in forming opinions of characters, and modeſt in delivering your own; and whilſt you behave with affability to all, reſerve your confidence for thoſe, of whom long acquaintance hath diſcovered the ſterling merit.</p>
                        <p>One's heart ſwells with honeſt indignation, to ſee the great, the venerable, the reſpectable virtues, paſſing unheeded through the vale of obſcurity, whilſt the mean, ſelfiſh, ſervile arts of cunning and hypocriſy, engage public notice, and even advance the poſſeſſor to ſhining and elevated ſtations. Let us, my ſon, deſpiſing the vile craft of the ſycophant, whilſt we remain obſtinate in virtue, cultivate that univerſal complacency and good-will, which is the offspring of good ſenſe, principle, and humanity.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, "you are ſhocked to find every thing ſerious treated with contempt and ridicule, by thoſe who arrogate to themſelves the name of fine gentlemen; though neither their talents nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſeem to qualify them for that ſphere."—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ridicule, my dear Henry, are the laſt

I will then truſt my cauſe to be plead by Friendſhip, againſt your advocate, Modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom, in ſpite of having wronged you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, you ſtill retain in your ſervice; and, farther, you may be pleaſed to inform her, that if ſhe cites me to anſwer for partiality at the bar of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I will inſtantly appeal to Judgment, whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, Common-ſenſe, has aſſured me, that I ſhall come off with credit and reputation.</p>
                        <p>Is it not humiliating, Louiſa, to the boaſtful pride of man, to feel how much this etherial ſpirit of his is affected by mechanical cauſes?—A cold day damps his hopes, a dark one clouds his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and a week of rain drowns him in the depths of deſpondent melancholy! But no ſooner does the ſky clear, the clouds diſperſe, and the ſun ſhine,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024442_0182_0FC736624D5B8288"/>
than his hopes revive, his proſpects brighten, his dejection vaniſhes, and the aſpect of every object is changed to the eye of his enlivened imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you will alledge, that mine has directed the pencil, in the piece I have juſt been drawing. Alas! no; Experience traced the outline, and Truth finiſhed the picture.</p>

                        <p>Our conviction, my dear friend, inſenſibly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incides with our inclination. You have taught me to believe that my letters give you pleaſure: I am too happy in being able to do ſo, not to embrace every occaſion of addreſſing you. The praiſes I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on you, my dear Lady Charlotte, are from the heart;—you are ſufficiently acquainted with its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine language, to give credit to this aſſertion; and ſurely would not wiſh me either to diſguiſe or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs its dictates, when writing to you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="unknown:024442_0183_0FC736646C8B6588"/>
I cannot agree with you, "that in praiſing you, I am laviſhing encomiums on myſelf." You for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that we always incline to contemn what we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enjoy, and admire what we do not poſſeſs.—I muſt not, however, be perverſe, or attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on you by my ſophiſtry. However this may hold with reſpect to the goods of fortune, it does not apply to the gifts of nature. It is confeſſed, we are all ſufficiently diſpoſed to over-value our mental qualifications.</p>
                        <p>Do not be afraid to ſcold me, whenever you think I require ſuch diſcipline. Though you have heard me confeſs, that I would ſuffer extreme pain on being told my faults by a perſon I loved, from the dread of forfeiting their eſteem, this is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable weakneſs. What friend expects to find us perfect?—and who is ſo proper to correct, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reform us, as thoſe we love?—Let me conjure you then, my dear Lady Charlotte, to tell me can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly whenever you ſee me fall into any error, that I may prove, by my eagerneſs to amend it, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous I am of becoming all you wiſh me to be.</p>
                        <p>Nothing, I am perſuaded, is ſo fatal, either to the intereſts of love or friendſhip, as thoſe little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts which take their riſe from trifles, but which, by alarming the delicacy, and wounding the pride of affection, by being often ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We ought not to expect perfection; but in all connections of the heart we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to avoid giving pain, by diſcovering our own imperfections.</p>
                        <p>I entirely agree with my friend, in thinking the obſervance of the leſſer morals highly requiſite
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024442_0184_0FC7366AED392DD0"/>
in ſuch connections. But if a very nice attention to theſe become neceſſary, will not this occaſion reſtraint? and does not reſtraint, like a ſecret poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, impair the very vitals of friendſhip?—Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, along with that fearfulneſs of offending, which flows from goodneſs of heart, there ſhould be an equal averſion to taking offence. Indeed, if we are at pains to examine our own minds, we ſhall find, that ſecurity of meeting with indulgence, is the firſt thing that prompts to unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                        <p>We are at preſent on a viſit at Lord Saliſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's; one of the nobleſt and moſt extenſive eſtates in this country. But there is an air of ſullen and ſolitary grandeur about it, that depreſſes the ſpirits, and diſſatisfies the heart.—How unlike the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hoſpitable Caſtle of Haſtings!</p>
                        <p>The houſes of five gentlemen in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are deſolate and tenantleſs, and their eſtates ſwallowed up in that of Lord Saliſbury. This cruel depopulation deprives him and his family of the moſt eſſential bleſſing of life—an agreeable ſociety.—Ah! if to be feared, diſliked, deſerted—if to poſſeſs a palace whoſe apartments are uninhabited, a territory where one can never hope to meet "the human face divine"—if this is to be rich and great, may Heaven preſerve from wealth and grandeur</p>

                        <p>I have often thought, my dear Henry, that there is not a more ſurpriſing principle in the mind
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024442_0185_0FC7366BC07BF278"/>
of man, than that by which he is led on from day to day, in purſuit of a felicity, which, in the calm hour of reflection, he will acknowledge to be unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable whilſt on earth.—Deſpiſing the bleſſings which the preſent offers to his enjoyment, he reſts all his hopes upon the future. Yet, alas! what more can he know of the future, than that it will reſemble the paſt, which has already deceived, and grievouſly diſappointed him?</p>
                        <p>Mankind, in their eager purſuit after happineſs, overlook the means of obtaining it; for this eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leaving them no leiſure to form juſt notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of their chief good, hurries them into a thouſand wild and extravagant ſchemes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deſtructive of it. By ſuch men, happineſs is believed to conſiſt in a quick ſucceſſion of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous enjoyments, where every deſire obtains its completion, and every purſuit is crowned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                        <p>Now, it is evident, that ſuch felicity is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incompatible with our preſent ſtate of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, where plenty is the fruit of toil, health the effect of temperance, reſt the reward of labour, and pleaſure the concomitant of pain; where virtue muſt be tried by adverſity, and the character formed by frequent acts of fortitude and ſelf-denial.</p>
                        <p>But, further, mankind err, in affixing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſituations and circumſtances, the idea of a quality which reſults from the exerciſe of worthy and generous affections, and the harmony of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-regulated mind.</p>
                        <p>The ſame objects do not affect any two of the human ſpecies exactly in the ſame manner.—The
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024442_0186_0FC7366D397B9768"/>
ſerious and contemplative find their chief enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the retired walks of life, in exploring the treaſures of ſcience, and contemplating the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſublime of nature.—To the young and gay, ſociety affords variety of pleaſures; the indolent find their's in eaſe, and the active in buſineſs.—How vain is it then to affirm, that happineſs reſults from a fortunate combination of external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when we ſee, that it muſt vary with every different mode of ſituation, conſtitution, and taſte.</p>
                        <p>Let us try then, by forming juſt notions of our preſent ſtate, to determine what muſt conſtitute our greateſt happineſs: Let us conſider ourſelves as placed here, not long to ſuffer, or exquiſitely to enjoy; but by properly maintaining our allotted part, to prepare ourſelves for future enjoyment.</p>
                        <p>Objects of high gratification are rare, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be acquired; and our anguiſh, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, muſt ever be proportionable to the tranſport they have afforded us. Objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and ſatisfaction are always within reach of a benevolent heart and well-regulated mind; and when Providence demands them from us, we can reſign them, without that poignant regret which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitates the ſoul for the enjoyment of ſuch as remain.</p>
                        <p>Let us then endeavour, by habituating our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſatisfied with ſuch temperate pleaſures as are eaſily attained, and ſuited to our preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to cultivate that healthful cheerfulneſs and equality of temper which diſpoſes us to view the beſt ſide of life, which gives a zeſt to all its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent pleaſures, and which we can never know,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024442_0187_0FC73676410A5F68"/>
whilſt, reſtleſs and unſatisfied, we graſp at an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary bliſs, and forfeit ſubſtantial peace, in vainly ſtriving for exquiſite enjoyment.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, that "bad health has at times an influence, even on the gentle temper of Dr. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville." Remember, my dear Haſtings, it is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar privilege, as well as province of friendſhip, not only to bear with the little ſallies of paſſion and peeviſhneſs, to which all of human kind are liable, but, with ſuperior delicacy, to ſteal from us our vexations and inquietudes, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>May perfect confidence in the divine goodneſs, which we have ſo often experienced, and in the divine wiſdom, which we profeſs to venerate, quiet every anxious wiſh and turbulent emotion of our ſouls, and preſerve them in that ſtate of cheerful ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which philoſophy vainly laboured to introduce into the reſtleſs heart of man.</p>
                        <p>It was with much reaſon, my Louiſa, that I urged you, whilſt young, to extend the circle of your amicable connections. When any of theſe are diſſolved in afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The fate of the gentle Conſtance, is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proof of the danger of reſting all our hopes on one object, and deriving all our pleaſures from one ſource.—You know, ſome time before your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in France, ſhe loſt her amiable and only friend. Accuſtomed from childhood to a daily interchange of kind offices, and boundleſs affection, the death of Agnes not only robbed her of all her enjoyment, but even deprived her of power to enjoy. After vainly ſtruggling, in obedience to duty, to recover the vigour of her exhauſted mind, in the tumult of the world, ſhe was permitted to retire from it, and to follow her inclination, in ſtriving to moderate,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024442_0189_0FC7367939CFC248"/>
in the quiet of retirement, that deep-rooted ſorrow, which death alone could cure.</p>
                        <p>I well remember, the firſt time you ſaw the ſilent dejected mourner, you remarked, that there was ſomething in her very look and manner, which ſtrongly indicated her nearneſs to Heaven—a puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ſenſibility, an abſtraction, which convinced one ſhe would not long be a ſojourner in this vale of tears.—Accordingly, ſhe has bidden an eternal adieu to it, and, I truſt, is again aſſociated with her kindred ſpirit, in the realms of light, and truth, and love, where their ſervices ſhall know no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and their felicity no end.</p>
                        <p>The wonderful affection which united the very ſouls of theſe friends, was allowed, I fear, to exceed the bounds preſcribed by reaſon and duty. It was ſuch a copious and overflowing tide, as laid waſte, or ſwallowed up in its courſe, many of thoſe kind and leſſer benevolences due to ſociety; whoſe ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, perhaps, remained in their hearts, but whoſe ſtreams were not ſufficiently diffuſed through their lives.</p>
                        <p>The gentle Conſtance has fallen a victim to the indulgence of that exquiſite ſenſibility, ſo ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flattering to young minds, and which a thouſand circumſtances, in this region of ſorrows, are ever at hand to cheriſh. From the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of her conſtitution, on which her mind has doubtleſs had a powerful influence, her peace, her health, even her life, has been ſacrificed to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, but fatal tenderneſs. With this nervouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, it was impoſſible for her to taſte of happineſs in a world where vice is ſo prevalent, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024442_0190_0FC7367DDB8FE498"/>
misfortune ſo irremediable.—The miſeries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life were to her an inſurmountable obſtacle to the enjoyment of its bleſſings: And unleſs her friends could have borne to ſee her become leſs amiable and intereſting, they never could hope to behold her more happy.—Joined to this endearing weakneſs, Conſtance poſſeſſed a temper ſo reſerved, that many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Hence ſhe was leſs generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved than many who were her inferiors in every quality, but that unreſervedneſs which is as often the effect of a weak and intemperate mind, as of a warm and generous heart.</p>
                        <p>Such was Conſtance! So ill fitted for this world, ſo deſirous of another, ſhould thoſe who loved her, regret her early eſcape from this dark region of ſhadows? And whilſt Time, like a ſilent thief, is daily pilfering from our little hoard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſhould we, my Louiſa, wiſh to linger here, till he has robbed us of all?</p>
                        <p>It is the natural effect of grief, to unhinge the mind, and render us ſuperſtitious: Were I to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the preſent ſuggeſtions of mine, I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I was not long to ſurvive my friend.—This, my Louiſa, is a ſoothing, but a very ſelfiſh idea.

                        <p>I think I told you lately, Louiſa, that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was become epidemical here. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not only to have me married, but in love too!—Was ever any thing ſo unreaſonable?—My father dined yeſterday at the French ambaſſador's, where he was introduced to the young earl of Leiſter, who is juſt returned from the grand tour; elegant, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, handſome, rich; and, if I may credit the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, he has collected all the improvements, graces, and accompliſhments, that ever were acquired by travelling, and brought them home in a bundle, for the good of his countrymen. I hope he will have the charity to beſtow ſome of them on his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers, who, if want forms a claim, may ſurely make large demands on his bounty. Perhaps, in return, they may teach him one ſcience, of which, with all his acquirements, he may be ſtill ignorant; I mean—cookery. I have heard a member of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament deſcant more learnedly on a receipt for a paſty, than he could have done on the bill of rights; and lately ate a beef-ſteak dreſſed by a peer, which the Grand Monarque's cook needed not to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. Conſidering the ſhortneſs of human life, if a man arrive at perfection in one art, it is all that can reaſonably be expected. It would really be unconſcionable to ſuppoſe that Lord Dale muſt be both a firſt-rate cook and a pillar of the ſtate.</p>

                        <p>My father is gone to the play: I had devoted this whole evening to you; was in the very humour for addreſſing you in the ſtyle you love, ſerious, ſententious, and ſentimental; when a ſervant came to inform me, that Mr. Danvers, a gentleman my father had invited to ſupper, was in the parlour.</p>
                        <p>It was but juſt eight—ſtrangers to each other, the proſpect was diſmal.

                        <p>Friendſhip, reflection, devotion, and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſupply real enjoyment to a temperate mind; but the manners, and, far more, the vices of the world, wear off the keen edge of that delicate ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which is the general organ by which all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pleaſure is conveyed to the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>It is the misfortune of young women in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who are trained in the gay world, to have their native abhorrence of vice inſenſibly leſſened, by being familiariſed to it, and hearing many things talked of there with eaſe, which they ought never to think of, but with horror. In particular, they ſhould be left in ignorance, both of the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners of men, and the pernicious and libertine principles on which they pretend to vindicate them. To make girls acquainted with ſuch, is like placing edge-tools in the hands of a child, with which, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to uſe them, it will certainly deſtroy itſelf.</p>

Such, in my opinion, ought to be the purity of the female mind, that a virtuous woman would feel herſelf criminal, in thinking of what a vicious man will not ſcruple to act.</p>
                        <p>But, my dear Lady Charlotte, though I do not ſhare in your turbulent pleaſures, think not that I am without your loved variety. In the courſe of eight weeks, we have viſited as many neighbouring families, ſome of whom would afford ſubjects ſuited exactly to your lively pen. We are at preſent at Squire Randall's, who, to all his other practices, adds that of phyſic: He compounds an eye-water, in particular, which was never once known to fail, though its qualities are directly oppoſite to Lethe's, as it ſmarts the patient too ſeverely to let him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his care.—It grieves me to ſee ſo many careſſes and ſo much white meat, beſtowed by the good lady on a parcel of ſenſeleſs, ſorry cats. Heaven ſeems to have endowed all its creatures with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain portion of affection, which muſt be expended: Some laviſh it on deſerving, ſome on unworthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. A dog, a cat, a man, or a monkey, uſually engroſſes the hearts of our ſex;—pleaſure, intereſt, ambition, are the idols to which the other ſacrifice. Which of us makes the wiſeſt choice, I leave you to determine.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, "you can have no conception of a heaven, without the ſociety of your friends."

                        <p>I ſhare in your pleaſures, my dear Henry, whilſt wandering with a tender and reverential me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, through ſcenes for ever hallowed by the efforts of genius, valour, and virtue. To tread thoſe paths where every foot is claſſic ground, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to inſpire a mind like your's with thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime ideas, and ſolemn reflections, which are akin to thoſe exalted ſpirits we then admire; and which by freely communicating, you give pride, as well as joy, to the heart of your father.</p>
                        <p>What you tell me of the miſerable fate of Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, ſhocks me beyond meaſure. How ſhort, how ſhameful has been his career! how guilty, how dreadful its cloſe!—What a melancholy proof does he exhibit of the fatal effects of early and vicious habits.</p>
                        <p>Though paſſion is a violent and inſolent maſter, it will ſometimes relax of its ſeverity; but habit is
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024442_0196_0FC736907753AE58"/>
an obdurate and relentleſs tyrant, that holds the mind enſlaved in cruel and perpetual bondage.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the unbounded indulgence of criminal propenſities, another cauſe has contributed to the ruin of the wretched Talbot. You know his mind, naturally active and inquiring, was early poiſoned by the maxims of modern philoſophy and ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. Surely men are not aware of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they publiſh their libertine opinions to the world. They uſually claim the title of moral men; but what can be more immoral than ſuch conduct? Their metaphyſical ſubterfuges, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical arguments, are only calculated to lull the voice of conſcience, and give ſcope to every lawleſs appetite to tyranniſe with impunity. Meanwhile, the unhappy vulgar, deprived alike of ability and leiſure for reflection, and prone to indulge to the ſame exceſſes, implicitly acquieſce in the opinions, and eagerly follow the example of their ſuperiors. What ſhould we think of the man, who could ſnatch from the ſinking mariner, the plank on which his laſt hope depended?—Inhuman, far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human is he, who, in midſt of the dangers which continually ſurround us, can rob us of that hope which is the anchor of the ſoul, and plunge us in the perplexity of doubt and horror of deſpair.</p>
                        <p>The bulk of our ſpecies, my dear Henry, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves not in abſtract ſpeculation, but in concerting ſchemes of pleaſure and emolument: they affix the idea of happineſs to the poſſeſſion of certain favourite objects, and expect, with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the hour that ſhall enſure their felicity, by the completion of their wiſhes: that hour arrives; but alas! it brings only heavineſs and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <p>How different is the courſe of that man, whoſe conduct is regulated by true wiſdom—who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this life in connection with the next—who moderates his deſires, and preſerves the powers of his mind in equal balance!—His wiſhes can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diſappointed, becauſe the object of them is immutable; his ſchemes can never be fruſtrated, becauſe they are built on the foundation of truth; and time, which accelerates the deſtruction of all things mortal, ſpeeds on the hour of his ſafety, his triumph, his everlaſting joy!</p>
                        <p>We are once more returned to the Caſtle, with that ſweet ſatisfaction which home affords to thoſe who are happy in their domeſtic connections, and endowed by Heaven with the true reliſh for happineſs.</p>

                        <p>I have been in the moſt delightful hurry theſe eight days paſt, making preparations for my firſt appearance at court.

                        <p>He was received very graciouſly by the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who converſed with him for ſeveral minutes;—he then paid his compliments in the politeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to my father, who brought him round, and preſented him to me.—I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>After experiencing the warmth of June in the end of February, the cold of laſt week has been intolerably ſevere, and has occaſioned univerſal murmurs.—Thus, when the cold blaſts of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune aſſail us, we forget the days of ſunſhine we have

                        <p>Lord Granville came into the room ſome days ago, with a letter from his ſon in his hand, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of the ſhocking fate of Sally's ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Talbot, with whom Lord Haſtings had been acquainted at college.—Having involved himſelf ſo much by every ſpecies of extravagance, that he could not any longer continue in England, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed a conſiderable ſum from his young friends, on pretence of going to take poſſeſſion of an eſtate in Wales, left him by a relation; and embarking at Dover, made the beſt of his way to Paris.—As his

That even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he loſt his laſt ſtake, he went home and wrote a letter to his unhappy father, attempting to juſtify his conduct on the principles of modern infidelity. He then, with his own hand, put an end to that life, which guilt had rendered obnoxious to others, and a burden to himſelf.—Ah! my friend, what a diſmal, what a ſhocking exit.</p>
                        <p>Ye, whom the love of fame, or pride of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, conducts into the diſmal labyrinths of error, in pity to mankind, remain contented with your fancied ſuperiority, your boaſted diſcoveries. But leave them, O leave them, in happy ignorance!

                        <p>My dear Lady Charlotte, ought we to ſpeak of diſtreſs, with whoſe ſorrow neither guilt nor ſhame is mingled?—When we ſhed the tear of nature or friendſhip over thoſe we love, we feel our virtues increaſed, our ſentiments ennobled by the generous ſorrow;—but who dare mention the name of Talbot to his afflicted father, or renew his ſhame, and redouble his anguiſh, by expreſſing compaſſion?</p>

                        <p>Your obſervation is certainly juſt;—our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are always ſuperficial in their inquiries, and impetuous in their ſallies.

Hence the former often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead the mind, before the latter arrives to direct it in the right path.—Miſerable ſtate of man! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the caviller: How uſeleſs that boaſted facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!—too tardy to oppoſe our impulſes, it comes but to upbraid us for yielding to them.</p>

Such complaints, however, are as ill-founded as they are peeviſh.—Omniſcience has aſſigned us another co-adjutor in the taſk of ſelf-government—conſcience—which remonſtrates againſt every vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency, with a promptitude which equals thought in quickneſs. Let us ſubmit, then, to the tuition of this faithful inſtructor. He is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's delegate, and therefore his dictates muſt be right. Mankind may indeed wreſt his language to guilty purpoſes; but this does not diſparage him; on the contrary, it is an evidence of his integrity; for if his obvious meaning were not reprehenſive of their vices, they would hardly be at ſo much pains to miſinterpret his ſpeech.</p>
                        <p>May we, my ſon, ever liſten attentively to his gentleſt remonſtrances; and act ſuch a part now as ſhall ſecure his future approbation.—Adieu.</p>

                        <p>My Louiſa will undoubtedly be anxious to know ſomething more than common report, of a man who already intereſts the heart of her friend, and who diſtinguiſhes me by a preference equally obvious and flattering.</p>
                        <p>Lord Leiſter diſcovers, on every occaſion, a ſound judgment and a correct taſte;—a delicate ſenſe of propriety, a conſtant, not too eager deſire to oblige, ariſing from a wiſh to make others happy, rather than to be diſtinguiſhed himſelf; a refined humanity, a juſt diſcernment, and, above all, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024442_0205_0FC736A8779E4418"/>
ſo engaging and unaſſuming, as adds a luſtre to his other good qualities.—Theſe I have already had opportunity to diſcriminate; and, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, am inclined to give him credit for at leaſt a hundred more.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt we were ſitting yeſterday on one of the benches in the Park, a genteel young woman, whoſe countenance expreſſed the deepeſt ſorrow, approached, with a little child in her hand, who ſeemed extremely fatigued; but on ſeeing the bench occupied, was about to retire.—To the unfortunate, more than ordinary attention is due.—I begged her to ſit down, and Lord Leiſter, with great humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, took the ſweet little boy on his knee. Good-manners prevented me from aſking any queſtions of the afflicted lady, whoſe ſpirits ſeemed ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that it was with difficulty ſhe could reſtrain her tears. In a few minutes the child got up, and, taking hold of her hand, <q>Come, mama, ſaid he, in a cheerful tone, I am able to walk now—let us go home to poor papa.</q> She roſe to thank me; but on attempting to ſpeak, the anguiſh of her heart denied her utterance, and ſhe burſt into a flood of tears.—I begged to know the cauſe of her extreme agitation, and aſſured her I ſhould feel myſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the power either to aſſiſt or relieve her.</p>
                        <p>She told me, that ſhe was niece to Lord—;whom, by marrying an officer of family, but no fortune, ſhe had for ever diſobliged: That her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe name was Williams, having received a wound in his breaſt, which entirely ruined his health, was obliged to return to England, where he had languiſhed in all the miſery which neglect, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and diſeaſe can inflict on a noble and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024442_0206_0FC736B14E7EC508"/>
ſpirit: That ſhe had made many applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her uncle, and their other great friends, or rather relations, who had not only refuſed them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but, by inſolence and contempt, had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered all their ſufferings!</p>
                        <p>Gracious Heaven! is it not enough to make the noble mind feel the whole weight of dependence, by being forced, with ſhame, to implore that relief which ought to be voluntarily beſtowed? Muſt the breaking heart be torn with unkindneſs? Muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited contempt and reproach render the cup of grief, and the bread of miſery, ſtill more bitter?—Is it really then, in the eyes of this generation, a crime to be poor?—Surely, to revile the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, is to reproach that Being by whom the lot of every creature is diſpoſed!</p>
                        <p>We accompanied Mrs. Williams to the entry of Spring-garden, where my carriage waited. On handing me in, Lord Leiſter begged me to ſtop a few minutes, whilſt, with an attentive humanity worthy of himſelf, he carried Mrs. Williams and her ſon into the neighbouring coffee-houſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them ſome refreſhment. We then ſet them down near Golden-ſquare, where Lord Leiſter aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, he would ſoon wait on Captain Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams.</p>
                        <p>It is alledged, that proſperity renders us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the happineſs of our fellow-creatures. For my part, Louiſa, I have ever felt my concern for the welfare of others, bear a proportion to my own felicity. Nor is this wonderful: Conſcious that, for wiſe ends, Heaven hath ſo conſtituted mankind, that they cannot ſo cordially ſympathiſe in our joys
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024442_0207_0FC736B299A72380"/>
as our ſorrows, we are afraid to forfeit the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent regards of our ſpecies, by appearing to triumph in that proſperity, which places us beyond the reach of their good offices. Hence the ſtrong propenſity we feel, to aggravate the account of our diſtreſſes, and to touch lightly on thoſe peculiar marks of good fortune, by which we may be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>You once told me, that to receive obligations, gave you pain; which you attributed to the pride of your heart. Favours and obligations, my dear Louiſa, are terms unknown to real friendſhip. To beſtow a favour on a friend, is to confer happineſs on one's ſelf; and to receive an obligation, is in ſome meaſure to repay it, by ſupplying one's friend with an opportunity of taſting the moſt refined pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>But though I reſpect too highly every feeling of your heart, ever willingly to do violence to any of them, it ſurely cannot give you pain to accept of a very ſmall gift from one, who is ambitious of a very large ſhare of your eſteem; and who means not this trifle as expreſſive of her regard, but of her earneſt deſire of being ſometimes remembered by you while at a diſtance—But ſhould I indeed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>You date your laſt letter eight o'clock, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening, and maliciouſly inquire, "how I am
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024442_0208_0FC736B3C2A4B648"/>
employed at that hour?"—Fie, fie, Louiſa; was this done in the ſpirit of Chriſtian charity?—Can you have any doubt about the matter? But leſt you ſhould, I will honeſtly inform you.</p>
                        <p>Know then, that at eight o'clock on Sunday e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, I was employed—not like you, in ſaying my prayers, or reading dull ſermons, for that I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched already—not in ſupplying the want of cards, by want of compaſſion and principle, and, under pretence of harmleſs converſation, tearing to pieces the reputation of my neighbours—not very like a ſaint, nor yet like a ſinner—not quite like an angel, nor juſt like a devil; but like a being who is a compound of all the four—A WOMAN: In ſhort, I was employed in trying on a charming new cap at the glaſs, in which I was to meet Lord Leiſter next morning, to take our accuſtomed walk in the Park.</p>
                        <p>Do not think, however, I am altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectful of my duties and devotions: I have juſt been reading over the ſervice for matrimony, and conſidering the matter in a more ſerious light than I have ever done before. To love and honour, ſeem very eaſy terms in the matrimonial compact, but our ſex boggle at the fearful word <hi>obey.</hi> Now, for my part, Louiſa, I think the whole difficulty lies in the two firſt articles: Obedience is the natural effect of reſpect and affection; and if we cannot obey from love, we muſt from fear;—but how few are there among the other ſex, whom we can ſwear through life to love?</p>
                        <p>You accuſe me of indolence in not writing; and that which you condemn as a fault, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends I know not how many virtues: Patience,

mortification, and ſelf-denial.—Indeed, my dear, the continual interruptions I meet with, call forth all theſe into exerciſe, when they force me to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go one of my chief enjoyments.</p>

                        <p>I am charmed with the active benevolence of Lord Leiſter; which, in procuring a penſion for Captain Williams, will probably excite ſome of his relations to exert themſelves in behalf of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous young family: Shame often acts more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully on mankind than principle.</p>

Were I inclined to indulge that indolence of which you accuſe me, I might uſe the common plea of having nothing to ſay; for at preſent I am as much a recluſe, as if immured within the walls of a convent. But whatever arts conſcience may acquire, from reſiding with the gay and polite in town (if ever he reſides there) we cannot teach him to be ſilent, when we wiſh, here in the country. He ſtares me rudely in the face, whenever I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt forming ſuch frivolous excuſes for lazineſs; and at this moment is ſo impertinent as to remind me, that the plea of having nothing to ſay, could never be admitted on the part of a woman, unleſs when in church, or aſleep.—To ſay truth, Lady Charlotte, I and conſcience are of the ſame mind for once. It is affirmed of ſome bodies, that, by their extreme velocity, they expend their force in a ſhort time; but I have never heard that a woman's tongue was of that number—and, from my own obſervation, I ſhould incline to think, that, in this inſtance, activity and heat increaſe motion.</p>
                        <p>I ſmile, my dear friend, to think on the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner in which you and I ſpend our time: Whilſt you are arranging the oeconomy of your toilet, I am viſiting my dairy, or feeding my poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;—whilſt you are hurried in preparing for an aſſembly, I am careleſsly wandering towards nurſe's cottage;—whilſt you are liſtening with rapture to the warbling voice, or delicate concerto, I am heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the tremendous roar of the wind, through the high trees that ſurround Caſtle Haſtings;—whilſt your eyes ſparkle at the ſight of beaux, belles, and radiant luſtres, my eyes are fixed on the pale lamp of evening;—whilſt you are plunging into

the gaieties of this world, I am almoſt ſighing after the peaceful repoſe of the next.</p>
                        <p>Think not, by this compariſon, I mean to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate your merit and advance my own; neither of us can claim praiſe on account of following our inclination.

                        <p>—Well, Louiſa, all things go on ſwimmingly.—I really never ſaw ſo ſenſible and agreeable a man as Lord Leiſter: His choice is ſufficient to prove the firſt, and his eyes tell me every moment that he thinks the very ſame of me. How fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is it, Louiſa, when two ſuch people are of one mind!</p>
                        <p>The world has already determined the match, and, though without conſent of the parties, you know one muſt pay a due regard to the opinion of the world—when it happens to be one's own; tho', in affairs of this nature, it generally decides, before the parties themſelves know any thing of the matter.</p>
                        <p>For my part, Lord Leiſter ſhall have my yea and amen, to take Lady Charlotte Villiers, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for worſe, as ſoon as he pleaſes. She has long been a troubleſome and vexatious companion to me;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024442_0216_0FC736CD4B9437D8"/>
and that I have not ſooner got rid of her, has been none of my fault, as all the world can witneſs.—As I never yet could make her what I wiſhed, and have little hopes of a change from time, I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to turn all her thoughts towards a future ſtate—(N. B. I do not mean Heaven—you cannot miſtake me ſo far; neither do I at preſent think of purgatory.)—And I flatter myſelf, that, when all connection between her and I ſhall ceaſe, Lord Leiſter will find in his wife, a more agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, a more docile pupil, a more ſincere friend, and a more amiable woman, than I have hitherto found in Lady Charlotte Villiers.</p>
                        <p>Heavens, Louiſa! is it really poſſible that the gay, young, beautiful Miſs Stanley is married to Lord Anſon?—I muſt have more than newſpaper authority, before I can credit ſo monſtrous, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous an event.—Aſſuredly, Louiſa, our ſex hold it as part of their creed, that marriage is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſalvation, and that there is no place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for old maids.</p>
                        <p>That I may not be behind-hand with the world in congratulations, I ſend you a billet, fabricated in ſuch a manner as will neither do violence to my friendſhip nor ingenuity; and beg you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to her without delay.</p>
                        <p>MADAM,</p>
                        <p>On this joyful and ſingular occaſion, permit me to join the circle of your friends, in wiſhing that your happineſs may be greater than your merit, and exceed even your moſt ſanguine expectation.</p>
                        <p>I have long entertained a high opinion of your ſenſe and prudence—an opinion in which the whole
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024442_0217_0FC73295B5194EB8"/>
world will readily acquieſce, now that you have preferred your intereſt to every other conſideration. You judged rightly that you was paſt fifteen, the age of romance, and therefore love would have been ſuperfluous in your liſt of marriage articles. If there be any virtue in ſelf-denial and mortification, you have laid in a ſtock that will laſt for life; and if the conſciouſneſs of virtue be its reward, your's muſt be a rich one.—If it can add to happineſs like your's, to reign unrivalled, I will venture to preſage, that you will have no competitor for the poſſeſſion of your empire: Your lot will indeed be ſingular, for your felicity will be unenvied; nor will even the moſt covetous or malicious ſeek to deprive you of it.</p>
                        <p>I am, Madam, with all that reſpect and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem due to merit, courage, and fortitude like your's,</p>

                  <p>Whilſt Miſs Seymour was amuſing herſelf with her friend's letter in the pavilion, a ſervant haſtily entered, and informed her, that Lord Granville was ſuddenly taken ill, and his lady begged to ſee her immediately in his apartment.—Louiſa entered the room in great agitation, and was dreadfully alarmed, on ſeeing Lord Granville, pale and faint, ſupported in the arms of his afflicted wife, whoſe countenance ſufficiently expreſſed the terror and anguiſh of her mind. He had complained of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whilſt reading to her in the library, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on reaching his apartment, fainted away. After being put to bed, Lady Granville retired a
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024442_0218_0FC73296D52EAF08"/>
few minutes to give vent to thoſe tears which ſhe could no longer reſtrain, and left Louiſa ſitting by the bed-ſide. No ſooner was ſhe gone, than Lord Granville, opening the curtain, made a motion for Louiſa to approach: She did ſo; when, taking hold of her hand, which he tenderly preſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his, "My dear Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, this is no time for ceremony or diſguiſe—Lady Granville's diſtreſs overwhelms me; I cannot bear to add to her affliction, by telling her the truth. You muſt be to her a daughter;—believe me, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Louiſa, I have long loved you as ſuch.—I have ſeen the growing tenderneſs of Haſtings, and I have ſeen it with pleaſure;—you are worthy of each other. When he returns to ſolicit your hand, let him be aſſured, that his choice met with my warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt approbation."</p>
                  <p>The variety of ſtrong and conflicting paſſions which this diſcourſe awakened in the boſom of Louiſa, deprived her for ſome time of the power of utterance. She knelt by the bed, and, taking Lord Granville's hand, which ſhe kiſſed and bathed with her tears, "Live, oh live, my Lord," cried ſhe, "to witneſs and confirm that happineſs you have ſo generouſly beſtowed!"</p>
                  <p>This tender ſcene was interrupted by the entrance of Lady Granville, which left Louiſa at liberty to retire, and compoſe the perturbation of her mind.</p>
                  <p>The anguiſh of ſuſpenſe was not added to the exquiſite ſorrow of Lady Granville: Her huſband was ſeized with another fit; from which he only recovered ſo far, as to pray for bleſſings on her and his ſon, and take a laſt tender farewel. He then,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024442_0219_0FC7329B4896E210"/>
with equal fortitude and reſignation, prepared to meet his fate; which ſoon ſucceeded, and deprived his family and ſociety of a life unſpeakably dear to the one, and highly valuable to the other.</p>
                  <p>Providence has wiſely conſtituted us in ſuch a manner, that the neceſſary exertion of the mind, in times of diſtreſs, ſeems to ſupport the feebleneſs of the body;—but when the attention of the former is no longer engaged, the powers of the latter feel utterly exhauſted.—Thus it fared with Lady Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. All the compaſſionate tenderneſs and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of Louiſa, were unable to ſupport her under the weight of this unexpected and dreadful blow. She ſunk for a while into the moſt deplorable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; from which ſhe was only rouſed by the moſt painful apprehenſions on account of her ſon, whom diſordered imagination repreſented as involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in dangers, languiſhing in ſickneſs, or ſinking under the ſtroke of death.</p>
                  <p>To a mind thus debilitated, it was in vain to offer either the ſuggeſtions of reaſon, or the conſolations of religion. Louiſa contented herſelf with teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſilent ſorrow and kind unremitting attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friendſhip.—Alas! how feeble is reaſon, oppoſed to feeling? Neither the conviction of the underſtanding, nor the aſſent of the will to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and rectitude of the Divine diſpenſations, can, for ſome time, calm the reſtleſs deſires of the heart, ſecure its peace, or reſtore it when loſt.</p>
                  <p>Haraſſed perpetually with images of horror, and diſpoſed to lean for ſupport on her laſt remaining prop, Lady Granville felt, that without the preſence of her ſon, ſhe could never enjoy one moment's
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024442_0220_0FC7329CE0819050"/>
quiet. She therefore wrote, to acquaint him with his misfortune, and entreated his immediate return, that his tenderneſs might at leaſt alleviate the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which his preſence alone could enable her to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>The letter found him at Rome. He heſitated not a moment about complying with her requeſt; but, in the mean time, diſpatched the following bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, to inform her of his health and ſafety, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her of that reſpect and affection which, he was conſcious, became doubly due to a parent in her ſituation.</p>

                  <p>Lord Haſtings (ſo we ſhall continue to call him) the moment he arrived in Paris, flew directly to the convent of St. Cire. In the midſt of the gloom which grief for the loſs of his revered father occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, he ſaw certain gleams of hope and joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, which were too intimately connected with his happineſs, not to divide his feelings, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his conduct.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa received the following letter from Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide, the day before he reached England:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To Miſs Seymour.</head>
                        <p>At length, my beloved, my admirable friend, your ſingular and ſuperior virtues are going to meet with their juſt reward: The amiable Haſtings has this moment left me. He acquainted me with the death of his father; and, whilſt he expatiated on his worth and tender affection, the tear of filial piety and ſorrow trembled in his eye, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced its way down his manly cheek.</p>
                        <p>Why, my friend, ſhould men bluſh to betray marks of that ſenſibility they ſo greatly admire in our ſex?—However modelled by education, or reſtrained by cuſtom, are not the leading features of the human mind the ſame in all the human ſpecies?—Let others applaud that ſtoical firmneſs, for which men are more frequently indebted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than philoſophy; I ſhall always think his

character the moſt perfect, who unites ſenſibility with fortitude, and whoſe heart is ever ready to correct the ſevere ſtrictures which his judgment is forced to make on the conduct of others.</p>
                        <p>He again introduced the ſubject of Rochelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> "I know, Madam," ſaid he, "you have long been the boſom friend of Miſs Seymour. May I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aſk whether there did not once ſubſiſt a very tender attachment between her and the Count?"—"Indeed, my Lord," ſaid I, "they are almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſtrangers to each other."—"Good Heavens!" exclaimed he, paſſionately, "what am I to think?"—Then, after a pauſe, "It is in vain, Madam," continued he, "to attempt concealing from you the tender intereſt my heart takes in every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Miſs Seymour.—Oh! might I, conſiſtently with honour, with delicacy, entreat to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that gentle heart is ſtill diſengaged?"—"My Lord," interrupted I, "this ſubject is too tender to be longer inſiſted upon."—"I confeſs it," replied he; "I implore your forgiveneſs; but ſurely the gentle Adelaide will pity the torment I ſuffer from ſuſpenſe, and the dreadful diſtraction and confuſion of my thoughts; ſurely ſhe may ſay, conſiſtently even with that ſacred friendſhip I revere, whether there be any other attachment?—My whole earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs depends—" I roſe; and, retiring from the grate to hide my emotion, which almoſt equalled his, "If Miſs Seymour, Sir," ſaid I, "has formed any attachment, Lord Haſtings cannot doubt that the object of her preference muſt be ſuch a one as will juſtify her both to the world and her own heart."—After again conjuring me to forgive a fault, which he ſeemed every moment in hazard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, he took his leave, telling me, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

from my generoſity a ſhare of that friendſhip, which his behaviour would convince me he could not claim from my juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt you read this letter, my deareſt Louiſa, I ſee your delicacies all in arms, and your heart throbbing with apprehenſion; but what, my friend, had you to fear from your Adelaide? Does not this heart reſpect every tender emotion of your's? Am not I capable of guarding the moſt ſacred of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits, the honour, the delicacy of a friend? Believe me, your's is not more ſafe in your own poſſeſſion than in mine.</p>
                        <p>All the happineſs I can now enjoy muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that of my friends: your's, I truſt will ſoon be complete: I would pray that it might be laſting, but correct the vain preſumptuous wiſh, and reſign the diſpoſal of your lot and my own, to that wiſdom which cannot err.</p>

The day after receiving this letter, Louiſa aroſe very early, and ſtrove to attain ſufficient compoſure to meet Lord Haſtings, without betraying any of thoſe violent emotions, with which her heart throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the moment ſhe thought of ſeeing him. Tho' ſhe ſat in the ſame room with Lady Granville, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſilent, ſhe ſtarted at every little noiſe, and ſeemed perplexed how to anſwer the ſimpleſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The moment ſhe heard a chaiſe drive into the yard, her heart took the alarm, and ſhe grew ſo faint, that ſhe was obliged to retire into Lady Granville's dreſſing-room. She heard Lord Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings enter the apartment ſhe had juſt quitted, and forgot her own feelings, to ſympathiſe in thoſe of the friends ſhe loved.</p>
                  <p>Though Lady Granville had ſummoned her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fortitude to her aid, ſhe could not again behold her ſon, without ſinking almoſt under the violence of the different paſſions with which ſhe was agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—His ſoothing tenderneſs at length compoſed her ſpirits; and, after the firſt violence of their grief was abated, Lady Granville deſired her ſon to go and fetch Louiſa. "To the care and affection of the moſt amiable of women," ſaid ſhe, "you owe the preſervation of your ſurviving parent; go, my Henry, and acknowledge the obligation."</p>
                  <p>He entered the dreſſing-room, where Louiſa was ſitting more dead than alive; but his own pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation prevented him from diſcovering her's. He approached, and taking hold of her hand, which he preſſed to his lips, "How, Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, "O, how can I expreſs my ſenſe of your friendſhip and tenderneſs to the beſt of women? May Heaven repay you a thouſand fold!"—"Indeed, my Lord,"
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024442_0225_0FC732AA879EAB18"/>
replied ſhe, "I muſt be loſt to gratitude, when I feel any pleaſure equal to that of giving comfort to Lady Granville!"—His eyes ſufficiently ſpoke the grateful ſenſibility of his heart for Louiſa's kindneſs. He led her into his mother's apartment; and thro' the veil of modeſt reſerve, could not help flattering himſelf, that Louiſa, at times, betrayed a joy on his return, and a ſympathy in his ſorrows, more anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than even that to which friendſhip gives birth.</p>
                  <p>The evening after Lord Haſtings arrived, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following letter from Lady Charlotte;</p>

                  <p>During a week that Lord Haſtings and Miſs Seymour hardly ever quitted Lady Granville's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſpite of ſincere regret for one parent, and anxious ſolicitude about the other, Lord Haſtings taſted a ſatisfaction ſo pleaſant, as often baniſhed every inquietude from his mind. The placid hours they now ſpent together, recalled the memory of thoſe which he eſteemed the moſt valuable of his life; and though unable to account for Grammont's letter, which firſt made him unhappy, he ſaw, with real pleaſure, that Louiſa was no longer ſo, and ſhared in her reſtored tranquility.

                        <p>My heart feels, and gratefully acknowledges, the ſhare you take in my ſorrow, on account of the loſs of the worthieſt of friends, and moſt indulgent of fathers. I have hardly yet had leiſure to feel the weight of my misfortune: My affectionate and afflicted mother demands my conſtant care. But oh, Beaufort! when I retire to my apartment, and recall the idea of my revered parent, a crowd of tender recollections preſs on my ſoul, and almoſt overwhelm it with ſorrow!—Be it our care who ſurvive, by treading in his ſteps, to repair, in ſome meaſure, the injury ſociety has ſuſtained, by the loſs of ſo reſpectable and valuable a member.</p>
                        <p>I found my mother in a very weak ſtate of health and ſpirits. Louiſa, the amiable, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Louiſa, is, if poſſible, more beautiful, more engaging than ever. That air of ſober ſadneſs which the late melancholy incident has impreſſed on her features, gives them an expreſſion of tenderneſs which melts the very ſoul. Mine is ſtill held in painful ſuſpenſe; ſtill am I tortured with thoſe perplexing doubts and fears, to which it gives riſe.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I fondly flatter myſelf, that through the timid and modeſt reſerve of the moſt amiable of women, I can ſee ſome ſparks of that peculiar tenderneſs, with which I ardently wiſh to inſpire her. O, Beaufort! at theſe moments, my heart throbs with unutterable tranſport!—At other times there is a caution, a timidity, a reſtraint in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that blaſts every bud of hope, and overwhelms me with dejecting melancholy!</p>
                        <p>A thouſand times a-day, I reſolve to ſpeak my ſentiments to Louiſa, and, if poſſible, diſcover her's.

But the fear of offending, the dread of diſguſting, the apprehenſion of loſing her friendſhip by ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her love, ſtill withholds me.</p>
                        <p>I met with an incident to-day which has ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed me. On riding ſlowly down the lane that leads to the Caſtle, I ſaw a clean, decent look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman, ſtanding at the door of a cottage, with an infant in her arms, whoſe features ſo ſtrongly reſembled the unhappy Talbot, that I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſtop my horſe, and inquire to whom the child belonged. The woman looked ſurpriſed at the queſtion, and, upon my repeating it, "Indeed, pleaſe your honour," ſaid ſhe, "that is more than I can tell; but I'm ſure, whoever my little Sally belongs to, need not be aſhamed to own her, for your honour will not ſee a ſtouter child in a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's day; but for that matter, ſhe is cared for by the beſt gentry in all the country, though I ſay it that ſhould not."—My firſt ſuſpicion was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; but what was my aſtoniſhment, when ſhe thus proceeded: "Mayhap, your honour is going to the Caſtle?—If ſo, you will ſee there the beſt friend my poor baby has in this world."—"How, nurſe," demanded I, "is it Lady Granville that befriends your child ſo much?"—"No, no, Sir," replied ſhe; "I believe as how Lady Granville is a very good lady, and very kind to the poor; but it is young Miſs Seymour, an' pleaſe you, that is ſo kind to me and my ſweet little poppet."—The arrival of her huſband, and ſome goſſips, put an end to this curious dialogue.</p>
                        <p>To find a child of Talbot's here, deſerted and diſowned, is by no means ſurpriſing; but how Miſs Seymour ſhould be particularly intereſted in the

care of ſuch a child, is an enigma I cannot unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.—I fancy, however, upon further acquaintance, I may prevail on honeſt nurſe to ſpeak out. If ſhe is enjoined ſecrecy, I ſhould deteſt myſelf, could I bribe her to betray her truſt; but if prudence alone occaſions her caution, that watchful dame may be caught napping, and nurſe open her lips at the ſight of all-prevailing gold.—Adieu.</p>

                        <p>It is with much truth I have formerly affirmed, that when we conſider the ſhortneſs of human life, Louiſa, reſignation ſcarce ſeems a virtue. Inſtead of looking back with criminal and unavailing ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, on account of thoſe gone before us, we ought to look forward and rejoice, becauſe we are ſo ſoon to follow.—Yet a few years, and the ſorrowful ſhall reſt in ſilence with them they deplore;—yet a few years, and all the griefs, and cares, and inquietudes, that diſturb the ſhort hour of life, and poiſon its enjoyments, ſhall be as nothing!</p>
                        <p>Again they have brought me here, to try the effects of my native air, in reſtoring an exhauſted and feeble conſtitution. But my diſeaſe is ſeated in my heart, and is without remedy!</p>
                        <p>Let not this afflict my gentle friend; let it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring her comfort to hear, that the hour of my releaſe is faſt approaching, and that I am about to receive my reward, before bearing the burden and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:024442_0232_0FC732C88E0D1F48"/>
heat of the day.—We have been long ſeparated from each other: Where is the difference, Louiſa, whether we are divided by ſeas and mountains—or by the grave?—Yes, my loved friend, there is a great, an eſſential difference—Whilſt ſeparated by diſtance, we are continually haraſſed with fear and anxiety, on account of each other; but no ſooner does the grave receive thoſe we love, than all our reſtleſs inquietudes end.</p>
                        <p>In proportion as earth and its concerns recede from view, the grand, the ſolemn ſcenes on which we are about to enter, come forward to cheer and ſupport the mind under the decays of nature. Let theſe have due influence on your's, ſhould Heaven ſee good to remove from you the friend you have long loved; and having improved to our advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in piety and virtue on earth, the moſt tender and laſting attachment, let us confide in our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Creator, that he will admit us to perfect, in the ſociety of the bleſſed, a friendſhip which here is liable to be impaired, may be interrupted, and muſt one day ſuffer diſſolution.</p>
                        <p>We are all prone, Louiſa, to forget our preſent is a ſtate of diſcipline, and regard the bleſſings we poſſeſs, not as the gifts of a bountiful Benefactor, which he is at liberty to reſume at pleaſure, but as an inheritance to which we have an indefeaſible right. It is neceſſary that we ſhould frequently be reminded of our abſolute dependence on God, and be brought back to him, by feeling that all beſides is vain, unſatisfying, and evaneſcent.</p>
                        <p>No one can properly aſſent to this truth, that has never loſt a friend. That ſtroke, which looſens our deareſt tie to earth, forms alſo, as it were, new

                  <p>The grief this letter occaſioned in the gentle heart of Louiſa was too great not to make a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent impreſſion on her features. This was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcovered by Lord Haſtings, who anxiouſly inquired the cauſe; and, by the lively intereſt he took in her ſorrow, inſenſibly leſſened its violence. It ſupplied him alſo with many pretences for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Louiſa alone (who wiſhed to conceal every depreſſing circumſtance from Lady Granville) and gave room for ſuch melting expreſſions of pity, as bore a near reſemblance to expreſſions of love.</p>
                  <p>One morning, after a very reſtleſs night, Lady Granville, feeling herſelf drowſy, deſired Lord Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to ride out, as the weather was remarkably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This propoſal was readily embraced by Miſs Seymour; but Lord Haſtings expreſſed great reluctance to leaving his mother. In reality, though there never was a more attentive or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſon, the preſence and converſation of Miſs Seymour were now become ſo eſſential to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, that he could find no pleaſure in any amuſement in which ſhe did not partake.</p>

He was ſcarcely gone, when Lady Granville ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great anxiety to know what horſe he rode; and on being informed that it was one he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed, grew extremely uneaſy, telling Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, that though he had carefully concealed it from her, ſhe had learnt, by accident, that this new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite was very eaſily ſtartled, and had actually thrown Lord Haſtings ſome time ago. Louiſa ſaid every thing to quiet the fears of his anxious mother, and continued to read, till ſhe perceived ſhe had dropped aſleep. Her apprehenſions were not ſo eaſily lulled: She ſtole ſoftly down to the garden, and, croſſing a ſmall paddock adjoining to it, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlowly up the lane, from whence ſhe had a view of the high road. She had not continued her walk many minutes, when ſhe diſcovered two men on horſeback at a diſtance; and ſuppoſing them to be Lord Haſtings and his ſervant, turned haſtily back, to regain the paddock before he ſhould obſerve her. It was too late, however, to effect her purpoſe;—on entering the lane, Lord Haſtings inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her; and alarmed on ſeeing her there alone, without her hat and cloak, clapped ſpurs to his horſe, and reached the paddock at the very moment ſhe arrived there. The flutter of her ſpirits gave ſuch a tremor to her hand, that ſhe made a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable noiſe in opening the gate; which ſtartling the horſe, made him ſpring to the oppoſite ſide of the road—and, in attempting to ſave himſelf from falling, Lord Haſtings ſprained his arm in ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a manner, that it was with difficulty he could diſmount.</p>
                  <p>After charging the ſervant to take no notice of this accident at the Caſtle, and ſending him away with the horſes, he followed Louiſa into the pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024442_0235_0FC732CD79DFBC20"/>
who ſtood pale and trembling, ſupporting herſelf againſt a tree.—She eagerly inquired after his arm, and expreſſed the ſincereſt regret, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of having been the cauſe of his accident:—"For Heaven's ſake, my Lord," ſaid ſhe, "let me entreat you never again to mount that horſe, which has already almoſt coſt you your life."—Taking hold of her hand, which he kiſſed with a look of grateful acknowledgment, he expreſſed much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe at her knowledge of the circumſtance of his former danger, as well as at her walking in the lane in that dreſs, without any attendant. In a moment, her face and neck were covered with bluſhes: The impropriety of this circumſtance, which ſtrongly betrayed the anxious and diſturbed ſtate of her mind, had never once occurred to her. She pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—ſhe heſitated—and was utterly at a loſs how to reply. Lord Haſtings perceived her embarraſſment; and, preſſing her hand to his throbbing boſom,—"Why—why, deareſt Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, with a look that pierced her to the ſoul, "ſhould you be ſo concerned about preſerving a life which is of ſo little value to the poſſeſſor?"—"Surely, my Lord," replied ſhe, "you cannot mean what you ſay? You muſt know that your life is of value to all who—" The earneſtneſs with which Lord Haſtings gazed on Louiſa whilſt ſhe ſpoke, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſconcerted her, that ſhe ſtopped ſhort, afraid that ſhe had already ſaid too much. "Ah, Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, in a tender and ſoftened voice, "could I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>latter myſelf that my life was of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to <hi>one,</hi> I would then know how much to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it."—Louiſa's perplexity and confuſion increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much, that ſhe turned towards the houſe, and muttering ſomething about Lady Granville being alone, left Lord Haſtings, without knowing what ſhe did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="unknown:024442_0236_0FC732D52683B9D8"/>
He ſtood ſome minutes, fixed to the ſpot: He repeated every word Louiſa had uttered—he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the circumſtance of her walking out alone towards the road, after having heard of his danger—and above all, on the tender ſolicitude ſhe ſhewed for his ſafety; and then wondered at his own blindneſs to ſo many proofs of her preference—and preſently reflecting on her former inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſo many marks of his, on the letter of Grammont, and conſequent depreſſion of her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with that diffidence which ever accompanies genuine and reſpectful love—he attributed all that had paſſed, to the gentle and compaſſionate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Louiſa, whoſe heart, he ſtill feared, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the ardent affection of his.</p>
                  <p>He had bewildered himſelf ſo long with theſe various conjectures, that he appeared quite abſent on entering Lady Granville's apartment; who, without knowing what had paſſed, conjured him never again to ride the horſe above-mentioned, and added, "though you kindly concealed the accident from me, I was telling Louiſa, juſt after you left us, that I was not ignorant of the danger you had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, by riding this unruly favourite of your's." Lord Haſtings turned his eyes on Louiſa, who was overwhelmed with confuſion at this unexpected piece of information; and which was rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by his replying, "I ſhould indeed be the moſt ungrateful of human beings, could I knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give one moment's pain to thoſe who ſo kindly intereſt themſelves in my ſafety."</p>
                  <p>As it was evident Miſs Seymour had made no mention of his late accident, he choſe likewiſe to be ſilent on the ſubject. A thouſand little attentive

cares on the part of Louiſa, ſhewed that it had made a deep impreſſion on her mind. The pain he felt from the arm, which, for ſeveral days, he could not uſe, it was not always in his power to conceal; and the reſtraint impoſed on Louiſa, by the preſence of Lady Granville, only redoubled the earneſtneſs of her inquiries, and tenderneſs of her ſympathy, when, for a moment, ſhe found an opportunity of ſeeing him alone.</p>
                  <p>The converſation of two amiable young people, in whom her heart took the moſt tender intereſt, inſenſibly diſſipated the gloom, with which the death of Lord Granville at firſt overwhelmed his affectionate wife: And thought Lord Haſtings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with exquiſite delight, the unguarded expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of compaſſion, under which were concealed the tender, artleſs effuſions of love, he did not chuſe, by too animated returns of gratitude for her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to alarm the delicacy of Louiſa, or increaſe her caution with reſpect to thoſe enchanting proofs of her tenderneſs, of which his glowing heart felt the full value.</p>
                  <p>One day Lady Granville propoſed trying to walk in the garden, for the benefit of air and exerciſe. This, with the help of Louiſa and her ſon, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with tolerable eaſe; and, after having reſted ſome time in the pavilion, felt her ſpirits ſo revived with the beautiful ſcene around her, that ſhe wandered down the field at the bottom of the garde. Juſt as they had ſeated themſelves on the bench, they obſerved a woman, with a lovely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in her arms, both remarkably clean, paſſing through the field; who, on ſeeing them, quickened her pace, as if afraid of being challenged. Lady
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024442_0238_0FC732D8C942FCA8"/>
Granville, who was extremely fond of children, called her: The poor woman approached; and, on ſeeing Miſs Seymour, looked extremely diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed. "I humbly beg your La'ſhip's pardon," ſaid ſhe (addreſſing herſelf to Louiſa, without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lady Granville, who was wholly engaged ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the beauty of the child;) I confeſs I ought not to have preſumed for to come ſo near the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, after your La'ſhip's expreſs orders to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but this being a holiday at Farmer Gibbon's, we were all goſſipping there, and I waited to try and bring my huſband along with me; for John, poor man, does like Farmer Gibbon's ale with all his heart, that he does. An' ſo, pleaſe your La'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being rather late abroad with my little Sally, I was taking the neareſt way home; but if your La'ſhip is angry with me, I will never do ſo no more."</p>
                  <p>During this harangue, the little infant, caſting its eyes on Louiſa, ſcreamed with joy, and ſtretched out its arms to embrace her, which greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her confuſion. "I proteſt, Madam," ſaid nurſe, with tears of joy in her eyes, "the little huſſey knows your La'ſhip; but no wonder."—Lord Haſtings took the child from her, to reach it to Louiſa, and, kiſſing it, placed it on his knee: I fear, nurſe," ſaid he, "I ſhall make but an awkward figure; but if I am not miſtaken, here is a lady," turning to Louiſa, "better accuſtomed to the office."—The infant claſped her round the neck; and though its inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent careſſes, at any other time, would have given her delight, at preſent they only heightened her bluſhes, and increaſed her embarraſſment.—"Why, nurſe," ſaid Lady Granville, "you and Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſeem to be old acquaintance?"—"Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,"
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024442_0239_0FC732DA74121BD0"/>
replied the ſimple cottager, "if I durſt ſpeak, I could tell your La'ſhip ſuch ſtories about her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! She is the very beſt friend I have in the world, God bleſs her!"—"Pray is this your own child?" demanded Lady Granville—"No, pleaſe your La'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but," with a very ſignificant ſhrug, "your La'ſhip muſt aſk me no more queſtions."</p>
                  <p>Here Louiſa aroſe, and, under pretence of care about the child's health, diſmiſſed nurſe and her little charge.—It is impoſſible to deſcribe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and agitation into which ſhe was thrown, by this unexpected rencounter. No ſooner was ſhe ſeated, than Lady Granville ſaid, with a ſmile, "My dear Louiſa, you did not uſe to conceal any of your pleaſures from me;—pray, when did you come poſſeſſed of this little treaſure?"—"Indeed Madam," anſwered Louiſa, with a deep ſigh, "if the knowledge of this child could have yielded you any ſatisfaction, you ſhould long ſince have been made acquainted with it. But it is a poor unfortunate babe, who has no one to care for it."—"Whatever may have been its misfortunes," ſaid Lord Haſtings, "it ſurely may now be accounted happy, in having ſo kind, ſo compaſſionate a protectreſs."</p>
                  <p>By this time they reached the Caſtle, and Lady Granville perceiving, from the embarraſſment of Louiſa's manner, that there was ſomething myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the hiſtory of the child, which ſhe did not wiſh to communicate, allowed the ſubject to drop.</p>
                  <p>Next day, however, on their being left alone, ſhe gave Lady Granville a full account of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and ended her narrative with ſaying, "I ſhould certainly have entreated your Ladyſhip's protection for this helpleſs innocent, had I not known, that by
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024442_0240_0FC732E26CA91718"/>
becoming an object of your attention, people would have been led to inquire into the circumſtances of her birth, which both honour and humanity promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to conceal; beſides, obſcurity is ſurely the moſt proper ſituation for one born under ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate circumſtances. I was often tempted to reveal the ſtory of its unhappy mother, at a time when your Ladyſhip's humanity might have affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her relief; but the earneſtneſs with which ſhe conjured me to conceal her error from the world, withheld me, together with my being perſuaded, that the beſt ſecurity for the future good conduct of ſuch an unfortunate wanderer, is the conviction that it is ſtill in their power, not only to return to virtue, but to preſerve reputation."</p>
                  <p>Lady Granville highly applauded Louiſa's conduct in this whole affair; and could not help expreſſing her admiration of ſo much prudence, diſplayed at ſo early an age.</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings now felt his curioſity to known the hiſtory of the child, redoubled by the ſcene of the preceding evening; accordingly he walked out early in the morning, and, on reaching the cottage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repeat the ſame queſtions he had formerly put to the nurſe: "You tell me," ſays he, "that this child is none of your own; but ſurely, nurſe, you muſt know to whom it belongs?"—"Indeed, that I don't," anſwered ſhe, "and if I did, I durſt not tell your honour, becauſe the ſweet young lady at the Caſtle brought it me nine months ago, and told me that its father was gone in foreign parts, and it had not one ſoul of living to care for it:—but ſure I am, the mother that bore her, could not love my little Sally better than ſhe does; for, if your
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024442_0241_0FC732E761300090"/>
honour will believe me, when the little poppet crows and laughs in her arms, ſhe weeps ſalt tears when ſhe looks at it."—"But why don't you bring this ſweet child to viſit Miſs Seymour at the Caſtle?" demanded Lord Haſtings.—"Why, it does ſeem a little ſtrange, to be ſure, that ſo humble, and ſweet, and good-natured a young lady ſhould forbid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to bring the child to the Caſtle, when good Lady Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville ſeems ſo fond of her; and ſhe is ſo handſome, that ſhe might appear before the beſt lady in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom."—"Pray, when did you become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Miſs Seymour?" ſaid Lord Haſtings.—"Oh, I ſhall remember the time as long as I live, and longer too, if I could," anſwered ſhe: "It was, pleaſe your honour, when my poor dear Nancy, who is now in Heaven, died, that Miſs Seymour firſt met me, when I was walking in the field, and weeping beſide a hut the child had raiſed with a few ſtones, and called it her drawing-room: The wind had thrown it down, and it was lying a heap of rubbiſh, and put me ſo in mind of my poor Nancy, that it had almoſt broke my heart. When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, I was taken with the ſame fever; and, would your honour believe it, that good angel—for if there's one in Heaven, ſhe is—came twice every day to ſee me, and gave me all the ſtuff the 'potecary ſent me with her own hand, and brought me fruit, and gave me money to pay his bill, and every thing I wanted, till I got pure well again."</p>
                  <p>The countenance of Lord Haſtings underwent many changes during the courſe of this converſation. Having given the good woman a guinea, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to be kind to the child, he returned to the Caſtle; but his curioſity was rather increaſed than piminiſhed by his interview with the nurſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="unknown:024442_0242_0FC732E88A184E08"/>
The moment he entered his mother's apartment, finding her alone, he introduced the ſubject of the child. She gave him a minute detail of all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances Miſs Seymour had related concerning the unfortunate Sally; and he felt his admiration of her increaſed, by every new light in which they placed her exalted character.—His mother, who watched every look and word which expreſſed a paſſion ſhe wiſhed to confirm, joined cordially in the praiſes he a thouſand times repeated, of the ſingular prudence and delicacy of the generous and noble-minded Louiſa.</p>
                  <p>That evening Lady Granville remarked that Louiſa looked very pale; and the weather being remarkably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine, deſired Lord Haſtings to take her out to walk: "You forget your own health, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa," ſaid ſhe, "in your concern about me; but remember, my love," ſhe added, with a look of the moſt tender ſolicitude, "that, next to that of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, on your ſafety my future comfort depends."</p>
                  <p>They paſſed through the garden, and wandered down the field, which was fragrant with the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mown hay. The ſtillneſs of the air, the ſerene face of the ſky, and the wild notes of a thruſh from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring wood, were perfectly in harmony with their feelings.—When they reached the bench, the ſun being very hot, and Louiſa looking tired, Lord Haſtings requeſted her to ſit down. They did ſo; when ſuddenly recollecting the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of finding the letter there, he became ſilent and thoughtful—he ſighed heavily, caſt his eyes on the ground, and ſeemed buried in his own reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Louiſa, whoſe ſoul vibrated to every emotion of his, ſoon caught the infectious melancholy.—
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024442_0243_0FC732EAC4753858"/>
Their mutual ſilence became every moment more embarraſſing.—At laſt, looking up, and fixing his eyes on Louiſa, with a reſpectful and timid air, "O Miſs Seymour," ſaid he, "may I preſume to hope, from the preſent ſerenity of your mind, that all obſtacles to your felicity are at laſt removed?"</p>
                  <p>The conſcious heart of Louiſa took alarm at the firſt word of this ſpeech; ſhe became pale as death, and trembled ſo violently, that Lord Haſtings was obliged to ſupport her in his arms. Afraid of her fainting, he haſtily endeavoured to unlooſe her cloak, to give her air; but, in his agitation, caught hold at the ſame time of the ſtring of pearls by which his picture was hung, and pulling the cloak away, the ſtring broke, and the picture, together with the locket, fell to the ground. He ſtooped to take it up; but how inexpreſſible was his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on diſcovering that it was his own!—"Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Heaven!" cried he, "can I credit my ſenſes!—Louiſa, my adored Louiſa! is it poſſible? Was it on this lifeleſs image I ſaw thee beſtow thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tears?"—He had time for no more.—Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a few moments the face and neck of Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour were covered with bluſhes; again her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance became pale, her head dropped on his ſhoulder, and ſhe continued for ſeveral minutes without ſenſe or motion.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of Lord Haſtings almoſt equalled her own; but far other were his feelings, when he ſaw her return to life. He preſſed her to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, which throbbed with unutterable tranſport; and again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ixing his eyes on her averted face,—"Tell me, Louiſa," ſaid he, "O tell me, do I not dream? Dare I hope—can I believe that I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?"
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024442_0244_0FC732EC3A99CCF0"/>
—"Oh, Haſtings!" ſhe replied, "how can you doubt it?"</p>
                  <p>The moſt tender, delightful, intereſting conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation now enſued. The letter of Grammont, the ſchemes of Lord Granville, the embarraſſing ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Louiſa, and the ill-grounded jealouſies of Lord Haſtings, led to ſuch a variety of tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting explanations, that theſe happy lovers forgot the hours; nor knew that they had ſpent more than two together, till they ſaw a ſervant coming down the field in ſearch of them.</p>
                  <p>With the aſſiſtance of Lord Haſtings's arm, Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa reached the Caſtle; but her emotion was ſtill ſo viſible, that Lady Granville inſtantly obſerved it: "Henry," ſaid ſhe, "you have certainly walked too far; Louiſa looks quite exhauſted—I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again entruſt you with my daughter."—"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my deareſt mother," ſaid he, taking hold of her hand, which he preſſed between his, "you muſt beſtow her on me yourſelf—you muſt entruſt her to me for ever."</p>
                  <p>Louiſa was ſtill ſo greatly agitated, that ſhe was unable to liſten to this explanation: She retired, therefore, into Lady Granville's dreſſing-room, whilſt Lord Haſtings repeated to her all that had paſſed. Could his happineſs have admitted of any increaſe, it would have been augmented by the warmth and tenderneſs of his mother's approbation.</p>
                  <p>She aroſe, and, on entering the dreſſing-room, "Now, now, my Louiſa," cried ſhe, claſping her to her boſom, you are indeed my daughter!" Then joining her hand with that of Lord Haſtings, who had followed her, "May Heaven for ever bleſs my
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024442_0245_0FC732F298808988"/>
children," ſaid ſhe, "and that God who made them virtuous, make them completely happy!"</p>
                  <p>The happineſs of this amiable pair was now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as exquiſite and unmixed as any which the moſt glowing imagination could repreſent. The late agitated ſtate of their minds rendered the calm, which now ſucceeded it, peculiarly delightful.—Their felicity, however, was chaſtened at times by their anxiety about Lady Granville, whoſe health had not yet recovered the dreadful ſhock it ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the death of her huſband.</p>
                  <p>None more ſincerely partook in their tranſport than the generous Lady Leiſter, who was then at the Earl's ſeat in—ſhire; and whom Louiſa immediately informed of the happy ecclairciſſement above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The day following, on Louiſa's being longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the dining-room than uſual, Lord Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings went in ſearch of her to the garden; and, on entering the pavilion, which had been the ſcene of ſo many intereſting interviews, was not a little ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on ſeeing Louiſa ſitting there, with a letter in her hand, almoſt drowned in tears. He inquired the cauſe of her ſorrow, with tender and earneſt ſolicitude: She gave him the letter; it was from Adelaide, and contained theſe words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To Miſs Seymour.</head>
                        <p>—At length, beloved friend of my heart, the ſolemn, awful hour approaches! This is the laſt letter you ſhall ever receive from your Adelaide! Already my hand is ſo feeble, it can hardly direct my pen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="121" facs="unknown:024442_0246_0FC732F4D586C9B8"/>
I know how this will afflict my gentle Louiſa; I feel for the anguiſh my death will occaſion you; yet ſomething whiſpers me, your heart ſhall be ſoothed, your ſorrows divided—and this hope gives conſolation to mine.</p>
                        <p>Waſte not, deareſt Louiſa, thoſe precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſhall never return, and which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny important duties demand, in exceſſive and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſorrow. Too, too many of them have we ſpent, in fond, preſumptuous ſchemes of unmingled felicity, which falls not to the lot of mortals.—Oh, my friend, vain alike are the pleaſures that engroſs, and the cares that diſquiet, he tranſient moments of our preſent exiſtence!—At this awful criſis, what do all the concerns of time appear, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the hopes of <hi>eternity!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My heart would ſay much, but my dim eyes and trembling hand refuſe their aid.—To the God of love and goodneſs I fervently commend you; to that God who will not leave the ſoul of his ſervant, deſolate and forlorn, to wander in the unſeen world—nor the body to remain for ever a priſoner in the loathſome grave.</p>

                  <p>Lord Haſtings was greatly affected with this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It touched ſome ſtrings in his heart, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to its pathetic language with a ſadneſs and ſenſibility almoſt too exquiſite to be borne. The ſorrows of ſuch hearts, however, are delightful; and whilſt theſe fond lovers, theſe faithful friends,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024442_0247_0FC732F73195FC28"/>
mingled their ſighs together, the bitterneſs of grief was inſenſibly converted into that ſweet and tender ſympathy, which gently agitates, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings preſſed the hand of Louiſa to his boſom, wiped away her tears, ſoothed her with love and tenderneſs, and encouraged her to hope, that from change of air, time, and other remedies, Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide might ſtill recover. Reflecting, that the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect due to the memory of a revered parent muſt a while delay that event to which all his wiſhes were directed, he prevailed on Louiſa, by the hope of once more beholding her friend, to join with him in requeſting Lady Granville to make trial for a few months of the air of the Continent. He knew that the novelty and variety of the objects ſhe would meet with in this little tour, would neceſſarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her thoughts from the melancholy ſubject which conſtantly occupied them; and likewiſe ſerve to relieve Louiſa from that awkward conciouſneſs attending her preſent ſituation.</p>
                  <p>With much difficulty, Lady Granville was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to enter into a ſcheme, which called for an exertion to which her ſpirits were very unequal; but conſcious of its propriety, and accuſtomed, from the ſingular benevolence of her heart, ever willingly to ſacrifice her own feelings to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or advantage of others, ſhe ſtrove at laſt to comply with the ſolicitations of her children, and, in gratitude for their duteous care of her health, to do ſo with cheerfulneſs: "There is only one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Louiſa," ſaid ſhe, "that can prevail on me to become a traveller at my age; and that is, that as ſoon as I am weary of France, you ſhall ſtand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024442_0248_0FC732F9F49BDD70"/>
to find me a daughter ready to love, honour, and obey, the moment I return to England."—Louiſa bluſhed; and Lord Haſtings, claſping his mother's hand, thanked her with his fine intelligent eyes, for this kind hint.</p>
                  <p>To avoid obſervation, they ſet out with very few attendants, and reached Paris by ſlow and eaſy journies. Being properly accommodated in lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in a retired village in the neighbourhood of Verſailles, the very day after their arrival, leaving Lady Granville behind, Lord Haſtings conducted the anxiouſly impatient Louiſa to the Convent of St. Cire. She could not again enter theſe ſacred walls, without feeling her heart ſwell with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed variety of emotions. Theſe were not leſſened on hearing, that, a few hours after ſending her laſt letter to her friend, the gentle Adelaide peacefully ended her innocent life.</p>
                  <p>Lord Haſtings partook in her virtuous ſorrow; but whilſt he did not venture to condemn, he gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to calm and moderate her affliction.—How exquiſitely ſoothing is that ſympathy, which unites at once the ardour and delicacy of friendſhip with the matchleſs tenderneſs of love!</p>
                  <p>Whilſt ſhe ſat down in the parlour, to compoſe her mind, and recover her ſcattered ſpirits, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meſſage from the abbeſs, requeſting to ſee her.</p>
                  <p>On entering her apartment, ſhe preſented her with a ſmall box, which Adelaide bequeathed to her with her dying breath. Louiſa received it with every mark of reverence for the beloved donor. She requeſted to be ſhewn the ſpot where ſhe was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024442_0249_0FC732FF4E725570"/>
and having paid the tribute of gratitude and friendſhip to a friend endeared to her heart by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue, ſhe returned to Lord Haſtings, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently waited for her, and immediately conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her back to Verſailles.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa retired to her apartment, to indulge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſes, thoſe tears which ſerved to relieve her heart. She then addreſſed the following letter to Lady Leiſter, whom ſhe had promiſed to inform of the fate of Adelaide, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be made acquainted with it.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To Lady Leiſter.</head>
                        <p>—Already, my dear friend, that ſingular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, on the poſſeſſion of which you ſo warmly congratulate me, has ſuffered a cruel interruption; already tears mingle with my joy!—Ah, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and moderation does it become man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that proſperity, which a thouſand accidents are ever at hand to embitter—which, however great, cannot be laſting—and which muſt, in this ſtate of trial, be one day ſucceeded by that adverſity, which, by contraſt, it renders more ſevere.</p>
                        <p>The kind, the generous Haſtings, who prevents or indulges every wiſh of my heart, carried me to St. Cire the very day after our arrival.—How ſhall I deſcribe the variety of feelings, with which I once more entered that ſacred abode of piety and peace!—My trembling apprehenſions were ſoon exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fatal certainty!</p>
                        <p>I had a long converſation with the venerable abbeſs, who informed me, after expatiating on the exemplary virtues of the dear deceaſed, that ſhe not
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024442_0250_0FC7330097DAD3A8"/>
only quitted life with cheerful reſignation, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and joy!—With her dying lips ſhe bleſſed me, bequeathed a little caſket to me, as a memorial of her friendſhip, and bade thoſe around tell me, "that though divided for a little, we ſhould ſurely meet again."</p>
                        <p>I cannot help regretting my abſence from this ſolemn, affecting ſcene. Yet, alas! why ſhould I regret it? My affliction would only have rendered death more formidable—might have diſturbed her heavenly compoſure, and clogged her aſcending ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>I reſolved to viſit all that now remained of the beauteous, amiable, admired Adelaide.—As I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the lowly dwelling, "I go to meet my friend," ſaid I; "but where are now the open arms, the ſmiling countenance, and throbbing heart that were wont to welcome me?"—The lay-ſiſter pointed out the humble, undiſtinguiſhed ſpot, where the firſt of women repoſes, and retired: "That faithful heart ſhall beat no more!—No more ſhall ſorrow heave that clay-cold boſom!—The ſhower of ſpring ſhall return—but no leaf of her's ſhall ariſe!—She is gone, ſhe is gone for ever, and the place that once knew her, ſhall know her no more!"</p>
                        <p>As I uttered this ſentence, I was ſtartled by ſomething which moved the ſod with which the grave was covered: It was her little dog Fidelle, the laſt gift of Grammont, on which ſhe doated, and who had made itſelf a bed under the ſod at the foot of her grave, which nothing could induce it to quit ſince the hour of her interment. The affectionate little animal knew me, and looked pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024442_0251_0FC733020169F810"/>
in my face; but immediately on perceiving its miſtreſs was not with me, laid down its head, and reſumed its former poſture.</p>
                        <p>This little affecting circumſtance quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me.—My ever watchful attentive Haſtings, afraid that this ſcene might prove too ſevere a trial for my weak ſpirits, approached; and giving me his arm, led me back in ſilence to the convent.</p>
                        <p>I then retired, to viſit her cell, that I might be more compoſed before returning to the parlour:—Her chair, her bed, her books, ſurrounded me! The very pen with which ſhe had laſt addreſſed me, lay on her table!—How pathetic was the ſilent language in which they ſpoke to my ſad ſoul!—There was a becoming ſtillneſs in the deſolate dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that gently harmonized my feelings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my mind.—I reflected with gratitude on the happineſs our mutual friendſhip had ſupplied; and bleſſed God, that from the hour of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, we had never given each other a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pain, nor wounded the delicacy of each other's affection, by careleſs neglect or culpable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
                        <p>And now, having recovered tolerable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I came back to the parlour, where Haſtings impatiently waited for me; and taking a laſt look, and breathing a laſt ſigh to St. Cire, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of its tranquil pleaſures, returned to Lady Granville.</p>
                        <p>On opening the little caſket, I found it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the picture of Grammont; a beautiful landſcape, ſuppoſed to be the ſcenery round the fort of—,

                        <p>Whilſt women, weak and puſillanimous, are held enſlaved by the prejudices of education, the bonds of principle, and the terrors of conſcience, with what ſuperior courage do men ſhake them off, and aſſert their native freedom!</p>
                        <p>If we venture even on a ſlight prevarication, how does the moral flow of our blood cover our cheeks with bluſhes, and betray our offence?—But men, with exalted courage, break the bonds of confidence and good faith, and, nobly ſuperior to remorſe and and ſhame, laugh at our credulity, and proclaim aloud their triumph.</p>
                        <p>But not only muſt we yield to you, on account of your facility in making and breaking promiſes, but in the ſuperior and peculiar art you poſſeſs, of forgetting them altogether.—Your laſt words when we parted, were, "I will write to you frequently."—How you have fulfilled your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let Conſcience anſwer.—O, cry you mercy? I believe he is not of your acquaintance, or elſe you lords indulge him with a perpetual vacation.</p>
                        <p>Tell me truly, is it that, in plighting your faith to one woman, you conſider yourſelves as abſolved from obſerving it with all beſides? Or that you think the marriage vow ſo large, that it ſhould ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all the leſſer promiſes that preceded it?</p>
