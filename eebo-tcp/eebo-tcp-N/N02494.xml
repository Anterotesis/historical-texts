            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And we ſee here that this generous Perſon, who cou'd ſay of his own ſufferings, <hi>None of theſe things move me,</hi> was ſcarce able to bear the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of his friends; however, he rebukes them for urging him to ſpare himſelf: <hi>What mean ye to weep, and break my heart:</hi> — And with great firmneſs of Mind declares his Reſolution to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with GOD's Will, whatever befell him.

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002956_0005_0FE6A5436ADE80A8"/>
Let us then Attend to this DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is our Duty to Prepare, and to be always in a Readineſs to Die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are ſuch Duties as theſe following, to be diſcharged by us, if we would be Ready to Die.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt uſe the Means GOD affords us to make Ready for Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD in His Word, threatned, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. and aſſureth us that it is <hi>appointed unto man once to die, and after that the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Yea, that Man who is born of a Woman, is <hi>of few days,</hi> Job 14.1. We muſt then <hi>look into the Scriptures,</hi> and learn from them the procuring cauſe, the certainty, and conſequence of Death. This plain truth muſt be receiv'd upon the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of GOD's Word, even when we do not feel the approaches of Death. And then, We muſt heedfully and religiouſly <hi>obſerve the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of GOD,</hi> which are a lively Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Word, and cry in our Ears, <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs</hi>—. Our Daily Experience muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to Excite us to be alſo ready. When we ſee others taken away, and ſome very Suddenly, we ſhould regard the operation of GOD's Hand, and receive Inſtruction. Again, We ſhould be much in ſerious and <hi>cloſe Meditation</hi> on this important Subject. We ſhould conſider the ſhortneſs of Life, the certainty of Death, the great uncertainty of the time when we muſt die,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002956_0006_0FE6A58B86330170"/>and the great Change Death will make upon us, when we muſt bid an eternal farewell to the buſineſs and enjoyments of this Life, yea to the means of Grace we now enjoy; and lanch forth into an amazing Eternity, to be fixt forever in perfect Happineſs, or extreme Miſery. And here, We muſt take pains to bring our Minds to a cloſe Application to theſe truths, which are irkſome to fleſh and blood, and endeavour to muſe till the fire burn, and our Hearts are ſuitably affected. Furthermore, under a deep ſenſe of our inability, as of our ſelves, to improve the Means; we ſhou'd <hi>Ask of GOD His Holy Spirit</hi> to bleſs them to us, and <hi>Pray,</hi> as Pſal. 39.4. <hi>Lord, make me to know mine End.</hi> And 90. 12. <hi>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our bearts unto wiſdom.</hi> For unleſs we obtain this Divine Teaching, tho' the Deaths of others, eſpecially when very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, may ſtartle us, yet the impreſſion will wear off without any ſaving effect. GOD may call once, yea twice, but we ſhall not hear &amp; anſwer his juſt expectation. Prov. 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>WE muſt ſeek after a ſaving Converſion to GOD, and not be at reſt till we have cloſed with the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as offered to us in the Goſpel.</hi> We muſt be brought out of a ſtate of Nature, into a ſtate of Grace, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of GOD, or we are not ſo much as habitually prepared for Death. We were all by Nature, and as Children of the firſt Adam,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002956_0007_0FE6A5459A455398"/>
               <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes in ſins, and Children of Wrath.</hi> The <hi>Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> not only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral but eternal Death. If we are therefore found under the guilt and dominion of Sin, when <hi>Death</hi> overtakes us, <hi>Hell</hi> follows. Certainly then, it moſt nearly concerns us to labour after a ſaving Converſion to GOD, and vital Union with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in order to our being in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Death. We muſt be born again, born from above, of the Spirit of GOD, or we cant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and therefore are not fit to die. There muſt be a ſaving change wrought on all the powers of our Souls; we muſt be turned from all Sin, unto GOD, or this great change will find us unprepar'd. We muſt by the Grace of GOD obey that word, Act. 3.19. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be Converted</hi> —. Unleſs we heartily grieve and mourn for our Sins as they are againſt GOD, turn from them with Godly Sorrow and Hatred, and return to GOD as our higheſt end and chief good; the valley of Death will lead to that place where is weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth for ever. We muſt alſo obey that Word of Chriſt, Joh. 14.1. — <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me:</hi> For unleſs we receive the Record GOD hath given of His Son in the Goſpel, and "Reſt upon Him alone for Salvation" with that Faith which alſo purifieth the heart, and works by love; the ſecond Death will come after the firſt: we ſhall die in our Sins, and periſh for ever. Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002956_0008_0FE6A58B9E9DC8A8"/>God abideth on on him.</hi> And 11.25. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the Reſurrection and the Life: be that believe thin me, though be were dead, yet ſhall be live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt labour diligently in finiſhing the Work GOD hath given us to do in this preſent Life.</hi> We have a Race to run, a Service to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, before we accompliſh as an hireling our day. There is the buſineſs of our General Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which muſt be engaged in and proſecuted with perſevering diligence: We muſt work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling. <hi>For it is God which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. And there is the buſineſs of our Particular Calling, which muſt be attended in ſubordination to the other. And if we wou'd be ready, we muſt be <hi>not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in buſineſs, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. The ſlothful and unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that hides his Lords Talents, may well be afraid of His coming to reckon with him. We muſt therefore <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good and faithful Servants, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Talents, and all our Advantages to the honour of GOD. Now theſe are various; there are the Powers of Soul and Body, Gifts &amp; Graces, Eſtate, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all muſt be diligently employ'd, that our Lord when He cometh may find us about His work, and ſo in a meetneſs, thro Grace, to enter into our Maſter's joy. Our Lord Himſelf ſaid, <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work,</hi> Joh. 9.4. And when about
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002956_0009_0FE6A545B46F2FF0"/>to leave the World, he could appeal to his Father, and ſay, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth: I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Joh. 17.4. And we muſt be followers of Him in our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Care to glorifie GOD, by doing His Will on Earth, if we would be Ready for our departure. Indeed after all, we muſt confeſs we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants, yea that we have fallen ſhort of our duty, and accordingly depend on the perfect and meritorious obedience of Chriſt for Pardon and acceptance with GOD. However, we muſt by a patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for Glory —. When we are wearied with conſtant labour in our Lord's Service, tho' not weary of it, we ſhall think with pleaſure of the Reſt which remains to the people of GOD in Heaven, and not need to be ſurpris'd when GOD calls us to give up our Account. Let us then obey that word, Eccl. 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave whither thou goest.</hi> O Chriſtian! do you not yet ſtand compleat, as to your profeiſed ſubjection to Chriſt. <hi>Have you not ſhewn forth the Lords Death at his Table,</hi> and openly Seal'd the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in obedience to that Command, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me.</hi> Or make haſte to keep this Commandment, leſt the reflection on ſo great an Omiſſion make your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Live in the diligent Mortification of Sin, and groan daily for perfect deliverance from it.</hi> Sin is the Sting of Death, and the remains of it in GOD's own Children, are the cauſe of their inordinate fear of Death; this cauſeth the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reluctance</hi> there is in us to a diſſolution to degenerate into a <hi>Criminal backwardneſs</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to anſwer GOD, when He calls us out of this World. Here then, we muſt ſeek the deſtruction of our Luſts, die to Sin, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death. We muſt wage an holy war with Sin, with our moſt beloved Luſts, cutting off the right hand, and plucking out the right eye. Col. 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupicence, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, which is idolatry.</hi> For this end we muſt improve the Death of Chriſt. By Faith we muſt realize it that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, and lay<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002956_0011_0FE6A54E80416248"/>aſide the ſin which moſt eaſily beſets us, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jeſus. For this end we ſhould walk in the Spirit, cheriſh its motions and follow his directions, who is the chief efficient in this work. Rom. 8.13. <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body ye ſhall live.</hi> In a word, the remains of ſin in us ſhould be our heavy burden under which we ſhould groan for deliverence. Our Cry ſhould be that, Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Such a frame as this maintained in the Soul, would be an excellent means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling us to Death; for at Death, and not till then, ſhall GOD's People be deliver'd from this worſt of evils. Then their Warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, and they are preſented faultleſs before GOD.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We must endeavour more and more to ſit looſe from this World, and to get our Hearts wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Earthly Enjoyments.</hi> If we would be ready to Die, and leave this World, we muſt <hi>not be conform'd to it, Rom.</hi> 12.2.

               <hi>the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World.</hi> This World contains thoſe objects which Satan makes uſe of to draw forth the luſts of Men. <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16. Now if we <hi>love the World,</hi> and the things of the World as our Portion, the <hi>love of the Father</hi> is not in us; and we are not prepared to leave it: We muſt then take care we do not walk according to the Courſe of this World, but Renounce it. We muſt rejoyce even in the lawful Enjoyments of this Life, as if we rejoyced not, and uſe this World as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this World paſſeth away. We muſt not look upon this as our Reſting Place, but confeſs <hi>we are ſtrangers and pilgrims on the Earth,</hi> Heb. 11.13. We muſt behave our ſelves as thoſe that are called out of this World, and do not depend on theſe things for our happineſs. We ſhould look upon this Life to be as a ſhort paſſage to an endleſs Eternity, and ſit looſe from theſe things, that we may be ready to remove at ſhort warning. And tho' it be true, we have here valuable Enjoyments, which we ought to acknowledge, to the honour of GOD who gives us theſe things richly to enjoy; yet we muſt realize it, that they are all <hi>uncertain,</hi> and not the good Part which can't be taken away; and accordingly we ſhould maintain ſome kind of holy indifferency towards them, and in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Minds a readineſs to leave them. To be ſure then we ſhould not with Covetuous deſires purſue the Riches, or other Enjoyments
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002956_0013_0FE6A54E9AB766B8"/>of this World, and weary our ſelves for theſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; but rather moderate our deſires towards theſe things, and be contented with GOD's allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>for we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.7, 8. Moreover, we ſhould manage our Worldly buſineſs with a great deal of Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Will of GOD, and learn to ſay, <hi>If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this, or that,</hi> James 4.15. When Mens heads are full of wordly projections, and their hearts are deeply rooted in the Earth, they muſt be as it were torn away from it by violence; but when their hearts are already weaned and taken off from worldly things, they will be in a good meaſure prepared to leave them, and go to GOD. But <hi>O how much do we need the eſpecial Influences of GOD's Grace that it may be ſo!</hi>

            <p n="6">6. <hi>We must live in the Exerciſe of Faith on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Realities, and ſet our Affections more on things above.</hi> There's a variety of Graces to be Exerciſed while attending this Duty; as a lively <hi>Hope</hi> of the Glory to be revealed to GOD's People: an holy <hi>Fear</hi> of the Judgments of GOD, which ſhould Excite us to give diligence that we may be found of our Judge in Peace. But I ſhall eſpecially inſtance in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> the vigorous Exerciſe of which upon proper objects is an excellent preparative for Death. Man is an empty Creature, and hath an inextinguſhable Thirſt after happineſs: and therefore while he is ſitting looſe from this World, he muſt look at heavenly things, and live by the Faith of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002956_0014_0FE6A594A2BE64D8"/>Son of GOD. The World we paſs into at Death is the <hi>Inviſible World.</hi> We have no knowledge of it, but by Revelation from GOD, and there muſt be Faith to receive the Teſtimony of GOD ſo as to lean the weight of our Souls upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changible Truth, Faithfulneſs &amp; Goodneſs. We muſt have an intire dependance on that GOD who is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt.

Expecting that He will come, and ſubmiſſively waiting that we may anſwer when He Calls, and yield a ready Obedience. <hi>Job</hi> ſays, 14 14. <hi>If a man die, ſhall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</hi> Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this change of <hi>Death;</hi> others of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> Take it in the former ſenſe, and then the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 15. intend that he would be in a readineſs to anſwer and obey the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when GOD ſhould call him out of this World. And while we are dutifully waiting our Lord's time, we muſt alſo <hi>Watch,</hi> by taking care to preſerve a wakeful frame of Spirit.

               <hi>How great, and how much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented is the Stupidity of the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this matter!</hi> That they are ſo thôtleſs about this great change of Death, ſo regardleſs of the conſequences, and ſo very negligent in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready for it.

            <p>USE, II. <hi>Let us ſeriouſly Inquire, Whether we have ſet about this great Duty of Preparing for Death.</hi> Have we laid this to heart, That we muſt Die, and conſidered what is like to become of us after Death? Have we been quicken'd from a Realizing view of our Mortality to ſecure the favour of the Eternal GOD, and to make haſte unto CHRIST in whom all GOD's People are made alive? Do we Watch for our Lords coming, and give diligence that we may be found of our Judge in Peace? In what condition ſhould we be, if GOD ſhou'd now call us out of the World?

            <p>USE, III. Let us hear and obey the call our Lord gives us in His Word, and by His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Be ye Ready alſo.</hi> We might have been a Warning to Others, who are gone to the Place of Silence; but the Lord of Life hath made them a Warning to us, and calls aloud to us; Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in the <hi>very Sudden Deaths</hi> of the laſt Week, to be Preparing for our own. Let us then to Day, Hear His Voice, and not harden our hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7, 8. The diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of GOD to us ſhould affect us, and lead us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Let us hear that Voice of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.2, 3. Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Hear ye then; <hi>Give Glory to the LORD your GOD before be cauſe darkneſs, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the ſhadow of death, and make it groſs darkneſs,</hi> Jer. 13.15, 16. GOD ſpeaks to Old and Young, to the middle Aged, and the blooming Youth, to Conſider, and Obey His Voice. However I wou'd in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner direct the <hi>Exhortation</hi> where Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeems to point it, <hi>To our Young People, and thoſe that are in their full Strength, Prepare to follow.</hi> You may be tempted to put away the the evil Day, and to ſay, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe,</hi> — To morrow ſhall be as this day; becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002956_0021_0FE6A559CAE3B458"/>your Conſtitution is unbroken, and you feel no ſymptoms of an approaching Diſſolution. But let the Word and Providence of GOD repell this temptation which hath deſtroyed it's ten thouſands. It's no ſtrange thing for Perſons to die in Youth: Yea, ſometimes that cry is heard in a very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſurpriſing manner, <hi>The young Men are Dead,</hi> Job 1.19. Your Sun may ſet ere it be Noon, and the ſhadows of the Evening cover you before you reach the middle Age of Life.

Eccl. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi> It is appointed unto you once to die, and after this the Judgment. Surely then you ſhould now <hi>give glory to GOD in whoſe hands your breath is;</hi> you ſhould now acquaint yourſelves with him, you ſhould now in the Morning begin to work out your Salvation, beſeeching GOD to work in you to will and to do. <hi>O Young People,</hi> you are our <hi>Hopes</hi> and our <hi>Fears.</hi> The time of Youth hath been the day of Salvation to many, yea it is likely to moſt that have been Converted: And yet, there is great reaſon to be afraid of you, and jealous over you with a Godly jealouſy.

Heavenly Father make them willing in the day of thy power! Don't bid me go away for this time; for this is the fitteſt time, and it may be the only time ever you ſhall have. Now it may be, your Conſciences are awakned, and the Spirit is ſtriving with you. O don't reſiſt Him; but cry to GOD now to turn you, that you may be turned; for He is your Covenant GOD. Now <hi>ſeek Christ early,</hi> earneſtly, and <hi>you ſhall find him.</hi> But if you reject Him, and neglect His great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it may be He who <hi>hath the Keys of hell and of death,</hi> will ſay to you, <hi>Thou fool! this Night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> Whereas if you now hear and obey, your Souls ſhall live.

Behold Him in our Nature <hi>Aſcending into Heaven,</hi> where He is gone to prepare a Place for you, that when the frail Houſe of this earthly Tabernacle ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you may have an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. And do not perplex your ſelves with diſquieting thoughts about the Time or Circumſtances of your Death; but caſt all thoſe cares and burdens on the LORD, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal 23.4. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I

O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin; and the ſtrength of ſin is the law. But thinks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for aſ much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
