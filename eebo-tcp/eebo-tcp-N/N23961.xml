            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN we examine the principles of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, we have reaſon to admire it, as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent form of a free government: And when we conſider its binding force and acknowledged autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all the branches of the adminiſtration, we have reaſon to confide in it, as a ſecurity of liberty. That either the conſtitution or its adminiſtration ſhould be perfect, it is inconſiſtent with the nature of man, its agent and object, to expect. Can the work of man reſemble that of angels, or would the laws of angels control the vice and folly of man? We are yet on earth, and not in heaven; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our nature muſt ſhow itſelf in all our works, and in all our conduct; and to the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perverſeneſs of our nature muſt our laws be adapted. The variety of the human mind ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders impoſſible an uniformity of opinion: as well may we expect uniform ſerenity of ſky, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031694_0004_0FEE772C2884C1C8"/>of health. The genius of our government, dictating a juſt regard to the ſentiments of every individual, contributes, with the variety of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to render vain the hope of general approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where the iron yoke of deſpotiſm weighs down every neck to an equality of ſubmiſſion, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is uſeleſs, and complaint dangerous; and there is the acquieſcence of conſtraint, and the ſilence of fear. But in a democratic government, where each man, while he feels his conſequence, muſt feel his diſappointment; you may as well bid the water ceaſe to ruffle, when the wind blows, as think to prevent diſſatisfaction, ſuppreſs murmurs, or ſtill clamour. Theſe ariſe out of our nature, and our government; and, like other evils, may be leſſened by prudence and ſkill, but cannot be removed.</p>
            <p>To have been in a ſituation of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to be extricated without injury, loſs, or cauſe of regret, is more than human nature, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fortune will permit us to hope.

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s of a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and an eight years' war; to have prepared, on a new and untried plan, and to have created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to ſupport, a frame of government for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen extended and independent ſtates, of various prejudices and views; to have adminiſtered the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe ſtates, under all the errors of its ſtructure, and the perils of their condition; to have reformed this government, and adapted it to their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031694_0005_0FEE77320FE054C0"/>varying circumſtances; and, hitherto, diſappointing the malicious hopes of our enemies, and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate fears of our friends, to have conducted it proſperouſly amidſt the conflict of a world in arms; is a taſk, which only the ignorant and thoughtleſs will deem light. And to have executed this taſk, without many errors, and many complaints, would have required a wiſdom, a virtue, and a fortune, far above the lot of man. When we view our paſt ſteps, our preſent ſtate, and our future fair and reaſonable proſpects, every candid and intelligent man, who juſtly eſtimates the difficulty of our affairs, and the frailty of our nature, will ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon to reſpect the wiſdom and virtue of thoſe, by whom our government has been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and to admire the felicity of our fortune.</p>
            <p>As we ought not to hope in man, for the virtue of angels, neither ought we to fear, in him, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of devils. A weak and erring creature, he is ſometimes miſled by ignorance, and ſeduced by temptation; but when he wilfully does wrong, it is for ſome cauſe, other than the pleaſure of doing it. The way to keep man right, therefore, is to point out clearly his duty, and remove from him all inducement to depart from it. The man who, in this ſituation, does wrong, muſt have a degree of malignity not common in human nature; and the man who can eaſily ſuppoſe it in another, muſt find ſomething in himſelf inclining him to do it. In this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031694_0006_0FEE775F0F03D770"/>ſituation our conſtitution, as nearly as practical ſkill and prudence can direct, has placed all thoſe who are entruſted with its adminiſtration. The limits of authority are preſcribed, and temptations to abuſe of authority are, as much as poſſible, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. No man can make laws to bind others, and not himſelf. No man can judge in his own cauſe. The authority of every man may be examined, and every man's abuſe of it puniſhed. All duty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; all power is limited; all intereſts are the ſame. There is no power but, in ſome way, is derived from the whole community, and, in due progreſs, returns to it. There is no power, which abuſe of it does not determine. There is no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, office, or truſt, which is not acceſſible to the merit of any citizen; none, which his merit can tranſmit to his poſterity. There are no offices, truſts, or penſions, but for the public benefit; none, which the public will cannot aboliſh. What more effectual guards, than our conſtitution has eſtabliſhed againſt temptation to human frailty, could human prudence invent? That thoſe who have adminiſtered the government have erred, may be true; and that they may err, is true; for they are men. But, as the conſtitution has, as much as poſſible, removed temptation, we cannot, without proof, or without admitting our own corruption, ſuffer ourſelves to believe, that they have erred wilfully.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031694_0007_0FEE77351E3D7098"/>
Beſides that ſecurity of liberty, and a faithful adminiſtration, which the principles of our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the nature of man afford us, we have an additional ſecurity, in the <hi>ſtation</hi> of thoſe who are intruſted with the adminiſtration of our government. If the elective branch exerciſe its powers with judgment and fidelity, it is hardly poſſible that the adminiſtration ſhould be wrong; for it will fill all offices with men of underſtanding, integrity, and knowledge: and ſuch appointments muſt produce a good adminiſtration. Conſidering therefore (as, where the elective branch acts properly, we ought to conſider) that appointment to office is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of underſtanding and knowledge, we have, in ſtation a ſecurity for a faithful adminiſtration. There is in underſtanding and knowledge a power, which thoſe who poſſeſs them not, cannot feel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtibly impelling to acquire reputation, by a faithful diſcharge of duty. Underſtanding and knowledge furniſh a juſt eſtimate of the importance of virtue, and inſpire the mind with a deſire of it: and however they may ſometimes yield to ſtrong temptation, it requires far ſtronger temptations to baffle the judgment, where they exiſt, than where they exiſt not. Let, therefore, the elective branch always fill offices with underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as moſt juſtly and readily valuing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing duty.</p>
            <p>Together with the conſtitution, nature, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have in that <hi>character,</hi> which ſtation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031694_0008_0FEE77277B3DFC30"/>public officers to form, a further ſecurity of a good adminiſtration. Is it to be ſuppoſed, that underſtanding and knowledge, which ſo ſtrongly impel to purſue virtue and duty, will not as ſtrongly impel to retain them? Character, reputation, or a good name, is not eaſily acquired, and will not leſs reluctantly be abandoned. It is not in the nature of man readily to give up that which we have hardly acquired and highly value. Is it eaſy to conceive, that a Waſhington or an Adams, who have derived all their fame from their exertions in the cauſe of liberty, would abandon the ſource of their glory and their pride?</p>
            <p>We find, therefore, in the nature of man, in our political conſtitution, and in the ſtation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe who adminiſter it, a competent ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our liberty, and a faithful adminiſtration. And I am perſuaded, that an accurate review of all the paſt tranſactions of our government will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy every intelligent and candid mind, that they are all conſiſtent with a ſincere deſire for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, and generally well calculated to promote it; that the errors in it have been fewer than in other governments in ſimilar circumſtances, and that, to account for thoſe errors, it is not neceſſary to ſuſpect corruption or any deſign againſt liberty; for they may all be accounted for, by the fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of human judgment, and the variety of human opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:031694_0009_0FEE77382C523100"/>
But why then, if our government has been ſo adminiſtered, and we cannot hope for perfection, do we hear complaints? Complaint is as natural to man, as error. Falſe judgment is one of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral errors of man. And we are not leſs diſpoſed to cenſure others, than to approve ourſelves. Let any man look back upon his paſt life, and, with his own, compare the opinion of others, on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and then ſay, whether others form a right judgment of his motives and actions. If others be miſtaken with reſpect to us, may not we be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with reſpect to others? And may we not all be miſtaken, in the judgment we form of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the government?</p>
            <p>The adminiſtration indeed may have been erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; but, without ſuppoſing error in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, we may account for complaint, from the nature of man, and of our government. Where the powers of government are limited to a few, they are ſuppoſed to qualify themſelves for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of them; and others, who have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, may take no pains to examine or to judge, but ſubmit in ſilence. But, in our government, every citizen has a ſhare in the adminiſtration, and a right to examine its conduct. We are too apt to confound right with capacity, and power with ſkill; to think ourſelves qualified to do, what we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do; and, becauſe we <hi>may</hi> judge, to ſuppoſe that we <hi>can</hi> judge. Politics, legiſlation, or
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031694_0010_0FEE77291A80BAA0"/>the art of government, is a ſcience, and like other ſciences, to underſtand it, requires knowledge, ſtudy, and reflection. Reſpectable as this country is, we can hardly ſuppoſe, that the ſtate of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledge in it is yet ſuch, as to enable all who <hi>may</hi> judge to judge <hi>rightly,</hi> of the conduct of adminiſtration. And this difficulty is increaſed by the readineſs, with which our intereſt directs us to admit ſtrangers to a participation of our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. We ſometimes ſee thoſe, who but a few months from Europe, and but ill qualified by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge or experience, have had little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of underſtanding our intereſts, ſuddenly, and perhaps before they have acquired the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of citizens, become the moſt forward to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the moſt ſevere to cenſure, the meaſures of our adminiſtration. The difficulty, therefore, of general knowledge, will induce a prudent man, when he hears complaints of adminiſtration, to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate in deciding, whether the error be in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or in the complaint; and to conſider on which ſide there is the beſt chance for a right underſtanding of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>In the mechanic arts, a ſtranger will frequently be at a loſs to explain the uſe, and frequently be diſpoſed to cenſure the folly, of the different opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the artiſan. But this happens more rarely in the common arts, becauſe the effect is ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately connected with the operation, that we can
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031694_0011_0FEE773F5EF2FD28"/>more readily diſcern its uſe, and form a right judgment. In the ſciences, phyſic, law, &amp;c. where our ignorance is greater, and can be leſs eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, our miſtakes are more frequent and more groſs. Under no government, perhaps, has juſtice been more purely and ſkilfully adminiſtered, than in courts of law, in our government. Yet do we not ſometimes hear their deciſions arraigned by the ignorant, as erroneous, and by the malevolent, as corrupt and prejudiced?</p>
            <p>We all admit, that all nature is under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Almighty wiſdom: but is there any government, againſt which there are ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? Where is the man that could not preſcribe better ſeaſons, better health, and better fortune, than we now receive from the Great Governor of the univerſe. If we are not pleaſed with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, can we wonder, if the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man diſpleaſe us? And in whom, ſhall we ſay, is the error?</p>
            <p>Since we complain moſt, where we leaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we have reaſon to lay it down as a rule, that, where, as in our government, there is little temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to error, complaints are in proportion to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and ariſe from it.</p>
            <p>As our ignorance occaſions complaints, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is often ill qualified either to juſtify or
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031694_0012_0FEE7760C6AB90B8"/>remove them. Our moſt diſtinguiſhed <hi>clamourers</hi> frequently derive their information only from newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers. I would not be underſtood to throw out indiſcriminate cenſure; but newſpapers are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times publiſhed, not that they may be uſeful to the readers, but to the printers; not that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, but that they may be bought; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the publiſhers is not ſo much to inform the judgment by juſt knowledge, as to excite paſſion and curioſity, and ſupport the party that will beſt ſupport their cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Sometimes alſo we ſee men, who, diſappointed by accident, or deſtitute of uſeful talents to lead them to that rank or character, which their vanity or ambition ſuggeſts, ſeek popularity by cenſure and complaint againſt all meaſures. Unable to comprehend, they ſeem to dread, every propoſition which comes not from themſelves, and fill the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with their falſe clamours and fooliſh fears.</p>
            <p>When we combine all thoſe cauſes, we may, without admitting that the adminiſtration of our government has been erroneous, perhaps juſtly, wonder, not that the complaints have been ſo many, but that they have been ſo few.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe internal grounds of diſſatisfaction, there is another, from which ſome nations have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much; but from which, I hope, we have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031694_0013_0FEE774775A89280"/>little to fear. The author of <hi>A Hiſtory of the late Revolution in Sweden,</hi> ſays, "The framers of the Swediſh conſtitution, by placing their liberties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of any attacks of their ſovereigns, imagined they had effectually ſecured them; and forgot they had left a door open for another ſpecies of corruption, equally fatal to liberty, and, in its conſequences, infinitely more ruinous to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, foreign corruption.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sheridan's Hiſtory of the Revolution in Sweden, Part II. ſect. 2.</note>" To this cauſe tampering with the intereſts and feelings of the people; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing the counſels, and checking the energy of the government; and thus throwing the nation into confuſion and diſtreſs, he attributes that revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which reſtored the king to deſpotiſm, and overthrew all thoſe barriers of liberty, which the framers of the conſtitution had eſtabliſhed as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>We, diſtant from the courts of Europe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in their intrigues, can have but little knowledge or ſuſpicion of the artifices, by which the greater play off the ſmaller ſtates againſt each other. Under pretence of maintaining the peace of Europe, they are in a conſtant ſtate of concealed hoſtility; and, to preſerve the balance of power, each kingdom is perpetually on the watch for an opportunity of aggrandizing itſelf. Of thoſe Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031694_0014_0FEE7766675CEB68"/>powers, France and Britain have long taken the lead; and with all the influence, which money and art can give, have mutually ſtriven to make every ſmaller ſtate a thorn in the ſide of each other, and light up the flame of war, whenever their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſts might ſuggeſt. For this purpoſe, they have maintained miniſters at every court in Europe, to watch the conduct of that court, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of other nations there. But as thoſe public agents muſt be known and ſuſpected, and ſo leſs competent for the neceſſary corruption and artifice; they have often been but ſhadows, without real confidence or power, and have been directed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtructions from others, who had no public authority. Or if they acted uncontrolled, together with them, there were often ſent others, who, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing talents without a name, and exciting no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, could intrigue more ſucceſsfully. To thoſe public miniſters and concealed agents of the courts of France and Britain, was intruſted a competent management of powers and money. They inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in all the internal meaſures of the ſtate in which they reſided. They excited parties where they found none, and where they found parties they ſupported them. In theſe intrigues, principle was altogether diſregarded; except the principle of embroiling the government on which they acted, and accompliſhing the purpoſe they meant to effect. While, at one time, in Holland, the agents of France ſupported democratic or ariſtocratic fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031694_0015_0FEE774FB01AAE98"/>becauſe the agents of Britain ſupported deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic; in Sweden, they changed ſides; and each ſupported that in one country, which it oppoſed in another. And in the ſame country, at different times, they adopted a contrary conduct, as their intereſt or views ſuggeſted. In Holland, or in Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the miniſter of France was, at one time, on the ſide of democracy, and another time on the ſide of monarchy, as he could beſt wield the foreign ſtate to the purpoſes of his court. And the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Britain as certainly took the ſide oppoſite to that which the French miniſter headed. To ſecure his ſucceſs, each miniſter diſtributed money, foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prejudice, and ſtirred paſſion, through the whole ſtate: and the parties of the diſtracted nation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by their arts, or ſeduced by their wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or pretended, that they were ſtruggling for the intereſts of their country, when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to its ruin. By ſpies and bribes, thoſe foreign miniſters pried into all the counſels of the ſtate which they were ſent to watch or corrupt. They endeavoured to influence all its conduct. If a treaty were ever ſo neceſſary and inoffenſive, they affected diſſatisfaction, feigned injury, embarraſſed its progreſs and execution, and excited clamour againſt it. If an election approached, they ſpread abroad reports, and exerted influence, bribes, and corruption, to ſecure the appointment that moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their views. The author whom I quoted, informs us, that when the ſtates of Sweden aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031694_0016_0FEE7722E5C887F8"/>in 1765, the French ambaſſador was ſuppoſed to have laid out no leſs than 400,000 livres in the election of the marſhal of the diet. But the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and Ruſſian miniſters had taken their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſo well, that the marſhal was of their ſide. What then muſt they have laid out!</p>
            <p>He alſo informs us, that in 1766, Sweden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treaty of Friendſhip with England; the chief article of which was, that the ſubjects of each nation were to enjoy reciprocally, in their reſpective kingdoms, ports, and harbours, all advantages and immunities which the moſt favoured nation did then, or might afterwards enjoy. "Inoffenſive," ſays he, "as this treaty was, France affected to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſſatisfied with it, as well as ſurpriſed at its being concluded without having been previouſly communicated to her. She accordingly made uſe of it as a pretext for putting off the payment of a part of the ſubſidies which had been then ſome time due. She further threatened, that, in caſe Sweden entered into a defenſive alliance with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhe would deprive the Swediſh ſhips of all the advantages they poſſeſſed in the ports of France. There is ſomething in the French ambaſſador's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to the Swediſh miniſtry on this occaſion, which gives ſo true an idea of the dependence in which Sweden was held by France, that it deſerves a place here. <hi>The true reaſon of the delay of the payment of the ſubſidies is, that his Moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031694_0017_0FEE775694EB9740"/>Majeſty, had made in conſequence of treaties, which he religiouſly obſerved, certain political arrangements relative to his interior affairs: That one of theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements of his Majeſty, with regard to the North was that Sweden ſhould conclude no treaty, without his Majeſty's conſent. That, in contempt of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, the motive of the ſubſidies of France to the Swediſh court, Sweden had made a treaty with a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, without waiting for the conſent of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. That Sweden not attending to this engagement had deranged the political views of his Majeſty, as his non-payment of the ſubſidies would derange the economical views of Sweden."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poland has long exhibited a melancholy example of the fatal effects of foreign influence on a divided people, and the deplorable ſpectacle of a nation bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces by its own paſſions, and the violence of other powers. The king of Pruſſia, in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs from 1763 to 1775, has detailed (and he knew them well) ſome of the intrigues of foreign ſtates, and the miſerable pretexts under which they cover their ambition, rapacity, and hatred towards the unhappy nations whom they embrace in their cruel and inſidious policy.</p>
            <p>Mirabean, the diſtinguiſhed defender of French liberty, reſided, ſometime before the revolution, as ſecret agent of France in Pruſſia. Of the means, which ſuch perſons uſe, we may form ſome idea
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031694_0018_0FEE7725F3B2DD00"/>from his expreſſions. "I do not ſcruple," ſays he, "to affirm, that by the aid of 1000 guineas, the whole ſecrets of Berlin might be perfectly known— It is impoſſible, that any thing ſhould eſcape the ambaſſador of France, if he be adroit, active, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and has the art to invite proper gueſts to his <hi>daily</hi> dinners and ſuppers: for theſe are the efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means, and not <hi>public</hi> dinners. He is a kind of regiſter office, to which all the diſcontented, the babblers, and the covetous reſort
<note n="*" place="bottom">Anecdotes of the Court of Berlin. Letter 64. 46.</note>."</p>
            <p>Though, as they always oppoſed each other, one of them might ſometimes do good, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the arts and money of thoſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters, to learn and influence the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the nation in which they reſided, even when they promoted the good of that nation, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted for that purpoſe, or for any other purpoſe, than to promote the views of their own courts. Mirabeau, while at Berlin, ſeems to have been the agent of Mr. Calonne, then in the French mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and is ſaid to have written his letters to Talyrand Perigord, late biſhop of Autun. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the diſturbances in Holland, he ſays, "The undoubted politics of our cabinet, are to render the Stadtholder ſubſervient to the public good, and the independence of the United Provinces; not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his expulſion. A ſucceſsful pacification of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031694_0019_0FEE775D88BE76E0"/>troubles of Holland would render Mr. Calonne more ſervice, than their continuation. Should it be proved to Mr. Calonne, that the Stadtholder is come over to the ſide of France, wherefore will he ſpoil his own game
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. Letter 62 61.</note>."</p>
            <p>If we examine the hiſtory of the minor ſtates of Europe, we ſhall find, that the agents of thoſe two nations, Britain and France, in oppoſition to each other have been conſtantly engaged, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to turn the counſels and exertions of every other ſtate, at whatever expenſe to itſelf, againſt the rival nation. Though war of the ſword may have ceaſed, war of arts and intrigue never ceaſed between them. And though, to ſucceed, they might cover their intrigues under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the intereſt of the ſtate which they ſtrove to influence or aid, their real deſign was always the aggrandizement of their own, and the humbling of its rival nation.</p>
            <p>With this diſpoſition, it was not to be ſuppoſed, that, when the American revolution commenced, France would be indifferent to ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humbling the pride and power of Britain. Accordingly, as ſoon as it was ſeen to be no haſty riot or tranſient inſurrection, that would ſink under the force of the Britiſh government; but was likely
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031694_0020_0FEE77246C362938"/>to iſſue in the complete independence of the United States, the French court took a decided, open, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and uſeful, part in our favour. The reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſing from the war, and the diſputes ariſing out of the treaty of peace, left no inducement for France to increaſe our animoſity againſt Britain. But no ſooner did we endeavour to compoſe thoſe diſputes, by a treaty, both neceſſary for us, and harmleſs to France, than here, as in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, France clamoured againſt that treaty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reſtored us to a ſtate of amity with Britain.</p>
            <p>I have no deſire to leſſen that juſt reſentment againſt the actual and intended injuries of Britain, or that juſt gratitude for the ſervices of France, which every American has felt. Nor am I ſatisfied, that the opinion is altogether correct, that a nation ought to have no paſſions. Reſentment and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are uſeful paſſions, planted in man for good purpoſes. Reſentment of injury ought not to ceaſe, while redreſs is attainable, and not obtained. Nor ought gratitude for benefits to ceaſe, while retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is practicable, uſeful, and not beſtowed. If Britain be no longer, our enemy, but now diſpoſed to do us juſtice, ought not our reſentment to ceaſe? If our ſervices would be uſeleſs to France; if fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer for her ſafety, but for her pride, ſhe ought not to claim them; and if, while they could only feed her <hi>pride,</hi> they would hazard our <hi>ſafety;</hi> ought gratitude to be exerted? It is no longer a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031694_0021_0FEE772AA0F51E58"/>queſtion, whether the nations of Europe will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge France as a republic. The combined armies no longer take her towns, or occupy her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. Inſtead of defending her own, ſhe now overruns other countries; and continues the war to enlarge her boundaries. Britain her moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy has already ſent to her capital, to ſue for peace. And France may, whenever ſhe pleaſes have the conſent of all her enemies, to ſheathe her ſword, diſband her armies, and, under her repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican conſtitution, retain all that vaſt empire, which her king governed. In this ſituation of France, and when we have omitted no ſervice, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice or ruin to ourſelves, we could beſtow; ſhall our gratitude be ſummoned to ſervices uſeleſs to her, and dangerous to us? And ſhall it be called ingratitude, without war, to have compoſed our diſputes with Britain, by a treaty, which has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us points eſſential to our ſafety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no ſtipulation injurious to France? Though gratitude be a duty, both of ſtates and individuals; the firſt duty, both of ſtates and individuals, is ſelf preſervation. States, like individuals, may often cover their conduct with pretences of generoſity and diſintereſtedneſs; but it will be found generally, that <hi>ſelf</hi> is at the bottom. Nor do we but in romance, ſee Don Quixotes, who gratuitouſly labour through the world, to redreſs grievances. Among nations as among individuals, where there is no common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, there will be but little common ſervice. And,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031694_0022_0FEE776AE860BB20"/>in both, a prudent man will always ſuſpect ſtrained profeſſions of generoſity, for ſymptoms of deceit.</p>
            <p>To a prudent jealouſy of other governments we ought to unite a prudent confidence in our own. Here the tie of common intereſt ſubſiſts. With a conſtitution reſtraining all the branches of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and with frequent elections, what have we to fear from our government? Where there is no room for fear, there is no cauſe for jealouſy; and confidence becomes a duty, which we owe to our own happineſs and intereſt. A deciſive, firm, and energetic execution of the laws, is the health of a free government; and, to ſecure that, the hands of government muſt be ſtrengthened, by a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Where there is an influential repreſentation of the people, violations of the conſtitution are, at leaſt, not leſs to be feared from the legiſlature, than from the executive. The moſt popular branch is always the greateſt favourite; and favourites are always the moſt apt to abuſe power. The ſenate of Sweden determined, that they might ſupply the want of the king's ſignature by affixing a ſtamp of his name; in other words, that though he governed in form, they ſhould govern in reality. The houſe of Commons in England raiſed troops, in the king's name, to ſight againſt him; and, as ſoon as they found that they could govern without him, they laid him aſide, and, after him, diſmiſſed alſo the houſe of Lords, and took all government into their own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:031694_0023_0FEE772F3697A5A0"/>
But have not other nations loſt their freedom, by uſurpation of the executive?</p>
            <p>Precedent or example becomes argument, only when caſes are ſimilar: and a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances contributed to deſpotiſm in Europe, which do not exiſt here. There, the king was conſidered as owner of the whole territory; and all eſtates were derived from him. He had a ſeparate eſtate annexed to his perſon, extenſive domains, and large revenue. All eſtates, that had no heirs, eſcheated to him. All, that were forfeited for crimes, veſted in him. All penalties and forfeitures for offences were his. For the uſe of all theſe, he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. He commanded the whole force of the kingdom. He could raiſe and maintain armies of his own will, and direct them at his pleaſure. The adminiſtration of this revenue, and command of this force, combined with the turbulence and rivalſhip of feudal ariſtocracy, enabled the king to increaſe his authority at his diſcretion. This accumulation of eſtate, treaſure, force, and authority enabled the father to tranſmit his poſſeſſions and authorities to his ſon, and made the crown hereditary; and this both tempted and enabled to render it deſpotic. While all were accountable to the king; his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters only were reſponſible, and he was ſubject to no juriſdiction. The ſituation of our executive is ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from all this; that the jealouſy neceſſary in other government, is not neceſſary in ours; nor does it ſeem to me proper to believe, that party
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031694_0024_0FEE772159BEE588"/>ſpirit contributes to the preſervation of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>Let each of us look into his own heart, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably believe, that the virtues which he ſees in himſelf exiſt alſo in others. Let us not ſuppoſe, that patriotiſm is confined to ourſelves, to our friends, or to our party; or that other opinions and meaſures than ours, may not alſo be intended and adapted for the public good. Let us judge of men in public ſtations, as men; with the errors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but alſo with virtues of men, and examine their conduct with that indulgence to their weakneſs, and that reſpect for their integrity, which we owe to men, and as men expect to receive. Let us inſtruct, and, if poſſible, reform, but not hate each other. Having all a common intereſt in the proſperity of the ſtate, let us, as members of one family, work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in unity and affection, for the public good, and diſcharge our political duties, with fidelity and judgment. In electing to office, let us be careful to chooſe men of knowledge, underſtanding, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and then repoſing, with confidence, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of our conſtitution, and the ſkill and honeſty of the adminiſtration; let us not diſturb our peace, with groundleſs jealouſy, or weaken the energy of the laws, by raſh cenſures, and erring complaints. And, with this ſpirit of faithfulneſs and reciprocal confidence, let us proceed to the peculiar duties of our ſeveral ſtations, at this time.</p>
