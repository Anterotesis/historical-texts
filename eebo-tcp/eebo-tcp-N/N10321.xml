            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WITH Re≈øpect to the Southwe≈øt Part of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Land afore≈øaid it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed that <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River mu≈øt <q>con≈øtitute the Centre of Trade,</q> &amp;c. to the Inhabitants thereof. But Three Qurters or more of that Di≈øtrict of di≈øputed Lands, from the Contiguou≈øne≈øs thereof to Lake Champlain, and remote Situation from <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River, equally con≈øtitute Lake Champlain, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, &amp;c. the Centre of Trade for its Inhabitants.‚ÄîFurthermore, it is no Way incompatable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Inhabitants of the Southwe≈øt Quarter of the Di≈øtrict afore≈øaid ≈øhould Trade at <hi>New-York,</hi> although they may be ≈øuppo≈øed to be under the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire.</hi> The following Exhibitions, will undoubtedly convince the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader that the ≈øaid Inhabitants would be under va≈øtly greater Advantage, to trade at <hi>New-York,</hi> or any where el≈øe, on Provi≈øo they ≈øhould be re-annexed to the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> for then they would peaceably enjoy the Right of ≈øoil of Lands they po≈ø≈øe≈øs, which, under the Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>New-York</hi> they cannot.

HIS Maje≈øty, ever graciou≈øly di≈øpo≈øed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intere≈øt and Good of his Subjects, and viewing the E≈øtabli≈øhment of the juri≈ødictional Line between the re≈øpective Governments, as not interfering with the private Property of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and in this View of the Ca≈øe, perceiving a manife≈øt Convenience, at lea≈øt for a Part of that Di≈øtrict, to be annexed to the Province of <hi>New-York;</hi> and the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> not being notified of Tryal (which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be owing to the Neglect of their Agent) by which Means his Maje≈øty and Council could have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation but from the Repre≈øentations from <hi>New-York;</hi> came to a Determination of the juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Line <hi>Exparte;</hi> which is probably the Cau≈øe why it extended ≈øo far Ea≈øt as the we≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. This Event proved exceeding unfortunate to the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers: From which they may compute the Date of their Oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion from the Government of <hi>New-York;</hi> this put it in the Power of that crafty, de≈øinging, &amp; monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing Government, to exerci≈øe that U≈øurpation towards the Inhabitants afore≈øaid, exhibited in the following Sheets.</p>
               <p>No ≈øooner had <hi>New-York</hi> obtained the Juri≈ødic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Governor <hi>Colden</hi> began to Patent, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain celebrated Attornies and principal Gentleman in the Province, the very Lands on which the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers dwelt; and it is a more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øable and complicated Wickedne≈øs in Governor <hi>Colden;</hi> ina≈ømuch as but a little before he per≈øwaded his graciou≈øly di≈øpo≈øed Maje≈øty into an Opinion

               </p>
               <p>NEXTLY, in the Cour≈øe of this Narrative it is nece≈ø≈øary to take a retro≈øpective View to July Term, in the Year 1769, at which the Claimants under <hi>New-York,</hi> being Non-re≈øidents, brought Actions of Ejectment in the Supreme Court again≈øt ≈øundry of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> who were in actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the conte≈øted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes: but part if not all of the Judges and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies being intere≈øted in the ≈øaid ≈øub≈øequent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013102_0006_0F8EBBE4505B58F0"/>from the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and ≈øome of the principal Attornies, Patentees of the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Patents then on Tryal. And the Plaintiffs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in great Fa≈øhion and State, which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Fraternity of Land-monopolizers, made a briliant Appearance. But the Defendants appearing in but ordinary Fa≈øhion, having been greatly fatigued by hard Labour, wrought on the di≈øputed Premi≈øes, made a very di≈øproportionable Figure at Court; and, in fine, Intere≈øt, Connection, and Grandeur, ea≈øily turned the Ca≈øe again≈øt the forlorn Defendants: The whole Di≈øtrict of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were greatly alarm'd at the Event that had begun to take Place, were in great Con≈øternation, each Individual reading his own intolerable Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction from that which had already began.</p>
               <p>STILL there was more Actions of Ejectment commenced again≈øt ≈øundry of the Inhabitants, and the Sheriff of Albany County, by ≈øpecial Order from the Governor, was rai≈øing the Militia of the County to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the Defendants afore≈øaid, of their Tenements. This was a mo≈øt melancholy Scene‚ÄîWomen lamenting over their Children, and they crying; and Men pierced to the Heart with the mo≈øt pungent Grief and Affection for them, and bitter Indignation at the approaching Tyranny of <hi>New-York.</hi> And what renders the Reflection of the Conflict more doleful, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of the extreme Fatigue, Hunger, and infinite Hard≈øhips the Inhabitants had undergone in the Settlement and Cultivation of a Wilderne≈øs Country: It ≈øtill adds a twinge to the Smart to

               <p>THERE had before this time been ≈øeveral le≈ø≈øer Combinations of the People of tho≈øe Grants to defend their Per≈øons and Properties from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of <hi>New-York,</hi> which by them are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opprobrious Names of Riots, Mobs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Felony, &amp;c‚ÄîAfter the ineffectual Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Po≈ø≈øe, the Land-Monopolizers in the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> adopted different Mea≈øures to accompli≈øh their De≈øigns; perceiving they could not rai≈øe a Militia, that would Fight for the Title of their Sub≈øequent Patents, and they being a cringing, fawnig, deceitful Fraternity; not enured to the Horrors of War, or any thing Heroic, dur≈øt not Fight for their own Claims: Their accu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Way, to carry Paints, being to deceive, cheat and over reach the Commonality of their Species, under a Pretence of Law, Ju≈øtice, good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great pretended Zeal of Loyalty, &amp;c. They were therefore obliged to follow their old beaten Road of Politics, and by their Influence, cau≈øed to be indicted as Rioters, every of the mo≈øt bold, ≈øpirited and leading Men, who were active in defending either their Country or them≈øelves, again≈øt their mo≈øt egregious and intreiguing Wiles; hopeing to make ≈øuch an Example of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as to frighten the Re≈øt into their de≈øpotic Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures.‚ÄîThe Inhabitants in general viewing this to be their Policy, guarded again≈øt it, and were active in defending them≈øelves, their Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ≈øo indicted, being fully per≈øwaded that the

And as for the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, and ≈øuch part of the Authority and People as they could Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they were active, endeavouring by all and every Method to apprehend the Rioters (≈øo called) and puni≈øh them as Criminals: The Struggles that en≈øued between the Parties relative to taking and defending Rioters, terminated in Wrath, Strife, and Ill-Will: The Con≈øequences ari≈øing therefrom, (which are too prolix to be in≈øerted) are very ingeniou≈øly ≈øummed up in the≈øe Words, "Where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and every Evil Work."

                  <p>"WHEN we con≈øider the numberle≈øs Troubles,

The tyrannical Mea≈øures they take to en≈ølave us, (we hope) will not fail to ju≈øtify us in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments and Re≈øolves thereon; for we think it an intolerable Hard≈øhip, and Piece of inhuman Cruelty, that we cannot be ≈øaid to give ≈øufficient Proof of our Loyalty and Obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but at the Re≈øignation of our whole Fortunes, in the Purcha≈øe and Improvement of which, we have ≈øuffered an Infinity of Hard≈øhips. Yet, at the ≈øame Time, impre≈ø≈øed with a Sen≈øe of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we return our thankful Acknowledgment to the≈øe worthy Gentlemen, Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> and ≈øundry of His Maje≈øty's honorable Council, for the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> for their ≈øignal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to us in ≈øome Time pa≈øt; which has, in ≈øome Degree, alleviated and ≈øupported us, under our heavy Troubles and Oppre≈ø≈øions.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013102_0015_0F8EBBECDA97D0C8"/>are ≈øcarce any Circum≈øtances that entirely exclude Hope; therefore we are not yet in total Di≈øpair: For this Moment we happily call to Mind, that the General A≈ø≈øembly of the ≈øame Province, about two Years ago, did annex all that Part of the <hi>Bay</hi> Province, We≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to that UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMITED County of <hi>Albany;</hi> but their avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grappling not being of a ≈øufficient Strength for ≈øuch an unrea≈øonable Burthen, it failed, by which they lo≈øt their ideal Booty.</p>
                  <p>"THE candid Reader will doubtle≈øs ob≈øerve, that in the Re≈øolves of the A≈ø≈øembly afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid, there is not a ≈øingle Word mentioned in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Title of the Land conte≈øted for, but that they level all their Spleen, and point all their Malice at notorious Rioters, as they call them, and make a pretended Shew and Figure, as though they were great Sticklers for good Order and Government; although at the ≈øame Time every Per≈øon of common Sen≈øe, who has had any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Knowledge of the Controver≈øy, ab≈øolutely knows, that our goodly Land, with the Labour thereon, is the only ≈øubject Matter, and grand Object of the whole Controver≈øy; and give the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> but that, and the Matter would be accompli≈øhed to their eternal Satisfaction; and it is pre≈øumed the Words Riotous, Di≈øorderly, Licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grantees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Occupants, for the whole Cour≈øe of the ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Century.</p>

                  <p>"AND whereas the true State of our Grants hath been already laid before the worthy Lords of the Board of Trade and Plantation, and they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing con≈øidered, and wi≈øely deliberated upon its ≈øeveral Circum≈øtances, did on the Third Day of December, A.

                  <p>"We therefore humbly report to the ≈øaid General Committee of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, as our Opinion, 1. That as we ever have, ≈øo for the future we will remain loyal and dutiful Subjects,

                  <p n="2">"2, THAT as we purcha≈øed our Lands of One of his Maje≈øty's Governors, and on the good Faith of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain tho≈øe Grants, again≈øt all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, until his Maje≈øty's Royal Plea≈øure ≈øhall be known on the Premi≈øes.</p>
                  <p>"AND whereas we have never made any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Re≈øi≈øtance to Government, than the Law of Self-Pre≈øervation, which the Law of GOD and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyns on every intelligent, wi≈øe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding Being; we therefore are fully of the Opinion to re≈øolve,</p>

We therefore re≈øolve, That as a Country, we will ≈øtand by, and defend our Friends and Neighbours, ≈øo indicted, at the Expence of our Lives and Fortunes. And we would recommend it to the General A≈ø≈øembly of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> to wait the Determination of his Maje≈øty, relative to the Title of tho≈øe Lands, and de≈øi≈øt from taking us as Rioters, to prevent the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Con≈øequences that may re≈øult from ≈øuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>"AND Fourthly, and la≈øtly, Re≈øolved, That for the future, every nece≈ø≈øary Preparation be made, and that our Inhabitants hold them≈øelves in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈øs, at a Minute's Warning, to aid and defend ≈øuch Friends of our's, who, for their Merit to the great and general Cau≈øe, are fal≈øely denominated Rioters; but that we will not act any Thing, more or le≈øs, but on the Defen≈øive, and always encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age due Execution of Law, in civil Ca≈øes, and al≈øo in criminal Pro≈øecutions, that are ≈øo indeed; and that we will a≈ø≈øi≈øt, to the utmo≈øt of our Power, the Officers appointed for that Purpo≈øe.</p>

And it has been too much the Ca≈øe with that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for a Number of de≈øigning Schemers, and Land-Jockeys, to rule the ≈øame. Let us take a View of their former narrow and circum≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Boundaries, and how, by Legerdemain, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and Deceptions of one Sort or other, they have extended their Domain far and wide; they have wrangled with, and encroached on all their neighbouring Governments, and have u≈øed all Manner of Deceit and Fraud to accompli≈øh their De≈øigns: Their Tenants groan under their U≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Oppre≈ø≈øion; and they have gained, as well as merited the Di≈øapprobation and Abhorrence of their Neighbours, and the innocent Blood they have already ≈øhed, calls for Heaven's Vengeance on their guilty Heads; and if they ≈øhould come forth in arms again≈øt us, thou≈øands of their injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013102_0039_0F8EBC0634C62D78"/>and di≈ø≈øatisfied Neighbours in the ≈øeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, will join with us, to cut off, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate ≈øuch an execrable Race from the Face of the Earth!</p>
               <p>THIS Piece is not ≈øuppo≈øed to contain a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the new con≈øtructed Set of Laws afore≈øaid; for ≈øuch a large TWO-YEAR OLD, hath never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ≈øeen in America, it being of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and mon≈øtrous Birth; nor is it ≈øuppo≈øed to give the Legi≈ølators their full Characters: But ≈øo much, and a little more may ≈øuffice for the pre≈øent. To quote the Laws, and make Remarks thereon, would be Matter ≈øufficient for a Volume: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we will yet make ≈øome few ≈øhort Ob≈øervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1≈øt, NEGATIVELY, it is not a Law for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> in general, but,</p>

Therefore the Ca≈øe ≈øtands thus: If we oppo≈øe civil Officers, in taking Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of our Farms, we are, by the≈øe Laws, denominated Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons; or if we defend our Neighbours, who have been indicted Rioters, only for defending our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; we are likewi≈øe adjudged Felons. In fine, every Oppo≈øition to their monarchial Government is deemed Felony, and at the End of every ≈øuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there is the Word DEATH! And the ≈øame Laws further impower the re≈øpective Judges, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided any Per≈øons, to the Number of Three, or more, that ≈øhall oppo≈øe any Magi≈øtrate, or other civil Officer, and be not taken, that after a legal Warning of Seventy Days, if they do not come and yield them≈øelves up to certain Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Purpo≈øe of ≈øecuring them; then it ≈øhall be lawful for the Judges afore≈øaid, to award Execution of DEATH, the ≈øame as tho' he or they had been convicted or attainted before a proper Court of Judicature, &amp;c. The candid Reader will doubtle≈øs ob≈øerve, that the diabolical De≈øign of this Law, is to obtain Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, or to make the People that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them Out-Laws, and ≈øo kill them whenever they can catch them.</p>
               <p>THOSE bloody Law-Givers know we are nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated

               <p>"IT may be the Reader, not having ≈øeen the Law referred to in this Piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and ≈øpirited Conflict that hath ≈øub≈øi≈øted between the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> nor of the Progre≈ø≈øive, Arbitrary and Monopolizing di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court Party of the latter of tho≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; may be apt to imagine that the Spirit of this Writing is too ≈øevere, ina≈ømuch as it De≈øtines whoever pre≈øumes to take us as Felons or Rioters, to immediate Death; but let the Wi≈øe con≈øider the State of the Cau≈øe.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. MAY it be con≈øidered, that the Legi≈ølative Authority of the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> had no con≈øtitutional Right or Power to make ≈øuch Laws, and con≈øequently that they are Null and Void, from the Nature and Energy of the Engli≈øh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution; therefore as they merit no Place among the Laws of the Realm of Great-Britain, but are the arbitrary League and Combination of our bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mercile≈øs Enemies, who, to obtain our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, have inhumanly, barbarou≈øly, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly,

               <p>FROM hence follows a nece≈ø≈øary Inference, That ina≈ømuch as our Property, nay our Lives, cannot be protected (but manife≈øtly ≈øtruck at) by the highe≈øt Authority in the Province to which we at pre≈øent belong; therefore in the Interim, while his Maje≈øty is determining the Controver≈øy, and till he ≈øhall interpo≈øe his Royal Authory, and ≈øubject the Authority above≈øaid to their Duty, or re-annex the Di≈øtrict of di≈øputed Lands to the Province of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> or ≈øome Way in his great Wi≈ødom and Fatherly Clemency, put the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Settlers under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> on an equal Footing with our Brother Subjects in his Realm; we are under Nece≈ø≈øity of re≈øi≈øting, even unto Blood, every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon who may attempt to take us as Felons or Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as afore≈øaid; for in this Ca≈øe it is not re≈øi≈øting Law, but only oppo≈øing Force by Force; therefore ina≈ømuch as by the Oppre≈ø≈øions afore≈øaid, the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers are reduced to the di≈øagreeable State of Anarchy and Confu≈øion; in which State we hope for Wi≈ødom, Patience and Fortitude, till

               <p>"The Alteration of Juri≈ødiction in 1764 could not effect private Property: Surely his Maje≈øty by this Alteration, did not purpo≈øe to take away the per≈øonal Property of a large Number of his loyal Subjects, and transfer it to other Subjects; the Engli≈øh Con≈øtitution will by no Means admit of this, for the transferring or alienation of Property is a ≈øacred Prerogative of the true Owner.‚ÄîKings and Governors cannot intermeddle therewith.

               <p>"FURTHERMORE, in the Time of Sir Henry Moor's Admini≈øtration, his Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to lay the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> under ab≈øoluto Prohibition not to grant or patent any of the Lands antecedently granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013102_0061_0F8EBC1FF0367FB0"/>forbid the Government to di≈øturb or mole≈øt the Settlers. This rightly under≈øtood, amounts to a Supercedies over the Authority of Common Law, and ab≈øolutely controuls the Cognizance thereof. As to the particular Matters in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition ≈øet forth, or Matters lying before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty by Petition, the Import of the Prohibition mu≈øt needs be thus, Namely, that his Maje≈øty, by it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> that he has taken the Controver≈øy to him made known by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, under his Royal Con≈øideration, and that, after due Information and Evidence of the State of the Ca≈øe, determines to ≈øettle the Controver≈øy; con≈øequently forbids the Government taking Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance thereof; and Common Sen≈øe teaches us that under ≈øuch Prohibition, if a Judgment at Common Law be ≈øuppo≈øed to be valid, it would invalidate the Authority of the Crown, and ≈øubvert and overthrow the Authority of the Kingdom, as it would render the Prohibitions of the Crown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly impertinent. Therefore Common Law, in the Ca≈øe before us, is not cloathed with Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of this Ca≈øe, much le≈øs with Authority to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs us; con≈øequently every Party of Men that have with Officers or otherwi≈øe, come into the≈øe Parts to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs us, came in open Defiance and direct Oppo≈øition to his Maje≈øty's Orders and Authority: And tho' they ≈øtile us Rioters, for oppo≈øing them, and ≈øeek to catch and puni≈øh us as ≈øuch, yet in Reality, them≈øelves are the Rioters, the tumultuous, di≈øorderly, ≈øtimulating Faction, or, in fine, the Land-robbers; and every violent Act they have done to compa≈øs their De≈øigns, tho' ever
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013102_0062_0F8EBC2071A98810"/>≈øo much under Pretence of Law, is in Reality a Violation of Law, and an In≈øult on the Con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Authority of the Crown, as well as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us in Per≈øon, who have been great Sufferance by ≈øuch inhuman Exertions of pretended legality of Law.‚ÄîRight, and Wrong, are eternally the ≈øame to all Periods of Time, Places and Nations, and colouring a Crime with a ≈øpecious Pretence of Law, only adds to the Criminality of it; for it ≈øubverts the very De≈øign of Law, pro≈øtituting it to the vile≈øt Purpo≈øes. Can any Man, in the Exerci≈øe of Rea≈øon make him≈øelf believe that a Number of Attornies and other Gentlemen, with all their Tackle of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Compliments, and French Fine≈ø≈øe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their boa≈øted Legality of Law, that the≈øe Gentlemen have ju≈øt Right to the Lands Labours and Fortunes of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers?

               <p>"And Matters having come to this, that Ho≈øtility, Revenge and Hatred, had began to put on their bloody, murtherous, and vengful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems‚ÄîIn which propitious Hour, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy WILLIAM TRYON, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> Governor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York,</hi> ≈øent the ≈øaid Inhabitants a kind, lenient and generous Letter, which breathed forth

Your Excellency further informs us, that you Look on our late Proceedings with great Concern, viewing them as daring In≈øults to Government, a Violation
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013102_0070_0F8EBC26756AB2A8"/>of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to our Petition. We would with proper Submi≈ø≈øion, give your Excellency and Council, a ≈øhort Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Facts, with a few Reflections and Rea≈øons thereon. And,</p>
               <p>"FIRST, we would ob≈øerve, That our Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers your Excellency ≈øtiles Commi≈ø≈øioners, was not authorized to e≈øtabli≈øh, and compleat Articles of public Faith for their Con≈øtituents.

Such Locating we view as a manife≈øt Plan, and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013102_0071_0F8EBC274E8BFBD8"/>of invading our Property‚Äîthe ≈øame as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching round the City, portraits a Siege thereof.</p>
               <p>OUR People having Notice of Mr. <hi>Kockburn</hi>'s Intru≈øion on our Borders, rallied a ≈ømall Party, and pur≈øued, and overtook him and his Party, and in their Pur≈øuit, pa≈ø≈øed the Towns of <hi>Panton</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> near the Mouth of <hi>Otter Creek;</hi> di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Col. <hi>Reed</hi> of a Saw-Mill in ≈øaid <hi>Panton,</hi> which by Force, and without Colour, or even Pretence of Recour≈øe to Law, he had taken from the original Owners and Builders, more than three Years before, and did at that ≈øame Time extend his Force, Terrors and Threats into the Town of <hi>New-Haven;</hi> who, by the vicious and haughty Aid of Mr. <hi>Benzell,</hi> the fam'd Engineer, with a Number of A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, under their Command, ≈øo terrified the Inhabitants (which were about twelve in Number) that they left their Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and Farms to the Conquerers, and e≈øcaped with the Skin of their Teeth, although they had expended large Sums of Money in cutting Roads to, and ≈øettling in that new Country, as well as fatigued and laboured hard in cultivating their Farms: Col. <hi>Reed</hi> at the ≈øame Time, and with the ≈øame Force, did take Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of one Hundred and Thirty Saw-Logs, and fourteen Thou≈øand Feet of Pine Boards, which Boards were made in the ≈øame Mill, &amp; all lying thereby, all which he converted to his own U≈øe. Not long after, the original Proprietors of the ≈øaid Mill, did re-enter, and take Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion thereof, but was a ≈øecond Time attacked by Col. <hi>Reed</hi>'s Stewart, with a Number of armed Men, under his

               <p>BUT to return to <hi>Kockburn</hi> again. Cur Party having taken him as afore≈øaid, brought him to the Town of <hi>Ca≈øtleton,</hi> near <hi>South Bay,</hi> where being fir≈øt informed of your Excellency's Clemency as well as that of the honourable Council, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prayer of our Petition; and in Conformity to the Articles of Settlement agreed on, di≈ømi≈ø≈øed him on honourable Terms.</p>
               <p>THIS is a ≈øhort Narrative of Facts, for the Proof of which, ≈øufficient Affidavits can be educed,</p>
               <p>WE are apprehen≈øive your Excellency has been hitherto unacquainted with the≈øe Facts, and have therefore exhibited them in this Letter; although it appears ≈øtrange to us, according as your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's own Letter ≈øtates the Matter, that we ≈øhould be ≈øu≈øpected or taxed with violation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith, and that our di≈øingenuous and di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Violation thereof, hath nullified and made void the late amicable Settlement; for at the ≈øame Time your Excellency charges us with breach of Faith, and Settlement, the very Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of this Faith was not known on our Part, and con≈øequently could not have been complied with, the very Stipulation and Faith ≈øpoken of, did not then exi≈øt, for it mu≈øt be the Meeting of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013102_0073_0F8EBC296F6DA5B8"/>the Minds of the contracting Parties, which con≈øtitutes ≈øuch Faith and Agreement, and of Cour≈øe cannot be broken before its exi≈øtence.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Kockburn</hi>'s locating our Lands in the mean Time the Preliminaries of Public Faith were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was at lea≈øt as much a Breach of that Faith, as what we are charged with. Nay, according to our Conception of the Matter, more ≈øo; as he made the fir≈øt Movement towards the Inva≈øion of our Property.</p>
               <p>SOON after, our Me≈ø≈øengers returned from New-York, and read the Minutes of Council, and your Excellency's Letter of Compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to a large Auditory convened at Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for that purpo≈øe, compo≈øed of the Inhabitants of that Place, the adjacent Country, and ≈øundry re≈øpectable Gentlemen from the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; your Excellency's gracious, wi≈øe, and benevolent Propo≈øals for ≈øettling Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in our Part of the Province, were by tho≈øe pre≈øent, unanimou≈øly applauded, and conceded to; and all po≈ø≈øible public Te≈øtimonies of Honour and Re≈øpect, paid to your Excellency and Council, by ≈øundry Di≈øcharges of Cannon and ≈ømall Arms; your Excellency's Health, long Life, and Pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, as well as that of the honourable Council's, was the Toa≈øt; your Name commanded Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and E≈øteem, and your Excellency's Per≈øon in particular, became precious in our Eyes.</p>
               <p>AND, we do humbly a≈ø≈øure your Excellency we have no Di≈øpo≈øition of Alienation of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013102_0074_0F8EBC2A2ADCE680"/>towards you, or knowingly break any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Publick Faith.</p>
               <p>THERE are two Propo≈øitions, which are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Attention.</p>
               <p>"FIRSTLY; The Protection and maintaining our Property.</p>
               <p>AND, SECONDLY; to u≈øe the greate≈øt Care and Prudence, not to break the Articles of Publick Faith, or in≈øult Governmental Authority.</p>
               <p>THESE two Propo≈øitions, we mean ≈øtrictly and religiou≈øly to adhere to. And for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Knowledge of the Preliminaries and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Publick Faith and Tru≈øt, we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your Excellency and Council, that our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of tho≈øe Conditions on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> is, that they make no further ≈øettlements or Locations on our Lands, granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> until his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure be obtained, as to the validity of the Grants; although this was not ≈øo fully expre≈ø≈øed, yet we ≈øuppo≈øe it was implied in the Ab≈øtract of the Minutes of Council; if it was not, we pray, your Excellency and Council would undeceive us in that Particular, for if we are deceived in this, then, on this Hypothe≈øis, your Excellency and Council's lenient and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Di≈øpo≈øition towards Us, will not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (by us) be viewed as ≈øuch; for ≈øuch Locations and Settlements on our Lands, would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with Friend≈øhip, and a manife≈øt Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013102_0075_0F8EBC2B04EE0238"/>on our Property, which has all along been the Bone of Contention.</p>
               <p>THE la≈øt part of your Excellency's Letter to Us, contains a Requirement of our immediate A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance in repo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing Col. <hi>Reed</hi>'s Tenants of ≈øaid Tenements. As to this Particular, had your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency have known by what Means Col. <hi>Reed</hi> obtained Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of them Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, undoubtedly your Excellency would not have required our A≈ø≈øi≈øtance in repo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing him; or have viewed with Concern, our di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing him, as a daring In≈øult to Government: For the Ca≈øe right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under≈øtood, it appears, that his Conduct was a daring In≈øult to Government, and continued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation for more than three Years, of the Laws, Re≈øtrictions, Regulations, and OEconomy, both of God, and Man; a notorious Breach of the Tenth Command of the Decalogue, which ≈øays, <hi>"Thou ≈øhalt not covet, &amp;c."</hi> He coveting, did take the Saw-Mill-Logs, Boards, and al≈øo, the Lands, Labours, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, Farms, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. &amp;c. from the rightful Owners, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and fir≈øt Occupants thereof, without a proce≈øs at Law, as afore≈øaid, to their Exclu≈øion from the Premi≈øes more than three Years, all which Time He has been enriching Him≈øelf, by the improvement of their E≈øtates; and, ≈øhould we repo≈ø≈øe≈øs him of the Premi≈øes again, We ≈øhould become Co-Partners with Him, in his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. Such an Act we could not reconcile to our own Con≈øciences; it being a parently immoral, and mo≈øt flagrantly Cruel and Unju≈øt.</p>

               <p>AS the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> rely on their Charters from that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the predicate and ground of their Title to the Property of the Land in Conte≈øt; ≈øo, on the other Hand, the Claimants under <hi>New-York,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and ground their Title to the ≈øame Land on the Validity of their Patents from <hi>New-York:</hi> This brings the Point in I≈ø≈øue between the re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Claimants to this ≈øingle Que≈øtion, namely, <hi>Which of the ≈øaid Governments conveyed the Fee of the Land in Conte≈øt?</hi> For it is ≈øelf-evident both could not. And upon exploring the Controver≈øy, and animadverting on the Merits of the different Claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to ≈øtand the Te≈øt, and adjudged Valid, it will of Nece≈ø≈øity invalidate the other. In the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ≈øearching into the Merit of the re≈øpective Claims, it is nece≈ø≈øary to in≈øpect into the Validity of the Grant from King CHARLES to the Duke of York, from which Foundation only, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013102_0078_0F8EBC2FA48FF088"/>of <hi>New-York</hi> deduce their Right of patent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lands in conte≈øt; yet the Matter of Fact is, that neither the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> as ≈øuch, or any Individual therein, has ever had any Conveyance of any Land from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> nor doth any Landlord or Per≈øon whatever, in the Government hold the Fee or Property of their Land, by Virtue of any Conveyance from the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> but they hold the Fee of their Lands on a very different Footing, viz. by Conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that King CHARLES gave to his Brother James Duke of York, the Fee of the Lands We≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to the Head of <hi>Delaware Bay;</hi> and allowing the Fee to be ≈øtill ve≈øted in him, his Heirs or A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns, upon this Hypothe≈øis no Per≈øon in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> hath the Fee or Property of the Land they po≈ø≈øe≈øs, the Fee remaining the Property of the Duke of York, his Heirs or A≈ø≈øigns. And further, upon the ≈øame Principle, tho≈øe identical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents under the Seal of <hi>New-York,</hi> which were laid on the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, are in their own Nature, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually null and void, with all other Conveyances of Land in the ≈øaid Province which have been given by the Crown, the Fee thereof being ve≈øted in the Duke of York, &amp;c. So that the Grantees under <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> are both, upon this Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ca≈øe, equally de≈øtitute of the Fee of the Land conte≈øted for: But, upon this Stating, the Grantees under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> have the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Settlement, and Ocoupation, and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on their Side; which is abundantly ≈øufficient to give the Priority, and Preference of Title to them, ≈øo that neither the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> or
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013102_0079_0F8EBC30A4686B58"/>their Patentees, gain any Thing by building their Title on the ≈øaid Grant to the Duke of York‚Äîfor if there be any Thing in it, it defeats their own Title as well as that of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> proving too much for their Purpo≈øe, or nothing at all: But, if the Lands contained in the Duke of York's Grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted back to the Crown, then the Duke of York's Patent became extinct, null, and ab≈øolutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the ≈øaid Rever≈øion happened in Con≈øequence of the ≈øaid Duke's abdicating the Throne‚Äîturning Papi≈øt, or by any formal Surrendery, or by any Means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, provided the Fee became reve≈øted in the Crown, then the ≈øaid Charter became extinct, as afore≈øaid: ≈øo that whether the Fee of the Land in Di≈øpute ≈øtill remains in the ≈øaid Duke of York, his Heirs or A≈ø≈øigns, or reverted, or was ≈øurrendered to the Crown, none of all this will in the lea≈øt ju≈øtify the Government of New-York or its Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, in founding their Preten≈øions of Title to the Lands afore≈øaid, by Virtue of the afore≈øaid Grant from King Charles to the Duke of York. For, take the Argument one Way, and it overturns both the Title of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> al≈øo, leaving the latter in Occupation and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the di≈øputed Premi≈øes, and that only, being intirely de≈øtitute of the Fee; and the <hi>New-York</hi> Claimants de≈øtitute of the lea≈øt Colour of Title what≈øoever. But, take the Argument the other Way, viz. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Fee of the Lands afore≈øaid reverted and been reve≈øted in the Crown, then the ≈øaid Lands at the Time of fir≈øt granting were crown Lands the ≈øame as though the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had never exi≈øted: But the Truth of the matter undoubtedly
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013102_0080_0F8EBC310D688690"/>is this, the under Proprietors all except William Penn, who had the ≈øeveral Countries parcelled out to them by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Grant; ≈øurrendered their Charters to the Crown, whereby <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jer≈øey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came royal Governments: This then being the State of the Ca≈øe, the Lands in Di≈øpute became Crown Lands, and the Governor of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> as well as <hi>New-York</hi> Crown Officers, or King's Agents, and it is of no Con≈øequence to the King which of his Governors, grants his Land, if ≈øo be they be granted to, and ≈øettled by loyal and indu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Subjects, thereby adding to the Revenue of the Crown and enlarging and ≈øtrengthening the Kingdom: This being pre≈øuppo≈øed, and admit for ≈øuppo≈øition only, that the Governor <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> exceeded his proper Limits in crown Lands, mu≈øt the Grantees who have ≈øettled tho≈øe Lands, paid one of the crown Officers for granting the ≈øame, and expended their ALL, in ≈øettling and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating his Maje≈øty's Wilderne≈øs Land, and who are truly loyal Subjects, be turn'd off the ≈øaid Land by Thou≈øands, and reduced to ≈øtarving Poverty, together with their numerous Families, becau≈øe one of the crown Officers either ignorantly or de≈øignedly impo≈øed upon the People by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crown Lands over his Bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more ≈øo as it cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed that the Subjects are capable Judges of the Juri≈ødiction of Governments and con≈øequently there ≈øhould be the greate≈øt care taken to guard the Subject from injury in all Ca≈øes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Truth of which will more fully appear by the following Con≈øiderations, viz. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013102_0081_0F8EBC31B34E1820"/>the ≈øuppo≈øed Error in granting the ≈øaid Lands, yet the great End of the Crown in granting of it is compleatly an≈øwered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Subjects i. e. the Settlers are quieted in the Fee and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the ≈øaid Lands, they will not be injured, ≈øo that upon this Hypothe≈øis, neither King nor Subject would ≈øu≈øtain Damage: Indeed no Per≈øon in the Realm could have ju≈øt Cau≈øe of Complaint. True, the re≈øpective Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>New-York</hi> may in≈øinuate, that upon this ≈øtate of the Ca≈øe, the Governor of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> has cheated them out of their Fees for granting the ≈øaid Land‚Äîthough it is evident, if Crown Officers are faithful to the King and Subjects, they could take no more Money for granting Crown Lands, than a rea≈øonable Compen≈øation for their Trouble, and the other Governor's being ≈øuppo≈øed to grant the Lands, ≈øaves the ≈øaid Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> the trouble; ≈øo that the Argument is brought to this ≈øingle Point only at la≈øt, that upon Suppo≈øition the Governor of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> exceeded his proper Limits in granting tho≈øe Lands, yet neither King nor Subjects are injured, (provided the Claimants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> hold the Fee of the ≈øaid Land as above) except the Governors of New-York, and if they be ≈øuppo≈øed to be hone≈øt Men, the Trouble of granting the Land would be equal to their Fees had they granted it; ≈øo that they have not been injured a Whit more in this Ca≈øe, than they may be ≈øuppo≈øed to have injured the Subjects by taking exorbitant Fees for granting the ≈øame Lands; which to them is no Injury at all, but a providential Check to the Excerci≈øe of their Avarice. So that the re≈øpective Governors of <hi>New-York,</hi> in an equitable Sen≈øe, are no Loo≈øers in
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013102_0082_0F8EBAC9ABEE4AC8"/>this Affair; or at mo≈øt the Privileges would be ≈øo very incon≈øiderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, e≈øpecially when ≈øet in Competition with the ≈øhocking and univer≈øal De≈øtruction that would over≈øpread a large Country of his Maje≈øty's good Subjects, provided they be di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Lands afore≈øaid. This ≈øeems to be the genuine Sequel of the Argument, even upon the Yorker's own Stating it.</p>

               <p>IT is not conceeded to on the Part of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> that the Governor did in Fact exceed his proper Limits in granting tho≈øe Lands, the contrary will abundatly appear from the following Con≈øiderations, viz. Before and at the Time the ≈øaid Governor of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> granted tho≈øe Lands they were reputed to be within his Juri≈ødiction, this was the Opinion of both Learned and Unlearned, the Wi≈øe as well as Simple, thus it was univer≈øally planed in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Maps down to the Year 1764, when, by royal Determination, the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> was extended over this di≈øputed Di≈øtrict of Land: But the general Opinion before this royal Adjudication was that the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> extended its Juri≈ødiction but Twenty Miles to the Ea≈øtward from <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River, ≈øo general was this Opinion that the be≈øt Maps of the two re≈øpective Provinces, and the Hi≈øtory of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> adopted it as ≈øettled; it is of very great weight in the Que≈øtion to ≈øhew how unive≈øal this Maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate Geographer Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> in his Map compo≈øed ≈øo
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013102_0083_0F8EBC3369E6E9D8"/>late as the Year 1755, which with great Propriety and Certainty a≈øcertains the ≈øame Limits, this Map has the more Authority as it was according to the Certificate of Mr. Pownal, Secretary to the Board of Trade, and was undertaken with the Approbation and at the Reque≈øt of the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners for Trade and Plantation, and is chiefly compo≈øed from Draughts, Charts, and actual Serveys of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of His Maje≈øty's Colonies and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in America, great Part of which have been ≈øince taken by their Lord≈øhips Orders and tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Office of the Governors of ≈øaid Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: This Twenty Mile Line was ≈øo far from being deemed unfavourable to <hi>New-York,</hi> that we find the Commi≈ø≈øioners from that Province ≈øo late as the Year 1767, made an Offer to tho≈øe of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay to let a Line at Twenty Miles di≈øtance Ea≈øt of <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River be the Divi≈øion between their re≈øpective Provinces, which the latter Commi≈ø≈øioners would not then agree to it, being Thought by them too much in Favour of <hi>New-York,</hi> ≈øo little it ≈øeems did <hi>New-York</hi> Commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conceive their Claim as far as <hi>Connecticut</hi> River could be ≈øupported.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it is true in the Year 1771 the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> by a publick Act of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral A≈ø≈øembly, did annex all that Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay, to the We≈øtward from <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to their County of <hi>Albany;</hi> and it is likewi≈øe true that in the Year 1773 the Governor's of the re≈øpective Provinces met at <hi>Hart≈øord</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> and came to a mutual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to ≈øettle that Line at Twenty Miles di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013102_0084_0F8EBC378A0EA178"/>Ea≈øtward from <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River, which was the Hypothe≈øis of that Settlement, which hath ≈øince been ratified by His Maje≈øty.</p>
               <p>THE Report of the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners for Plantation Affairs in 1753, States the following Facts, from which is nece≈ø≈øarily inferred that <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> extended its Juri≈ødiction to the We≈øtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.‚Äî"There are, ≈øays their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips, about 60,000 Acres of Land ≈øituate on the We≈øt ≈øide of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which was purcha≈øed by private Per≈øons from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to whom the Land had been laid out, by the Government of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay</hi> as an equivalent for two or three Town≈øhips which the Latter purcha≈øed from the Former, this Tract of Land by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Boundary Line between the Provinces of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> and the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay</hi> in 1739 is become a Part of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire."</hi>‚ÄîThus we have their Lord≈øhips Sentiments that the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> extended over Part of the very Lands in Conte≈øt, We≈øtward of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi> River, as long ago as the Year 1739, at which Time <hi>New-York</hi> never dreamed of extending their Claim to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.‚ÄîThere is another glaring and indi≈øputable evidence of the former We≈øtern extent of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> viz. Relative to Fort Dummer which was Built by the Bay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in 1724, and garri≈øoned at their Expence a great Number of Years; but upon its being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from their Juri≈ødiction by the Settlement of the juri≈ødictional Line, between them and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> in 1739, the <hi>Bay</hi> Province repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to the Government at Home, that the ≈øaid
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013102_0085_0F8EBC3863469BF0"/>Di≈øtrict of Land and Fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> having been determined to be the Property of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> they were no longer obliged to Garri≈øon and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and praying, That as it was nece≈ø≈øary to the Defence of the Country, that <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> might be directed to ≈øupport it. In Con≈øequence of which, an Order pa≈ø≈øed the King and Council in 1744, that the Governor and Commander in Chief of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> ≈øhould forthwith move the A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, in His Maje≈øty's Name, to make a proper Provi≈øion for that Service; and at the ≈øame Time informing them that in Ca≈øe they refu≈øed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ≈øo rea≈øonable and nece≈ø≈øary a Propo≈øal, his Maje≈øty would find him≈øelf under a Nece≈ø≈øity of re≈øtoring that Fort, with a proper Di≈øtrict of Land contiguous thereto, to the Province of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chu≈øett's-Bay,</hi> who cannot with Ju≈øtice be required to maintain a Fort no longer within their Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In con≈øequence of this, <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> did maintain this Fort, and paid a Demand of Arrears for its Maintainance, to the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øett's-Bay.</hi> In the mean Time <hi>New-York</hi> was never a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor for the Burthen, willing as ≈øhe is to enjoy the Advantage of granting and engro≈ø≈øing the ≈øaid Lands.</p>
               <p>THIS being the Ca≈øe, the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> by the Royal Decree, was obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> and it being on the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticnt</hi> River, and on this very identical Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Land now in Di≈øpute, can that Government be ju≈øtly charged with granting Lands in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York,</hi> when but a little before his Maje≈øty in Council had adjudged the ≈øame Lands to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013102_0086_0F8EBAC9689A12D0"/>be in the ≈øaid Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> and ordered them to defend it, as by maintaining Fort Dummer, &amp;c. Surely at that Time <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> did extend its Juri≈ødiction We≈øtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; otherwi≈øe the King had ordered the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York to have maintained Fort Dummer. Nothing can be more flagrantly evident, than, that the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> had a Right to Grant Crown Lands where the Crown compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Defend. From Hence it appears, that the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> had a legal Right to grant the Lands now in Di≈øpute, and that, that Government and his Maje≈øty's good Subjects, the Grantees of, and Settlers on the ≈øaid Lands, acted upon hone≈øt and honourable Principles, in granting purcha≈øing, and ≈øettling the ≈øame, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, it appears, that the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> in re-granting the ≈øame Land, acted quite the rever≈øe; and the more unpardonably ≈øo, as they granted great Part of it, in open Defiance to His Maje≈øty's Authority manife≈øted unto them by his expre≈øs Prohibition, dated the 24th Day of July 1767.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been already elucidated it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Line of Juri≈ødiction between the re≈øpective Provinces was not exactly a≈øcertained till the 20th of July 1764; but neverthele≈øs that the Admini≈øtration of Great-Britain had adjudged in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> extended We≈øtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and that this was the general Sen≈øe of the Nation (till a≈øcertained as afore≈øaid) is real Matter of Fact.‚ÄîTrue no Determination of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013102_0087_0F8EBC38780362D0"/>His Maje≈øty or Reports of the Lords of Trade had before particularized how far the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> ≈øhould extend We≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River: but ≈øuch Determinations of their's mightily ≈øtrengthened the common Opinion, nay, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, that that Government extended We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a twenty Miles Di≈øtance, Ea≈øt from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s River; inter≈øecting a parrallel Line with the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and the Province of the <hi>Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øett's Bay,</hi> between them and ≈øaid Province of <hi>New-York.</hi> This was the Opinion both of King and Subjects at the Time the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> granted tho≈øe Lands; and Americans could not conceive of any intermediate Boundary in one Place more than another, between <hi>Connecticut</hi> River and the twenty-mile Limit afore≈øaid; nor had they any Apprehen≈øion that the Government of <hi>New Hamp≈øhire</hi> would extend to the We≈øtward of that Limit. This parrallel Line took univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal and deep Impre≈ø≈øion on the Minds of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, and was the Under≈øtanding of the Briti≈øh Empire, and was thus portrayed in all former Maps.‚ÄîThe Certainty of this general Opinion may be further illu≈øtrated from the Con≈øideration that none of the Briti≈øh Subjects applied to the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> for Grants of tho≈øe Lands, till after the Alteration of Juri≈ødiction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <hi>New-York</hi> Scriblers, that their Government extended Patents from within the ≈øaid twenty mile Line a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro≈øs the ≈øame, and on ≈øome Part of the Premi≈øes in Di≈øpute, many Years before the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> granted tho≈øe Lands‚Äîwhich will
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013102_0088_0F8EBC399740D1E0"/>be hereafter con≈øidered: But, would further add, it is Matter of Di≈øpute whether the Admini≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Home would recognize tho≈øe Patents grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes afore≈øaid; though antecedent to tho≈øe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> ina≈ømuch as the Royal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> to grant them Lands, which by Royal Adjudication of the Line of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction between <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> and <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> fell within the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> in 1739, as afore≈øaid. However, for Argument only, we will ≈øuppo≈øe the Governments of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> and <hi>New-York</hi> had each of them equal Authority to grant tho≈øe Lands‚Äîthen on this Stating the Ca≈øe, prior granting would of Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be Priority of Title. The fir≈øt Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, upon this Hypothe≈øis, being good and valid both in Law and Equity, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily defeat any ≈øub≈øequent Grant from the Crown or its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatives, being as authentic, to all Intents and Purpo≈øes, as any Conveyance of the Fee of Land from the Crown can po≈ø≈øibly be.‚ÄîThus it appears upon this mo≈øt favourable Conce≈ø≈øion to tho≈øe on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates in Favour of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> as their Grants are prior to tho≈øe of <hi>New-York,</hi> (except in the In≈øtances of the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, yet to be con≈øidered.)</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the expre≈øs Words of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, that the Grantees were not only intitled to the Fee of the Lands
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013102_0089_0F8EBC39FB7B7290"/>therein di≈øcribed, but al≈øo to all the Enfranchi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and each and every of the Privileges and Immunities that by Law his Maje≈øty's Subjects in the Province of <hi>New Hamp≈øhire</hi> enjoy; ≈øo that at the ≈øame Time that the Grantees were ve≈øted with the Fee of the Land, they were enfranchi≈øed with, and entitled to, all the Privileges and Immunities contained in their Charters; as the holding of Fairs, choo≈øing Town Officers, and making and mending their own Roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it ≈øhould be the future Plea≈øure of his Maje≈øty, to continue the ≈øaid Lands in the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> (which by the Settlers afore≈øaid is hoped will not be the Ca≈øe) that the Claimants and Settlers under the ≈øaid Grants, will neverthele≈øs have his Maje≈øty's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Approbation to enjoy without Let or Mole≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Privileges of Incorporation therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the Grantees having ever con≈øidered tho≈øe Privileges as in≈øeperably connected with the Grant of the Fee-Simple.</p>

               <p>FROM the Facts and Rea≈øons that have been advanced in the foregoing Sections, it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly appears, that the Title of the Claimants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> to the Lands in Que≈øtion is indefea≈øible; yet ≈øtill there are ≈øundry Con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may ≈øerve more abundantly to confirm and e≈øtabli≈øh this Title beyond He≈øitation. As,</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, The far greate≈øt Part of the Extent
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013102_0090_0F8EBC3ADB1DD178"/>of Juri≈ødiction of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and great Part of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> depended entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure, being wholly in the Arbitration of the Crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real Grant on which the original Circumference of the Government of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> was founded, extended but Sixty Miles from the Sea into the Country, to the We≈øtward, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating about Twenty Miles Ea≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. This Government was afterwards enlarged by his Maje≈øty's Commi≈ø≈øion to <hi>Benning Wentworth,</hi> 
                  <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> Governor of that Province, directing it to extend to the We≈øtward until it ≈øhould meet with his Maje≈øty's other Governments. Which Clau≈øe of We≈øtern Extention, in the ≈øaid Commi≈ø≈øion, as well as the Royal Adjudication of the boundary Line between this Government and the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetts-Bay</hi> in 1739, and Report of the Lords of Trade in 1755, and many Arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing Sections, all, on the Part of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> amount to ≈øufficient Evidence, that their Government extended ≈øo far We≈øt as to inter≈øect the parrallel Line of the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> and Province of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> as argued above. And with re≈øpect to the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> it's original Northen Circumference terminated South of the City of Albany, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as Plantations were extended Northerly, either on Patents procured immediately from the Crown, or Government, or meer Settlements on Extra-provincial Lands, Commi≈ø≈øions from the King, to the re≈øpective Governors were enlarged, as in the Example following, viz. A. M. <abbr>E≈øq.</abbr>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:013102_0091_0F8EBC3B75DCE508"/>Captain General, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> (then follows the Enlargement,) and the Territories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereon in America.‚ÄîThe≈øe Territories are that Exten≈øion of Juri≈ødiction beyond their fir≈øt circum≈øcribed Limits, terminating South of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> called the Province. This territorial Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Juri≈ødiction is altogether in the Arbitration of the Crown to curtail or extend as before repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented. This being the Ca≈øe, the re≈øpective Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors can no other Way be Judges of the Extent of their Juri≈ødiction, but by Directions given them in their Commi≈ø≈øions, together with his Maje≈øty's expre≈øs Proclamations, and public Determinations relative thereto, as in the In≈øtance of the Royal Adjudication in 1764; a Publication of which, by his Maje≈øty's Order, gave his Subjects to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that it was his Plea≈øure that the Territorial Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> ≈øhould extend to the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which includes the di≈øputed Premi≈øes within that Government; before this it was impo≈ø≈øible for the Subjects to know it; if they could have under≈øtood it without his Maje≈øty's Proclamation certifying the ≈øame, ≈øuch Proclamation would have been needle≈øs and impertinent. The Truth of the Matter is, his Maje≈øty in 1739, determined <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ≈øhould cover the pre≈øent di≈øputed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes; he altered his Determination in 1764, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>New-York</hi> extended it's Territories over the ≈øame Land. And the King has an undoubted Right to alter and regulate the Juri≈ødiction of Royal Governments as may ≈øeem to Him mete;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013102_0092_0F8EBC3CAA2C2480"/>and for the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> to pretend to amu≈øe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of common Sen≈øe, pretending that it is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and indi≈øputable Right of the Colony of <hi>New-York</hi> to extend to the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, as it's ea≈øtern Boundary, is the very Height of Folly: It was in the Nature of Things ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible his Maje≈øty him≈øelf ≈øhould have known that to have been the Ca≈øe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before he determined it, and equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent that the Subjects ≈øhould know it before his Maje≈øty proclaimed it.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the Repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was laid before his Maje≈øty by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Governor <hi>Colden,</hi> as an Inducement to prefix the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, the ea≈øtern Boundary of the Province of <hi>New-York</hi>‚ÄîThat they were Arguments of Conveniency, holding up to View that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants on the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, to be under the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York;</hi> which Arguments are incompatible with the Idea of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Right of Juri≈ødiction. Likewi≈øe, from hence we may ≈øee the Incon≈øi≈øtency of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or it's Patentees, in founding their Right in Fee to All or any Part of the Lands in Conte≈øt, by Virtue of the ≈øaid Royal Adjudication of the Boundary Line on the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; ina≈ømuch as it cannot operate to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage antecedent to the Date of that Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterward cannot be con≈øidered any Thing more than a mere Line of Juri≈ødiction between the re≈øpective Governments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:013102_0093_0F8EBC3D28A5EA10"/>
IT ≈øhould be furthermore con≈øidered, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments were ve≈øted with the Fee of tho≈øe Lands; their Ca≈øe in this Re≈øpect, is quite the Rever≈øe to that of Proprietary Governments, who have a Right to appropriate the Soil. In Royal Governments, it is true, the Governors have a delegated Authority from his Maje≈øty to grant Crown Lands; and in ≈øuch Governments it is a Prerogative of the Crown to alter the Limits of Juri≈ødiction; His Maje≈øty hath a Right to re-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the di≈øputed Premi≈øes to his Province of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> (in which it formerly was, and on the Faith of which the Claimants under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purcha≈øed and ≈øettled the ≈øame Lands) or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate it into a new Government, or continue it under the pre≈øent Juri≈ødiction, as his Royal Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may di≈øcern to be be≈øt for the governed: But, upon ≈øuch Alterations of Juri≈ødiction, private Property is never changed or ≈øubverted. For, if the Property of the Subject be in the Arbitration of the Crown, and liable to the ≈øame Vici≈ø≈øitudes and Changes with Juri≈ødiction, this would de≈øtroy the very Nature of Property, and would render a King ab≈øolute, and de≈øpotic, which is perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent with the Con≈øtitution of the Kingdom.‚ÄîTherefore, to convey or alienate Property, is the ≈øacred Prerogative of the rightful OWNER.‚ÄîKings and Governors (in the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) cannot intermeddle therewith. There is indeed as much Difference between the Change of Juri≈ødiction, and transfering of the Property of the Subject, as there is between Light and Darkne≈øs; although ≈øince the ≈øaid Royal Adjudication in
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013102_0094_0F8EBC3E028AB220"/>1764, the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> have endeavoured to blend them together to an≈øwer ≈øini≈øter and lucrative Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes.‚ÄîThey were ≈øen≈øible, undoubtedly, that ≈øuch the afore≈øaid Arguments were conclu≈øive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their monopolizing the Fee-≈øimple of ≈øaid Lands; and as it is very common for People, who are upon a De≈øign of engro≈ø≈øing the Property of their Neighbour, to ≈øet up ≈øome ≈øpecious Pretence of Right to vindicate them≈øelves from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Di≈øhonor and Reproach; ≈øo in the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> endeavour to draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Duke of York over their Knavery, and under the feigned Character of Heirs to that apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Duke, claim the Lands afore≈øaid, and fancy them≈øelves the Owners of Towns, (Fields) and Hou≈øes that they builded not.</p>

                  <hi>New-York</hi> Arguments relative to their Title to tho≈øe Lands. Here,</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is nece≈ø≈øary the de≈øcriptive Limits of the above rehear≈øed Charter be brought under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration; which includes the Countries of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> adjoining <hi>New Scotland, Pemaquid,</hi> the River <hi>Kenebeque,</hi> and the I≈ølands known by the Names of <hi>Martin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</hi> &amp;c. All the≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lying far Ea≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and within the actual Juri≈ødiction of the Provinces of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay, New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> &amp;c. and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, not contended for on the Part of <hi>New-York.</hi> Their General A≈ø≈øembly, in the <q>State of the Right.</q> &amp;c. had done well to have informed the Publick; whether their "ancient and indi≈øput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right" of Juri≈ødiction extended to every Part of the di≈øcriptive Limits of the Grants afore≈øaid, and if not, to which Part it was circum≈øcribed; and when done, and by what Authority; whether their Governors Commi≈ø≈øions, at any Time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized and determined to what Part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ≈øaid Duke's Grant their Juri≈ødiction ≈øhould extend, more than another, or to the whole; or, whether any Royal Edict or Proclamation, had ever thus given them ≈øuch predicated Limits of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction: this is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary for them to do, in Support of their Title to the Lands in Que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And furthermore, it is requi≈øite for them to demon≈øtrate that tho≈øe Lands were actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ≈øuch their former Limits of Juri≈ødiction: but, if the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> from Royal Determination, cannot extend Juri≈ødiction to any
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013102_0100_0F8EBB3BC0EC2520"/>one Part of the de≈øcriptive Limits of the Grant afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid, more than to another; then, on this Hypothe≈øis, their Juri≈ødiction includes the whole Limits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Grant, or none at all; that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Whole, will not be pretended, and that any Part, as predicated on them Limits, cannot be made to appear: But on the contrary, it appears His Maje≈øty and Council had no Reference to any Part of the Limits of this Grant, in determining the Boundaries of the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York</hi> in 1764, as may appear from the Royal Order it≈øelf, an Extract of which is as follows: <q>His Maje≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Advice of his Privy Council, doth Order and Declare, That the We≈øt Banks of the River <hi>Connecticut,</hi> from where it enters the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> as far North, as the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, to be the Boundary between the ≈øaid two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</q>‚Äîthat Parrallel of Latitude is al≈øo e≈øtabli≈øhed it's North Boundary, &amp;c. The Source of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River is ≈øuppo≈øed to be ≈øomething to the Northward of Latitude Forty-Five, and comes much from the North-Ea≈øt, a con≈øiderable Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after it pa≈ø≈øes that Latitude; but it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Source of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River is far South of it; ≈øo that by comparing the de≈øcriptive Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, with tho≈øe expre≈ø≈øed in the Royal Order, they will be found to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different. The Limit of that Part of the Duke's Grant, which re≈øpects the pre≈øent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is in the Words following: <q>Together al≈øo with the ≈øaid River called <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, and all the Lands from the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:013102_0101_0F8EBB3C8C808020"/>to the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware Bay;</hi>
                  </q> which Limit in any po≈ø≈øible Con≈øtruction of it, can include but Part of the di≈øputed Premi≈øes, (which ≈øaid Premi≈øes extend and are bounded on the Forty-fifth Degree of North Latitude,) as will more fully appear in a further Di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of that Line. But,</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is manife≈øt that the King and Privy Council, in determining the Extent of the Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> did not proceed upon the Idea of that Government's having any antecedent Right of Juri≈ødiction to tho≈øe Lands. Had that been the Ca≈øe, the Royal Order had been predicated on the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Lines of the Duke's Grant afore≈øaid, and could not have comprehended any more Land than <q>from the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay;</q> and the≈øe Bounds are ≈øo loo≈øe, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impo≈ø≈øible to found a Line of Juri≈ødic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following Ob≈øervations on the di≈øcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits thereof, which may be ≈øeen at Large in the fore Part of this Section. Therefore, ≈øuch Part only, as is nece≈ø≈øary for the Con≈øideration of the indeterminate Bounds, before ≈øpoken of, is here quoted; which, after de≈øcribing the Situation of <hi>Long-I≈øland,</hi> and that it abuts upon the Main Land <q>between the two Rivers there called or known by the ≈øeveral Names of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River,</q> begins the Di≈øcription under Con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <q>together with the ≈øaid River called <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s River.</q> Ob≈øerve, that as the De≈øcription
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013102_0102_0F8EBB3D507C3AE8"/>of this River is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following Di≈øcriptions in ≈øaid Grant; nothing more can po≈ø≈øibly be included in it, but a Di≈øcription of the River only, exclu≈øive of one Foot of Land on either Side. The ≈øecond Di≈øcription <q>and all the Land from the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay.</q> The be≈øt Mathematician on Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a≈øcertain the≈øe Limits, except upon arbitrary Principles, as there can be no prefixed Place on <hi>Connecticut</hi> River where to erect the fir≈øt Bounds; and as to any particular Place on the <q>Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay,</q> where to erect a Second, is altogether undetermined in this Di≈øcription: But, ina≈ømuch as it includes all the Land from the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, &amp;c. there is a little better Foundation to e≈øtabli≈øh the fir≈øt Bounds than the Second. It ≈øeems in order to include All as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid, it would be nece≈ø≈øary to extend either to the Head of the River, or to the mo≈øt Northerly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the whole Stream, to make the fir≈øt Bounds; and provided this imaginary Bounds ≈øhould extend North of the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, it would ≈øo far exceed the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Line in 1764. Be this as it will, the mo≈øt Northerly Part of the River, which would mo≈øt likely be the Head, would be the mo≈øt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable on the Part of New-York, for to e≈øtabli≈øh a fir≈øt Bounds, and from thence to extend a ≈øtrait Line to ≈øome Place on the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay; this is ≈øomething of a natural Con≈øtruction, on the indeterminate de≈øcriptive Limits afore≈øaid, without exploring <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which in this
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013102_0103_0F8EBB3E0B426688"/>Ca≈øe is nece≈ø≈øary. And, Fir≈øt, in tracing ≈øaid River to its Source, it is found towards it's Extremity, to come much out of the North-Ea≈øt. This being the Ca≈øe, a ≈øtrait Line from it's Head to <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, would cro≈øs ≈øaid River and include a large Tract of Land on the Ea≈øt Side, and perhaps cro≈øs the River ≈øundry Times; the Con≈øequences may be drawn thus, that where the Line may be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to cro≈øs the la≈øt Time, ought to be the fir≈øt real North Boundary, of the <q>ancient and indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable</q> Limit of Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York.</hi> For, if the Bounds at the Head of the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øpoken of, be ≈øo e≈øtabli≈øhed, it would include con≈øiderable Land on the Ea≈øt Side of the River, within the old Boundary of New-York, which is contrary to any Idea to be gained from the di≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Limit afore≈øaid, viz. <q>and all the Land from the We≈øt Side of Connecticut River, &amp;c.</q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another propo≈øed fir≈øt Boundary better purporting with the Di≈øcription of <q>And all the Land from the We≈øt Side of Connecticut River to the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay,</q> between the Head of the River, and the Place where the imaginary Line was ≈øuppo≈øed to pa≈øs? To this it may be an≈øwered, that a Place between the≈øe two, ≈øo far up the River as in tracing a ≈øtrait Line from thence, to <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, would not cro≈øs the River, may better agree with the above Di≈øcription: Still, from none of the≈øe imagined Lines, from the different imagined Bounds, or from any other projected, po≈ø≈øible, fir≈øt Bounds, can ≈øuch a ≈øtrait Line be a≈øcertained, till the Place for the South-We≈øtern Boundary on the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013102_0104_0F8EBB3EAF0D9010"/>"Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay" be e≈øtabli≈øhed? And the Vaguene≈øs of the di≈øcriptive Limit is ≈øo great, that it cannot be determined whether that Bounds ≈øhall be at the Northern Extremity of the Ea≈øt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, or at the Southern, where it communicates with the main Ocean, or at any other intermediate Place between the≈øe two: ≈øo, that from the uncertainty of the ≈øecond Bounds, it is impo≈ø≈øible to e≈øtabli≈øh the fir≈øt, ≈øo as exactly to include "all the Land from the We≈øt Side of the ≈øaid River to the Ea≈øt Side of ≈øaid Bay," and no more. And,</p>
               <p>THUS it is demon≈øtrated from the Vaguene≈øs, Uncertainty and Ob≈øoletene≈øs of the di≈øcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Grant to the Duke of York, before quoted at large; that it is in the Nature of Things ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible to a≈øcertain it. From hence follows a Second nece≈ø≈øary inference, viz. That it is equally impo≈ø≈øible and contradictory, that governmental Juri≈ødiction ≈øhould be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain Juri≈ødiction, in its own Nature incapable to be determined, is in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty none at all. And from hence follows a Third Inference which determines the Sequel of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the Subject of Property, concerning the Lands in Que≈øtion, to be in Favour of the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire:</hi> For, it is in the la≈øt Place, equally contradictory and impo≈ø≈øible, as in the Ca≈øe of the Ab≈øurdity of a≈øcertaining the Limits of the pretended "ancient" Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> predicating it on vague and undeterminate Boundaries, that, that Government ≈øhould predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013102_0105_0F8EBB406BDB66D8"/>their Right to the Fee of Lands, by them thus una≈øcertainable; for as Uncertainty, and natural Impo≈ø≈øibility of a Juri≈ødiction's being rendered determinate makes it in Reality to be none at all; ≈øo the Idea of Property, predicated thereon is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually impertinent.‚ÄîTrue it is, by the royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in 1764, the Ea≈øt Line of <hi>New-York</hi> extended to the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. Which may be Foundation for Conjecture, that, that Limit might have Reference to a Di≈øcription in the Duke's Grant afore≈øaid, "and all the Lands from the We≈øt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River," &amp;c. Yet when the Repre≈øentation made by Lieut. Governor Colden, to his Maje≈øty in Council, as mentioned in this Pamphlet, under the Head of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, &amp;c. comes to be con≈øidered it will reflect Light on this Point. The Arguments made U≈øe of in the ≈øaid Repre≈øentation were tho≈øe of Conveniency and Advantage to the Settlers on tho≈øe Lands to be in the Government of New-York: And, that the We≈øt Banks of Connecticut River was a good and certain Boundary," &amp;c. The≈øe were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the preponderating Motives of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the We≈øt Banks of Connecticut River to be the Ea≈øt Boundary of New-York, and ≈øuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are utterly incon≈øi≈øtant with the Notion of an "Ancient indi≈øputable Right" of Juri≈ødiction.</p>
               <p>THERE is ≈øtill another Con≈øideration which may be of Moment in the Ob≈øervation of this, ≈øo Trumpt-up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the Province of New-York, to the Lands in Conte≈øt: If it be admitted a Line ≈øhould be drawn from the mo≈øt northerly Part of Connecticut River
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013102_0106_0F8EBB40EFF67140"/>to the mo≈øt northern Extremity of Delaware-Bay; ≈øtill, it is by no means probable ≈øuch Line would include more than one half (if ≈øo much) of the Lands in Di≈øpute ≈øo far as may be judged from the Latitude and Longitude of the re≈øpective Objects: For con≈øidering the Cour≈øe of Connecticut River, which is nearly from North to South, except to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Extremity; and the Sea coa≈øt, from the River's Mouth, together with Delaware Bay, forming al≈øo an indened Line, to the South of We≈øt; the Land included in the≈øe Limits, by a Line drawn from Connecticut River to Delaware Bay as afore≈øaid, would (excepting the ≈ømall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory formed by the Mouth of the Bay and the Ocean) lye in the Figure of an obtu≈øe angled Triangle; and the Cour≈øe of the ≈øaid Line from the River to the Bay, according to occular Survey, would be from the Northea≈øt a Southwe≈øterly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Which very badly comports with the pre≈øent North and We≈øterly Exerci≈øe of Juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government of New-York, at Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, Detroit, &amp;c.‚ÄîIt may here well be ob≈øerved, the Settlers under New-Hamp≈øhire ≈øeem to be in a critical Situation; every arbitrary Mea≈øure under the pre≈øent Admini≈øtration of the Government of New-York, is excerci≈øed again≈øt them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they flee to the Ea≈øtward to procure Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, there they are fore-clo≈øed, the di≈øcriptive Limits of the ≈øaid ancient Juri≈ødiction covers them (to wit) the Countries of St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard, &amp;c.‚ÄîYet there is another large unknown Country to the We≈øt and Northwe≈øt, which has been but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013102_0107_0F8EBB41C892D6E8"/>explored; and provided, the≈øe People, in≈øtead of fleeing to the Ea≈øtward, ≈øhould turn their Cour≈øe, to tho≈øe Countries; there, it is indi≈øputable but that, New-York would encircle them with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther odd Di≈øcription of Domain contained in their Governor's Commi≈ø≈øions, i. e. <q>A. B. Captain General Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of New-York,</q> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Di≈øcription hinted <q>and the Territories depending thereon, in America.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the foregoing Di≈øcriptions of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York, it appears they lay Claim to ≈øo exten≈øive a Domain three different Ways, or have three different Modes or Modifications in comprehending and engro≈ø≈øing their progre≈ø≈øive Limits. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1≈øtly. THE Province of New-York, which falls ≈øhort of, and terminates con≈øiderably South of the City of Albany.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. "THE Territories depending thereon in America." The≈øe Territories comprehending ≈øuch Plantations, on extra-provincial Land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the Province till its Territories, are at pre≈øent extended to Detroit and the Neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, and ina≈ømuch as the Grantees and Settlers on the Lands in Di≈øpute, hold their Title under New-Hamp≈øhire, and that Government had for ≈øeveral Years exerci≈øed their Juri≈ødiction over tho≈øe Lands,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013102_0108_0F8EBB4275649058"/>even till 1764.‚ÄîTherefore, in this Ca≈øe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of New-York could not extend their Territorial Sort of Juri≈ødiction over the Premi≈øes; for ≈øuch Sort of Juri≈ødiction might be challenged on the Part of New-Hamp≈øhire (if it ≈øhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited at that Time, ≈øaid Premi≈øes was extra-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Lands) and that with far the mo≈øt Propriety. Ina≈ømuch as that Government had granted the Land and began Settlements thereon. Add to this the following Clau≈øe in Governor Wentworth's Commi≈ø≈øion, which they viewed to be of great Weight in this Ca≈øe, which, after di≈øcribing the former Limits of New-Hamp≈øhire, <q>and from thence extending We≈øt till it meets with his Maje≈øty's other Governments.</q> Add to this al≈øo, the Rea≈øons held forth in the Chain of Arguments, contained in the three fir≈øt Sections; all which were too potent for the New-York territorial Sort of Dominion to fru≈øtrate. At that Juncture, Therefore, the Lawyers, Land-jobbers, Politicians, &amp;c. planed out the afore≈øaid third Modes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction predicating it on the di≈øcriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of York. And on this new modled Plan breathed an air of <q>ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT of</q> Juri≈ødiction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently to the Fee of the Lands in Conte≈øt.</p>
               <p>THE fir≈øt Intimation that ever ≈øaluted the Ears of the Publick, a≈ø≈øerting it to be the ancient Right of the Colony of New-York, to extend to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut River as its ea≈øtern Boundary, was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd from a Proclamation, given under the Hand of William Tryon, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> Governor of the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013102_0109_0F8EBB4693DC1370"/>Province of New-York, &amp;c. and dated the 11th Day of December, 1771. His Proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins after the following Manner. <q>Whereas it is the ancient and inconte≈øtible Right of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to extend to Connecticut River, as its Ea≈øtern Boundary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was drawing a po≈øitive Conclu≈øion from fictitious, and till that Time, unheard of Premi≈øes: and rather influenced People, in the ≈øeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to purcha≈øe and ≈øettle under New-Hamp≈øhire, than di≈øwade them therefrom, for common Fame, and common Sen≈øe were a Barrier again≈øt the Belief of this New-York Doctrine, which from the Time of the royal Adjudication in 1764, was by the Proclamation afore≈øaid, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to "Ancient." That this Doctrine till then, was inconte≈øted, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public Con≈øideration, and has ever ≈øince been conte≈øted.</p>
               <p>SHOULD this, their new Hypothe≈øis be admitted; yet, as hath been before ob≈øerved, the≈øe Limits could include but Part of ≈øaid Lands, according to the be≈øt Judgment that can be formed without an actual, and accurate Survey of the di≈øcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ≈øaid Grant; which if the New-Yorkers can do and fairly Demon≈øtrate, to any able Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, and competant and impartial Judges, that they have rightly a≈øcertaned tho≈øe Limits, it is engaged on the Part of the Claimants under New-Hamp≈øhire that they ≈øhall yield up, to the Land-jobbers of New-York, their Lands and Labours:
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013102_0110_0F8EBB4799F5F730"/>an Object which undoubtedly would be grateful and plea≈øing to them; and which they have many Years been in Pur≈øuit of, and have hitherto had the Mortification to be baffled. It is verily Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant on the Government of New-York, in order to found Tittle to tho≈øe Land on this new Scheme,</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, to a≈øcertain the Limits of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Bounds: This, the Claimants under New-Hamp≈øhire, will expect compleated, or hear no more of tho≈øe "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" Boundaries of New-York.</p>

               <p>THIS Deed of Sale at the Suit of the Grantees, with a Charter of Incorporation, was granted and confirmed by King CHARLES the Fir≈øt, the 4th Day of March 1629, wherein the Limits are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ≈øame with tho≈øe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Conveyance; and the Provi≈øo of CHARLES, that the actual Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Subjects of other Chri≈øtian States to determine the Extent, the ≈øame as was the Provi≈øo in JAMES'S Grant to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Company.</p>
               <p>THIS ≈øame Charter of Incorporation was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed void in the High Court of Chancery of <hi>England</hi> in 1684; from which the A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in their State, &amp;c.

               <p>THIS Charter, as above, being nullified in the High Court of Chancery of England in 1684, and re≈øtored again in 1691, wherein the We≈øt Extent of Limit is predicated by that of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and this We≈øt Limit of <hi>Connecticut</hi> being predicated by the old Charter of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly extending in Longitude to the South Sea on the We≈øt Part, exactly extends the pre≈øent Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> with it's Powers of Juri≈ødiction to All, and every Part of the Limits of the old nulled Charter. This is the natural and legal Sen≈øe of the pre≈øent Charter of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> predicated on undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Facts,</p>

IN the next Place 'tis nece≈ø≈øary to con≈øider the Charter of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which our Authors inform ≈øhould not extend We≈øt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, in the Words following: <q>This being a Crown Grant on the Suit and Petition of the Grantees, is to be taken mo≈øt beneficially for the King. The di≈øcriptive Words, and the Intention of the Grant, will in legal Con≈øtruction be ≈øatisfied by giving the Colony the ≈øame Length as the <hi>Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øetts Bay;</hi> and it is plain, both from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital and the ≈øaving Clau≈øe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, on which the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øett</hi>'s Title was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Latter cou'd not in any Sen≈øe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the We≈øtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.</q> As this their A≈ø≈øertion is founded on the Hypothe≈øis of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Charter's being predicated on that of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øett's,</hi> and therefore the Arguments before exhibited on that Head, are equally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øive for the e≈øtabli≈øhing the We≈øtern Extent of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> nothing more is nece≈ø≈øary for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, but a Recital of the di≈øcriptive Words of their Charter, granted ≈øub≈øequent to their Purcha≈øe from the Council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April, 1662, <q>Bounded on the Ea≈øt by <hi>Narragan≈øet</hi> River, commonly called <hi>Narragan≈øet</hi> Bay, where the ≈øaid River falleth into the Sea; and on the North by the Line of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Plantation; and on the South by the Sea, and in Longitude as the Line of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Colony, running from Ea≈øt to We≈øt: That is to ≈øay, from the ≈øaid <hi>Narragan≈øet</hi> Bay on the Ea≈øt, to the South Sea on the We≈øt Part.</q> Thus it appears not
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013102_0116_0F8EBB4B6C3D3DB8"/>only by the Demon≈øtrations afore≈øaid, but from the expre≈øs Words of the di≈øcriptive Limits of the Charter it≈øelf, which cannot admit of a double Meaning, (curious as our Authors be in the Art of playing with Words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal Meaning,) that it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtionable Right of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> to extend it's We≈øtern Boundary to the South Sea on the "We≈øt Part;" and in this that Colony agree, who are now challenging their Right in Fee to tho≈øe Limits, and actually making Plantation, as at <hi>Su≈øquebannah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BY this Time, undoubtedly Queries will ari≈øe in the Mind of the Reader, What will become of the Grant to the Duke of York, if the Ma≈ø≈øachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øett's and Connecticut Colonies extend "to the South Sea on the We≈øt Part?"

                  </gap>ourable this Conclu≈øion may be thought, on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> yet, as the Crown had prior to either of the Duke's Grants, di≈øpo≈øed of its Right to the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colonies‚Äîif it was not thus founded on Conque≈øt, it hath no Foundation at all; and it's having any Place for Exi≈øtence, is but an "Intru≈øion on the Rights" of tho≈øe other Colonies. Furthermore, it is My≈øterious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013102_0118_0F8EBB4FC98C6988"/>admitting that that Government was thus founded, to ≈øuppo≈øe the Duke could be Lord Proprietor; ina≈ømuch as by the Conditions of Capitulation, the Fee then acquired to the Crown, pa≈ø≈øed to the Dutch Inhabitants, who then became Engli≈øh Subjects.</p>
               <p>THE Reader is in the next Place invited to a more particular Con≈øideration of the afore≈øaid di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Premi≈øes, which are bounded South on the North Line of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> and We≈øt by a Line about twenty Miles Ea≈øt of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, extending North ten Degrees, Ea≈øt till it comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt oppo≈øite to <hi>Ticondaroga;</hi> thence We≈øt till it ≈øtrikes on <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> thence on the Ea≈øt Banks of ≈øaid Lake to the Forty fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, and on the North by the ≈øaid Latitude, and Ea≈øt on the We≈øt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. On this Tract of Country 'tis not pretended there ever was any ancient Dutch Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, nor any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Title from <hi>New-York,</hi> except on the We≈øt Part of the Town≈øhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> ≈øituate at the South-We≈øt Corner of this Tract; and ≈øome Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions in the Town≈øhip of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> on <hi>Otter Creek,</hi> which Colonel <hi>Reed</hi> gained and maintained by Force, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Years, and which by Force he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ≈øurrender to the fir≈øt Settlers, who were Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH this Tract of Land was contained in the original Grant to the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> yet, as they never made any Conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the Crown on the Surrender of that
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013102_0119_0F8EBB50B84E69D8"/>Grant, the 7th Day of June, 1635. From which it may be objected, on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the above Conci≈øene≈øs in the Circum≈øcription of the Boundaries of their Colony is too great; for, that the Grant to the Duke mu≈øt hold good where the Crown, at the Time of granting, was ve≈øted with a Right to the Lands granted. In An≈øwer, it has been argued in the preceeding Section, that it is very uncertain whether the Limits of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant included this Tract of Land, or if any, how great a Part; and that the Limits of ≈øaid Grant cou'd not be a≈øcertained‚Äîand that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Juri≈ødiction, and Property cou'd not be predicated on ≈øuch ob≈øolete and uncertain Bounds. It was al≈øo demon≈øtrated in the fir≈øt Section, and will be further ob≈øerved in this, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant reverted to the Crown, and that the Landholders in the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> hold under the Crown‚Äîand that, if it did not revert to the Crown, the Fee is ≈øtill in the Duke, his Heirs or A≈ø≈øigns, and no Landholders in the Government are ve≈øted with the Fee of the Lands they po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øs, &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">This Argument and Couclu≈øion is founded on the <hi>New-York</hi> Hypothe≈øis, exclu≈øive of the herein mention'd Article in the Dutch Capitulation.</note>. It would be too tedious as well as needle≈øs to recite the Arguments that have been offered in the three fir≈øt Sections, which is humbly conceived are abundantly ≈øu≈ø≈øicient to An≈øwer the afore≈øaid Objection, and fairly demon≈øtrate Priority of Title to be in Favour of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> to which the curteous Reader is referred for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration.</p>

As has been before ob≈øerved, the De≈øign of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant was to include the Dutch Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, or in other Words, that it never was valid any further than to ≈øuch Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which by Conque≈øt, reverted to the Crown, and no farther than the≈øe Limits, to interfere with the Charter Colonies of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> And as a Twenty Miles Line to the Ea≈øtward from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s River would include the mo≈øt Ea≈øtern Extent of the forementioned Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, the Rea≈øon why ≈øuch a Line was agreed to as the Boundary between the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-York:</hi> But, as the≈øe Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions to the Northward of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> fell far ≈øhort of this Twenty Mile Line, or were ≈øo incon≈øiderable and uncertain as not to come within the Capitulation Re≈øerve, therefore, the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chu≈øetts</hi> Colony contended with <hi>New-York</hi> for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther We≈øtern Extent than Twenty Miles Ea≈øt from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River; but the re≈øtle≈øs Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> ever unea≈øy within it's own Boundaries, pre≈øumed unrelenting, to intrude on, and conte≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ju≈øt Rights of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Patents far to the Ea≈øtward of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River; in Con≈øequence of which the greate≈øt Di≈øturbances have ari≈øen between the Inhabitants of the re≈øpective Colonies, and ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the Conflicts ≈øo ≈øevere, that human Blood ≈øpilt in the Conte≈øts redened the Hands of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders; but finally a boundary Line was agreed to by the re≈øpective Governments in 1773, at a Twenty Miles Di≈øtance from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, which has ≈øince been ratified by his Maje≈øty.</p>

IN the State of the Right, &amp;c.

               <p>OUR Authors, in Order to maintain their Claim to the Lands in Conte≈øt, and if po≈ø≈øible, to include it within One of the de≈øcriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> tell us many ≈øtrange Things about the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetts:</hi> That <hi>Connecticut.</hi> "in legal Con≈øtruction" ≈øhould not have extended to the We≈øtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that their Settlements We≈øt of that River were an Intru≈øion on the Right of the Colony of <hi>New-York;</hi> yet, neverthele≈øs for Peace ≈øake, and rather than conte≈øt with "a powerful Neighbour," they ≈øettled with that Colony at twenty Miles di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River.</p>
               <p>THEY further inform, that <q>the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Claim ≈øtands by no Means in ≈øo re≈øpectable a Light as that of <hi>Connecticut,</hi>
                  </q> and in legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, ≈øhould extend <q>no further We≈øtward than 'till it meets the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and not to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and much le≈øs to the We≈øtward of it.</q> Our Authors being Men of great Learning and Sagacity; ≈øoon extended their antient Right of Juri≈ødiction over ≈øuch Part of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Colony as lay to the We≈øtward from <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and this their Scheme in ≈øtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the We≈øtern Exten≈øion of that Colony where it meets <hi>Connecticut,</hi> may be reckoned as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greate≈øt of their political Atchievements. "And it is worthy a Remark," that had the <hi>Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Colony extended We≈øt to the South Sea,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:013102_0127_0F8EBB5786B4DBA0"/>it could not have met <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but mu≈øt have extended parallel with it, in the ≈øame Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To give this plea≈øing Scheme ≈øome Kind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they argue the Nullity of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> fir≈øt Charter, and introduce the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant as the olde≈øt Title, Page 5th, <q>The <hi>Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Charter was vacated, and the Title of that Colony now ≈øolely depends on their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 1691.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YET they allow, that that Colony obtained the Right of Soil from the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and that the Charter of King <hi>Charles</hi> dated the 4th Day of March 1628-9, <note n="*" place="bottom">This is the Charter ≈øpoken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of, in 1684.</note> ve≈øted them with Powers of Government, (it's needle≈øs to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert on the≈øe ≈øtrange Accounts) however, after they have charmed their Imaginations with the fruitle≈øs Idea of extending their antient Right to all that Part of the Bay Province We≈øt of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi> River, they complain bitterly of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts,</hi> Page 8th. <q>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Circum≈øtances ≈øo favourable to the Rights of this Colony, we have great Rea≈øon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the unwarrantable Encroachments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Authority of the Government of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay,</hi> by which a valuable Tract extending from <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, within Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, has been wre≈øted from us.</q>

                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:013102_0128_0F8EBB5831F87330"/>
                  <q>THEIR Conduct ≈øeems the more inexcu≈øable, as they mu≈øt have known that ≈øuch Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not only di≈øre≈øpectful to his Maje≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Authority, and big with great Mi≈øchiefs and Di≈øorders, but were highly injurious to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Property, great Part of the≈øe Lands having antiently been granted to his Maje≈øty's Subjects under the great Seal of this Colony.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEN they proceed to recite their old Grants, which they tell us <q>cover the Country the whole Breadth of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øett</hi>'s Claim:</q> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Ren≈øelaerwyck,</hi> granted in 1685, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 24 Miles each Side, from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River; and <hi>We≈øtonhook,</hi> in 1705, which extends about 30 Miles from <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River; and <hi>Hoo≈øick,</hi> in 1685, which extends about 30 Miles from the River. It ≈øeems to have been a political, and univer≈øal Principle with the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to begin their Patents within the Twenty Mile Line, and extend them Ea≈øtward of it, that by this Means they might have Opportunity to encroach on, and jockey their neighbouring Colonies, more or le≈øs, out of their Lands, as ≈øub≈øequent Policy, Intrigue and Power, would render practicable.</p>
               <p>THAT Government, thus extended their Patent into <hi>Connecticut,</hi> One in particular, into the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of <hi>Sali≈øbury;</hi> and it has ever been their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to wrangle till they find by Experience, that neither by Sophi≈øtry, Law, or Ho≈øtility, they can maintain their exorbitant Claims, and then capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on as good Terms as they can; and conclude
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:013102_0129_0F8EBB58EA985BA0"/>with branding their Competitors with Di≈øhone≈øty, Encroachment and many hard Names, and don't ≈øcruple to impeach their Governmental Authority, (as in the Ca≈øe ju≈øt recited of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay) with being Di≈øre≈øpectful to his Maje≈øty's Authority, and guilty of great Mi≈øchiefs and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; although the Authority of their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by their unju≈øt, avaricious Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> even to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, laid the Foundation of tho≈øe Di≈øorders, and they might have added Blood-≈øhed; yet their A≈ø≈øembly have the Impudence to Palm it all upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts.</p>
               <p>THE Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> are ≈øo happy as to be almo≈øt exempted from any <hi>New-York</hi> Claims, by Patents from that Government prior to their's; the afore≈øaid <hi>Hoo≈øick</hi> and <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> Patents being the only ones of this Nature, the former includes about one Qaurter of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> on which Part were about four Settlers, when it was granted by <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire.</hi> This Town≈øhip is bounded Southerly by the North Line of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay,</hi> and extends We≈øt as far as the <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> Colonies; the latter, i. e. <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> Patent, was granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the common Seal of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> the 15th Day of June, 1739. This Patent is ≈øaid to interfere with the Town≈øhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> and it is Matter of Di≈øpute, whether in it's fir≈øt Locati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it included more than about 30 or 40 Acres within that Town, tho' it ≈øeems the Patent by it's di≈øcriptive Limits, extends further into the Town,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013102_0130_0F8EBB5FB2FE88F0"/>and the Patentees produce a Map corre≈øponding with tho≈øe Limits: However, an Indian, aged Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Nine, who was Pilot to the Party that located this Grant, informs of a certain Monument they then erected, where they broke a Bottle, &amp;c. for their Ea≈øtern Bounds. "And it is worthy a Remark," that this Indian happens to be exactly of the ≈øame Age with <hi>Ebenezer Cole,</hi> one of our Author's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deponants. This Monument is well known by the <hi>Bennington</hi> People, and is on the We≈øtern Edge of the Town; and there has never been a Di≈øcovery of any Lines of the Survey of that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Ea≈øtward of this Monument. The many Circum≈øtances of this Nature, amount to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt a Certainty, that the Patentees never made any actual Location further interfering with <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> than as afore≈øaid; notwith≈øtanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one Eighth Part of the Town; which Lands are exceeding good in Nature, and are ≈øettled wholly under the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Title, by indu≈øtrious Farmers, who form a Wilderne≈øs State, have culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and brought the mo≈øt of it under good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, with many valuable Hou≈øes, Barns and Orchards; ≈øome of them annually mowing at lea≈øt 80 Tons of Hay, and rai≈øe other Produce of the Country in Proportion. Not the lea≈øt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions were ever made in that Town, except by the≈øe Inhabitants; neither had they the lea≈øt Knowledge of a Pretence of any <hi>New-York</hi> Patents extending there till ≈øeveral Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ≈øettled the Land. As has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ob≈øerved, there was about four Settlers on that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:013102_0131_0F8EBB6155CA1060"/>Part of <hi>Hoo≈øick</hi> Patent, included in the Town≈øhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> when it was granted; and if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has a right Information, there has not been any more Settlements made under the <hi>New-York</hi> Title ≈øince, though there hath ≈øundry Families ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on the Premi≈øes, included as afore≈øaid, under the <hi>New-Ham≈øhire</hi> Title.</p>
               <p>As the State and Circum≈øtances of ≈øuch Part of the Town≈øhips afore≈øaid, as are included in the old Patents, are materially different, in many Re≈øpects, from the Circum≈øtances of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants in general; it will therefore be nece≈ø≈øary that this Matter have a particular Con≈øideration; and that none of the afore≈øaid Arguments be con≈øidered in this Ca≈øe but what are truly applicable: and in this Review of the Ca≈øe, it will be admitted, that the old <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> Patent includes ≈øuch Part of <hi>Bennington,</hi> as the Plan the Patentees exhibit doth contain.</p>
               <p>IT is taken for granted that the Royal Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the boundary Line in 1764 cou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> antecedent to the Date of that Order, which was a Manife≈øtation of Royal Power, and which was the ≈øole Cau≈øe of that Extention; therefore, at the Time the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> granted the forementioned old Patents, they could have no greater Authority for ≈øo doing than what they were then in Fact po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of: It remains therefore to be con≈øidered, whether the Patents from the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or not, ≈øo far as they interfere with the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:013102_0132_0F8EBB646A9A24A8"/>of <hi>Bennington</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And Fir≈øtly, it has been proved that the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> as di≈øcribed in their Governor's Commi≈ø≈øions, doth not extend ≈øo far North as the City of <hi>Albany;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Northern Tracts of Country which the≈øe Patents of <hi>Hoo≈øick</hi> and <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> cover, mu≈øt be con≈øidered as belonging to their ≈øecond Sort of Domain, (to wit) the Territories. It has al≈øo been ≈øhewn, that the≈øe Territories are not circum≈øcribed to any particular Limits, but that they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally meant to include ≈øome ancient Grants that were Independent of the Province and adjoining Settlements, on Extra-provincial Lands: probably that Government may have Authority to grant Land to the We≈øt and North-We≈øt, where it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øputably unappropriated, and where the Claim of none other Government could interfere: But it will be in≈øi≈øted upon, on the Part of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers, which are included in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid old Patents, that the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> had no Right to extend any of their Patents to the Ea≈øtward of a Line equivalent to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutes the Bounds between <hi>New-York</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts:</hi> This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit was ever thought by the People in general of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> as well as tho≈øe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Colonies, to be the Ea≈øtern Boundary of <hi>New-York,</hi> until the Aera of the late Determination, which extended it to the River <hi>Connecticut:</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Men that ≈øupport the World of Mankind, are obliged to form their Judgments of the Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Government's by the common received Opinions of Mankind they are conver≈øant with;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013102_0133_0F8EBAD2AB05A430"/>and even admitting they make an erroneous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet, in the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, as the Lands were of but little Value, exclu≈øive of their Toil and Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and as the Farmers in Reality uphold the State, it is therefore not only incumbent on the Laws, but on the Policy of the State to defend them in Ca≈øes of this Nature‚Äîit mu≈øt be admitted that where the Limits of Governments are clearly a≈øcertained and notoriou≈øly known, that a Farmer tre≈øpa≈ø≈øing in this Manner on another's Property, mu≈øt bear the Lo≈øs: But, provided a Country of People be generally under a Deception as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Juri≈ødiction, and purcha≈øe Land and make great Improvements, and all on a mi≈øtaken Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Men in ≈øuch Circum≈øtances ≈øhould be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the mo≈øt favourable Light. For, as not only Individuals, but the Country about them were in the ≈øame Manner deceived, and therefore, at the Time of purcha≈øing and Settlement, they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly de≈øtitute of the Means of Knowledge; yet, however, it is not conceded to, that tho≈øe Farmers on who≈øe Account the pre≈øent Arguments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, are under a Deception about this Matter; for of all Sorts of governmental Juri≈ødiction, the <hi>New-York</hi> Territorial was the weake≈øt, loo≈øe≈øt and mo≈øt vague; it was rather occa≈øional and political, than po≈øitive, and in it's own Nature almo≈øt or quite incapable of being extended fa≈øter than Settlements were actually carried on, or at mo≈øt the Lands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to this territorial Juri≈ødiction, ≈øhould not be patented fa≈øter than his Maje≈øty's Subjects are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed forthwith to ≈øettle. The Nece≈ø≈øity of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo fa≈øt may be pleaded on Account of Order‚Äîthe
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:013102_0134_0F8EBB68D2BB8840"/>Policy of Government may demand it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe an occa≈øional Juri≈ødiction would be altogether unable to abilitate the Government to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Right in Fee; although it is indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable that ≈øuch a Juri≈ødiction in Matters of meer Government, is to all Intents and Purpo≈øes, equal to po≈øitive Juri≈ødiction; but with Re≈øpect to hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Power to convey the Fee of Lands, is Matter of Doubt: But thus much with Propriety may be inferred, that a Title ≈øo weak and impotent ≈øhould not claim Superiority over the lea≈øt Conception of Title whatever; a meer Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion is of it≈øelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ≈øufficient to maintain the Right in the Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øor, and on a judicious Tryal at common Law, (cou'd ≈øuch an One be had) would be judged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to it.</p>
               <p>There is another Con≈øideration that mu≈øt totally extingui≈øh and obliterate all po≈ø≈øible remaining Idea of Right, that the Patentees of <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> may be ≈øuppo≈øed to have to the ≈øaid Tract of Land includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Limits of the Town≈øhip of <hi>Bennington.</hi> Only advert to the Date of that Patent, which is on the 15th Day of June, 1739, and compare it with the Time of the Commencement of the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which was in the Spring of the Year 1760, and there will be found to be 21 Years, from the Date of this Patent, to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Settlement under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi>‚Äîin all this Time there was not the lea≈øt Settlement or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion made in the Premi≈øes; although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Condition of the Patent was, that it ≈øhould be ≈øettled in three Years from the Time of granting.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:013102_0135_0F8EBB6982919BA8"/>Po≈ø≈øibly in all that Time the Patentees might have got ≈øome Dutch Tenants on ≈øome We≈øtern Part of the Patent, which, with the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> may be denominated a Fulfilment of the Condition of Settlement; many large Tracts hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been patented, ≈øome ≈øince, and others longer ago than that <hi>Wallum≈øcock,</hi> which are yet mo≈øtly a howling Wilderne≈øs. This Practice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> in extending their Patents to the Ea≈øtward of a Twenty Mile Line from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s River, hath ever been con≈øidered as a di≈øinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and de≈øigning Policy in that Government; thereby to lay a Foundation for intruding on the Rights of their neighbouring Colonies; and has been attended with many di≈øagreeable Con≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as has been before ob≈øerved. And as that Government have given up their exorbitant Claims where they interfered with the Right of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chu≈øetts,</hi> it would undoubtedly be their wi≈øe≈øt Way to do the ≈øame with Re≈øpect to ≈øuch Claims as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the Right granted under the great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> and in≈øtead of treating the People that have ≈øettled tho≈øe Lands under that Title, as Rioters and Felons; to exerci≈øe that Ju≈øtice and Humanity towards them, which becometh Governors, to the governed.</p>
               <p>IT remains ≈øtill, that there be a ≈øummary View exhibited, relative to the Rule of Right which ≈øhould take Place with Re≈øpect to the Settlers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Government, that are ≈øettled on ≈øuch Part of the forementioned Patents as are included in the Town≈øhips of <hi>Bennington</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013102_0136_0F8EBB6A2AAC2220"/>Superiority of Title is in Favour of tho≈øe under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> neverthele≈øs, as the Line of Juri≈ødiction, in tho≈øe Times of granting and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not expre≈øly a≈øcertained or known.‚ÄîUnder the≈øe Circum≈øtances, it would not only be bad State-policy, but great Inhumanity and Inju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Subject; for either the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them, let them have ≈øettled under the Title of either; for Titles liable to ≈øo much Di≈øpute and Uncertainty as both mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed to be (though One may have much the Preference of the Other) are not ≈øufficient to ou≈øt the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, ina≈ømuch as both challenge a legal Right; therefore, either Title, ≈øealed and confirmed with the Sweat and Toil of the Farmer is abundantly paramount to the Other.</p>
               <p>OUR Authors, in their Appendix, Page 19th, mi≈ø-repre≈øent the Plea of the <hi>Bennington</hi> People, in ≈øaying, <q>To rea≈øon on their own Principles, if Equity confirmed the Claims of Others under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> on Account of Priority of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering Grants, it would have afforded a fatal Plea again≈øt the People of <hi>Bennington;</hi> becau≈øe they ought then them≈øelves to have yielded up all the Lands which are covered by more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Patents.</q> The People of <hi>Bennington,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in≈øi≈øted, that at the Time the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> granted tho≈øe Lands, they had good Right ≈øo to do; but that <hi>New-York</hi> had not. This Matter is illu≈øtrated and proved by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and real Facts, in this Treati≈øe, particularly
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:013102_0137_0F8EBB6AF1647090"/>in the 2d and 3d Sections, to which the Reader is referred. 'Tis true, provided the <hi>Bennington</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no further Con≈øiderations in the Matter of Title, but the Priority of interfering Grants‚Äîaccording to this Method of arguing, they ought to yield up ≈øuch Part of that Town as interferes with <hi>Wallum≈øcock</hi> Patent; but the Con≈øideration of Settlement is undoubtedly, with the many other Matters, material to be con≈øidered, as argued afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:013102_0140_0F8EBB6D44061338"/>Practitioners than Pea≈øants: But artful as they are, they made a fatal Mi≈øtake in advancing for Matter of Fact that which in its own Nature is incapable of Proof, and what has been di≈øprov'd by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a mathematical Nature, and capable of further Di≈ø-proof by actual Men≈øuration. It is no Ways marvellous that tho≈øe Gentlemen which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in that A≈ø≈øembly have an Antipathy again≈øt the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> who have had a great Share in defeating them in obtaining Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Country of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants: It ≈øeems they are no in≈øen≈øible of their Merit, for, ≈øay they, <q>it is to this Town≈øhip erected by a Charter in it≈øelf void, and ≈øo greatly abu≈øed, that we are to a≈øcribe all the Oppo≈øition which has ≈øince been given to the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </q> It is evident that the≈øe Gentemen have an evil Eye upon <hi>Bennington</hi> Inhabitants; for, when they mention the Oppo≈øition to their Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they take Care to repeat the afore≈øaid groundle≈øs A≈øper≈øion, by adding the≈øe Words, <q>erected by a Charter in it≈øelf void, and ≈øo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abu≈øed.</q> They ≈øtill proceed upon this their favourite Topic, and draw particular Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from it to their advantage, <q>for by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Situation of <hi>Bennington,</hi> it is made to comprehend a large Part of <hi>Wallum≈øcock,</hi> which was granted under the Seal of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ≈øo early as the Year 1739.</q> This their ≈øcandalous A≈ø≈øertion is twice repeated in Page 8th. One of the Pa≈ø≈øages is as follows: <q>Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll,</hi> one of the mo≈øt eminent Coun≈øel in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selve≈øter</hi> of <hi>Albany,</hi> were concerned for
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:013102_0141_0F8EBB6DEBDBAD28"/>the Defendants. When the≈øe Gentlemen found <hi>Breakenridge's</hi> Farm to be within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, and greatly to the We≈øtward of what the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be the Juri≈ødiction of <hi>New-York</hi>‚Äîthey told him that it was impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øet up any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple for his Defence. Accordingly, when his Ca≈øe was brought to Tryal, he refu≈øed to confe≈øs the Lea≈øe, Entry and Ou≈øture, agreeable to the Rule, and the Plaintiff being Non-≈øuited, obtained Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ≈øucceeding July Term, again≈øt the ca≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Ejector.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is far from being the true State of the Ca≈øe. Sundry Cau≈øes which had been tried, were determined again≈øt the Claimants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> perceived it was expending Money to no Purpo≈øe, to maintain a Suit at Law again≈øt the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, as they had ≈øuch a Combination of Intere≈øt with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Part of which were intere≈øted in the <hi>New-York</hi> ≈øub≈øequent Patents, which interfered with the Grants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> though not in tho≈øe on Tryal. This, with many other Things too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to particularize, was the Cau≈øe why Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> would not defend the afore≈øaid Suit in Tryal; but there as not a Word ≈øaid, (as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me) between him and his ≈øaid Attornies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Farm's being within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River; nor is it likely never ≈øuch a Thing was mentioned in <hi>Albany</hi> County; the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo well known. Undoubtedly, this was wrote "for the Information of Government at Home,"
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:013102_0142_0F8EBB6EC6C77D28"/>thinking the Fallacy would not there be detected, it being at ≈øo great a Di≈øtance.</p>
               <p>OUR Authors, P. 10th, after giving a Narrative of a riotous and tumultuous Outrage, committed by the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> for which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation had i≈ø≈øued from the Earl of <hi>Dunmore,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the principal Authors of the Di≈øturbance "which could not be brought to Ju≈øtice," then they introduce a particular Charge again≈øt Mr. <hi>Breakenridge,</hi> which is entirely de≈øtitute of Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz.

In the 18th and 19th Pages of the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:013102_0143_0F8EBB6F87ED7310"/>they repeat their former A≈øper≈øion again≈øt the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington</hi> in the mo≈øt virulent and emphatical Language‚Äî<q>And what is ≈øtill more ≈øhameful, they contend, they arm, they ≈øight, for Lands, as a Part of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River, and which the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> never claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but admitted to be beyond their Juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>

               <p>AS THERE can be no Doubt but the≈øe Gentlemen really wi≈øh the≈øe things to be true, and having ≈øo frequently repeated them as being ≈øo, it is conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured they by this Time begin to believe them, or at lea≈øt think others may; but that the imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reader may have the real Truth of the Matter, the following Evidence is exhibited.</p>

THAT ≈øome Time in the Month of October 1771, We was in Company together in the We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Part of <hi>Rupourt,</hi> a Town≈øhip of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, and we perceived there was a Controver≈øy between the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers of that Town≈øhip, and ≈øundry Per≈øons that had newly come to that Place, with Axes and Saws, and other Farmery In≈øtruments, to begin a new Settlement near the We≈øt Line of ≈øaid Town, and within the Limits of the ≈øame, under ≈øub≈øequent Patents, under the Grant of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> which laped on the Township afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid: And ≈øundry of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers of that Town were gathered together to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of about Nine, including <hi>Ethan Allen,</hi> and <hi>Remember Baker,</hi> which was not Inhabitants of ≈øaid Town; this Number of Per≈øons went to warn off Two Men, who≈øe Names were <hi>Todd,</hi> that was then at work on a Lot of Land laid out to <hi>Robert Cochran</hi> in ≈øaid <hi>Rupourt,</hi> and on the ≈øame Piece, where ≈øaid <hi>Cochran</hi> had partly cleared before, and had in his Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: and we the Deponents went with the Party, having a Curio≈øity to ≈øee the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for we were informed that the Two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachers, viz. the <hi>Todds,</hi> had bid a Challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers, and that they were provided with Arms, and had threatened the Life of the ≈øaid <hi>Cochran,</hi> and claimed the ≈øame Land by a ≈øub≈øequent Patent from the Governor of <hi>New-York:</hi> So the Party came to where the Two Per≈øons above named were at work, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Land, and warned them, to forthwith go off from the Premi≈øes, and they did accordingly.
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:013102_0149_0F8EBB7405FF3F70"/>And we found it true that the Two Encroachers was well furni≈øhed with Fire-Arms, and ≈øo was the Party of Nine Men that went to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them; expecting there would be near or quite as many to oppo≈øe them, but there was no Pretence of u≈øing Fire-Arms on either Side. After this, the Party of Nine Men went a little further, where another Per≈øon had began to build a Log-Hou≈øe on a Lot of Land belonging to a <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grantee in ≈øaid Town; the Logs were laid, and the Rafters fixed thereon for the Roof; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon's Name that was building the ≈øame, was <hi>Hutchin≈øon,</hi> the Party afore≈øaid warned him off the Land; accordingly he departed the Town, but tarried to ≈øee the Logs he had collected together, pulled down, and laid in Four Heaps by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and burned with Fire. After this, the Party advanced a little further, where one <hi>Reid</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ≈ømall Improvement on a Piece of Land in the Town of <hi>Pollite,</hi> his Claim being al≈øo under <hi>New-York,</hi> on a ≈øub≈øequent Grant, where was a poor Shelter, four Crotches being drove into the Ground, and a Pole laid thereon, and Boughs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the heap in Lieu of a Roof: This ≈øhiftle≈øs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick was al≈øo con≈øumed by Fire by the ≈øame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and we the Deponents, were Eye-witne≈ø≈øes of the Fact before related; and directly after this, the Party di≈øper≈øed: But there was no Family di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed in the whole Affair, nor was there any that had moved on the Premi≈øes under Title from <hi>New-York.</hi> And further the Deponents ≈øay not.

                           <p>THAT, on or about the 19th Day of June, 1773. we arrived from <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>New-York</hi>‚Äî≈øoon after
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:013102_0151_0F8EBB74D99846D0"/>our Arrival, we met with Col. <hi>Reid,</hi> in <hi>New-York,</hi> who invited us to ≈øettle under him in the County of <hi>Charlette,</hi> on Lands which he ≈øaid he owned in that County. We being Strangers to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and not knowing there was any Di≈øpute or Controver≈øy about Land in America, thought be≈øt to accept of his Offer; and accordingly agreed to go with him, on the following Terms, viz. That we ≈øhould have a Lea≈øe of our Land forever, with the fir≈øt ≈øeven Years free from Rent, and after that, Six Pence per Acre yearly, and to deliver to him at his Mill or Mills, the Tenth Part of our Grain yearly, and not to cut any Timber, ≈øave what the clearing our Lands required. On the afore≈øaid Agreement we ≈øet out from <hi>New-York,</hi> with ≈øaid <hi>Reid,</hi> and when we arrived at Fort <hi>Miller,</hi> we hear'd tho≈øe Lands that we agreed for, were in Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; on which we went to ≈øaid <hi>Reid,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, that if his Lands were in Di≈øpute, we rather cho≈øe to turn back, than to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but he affirmed to us, that his Land was not in Di≈øpute, and that he would put us in peaceable Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and protect us there. On this Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement we went forward as far as Fort <hi>George,</hi> where we heard the News of the Di≈øpute again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us; on which ≈øome of our Company would have turned back, but Col. <hi>Reid</hi> refu≈øed to let them go, a≈ø≈øuring us that the Lands was not in any Conte≈øt, and that he would compel us to go forward. After this we went to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> where we under≈øtood that the Land to which we were going, was granted to the Settlers that were on it by the Governor of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and that they
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:013102_0152_0F8EBB7571603688"/>would not give up their Title, it being antecedent to <hi>New-York</hi> Patents. After hearing that we ≈øhould have Trouble, we ab≈øolutely refu≈øed to go any further, telling Col. <hi>Reid</hi> that we did not come to <hi>America</hi> to fight for any Man's Title, nor to take away any Man's Property, and de≈øired we might go back to <hi>New-York;</hi> but he refu≈øed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that we ≈øhould fulfil our Agreement, and, that there was a Parcel of <hi>Yankies,</hi> or <hi>New-England</hi> Men, ≈øettled all over America, without any Right or Title to their Lands, and he would put us in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and defend us there. After this, he brought us to the Mouth of <hi>Otter Creek,</hi> and then he ordered every Man to load his Gun; but I, viz. <hi>James Hender≈øon,</hi> refu≈øed to load mine. Next Morning, at the Falls of ≈øaid <hi>Creek,</hi> he a≈øk'd me where my Firelock was? I replied, it was in the Battoe. Ay! Damn you! ≈øaid he, you dare not load your Firelock‚Äîyou will make a bad Soldier. After this we went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> a Town above the Falls, where we found large Improvements made, and the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi>'s actually in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their Families, which Families ≈øaid <hi>Reid</hi> turned out, and put us, with the Re≈øt of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in their Place‚Äîthen he ≈øaid, there was no further Danger, and went back and left us to keep Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe Hou≈øes and Improvements. Soon after this, came a large Number of armed Men which ≈øtiled them≈øelves the <hi>Green-Mountain-Boys,</hi> and they demanded of us if we were <hi>Reid</hi>'s Settlers? We replied that we were. Then they informed us that their Bu≈øine≈øs was to di≈øpo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øs us, alledging that tho≈øe Lands were antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:013102_0153_0F8EBB764CE32220"/>granted to them by the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and that they would keep Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of them 'till his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure was further known, Then they ordered our Goods and Effects to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Hou≈øes, that none of them ≈øhould be hurt, which was done; and then they demoli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and burned the Hou≈øes, which were made with large Logs, but nothing of our Hou≈øhold Goods were burned. Next Day they pulled down a Gri≈øt Mill of ≈øaid <hi>Reid</hi>'s, and there was a ≈ømall Stack of Hay burned; which they ≈øaid accidentally took Fire; and that if they could find out that any of their Men put Fire to it, they ≈øhould pay for the Hay; for, they ≈øaid, they did not approve that any of the Effects of the Earth ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed. Their Hor≈øes likewi≈øe de≈øtroyed ≈øome of the Wheat and Corn, but they did not otherways abu≈øe our Per≈øons, Effects or Families; neither did they exclaim again≈øt governmental Authority, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly affirmed that they would maintain their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and defend it from the Incur≈øion of Col. <hi>Ried,</hi> or any other Claims from <hi>New-York,</hi> until his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure ≈øhould be further known.

               <p>OUR Authors in the Twenty Seventh and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing Page of their Narrative, di≈øcover great Invention and Subtilty, who after giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the unfortunate Circum≈øtances of the Town of <hi>Hin≈ødale</hi> which has, ≈øay they, <q>been taken up by a Royal Mandamus.</q> This Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip had fir≈øt been granted by the Government of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> and upon the Settlement of the Boundary-Line between the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> in 1739, it fell within the latter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Proprietors, who in Addition to their Title, had al≈øo the Indian Right. This Town≈øhip, by the Determination of the Boundary Line between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> fell within the Juri≈ødiction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <hi>Howard,</hi> after it had been ≈øettled about Seventy Years. The A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in Order to ≈øcreen their Government from the Imputation of the Blame ju≈øtly due to ≈øo reprehen≈øible a Conduct, endeavour to palm it on the Government at Home, ≈øee Page Sixth, with Re≈øpect to <q>
                     <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> a Town≈øhip in the South Ea≈øt Corner of <hi>Cumberland</hi> County: Even this is not to be a≈øcribed to our Government, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a much greater, and the highe≈øt Authority: A Mandamus was produced from the Crown, on the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which ve≈øted the Grantee with a Right of Election, an Act deci≈øive in it≈øelf, and ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013102_0156_0F8EBB7B18A9CC08"/>the Agency of the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil here, and the u≈øual Forms.</q> A very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Repre≈øentation! The Nature of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mandamus is diametrically oppo≈øite to this Interpretation: The Right of Election in the Grantees, is re≈øtricted entirely to Crown Lands which are unapropriated; in ≈øuch Lands, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee has a Right of Election, and common Sen≈øe may teach, that neither a Mandamus or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crown Grant can ≈øubvert the Property which the Subject holds under the Crown by Prior Grants; and, though there be ever ≈øo many Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the Juri≈ødiction, ≈øundry of which have perplexed the Town of <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> yet this ≈øhould have no Effect on the Property of the Subjects.‚ÄîThe≈øe Grantees are likewi≈øe withheld from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereing on the Right of the Indian Subjects.‚ÄîYet, it ≈øeems Col. <hi>Howard</hi> had the Vanity to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Mandamus on the old Plantation of <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> which was fir≈øtly appropriated by a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe from the <hi>Indians,</hi> ≈øecondly, by a Grant from the Government of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts Bay,</hi> and thirdly, by the Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and fourthly, by an uninterupted Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Occupancy about Seventy Years.</p>
               <p>THE Subterfuge the Gentlemen make U≈øe of, to rid their Government from Di≈øhonour, in making this la≈øt Grant of <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; it ≈øeems not well calculated <q>to be tran≈ømitted for the Information of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Home!</hi>
                  </q> who are undoubtedly compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of their own Mandamus's, and no
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013102_0157_0F8EBB7BEE0F6D78"/>Doubt will ea≈øily di≈øcern their La≈øt Error to be wor≈øe than the Fir≈øt. Such prepo≈øterous grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lands, is Criminally injurious to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as it never fails to embarra≈øs the different Claimants with many concomitant Difficulties. Yet, ≈øtill to ca≈øt the Blame due to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the King's Mandamus, is more dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly injurious to the highe≈øt Authority in the Nation.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, the manner of Redre≈øs pre≈øcribed for the Sufferers, viz. the old Proprietors of <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> is the mo≈øt ≈øhocking Piece of Contrivance, Page 27, <q>
                     <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> a ≈ømall Town≈øhip which has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been taken up by Virtue of a Royal Mandamus, is alone unfortunate‚Äîbut even here the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors may be relieved, by a ≈øuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compen≈øation, equal to the Value of their Improvements in Crown Lands, free from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Fees.</q> The≈øe Gentlemen in their great Clemency have al≈øo conceded that the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> Settlers in general may be thus con≈øidered, <q>On the ≈øame Terms, may be a≈ø≈øigned to each of tho≈øe who are ≈øeated on the Soil, actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to others by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for that Rea≈øon be confirmed; ≈øuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Crown Lands, as the Governor and Council ≈øhall judge to be adequate to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpective Improvements.</q>

<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013102_0158_0F8EBB7C2BCB70E8"/>Part of the County of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Connecticut</hi> River and Lake <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,</hi> ≈øtill remains unpatented by either Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and might be planted and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the≈øe People:</q>‚ÄîWhat a ≈øurpri≈øing Conde≈øcention this! the Po≈øterity of the Original Proprietors of <hi>Hin≈ødale,</hi> e≈øpecially, to be allowed the Privilege to pull up Sakes, quit their Farms and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, Hou≈øes, Orchards, &amp;c. and join Company with the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and trudge off to the North-Ea≈øt Part of the Wilderne≈øs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and there commence another Settlement, leaving their plea≈øant Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Fields, Tenements, and Country, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for a howling Wilderne≈øs; a pretty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change!‚Äîand this to gratify a number of <hi>New-York</hi> Cormorants. But, let's ≈øtop a little and con≈øider‚Äîwhether it would not be more Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to change the Scene, and ≈øo the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees remove their Patents, that interfere with the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, and lay them in the Wilderne≈øs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> as neither Government have appropriated it.</p>
               <p>A ≈øufficient Rea≈øon to be offered in favour of the latter of the≈øe Projects, is, that the Settlers under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> are in Deed, and in Truth the right and lawful Owners and Proprietors of the Lands they po≈ø≈øe≈øs, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demon≈øtrated in the preceding Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Although the≈øe Gentlemen have, in the Cour≈øe of their Narration, flung out very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Hints of rewarding his Maje≈øty's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013102_0159_0F8EBB7FD8E9C6F0"/>by the Di≈øtribution of tho≈øe Lands, yet, they may here again be reminded, (which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øerve as the above Rea≈øon) that his Maje≈øty's Proclamation directed the Soldiery to make their Pitches on unappropriated and vacant Lands; this therefore, they mu≈øt do, at the Hazard of lo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Grants, or repitching. For tho≈øe Lands which being antecedently granted by the Crown, by the Agency of the Governor and Council of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> mu≈øt forever exclude the Soldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from pitching thereon; and put it entirely out of the Power of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> or the Crown, to grant them to a Second Per≈øon. And when it is con≈øidered, that the <hi>New-York</hi> Land-Jobbers have, long ≈øince purcha≈øed great Part of the Soldiery Rights, and that for a mere Trifle, and laid them out of them≈øelves, at their own Ri≈øque; their Arguments on that Subject, cannot contribute greatly to the Removal of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers, to the exterior Part of <hi>Charlotte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Authors have given a tedious Hi≈øtory of the Suits at Law, which have been commenced, by the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, again≈øt the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and Occupants under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> and have exhibited many ≈øpecious Appearances of Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Equity, and Impartiality in their Tryals. However, the Reader mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of tho≈øe, ≈øo boa≈øted of, candid Tryals, the Defendants, by the Re≈øult, were to be di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Farms.

               <p>THIS A≈ø≈øembly ≈øeem profu≈øely lavi≈øh in the Prai≈øe of their own Government, concerning the Genero≈øity, Forbearance and Humanity, &amp;c. they have exerci≈øed towards the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers; and that nothing of that Sort may here pa≈øs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, but that every Act, by them done, worthy of ≈øuch Appellations, may be duly acknowledged; it will be freely confe≈ø≈øed that Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> and the Majority of his Maje≈øty's Council, conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Honour and Humanity toward them; while his Excellency was in the Admini≈øtration, except in pa≈ø≈øing ≈øome very extraordinary Laws on the 9th of March, 1774, which may be ≈øeen in the fore Part of this Treati≈øe, under the Head of the Narrative: But tho≈øe Settlers mu≈øt have that

               <p>COULD they once get this e≈øtabli≈øhed, that there ≈øhould be no Acce≈øs to his Maje≈øty, or Trial, but in this "ordinary Mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire Satisfaction; Tryals in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would then ea≈øily become deci≈øive; for in no Ca≈øe, wherein the Demand of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is below the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds, a Writ of Error in Favour of the Defendant can i≈ø≈øue. And the <hi>New-York</hi> Attornies who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled the <hi>New-York</hi> Statings, and are al≈øo Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees under that Government, well knew that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Action brought again≈øt the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Claimants has been de≈øignedly laid below that Sum.

               <p>THERE is nothing exhibited in this <hi>New-York</hi> Pamphlet which more ≈øen≈øibly de≈øerves Re≈øentment than their Preten≈øions of Indulgencies, Favours, &amp;c. conferred on the≈øe Claimants by that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment‚Äî<q>To the Honor of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> it may ju≈øtly be a≈ø≈øerted, that the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Claimants have received every Mark of Favour and Indulgence which the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances permitted.</q> Such Hypocri≈øy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈øes
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013102_0163_0F8EBB82ED033950"/>Human Nature, is the Pe≈øt of Society, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Fal≈øhood and Treachery; and what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it peculiarly vile, is, that it u≈øurps the Seat of Virtue, and de≈øtroys Faith in Communities, and is the Source of cruel Jealou≈øy. Had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York</hi> been truly friendly to tho≈øe Settlers, it had been return'd again; and mutual Good Will ≈øupplied the Place of Hatred an Strife. But, alas! ≈øo long as the Fee of the Country of the <hi>New Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants is the Object in View, by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> how it is po≈ø≈øible for Peace and good Order to take Place, can't well be conceived. Well would it be for that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and infinitely better for the Settlers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> were they annexed to ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government; but they ≈øay, No. Quere, Why? The An≈øwer is ea≈øy. They would then loo≈øe Sight of the afore≈øaid de≈øirable Object: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe, ≈øurely they would be glad to part with ≈øuch rebellious Subjects as they repre≈øent them to be. For the Truth no Doubt is, that they are in Hopes ≈øome better Fortune may in future, attend them. And that they can take and execute ≈øome of the leading Men among the≈øe Inhabitants; and ≈øo frighten and impo≈øe on the Re≈øt; and finally, by this Means, avail them≈øelves of their E≈øtates and Property. This is all they can de≈øire in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Country under their Juri≈ødiction. That they have in Reality a View to this, will further appear, by ≈øome memorable Sentences recorded in the 25th Page of their Appendix. "We may," ≈øay they, <q>readily conceive, that <hi>Breakenridge,</hi> and his Party, have abundant Rea≈øon to wi≈øh
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:013102_0164_0F8EBB83B5CE8170"/>for an Alteration of Juri≈ødiction. The public Crimes, and private Wrongs which they have perpetrated, mu≈øt make them look forward to the Hour of Tranquility, with the mo≈øt anxious Apprehen≈øions. The injured may then demand Satisfaction for all their Sufferings.‚ÄîAn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement mu≈øt then be made to the Country, for the Violation of it's Laws.</q> Here the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers may read their intended Doom, in Con≈øequence of the Ability of the Government of <hi>New-York.</hi> And one Rea≈øon why this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have not already de≈øtroyed the Inhabitants of the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Grants, with Fire and Sword, is their Want of Ability; and this Inability, in great Part, con≈øi≈øts in this, that the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Government, are univer≈øally of Opinion that the Inhabitants have a good Right to tho≈øe Lands, and ≈øhould not be mole≈øted in the peaceable Enjoyment of them; and con≈øequently will not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt their Civil Officers, in taking Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their Tenements, or them as Rioters. That they are no further turbulent than what is nece≈ø≈øary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Per≈øons and Properties, from the Cruelty and Monopoly of their Rulers. This is the Ground of all the Lenity, Forbearance and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of that Government towards tho≈øe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and it is hoped, if the≈øe exce≈ø≈øive Favours ≈øhould be pa≈ø≈øed over without their Thanks, they may yet be excu≈øed for the Neglect.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, tho≈øe Gentlemen, after having thus ≈øoon out their in ≈øulcible Complaints, crown the Whole in Page 25th. <q>That they, i. e. the

He has never, (notwith≈øtanding all their In≈øinuations) been active in any Riots (as they term them) occa≈øioned by this Controver≈øy; but is become the Subject of a Proclamation‚Äîyet ≈øtill, what Evil has he done? As tho≈øe Gentlemen have not obliged the Public with an Information, the Author can ≈øupply their Defect. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was one of the fir≈øt Settlers on the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> Grants; and has had a great Share in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Oeconomy of that Country, is a Man of Probity and Stedfa≈øtne≈øs in Principle, and ble≈ø≈øed with ≈øtrong Power of Ponderation, and has gained, as well as merited the E≈øteem of the≈øe Settlers. He was by them cho≈øen as Agent to repre≈øent their di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Cau≈øe to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Pre≈øident of the Board of Trade; and al≈øo, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Maje≈øty to interpo≈øe his Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and relieve his oppre≈ø≈øed Subjects.‚ÄîHe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his Lord≈øhip, with a Repre≈øentation of the Conduct of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Con≈øtituents, and ≈øollicited his Lord≈øhip's Aid and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, in Behalf of the Sufferers. He was received with Expre≈ø≈øions of Kindne≈øs,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:013102_0166_0F8EBB869D6CEDB0"/>and when he had laid the Facts of the Cau≈øe before his Lord≈øhip, and ≈øub≈øtituted an Agent at <hi>London,</hi> and put the Cau≈øe in Readine≈øs for a final Tryal, before his Maje≈øty in Privy Council, returned to <hi>America;</hi> having done all Things to the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Employers.‚ÄîSince his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Great-Britain, he has made his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at his own Hou≈øe in <hi>Bennington,</hi> (which is not within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,) although "a Fugitive from Ju≈øtice,"‚Äîmaking further Preparations for the deci≈øive Trial depending before his Maje≈øty, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inhabitants, with the Hopes of his mo≈øt gracious Deliverance.

               <p>AS THE De≈øign of this Section was, in a conci≈øe Manner, to point out ≈øome of the mo≈øt notorious Extravagancies of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> the Subject can't with Propriety be pa≈ø≈øed over, without taking a ≈øhort Review of the forementioned Laws of that Colony, which are the mo≈øt apparent Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their horrid Malevolence and Caprice. Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing the≈øe Laws, which are evidently calculated with a De≈øign of extirpating the Inhabitants, by them Laws alluded to, from their goodly Land, nay, from the Face of the Earth; is no le≈øs than lavi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foaming out their own Shame; Laws that ought, and are contemned and di≈øregarded by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lover of Virtue. Laws and Society-Compacts were originally de≈øigned to protect the Subjects in their Property. Loyalty and Subordination to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:013102_0167_0F8EBB8837B24D00"/>≈øuch Government, is e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary, for the Good of Society, and all good and liege Subjects will ≈øupport ≈øuch Laws and Legi≈ølators. But, as in the pre≈øent In≈øtance, when Laws, in their original De≈øign and Admini≈øtration, are degenerated from the good Ends for which Laws and Government were in≈øtituted, terminating in the Ruin and De≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the Society it ≈øhould ≈øecure &amp; protect; from the ≈øame Principles, viz. Self-pre≈øervation, the Subjects are obliged to re≈øi≈øt, and depo≈øe ≈øuch Government. And, ina≈ømuch as tho≈øe Laws, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ≈øome Remarks on them, are to be ≈øeen in the Narrative Part of this Performance, ≈øhall therefore conclude, with leaving the Reader, from his own Meditations, to pa≈øs ≈øuch Sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter as may appear rea≈øonable.</p>

And tho≈øe Settlers from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going

               <p>THE A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have been very particular in their Hi≈øtory of the Tumults and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots made by tho≈øe Settlers, in Oppo≈øition to that Government, (many of which Facts mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed to be true) though they have carefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their manyfold Provocations, yet, with all their Particularity have given but a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Idea of tho≈øe Tran≈øactions. I ≈øhall here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, waving particulars, give a general Review of the Oeconomy of tho≈øe Settlers in their Oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that Government. For defending their Properties, they were indicted Rioters, the next Thing was to defend Rioters; then they had two Objects as the Subjects of their Protection, viz. their Per≈øons, as well as Property: They were at Fir≈øt greatly intimidated at the empty Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Law, that their Opponents were ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øant with, ≈øometimes de≈øpairing of maintaining their Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions; yet upon Extremity, rather than quit their Sub≈øtance to the in≈øatiable Ravi≈øhers, would rally and fru≈øtrate their De≈øigns: Thus, when the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Albany</hi> with his Po≈ø≈øe came to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs ≈øome of them, they mo≈øt generally, boldly took up Arms, and appointed Leaders. Matters having come to this, not long
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013102_0180_0F8EBB9800A17BD8"/>after, the Inhabitants a≈ø≈øembled and appointed Committees of Safety in the ≈øeveral Towns through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Settlement; this general Committee have the conducting of the Public Affairs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for its Security, 'till his Maje≈øty ≈øettles the Controver≈øy. They have erected ≈øeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which by the Votes of the Soldiers are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed with Officers, the≈øe Companies form a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment which are known by the ≈øignificant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of GREEN-MOUNTAIN BOYS, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the Prime of Life, well ver≈øed in the U≈øe of Fire-Arms, and of robu≈øt Con≈øtitutions; probably no American Regiment in an interior Defence could excel them, or that would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute more to the Support of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> for it is ob≈øervable, that ≈øuch Subjects that will not fight for their Property, will never fight for their King: And, the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions from the Committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing again≈øt the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> but on the Defen≈øive.</p>
               <p>IT is in the Nature of Things impo≈ø≈øible to pa≈øs a right Judgment on the Conduct of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi> Settlers, without taking into View the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> towards them. All Ca≈øes mu≈øt be determined upon the peculiar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances attending; no Act can ≈øcarcely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of which, under certain attending Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances might not be lawful. It will be readily admitted on the Part of tho≈øe Settlers, that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees have a clear and inconte≈øtible Right to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:013102_0181_0F8EBAD0903D8FF0"/>tho≈øe Lands; and that they are Intruders, and by Force and Violence have maintained ≈øuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, then, they are truly guilty, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have alledged: But on the Contrary, if tho≈øe Settlers have a legal and inconte≈øtible Right to tho≈øe Lands, that they pro≈øecute Settlement on the good Faith of that Title, and the ≈øundry Approbations of both their Title and Settlement from the Briti≈øh Admini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, then, they are not guilty in Manner as tho≈øe Gentlemen have declared; and the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Public, in≈øtead of viewing them as U≈øurpers, Rioters and Felons, will ju≈øtify them in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and e≈øteem them as good Members of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, leige Subjects to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and good Soldiers for defending their Per≈øons and Properties.</p>
               <p>THUS, is humbly ≈øubmitted the State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øy, which has for many Years ≈øub≈øi≈øted between the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> and the Settlers under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> by impartial Ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice mu≈øt every Act ≈øtand or fall; if tho≈øe Settlers are in the wrong, they are criminally ≈øo, but if not, then the Allegations of their Opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</p>

Becau≈øe be is credibly informed that the Gentlemen Land-≈øchemers of New-York have altered their Plan of Operation, and have at an incon≈øiderable Price, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed the greate≈øt Part of the <hi>French</hi> Claim to corobor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their own ≈øub≈øequent Patents, and by that Means to avail them≈øelves of an antecedent Claim to that of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire;</hi> and that their pre≈øent Scheme is to be ≈øilent at the Court at <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with Re≈øpect to their Claim under <hi>New-York,</hi> and carry on the Di≈øpute in the Name of the <hi>French</hi> Barons, hopeing by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to procure to them≈øelves the Fee of tho≈øe Lands which the <hi>French</hi> Grants cover; and fru≈øtrate and Di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the Claimants and Settlers under <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> which are ≈øeated on the Lands the <hi>French</hi> Grants include, to the Number of about Three Hundred Families, and on which there is not a ≈øingle Settler under either the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>New-York</hi> Claim. And ina≈ømuch, as the Chain of Arguments predicated on undeniable Facts, and exhibited in the following Appendix, of which this is an Introduction, are abundantly ≈øufficient to invalidate the <hi>French</hi> Claim, the Author therefore takes a peculiar Plea≈øure in turning the Artillery of the A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> again≈øt them≈øelves, in full Confidence that, that A≈ø≈øembly cannot, by Rea≈øon and Argument, gain≈øay what they have thus exhibited with the Help of any <hi>French</hi> Cunning what≈øoever. And provided the A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York</hi> had publi≈øhed the following Appendix, with a friendly De≈øign towards the <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> Settlers; that A≈ø≈øembly would have merited their grateful Acknowledgements; but though their De≈øign at that Time was to defeat the <hi>French</hi> Claim to e≈øtabli≈øh their <hi>New-York</hi> Patents, neverthele≈øs it ≈øeems a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath made U≈øe of the learned Abilities and evil
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013102_0184_0F8EBB9A390A0530"/>Inten≈øions of the Gentlemen of that A≈ø≈øembly, which tho≈øe Settlers dreaded as their greate≈øt temporary Evil to be conducive to their greate≈øt temporary Good.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Arguments contained in the Appendix, to be hereafter in≈øerted, are full and compleat again≈øt the <hi>French</hi> Claim, they are neverehele≈øs ≈øomewhat incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with meer imaginary Notions, relative to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious and antient Northern Extention of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> even to the River <hi>St. Lawrence.</hi> They indeed a≈øcertain and vindicate the Right of the Crown of England to tho≈øe Lands, and then on ficticious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a≈ø≈øume the Right of that Colony to be co-exten≈øive with that of the Crown. Now the Reader will with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Attention, di≈øcern that Arguments relative to the <hi>French</hi> claim, do not at all depend on the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Extention of the Right of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> or of any of his Maje≈øty's colonies: Meerly the Right of the crown to that Extention of Territory is abundantly ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to nullify and make void the <hi>French</hi> claim. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly tho≈øe Lands granted by the <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Canada,</hi> adjoining to Lake <hi>Champlain</hi> were crown Lands when u≈øurped and granted by the <hi>French,</hi> and continued ≈øo to be till it was granted by his Maje≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Government of <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire.</hi> But of this enough has been already animadverted. The Di≈øpute between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire</hi> is committed to the Publick con≈øideration. What remains in this Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Appendix is only to point out to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ≈øuch Part of the Arguments, or rather Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentations, therein contained as a≈ø≈øume a colony Right to tho≈øe Lands, are foreign to the Point in I≈ø≈øue, in the Di≈øpute of the French claim; the ≈øame may be ≈øaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

Such Arguments may truly affect the colonies of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp≈øhire,</hi> but by no Means affect the I≈ø≈øue in Di≈øpute relative to the French claim, ina≈ømuch as the Right of the Crown of England to tho≈øe Lands Precludes the French claim intirely. Therefore ≈øuch colony Arguments as may be found inter≈øper≈øed in the following Appendix are only Digre≈ø≈øions from the Point in I≈ø≈øue, but cannot any Way affect the Arguments which centre in that ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Point.

            <p>
               <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River was again vi≈øited in 1610, and the following Years, by <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, with a Grant under the States General for an exclu≈øive Trade; and the Coloy which they denominated <hi>Nieuw Nederlant,</hi> advanced with ≈øuch Rapidity, that in 1612 they had a Town and Fort in <hi>New-Am≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> now <hi>New-York;</hi> and in 1615, another Town and Fort at <hi>Aurania,</hi> now <hi>Albany</hi> 160 Miles up <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s River.</p>
            <p>IN 1623, they erected Fort <hi>Good Hope,</hi> on <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, and upwards of Thirty-five Miles from its Mouth.

            <p>IN 1663-4, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, granted to his Brother <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Di≈øtrict of Country comprehending <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øey,</hi> which were Territories po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>

            <p>IN 1673, the Country was again ≈øurrendered to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, but in 1674, by Treaty between the two Nations, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ceded all their Claim to this Country, to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the ≈øame Year King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all Doubts which might have ari≈øen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Validity of his fir≈øt Grant to the Duke, on Account of the intermediate Conque≈øt by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> confirmed the ≈øame Territories to his Royal

There can be no Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but that by the Words of the Duke's Grant, the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> was to have an Ea≈øtern Extent to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.

            <p>ON this Principle we have always claimed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Royal Grant, as the ju≈øt and ancient Right of this Province, All the Country which lies to the South of We≈øt Line drawn from the Head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; except ≈øo far as it interferes with the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with which a Settlement was made in 1683, by Commi≈ø≈øaries of both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under mutual Acts of Legi≈ølature, and which was confirmed by King <hi>William.</hi>

            <p>THAT the Crown con≈øidered the Five Nations, and their Country, to be under it's Subjection, <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">That the Five Nations became Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and put them≈øelves under it's Protection, appears from many of their Treaties.‚ÄîVide <hi>Colden's</hi> Hi≈øtory, Page 53, 54, 62, 80, 139.</note> and that the <hi>French</hi> could have no Claim to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is manife≈øt from the fifteenth Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">The Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> 11th <hi>April,</hi> 1713.</note> confirmed by that of <hi>Aix-La-Chapelle;</hi> ≈øtipulating that the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Canada,</hi> and el≈øewhere, ≈øhall not di≈øturb or mole≈øt in any Manner whatever, the Five <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, <hi>which are ≈øubject to Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> nor its other American Allies.

            <p>So long ago as 1696, a Grant pa≈ø≈øed the Great Seal of this Province to <hi>Godfrey Dellius,</hi> for a Tract of Country extending from the North Bounds of <hi>Saraghtoga,</hi> (which lies on <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River thirty four Miles North of the City of <hi>Albany</hi>) to the Rock <hi>Ro≈øian,</hi> a Station indi≈øputable, and which is well known to lie on <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> upwards of twenty Miles to the North of <hi>Crown-Point;</hi> and extending twelve Miles Ea≈øt from <hi>Hud≈øon's</hi> River, and the ≈øame Di≈øtance Ea≈øt from the Wood-Creek, and the Waters to the Northward.

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013102_0192_0F8EBBA567676ED0"/>Day, that the Legi≈ølature conceived the Grant of it to be too great a Favour to one Subject, and pa≈ø≈øed a Law in the Year 1699, repealing it as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. <note n="¬∂" place="bottom">Laws of <hi>New-York,</hi> 1 Vol. Page 35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FORMERLY, and before the Year 1731, we had a Trading-Hou≈øe at Crown-Point, where our Traders occa≈øionally re≈øided; for it was not 'till that Year that the Canadians, in profound Peace, invaded this frontier Part of the Province, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Fort <hi>St. Frederick</hi> at Crown-Point, which has been the Occa≈øion of an almo≈øt uninterrupted Series of Contention and Blood≈øhed.

            </p>
            <p>A COMPLAINT was accordingly tran≈ømitted to Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> but it made ≈øo little Impre≈ø≈øion on that Mini≈øter, that our Government was left without the lea≈øt Direction from their Superiors; and conceiving an attempt to oppo≈øe or di≈ølodge the <hi>French</hi> (which probably mu≈øt have drawn upon
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:013102_0193_0F8EBBA58155DBA0"/>them the whole Power of Canada) to be too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous an Undertaking, without the Authority or A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Crown, this important Pa≈øs was left in the Hands of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' we were at that Time unable to do our≈øelves Ju≈øtice, it was not only the Opinion of this, but of all the neighbouring Colonies, that the Erection of the Fort at Crown-Point was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Encroachment; and that the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt demanded that proper Mea≈øures ≈øhou'd be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to ≈øecure the Colonies again≈øt the Mi≈øchiefs to which it expo≈øed them.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY in 1755, and before the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, this Colony, in Conjunction with the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øett's-Bay</hi> and Connecticut, formed a Plan for erecting one or more Forts on his Maje≈øty's Lands at or nigh Crown-Point, and the Troops were rai≈øed accordingly,<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Journal of the General A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> 2 Vol. Page 440.</note> but War being ≈øoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, our Operations became more exten≈øive.</p>
            <p>IN ≈øhort, on the Principle that it was unque≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably a Part of the Briti≈øh Dominions within this Colony, the Government both at home and here, have ever con≈øidered the Occupancy of Crown Point by the <hi>French,</hi> as a per≈øidious and dangerous Encroachment, which in Effect was one of the principal Cau≈øes of both of the la≈øt Wars. The≈øe Remarks ju≈øtify an Inference of the utmo≈øt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the pre≈øent Controver≈øy, <hi>to wit,</hi> That as it was an ancient Right of this Colony, coeval with
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:013102_0194_0F8EBBA80486DFE0"/>it's fir≈øt Plantation by <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Subjects, to extend even further Northward than the Latitude of 45 Degrees, to which it is now re≈øtricted, his Maje≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Proclamation, in≈øtead of enlarging our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, (as has been under≈øtood by ≈øome, who have not con≈øidered the Subject, and pretended by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who≈øe Intere≈øt it is to mi≈ørepre≈øent) does in Fact con≈øiderably abridge it, operating as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our original Title up to the Line it e≈øtabli≈øhes; and as an Extinction of Juri≈ødiction beyond it (<hi>to wit</hi>) over the Lands between that Latitude and the Head of Connecticut River, or more properly the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> our old Boundary.</p>
            <p>IT is true that ≈øince the Year 1731, the <hi>French</hi> by maintaining Forts and ≈øtrong Garri≈øons at Crown-Point, Tieonderoga, &amp;c. have deprived us of the Enjoyment of the Country to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Albany;</hi> nor was it po≈ø≈øible to extend our Plantations, perpetually expo≈øed to the Ravages of a mo≈øt cruel Enemy, 'till on the Approach of Sir <hi>Jeffery Amher≈øt,</hi> with the Engli≈øh Army in 1759, the <hi>French</hi> abandoned both their Forts and their Settlements.‚ÄîThe≈øe la≈øt were very few in Number, and all of them in the Neighbourhood of Crown Point and Tieonderoga; which having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>French</hi> as Places of Arms, to annoy and di≈øtre≈øs this Colony the more effectually, no Cultivation had taken place but for the meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of their Garri≈øons.

            <p>THE Capitulation granted by the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Inhabitants of Canada, on the Conque≈øt in 1760, ≈øtipulates, <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING ≈øeems more obvious than that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given to the Canadians, both by the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and the Treaty, was confined to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Colony of Canada; nor any Thing more ab≈øurd, than to ≈øuppo≈øe it ≈øhould extend to a Part of the Country which the <hi>French</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiou≈øly u≈øurped, and which they had only within the Compa≈øs of a few Years granted to the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to further their Encroachments.</p>

               <pb n="199" facs="unknown:013102_0196_0F8EBBAB83C6CC00"/>
THE Government of <hi>New-York</hi> therefore, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of his Maje≈øty's late E≈øtabli≈øhment of our Boundary with <hi>Quebec,</hi> could not but con≈øider all the Country on both Sides of Lake Champlain, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtionably within it's ju≈øt and ancient Limits and Juri≈ødiction.</p>
            <p>THAT the Canadian Grants can never be ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a meer Encroachment, nor derive Stability or Confirmation either from the Capitulation or the Treaty, was not only the Opinion here, but al≈øo of his Maje≈øty and his Mini≈øters.</p>
            <p>IN Pur≈øuance of the Proclamation of the 7th Day of October, 1763, Sir <hi>Henry Moore,</hi> and Col. <hi>Carleton,</hi> the Governors of the two Provinces, in the Month of September 1767, fixed the Place of the Latitude of 45 Degrees, by actual Ob≈øervation, near the North End of the Lake.

            </p>

            <p>THE Title of this Province, in Right of the Crown, to all the Country to the Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> ('till his Maje≈øty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and ≈øince that Act, to the Southward of the 45th Degree of Latitude) being thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly e≈øtabli≈øhed, it cannot be wondered at that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Peace was re≈øtored, our Government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Grant and Settlement of the Lands to the Southward of this la≈øt Boundary, without the lea≈øt Scruple.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THERE were ≈øeveral Rea≈øons which induced them to fix, and the Government to grant, in this Part of the Country.</p>
            <p>IT had been the Scene of War, and they were well acquainted with it. They ≈øeemed to have a peculiar Right to be provided for, out of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Fruits of their Victories; and above all, the re≈øt of the Province which remained unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated, belonged to the Native Occupants, and could not be patented without a previous Purcha≈øe from them: A Condition with which mo≈øt of the Officers, and all the Soldiers, were unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Under the≈øe Circum≈øtances they were chiefly gratified by Grants of the Lands fir≈øt mentioned, and the Country adjoining to the Southward and Ea≈øtward, after being put to great Trouble and Expence in the Di≈øcovery and actual Survey of their re≈øpective Allotments. Many Grants have al≈øo been made to the Inhabitants of the Colony in the ≈øame Di≈øtrict, which, as far as they concern this Controver≈øy, are laid down in the annexed Map.<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">See Map No. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Canadian Grants cover a great Part of the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013102_0200_0F8EC52003CCAFD0"/>Country along both Sides of <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> not only to <hi>Crown Point</hi> but ≈øeveral Miles to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They include the Whole, or chief Part of antient Grant to <hi>Dellius;</hi> which has ≈øince been parcelled out among the Military. They are numerous, large in Extent, but unattended (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in very few In≈øtances) with the lea≈øt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>THEY all originated at, and ≈øince the Time of the <hi>French</hi> Encroachments at <hi>Crown-Point</hi> in 1731, and ≈øeveral of them are ≈øo late as the Years 1757, and 1758: A Period when we were actually at War with <hi>France,</hi> concerning the≈øe very Lands!</p>
            <p>THE Number and Extent of the≈øe Grants, and how de≈øtructive it mu≈øt prove to the Rights of the King's Military Subjects, as well as to others, to give them the lea≈øt Countenance, will be ≈øeen by a View of the annexed Map and the Notes which accompany it.<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Map No. 1.</note>

            <p>ON this Subject we are furni≈øhed with two Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one pre≈øented to his Maje≈øty by ≈øeveral Per≈øons who≈øe names do not appear in the Copy; the other to the Lords of Trade, by Mon≈øieur <hi>De Lolbinier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Merits of the≈øe Petitions are founded, 1≈øt. On an A≈ø≈øertion that the Lands in que≈øtion lie within the ancient Bounds of <hi>Canada</hi> as <hi>peaceably</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed for many Years by the <hi>French,</hi> and have only been <hi>added</hi> to the Colony of <hi>New-York</hi> by the

On the <hi>actual Improvements and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Petitioners or their Grantors. 4th. On their having, in many Ca≈øes, paid the Governor of <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Quint or fifth Part of the original Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe Money of their re≈øpective Seigniories, and done Faith and Homage, and having been put in full Sei≈øen in the King's Name. 5th. On the Hard≈øhip of their having been turned out of Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion, by Titles granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> and being further threatened with the ≈øame Di≈øtre≈øs.</p>
            <p>We have anticipated the three fir≈øt of the≈øe A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertions. 1≈øt. <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> nor any of the Lands Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> were ever a Part of <hi>Canada,</hi> but rightfully belonged to the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as within his Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and as the Country of the Five Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his Subjects; nor were they ever in the <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>French.</hi> They were invaded in Time of profound Peace, with an armed Power. they were held by the ≈øame unju≈øtifiable Means. They were the Source of perpetual Contention and Blood≈øhed between the Provinces of <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>New-York.</hi> They were a chief Occa≈øion of two bloody Wars between the Nations. Can this be called <hi>a Title or a peaceable Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion?</hi> 2d. We have ≈øhown that neither the Articles of Capitulation, nor the Treaty, can ≈øerve the Purpo≈øe of the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. The Capitulation can only apply to what the <hi>French</hi> had a Right to, and not to what they had unju≈øtifiably ≈øeized; and as to the Clau≈øe of
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:013102_0202_0F8EC521976F11B8"/>the Treaty, it only gives leave to the <hi>French</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ≈øell their E≈øtates in <hi>Canada,</hi> but does not confirm or concern <hi>di≈øputable,</hi> and much le≈øs <hi>tortious and fraudulent Grants,</hi> founded in Breach of Faith; nor can it create a Right which had no prior Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence. Be≈øides, this is a Point which the Crown has already ≈øolemnly determined, and it is pre≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there can be little danger of the Change of a Re≈øolution grounded on the cleare≈øt Dictates of Rea≈øon and Ju≈øtice. 3d. As to the third Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and Improvements by the Canadian Claimants and their Grantors, it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any ≈øuch (worthy of Con≈øideration) have ever been made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crown-Point</hi> was a Place of Arms, and ≈øo was <hi>Tieonderoga.</hi> The≈øe important Pa≈ø≈øes the <hi>French</hi> forfeited to facilitate their Ho≈øtilities again≈øt <hi>New-York,</hi> and not for the Sake of Cultivation; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on the Conque≈øt of the Country, few <hi>French</hi> Improvements were found, and tho≈øe within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Compa≈øs about the Forts, and for the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of their Garri≈øons. With the≈øe incon≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Exceptions, the Country was a de≈øolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs all along on both Sides of the Lake. 4th. As to the Payment of the Quint or fifth of the original Purcha≈øe Money of their re≈øpective Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories, and their having been put into full Sei≈øen in the King's Name; the Canadian Claimants have pointed out no In≈øtances. We may however, venture to affirm that this A≈ø≈øertion, if it relates to the Lands on the South Part of <hi>Lake-Champlain,</hi> cannot be ≈øupported; nor, with re≈øpect to the re≈øt,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:013102_0203_0F8EC521E2C86B40"/>is it to be pre≈øumed that a Governor or any Crown Officer of <hi>Quebec,</hi> would interfere with the Lands or Affairs of the Colony of <hi>New-York.</hi> If ≈øuch Acts have been performed, in any ≈øingle In≈øtance, we ≈øuppo≈øe it concerned Lands near the North End of the Lake, and was only calculated to give ≈øome Colour and Countenance to a Claim ≈øo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs: Be it as it may, this Government (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could rightfully interpo≈øe) has had no Agency in any ≈øuch Acts, and they mu≈øt therefore be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as of no Validity. 5th. The fifth Sugge≈øtion,‚Äîthe Hard≈øhip of their having been turned out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion by Titles granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> and being further threatened with the ≈øame Di≈øtre≈øs,‚Äîis al≈øo without Foundation. No <hi>French</hi> Claimant has been evicted, nor has a ≈øingle Suit of any kind been pro≈øecuted again≈øt them. Indeed there could be no Room for it, for as we before ob≈øerved, ≈øince they abandoned their Forts and Settlements, in 1759, there has been no Attempt to re-e≈øtabli≈øh them. Some tran≈øient People from that Colony, have been employed on the Lakes in the Lumber Trade, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Leave of the <hi>New-York</hi> Proprietors, or as mere Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øers) but we have no Proof of a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Improvement or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, <hi>≈øince the War,</hi> under a Canadian Grant.</p>
            <p>BESIDES all the≈øe Objections, it is worth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Petitioners a≈øk what is improper in it≈øelf, and, as we humbly conceive, out of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Crown to Grant.</p>
            <p n="1">1≈øt. THEY aim at enjoying their Seigniories ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their original Tenures, which depend on the Laws and Cu≈øtoms of <hi>France.</hi> It is difficult
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:013102_0204_0F8EC525F6C18078"/>to comprehend how the≈øe Tenures can prevail in this Colony, where ≈øuch Laws and U≈øages are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and where all E≈øtates are held under the Crown upon Quit-Rents, in free and Common Socage as the Manor of <hi>Ea≈øt-Greenwich,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> is held in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Tenure aimed at by the Petitioners, was free from this Objection, it would be a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Rights of the Crown, which derives a very valuable Revenue from the Quit-Rent of 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Sterling, upon every Hundred Acres of Land granted in this Colony.</p>
            <p>BUT, 2dly. It is pre≈øumed that no <hi>pre≈øent</hi> Act, or Order of the Crown, can have any legal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Grants in Que≈øtion. They mu≈øt ≈øtand or fall by the Rules of Law.</p>
            <p>IF the Limits of the <hi>French</hi> Colony of <hi>Canada,</hi> originally extended as far Southward as is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted, and if the Articles of the Capitulation and Treaty, operate as a Confirmation of the Canadian Grants, then the≈øe Claimants have a good Title at Law: This Que≈øtion, in a Cour≈øe of Litigation, will come judically before the King in Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, on an Appeal from the Judgments of the Courts of our Province, if either Party ≈øhould be di≈ø≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The Petitioners need not be apprehen≈øive of Partiality, becau≈øe as a Deci≈øion here (upon the Point of Title) is not final, no Inju≈øtice can be done but what the Crown will eventually redre≈øs. To take up and determine the Matter extra judically, and without hearing the <hi>New-York</hi> Grantees, would
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013102_0205_0F8EC526DB729898"/>not only be premature but inconclu≈øive, for we ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>a mere exparte Order of the Crown</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Title. The Royal Interpo≈øition wou'd be very con≈øi≈øtent if the Lands had remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patented; but here the Crown in every View hath parted with it's Right.‚ÄîIf the Canadian Principle is ju≈øt, to them, by the Capitulation and Treaty;‚ÄîIf it is in≈øupportable, then to the <hi>New-York</hi> Grantees under the Great Seal of this Province.</p>
            <p>But admitting that the Order of the Crown would be deci≈øive,‚Äîthat this is an extraordinary Ca≈øe, which ought not to move or depend upon the nice Principles of Law,‚Äîand that the Rules of Equity and Policy ought alone to be con≈øulted. This I≈ø≈øue, we conceive, mu≈øt be equally favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Military Grantees, under <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1≈øt. WITH re≈øpect to the Merits of the different Claimants, the <hi>French</hi> Subjects received their Grants from their Prince, for their Services in an unju≈øt Encroachment upon the Briti≈øh Crown; and in Violation of our original Rights, and of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> The Military, who hold under <hi>New-York,</hi> received their Titles by virtue of his Maje≈øty's Proclamation, and as a Recompence for their Valour, in defence of his ju≈øt and ancient Dominions. To reward the Aggre≈ø≈øors at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the King's faithful Subjects, ≈øeems incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with every Idea of Ju≈øtice. But it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Honour of the Crown is engaged to ≈øupport the Millitary Grants under <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR, 2dly. It would be≈øpeak a Language very
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013102_0206_0F8EC528574CA150"/>different from the Proclamation, and prove, in≈øtead of a Reward, a ≈øevere Puni≈øhment to People who have de≈øerved ≈øo much, if his Maje≈øty, after a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Limits between the two Colonies,‚Äîafter ≈øo fully ≈øignifying that it was his Royal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give no Confirmation to the≈øe Canadian Claims,‚Äîafter all the Trouble and Expence they have been put to in obtaining their Surveys, and maintaining their Grants, and ≈øettling and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their Lands,‚Äî≈øhould now by any Order, que≈øtion or impeach their Validity; and which mu≈øt involve them in the utmo≈øt Perplexity and Di≈øtre≈øs.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To confirm Claims, derived under the Authority of <hi>France,</hi> to the Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> would hold up to the World a ≈øtrange Picture of the Ju≈øtice and Equity of the Briti≈øh Court. After engaging in two bloody Wars, and particularly the la≈øt in Re≈øentment of ≈øuch flagrant Encroachments, ≈øhould it now be admitted that <hi>Canada</hi> extended as it's Advocates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what would be the Inference? Mu≈øt it not nece≈ø≈øarily follow, that the Occupancy of the Lakes, <hi>Crown Point, Tieonderoga,</hi> &amp;c. was no Inva≈øion or Act of Ho≈øtility, but the Exertion of a rightful Sovereignty? And con≈øequently, that we were the Aggre≈ø≈øors in tho≈øe Wars, and not the <hi>French;</hi> for nothing le≈øs could be implied in the Confirmations ≈øollicited.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> and <hi>Lake George,</hi> open a mo≈øt important Communication, and may be ju≈øtly called a Key to the Northern Briti≈øh Colonies
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:013102_0207_0F8EC528C3AEE2E8"/>However humbled in the Cour≈øe of a War, which has crowned <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with unexampled Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs, it is natural to think the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> will long look with an affectionate Eye towards their former Prince. The Canadian Barons in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, lo≈øe a flattering Weight and Di≈øtinction; while under the Dominion of the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> they are ≈øunk into mere Commons. Their Language, their Laws, and their Manners, but above all, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, mu≈øt for an Age to come, forbid a cordial Attachment to our Government. They may not be without Hopes that the Fortune of War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two powerful and rival Nations, may one Day give <hi>France</hi> ≈øuch an A≈øcendency as to reduce us to the Nece≈ø≈øity of re≈øtoring <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM this View, it mu≈øt be very impolitic to ≈øuffer the <hi>French,</hi> altho' now our Fellow Subjects, to ≈øettle on tho≈øe Lakes, ≈øince it will give them the fulle≈øt Opportunity of a≈ø≈øi≈øting their Countrymen in invading and di≈øtre≈ø≈øing this and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colonies, and e≈øtabli≈øhing a Footing, on the fir≈øt Rupture, in the Heart of our Country. On the other Hand, if the fertile Lands ≈øurrounding the Lakes, were peopled with the King's natural born Subjects, this Danger, which ought not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øsly to be de≈øpi≈øed, would be avoided; it's ill Con≈øequences be prevented, and the Canadians them≈øelves, even if they ≈øhould be inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, would be over awed into Subjection.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not all.‚ÄîIf ever <hi>Canada</hi> ≈øhould be the Subject of a Ce≈ø≈øion to <hi>France,</hi> what were her ancient Bounds mu≈øt become a nece≈ø≈øary Que≈øtion? Her original Grants to the Canadians, ≈øupported
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013102_0208_0F8EC529953A8260"/>by the Confirmation of the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> wold be con≈øidered as irre≈øi≈øtible Evidence of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Right; and thus not only <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> but <hi>Lake George,</hi> which are both inter≈øper≈øed with the≈øe Grants, would fall again into the Hands of <hi>France.</hi> The Po≈ø≈øibility of an Altercation of this Nature, will be wholly removed by con≈øidering the Claims of the Canadians to the Lands on tho≈øe Lakes, as unworthy of Attention.</p>
            <p>UPON the Whole, viewing this Subject in every Light, upon the Principles of original Right,‚ÄîTreaty and Ce≈ø≈øion,‚ÄîLaw and Ju≈øtice,‚ÄîEquity and Policy, it is conceived that the Military and other Grants under the Seal of this Province, ought not to be impeached; and that the Canadian Claims, extravagant in them≈øelves, and de≈øtitute of all Foundation, ought to be rejected.</p>
