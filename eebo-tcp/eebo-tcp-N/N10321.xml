            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:013102_0003_0F8EBBDE797C0C98"/>and receive and return ſuch Articles as they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And that it would therefore be much more convenient and happy for them to be under the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>WITH Reſpect to the Southweſt Part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Land aforeſaid it muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River muſt <q>conſtitute the Centre of Trade,</q> &amp;c. to the Inhabitants thereof. But Three Qurters or more of that Diſtrict of diſputed Lands, from the Contiguouſneſs thereof to Lake Champlain, and remote Situation from <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, equally conſtitute Lake Champlain, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, &amp;c. the Centre of Trade for its Inhabitants.—Furthermore, it is no Way incompatable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Inhabitants of the Southweſt Quarter of the Diſtrict aforeſaid ſhould Trade at <hi>New-York,</hi> although they may be ſuppoſed to be under the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> The following Exhibitions, will undoubtedly convince the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader that the ſaid Inhabitants would be under vaſtly greater Advantage, to trade at <hi>New-York,</hi> or any where elſe, on Proviſo they ſhould be re-annexed to the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> for then they would peaceably enjoy the Right of ſoil of Lands they poſſeſs, which, under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>New-York</hi> they cannot. A Number of Families that have ſpent their Subſtance in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Lands of the Government of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and in removing from a great Diſtance to the Premiſes, and in making Improvements thereon; provided they ſhould be diſinherited, would make a very indifferent Figure trading at <hi>New-York.</hi>

                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:013102_0004_0F8EBBDF4511CE48"/>
HIS Majeſty, ever graciouſly diſpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt and Good of his Subjects, and viewing the Eſtabliſhment of the juriſdictional Line between the reſpective Governments, as not interfering with the private Property of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and in this View of the Caſe, perceiving a manifeſt Convenience, at leaſt for a Part of that Diſtrict, to be annexed to the Province of <hi>New-York;</hi> and the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> not being notified of Tryal (which is ſuppoſed to be owing to the Neglect of their Agent) by which Means his Majeſty and Council could have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation but from the Repreſentations from <hi>New-York;</hi> came to a Determination of the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Line <hi>Exparte;</hi> which is probably the Cauſe why it extended ſo far Eaſt as the weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. This Event proved exceeding unfortunate to the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers: From which they may compute the Date of their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Government of <hi>New-York;</hi> this put it in the Power of that crafty, deſinging, &amp; monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing Government, to exerciſe that Uſurpation towards the Inhabitants aforeſaid, exhibited in the following Sheets.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had <hi>New-York</hi> obtained the Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Governor <hi>Colden</hi> began to Patent, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain celebrated Attornies and principal Gentleman in the Province, the very Lands on which the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers dwelt; and it is a more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable and complicated Wickedneſs in Governor <hi>Colden;</hi> inaſmuch as but a little before he perſwaded his graciouſly diſpoſed Majeſty into an Opinion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013102_0005_0F8EBBE019535278"/>that it would be for the Advantage and Happineſs of the Settlers aforesaid to be under the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>New-York.</hi> A complaint of the Conduct of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> relative to their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Patent upon Patent, as aforeſaid, being laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty, who with the Advice of his Privy Council was graciouſly pleaſed to prohibit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York</hi> from Patenting any of the ſaid Diſtrict of Land patented by the Governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> as aforeſaid, on Pain of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's higheſt Diſpleaſure. Notwithſtanding, the ſame Lieutenant Governor <hi>Colden,</hi> Governor <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> have, each and every of them, in their reſpective Turns in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſumed to violate the ſaid Royal Command, by Patenting to certain of their own Favourites and Gentlemen of Influence, ſundry valuable Tracts of Land contained in, and belonging to the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Premiſes; the moſt of which Land being at the Time of patenting in actual Poſſeſſion and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy by People claiming the ſame Lands by Virtue of prior Patents from the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEXTLY, in the Courſe of this Narrative it is neceſſary to take a retroſpective View to July Term, in the Year 1769, at which the Claimants under <hi>New-York,</hi> being Non-reſidents, brought Actions of Ejectment in the Supreme Court againſt ſundry of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> who were in actual Poſſeſſion of the conteſted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: but part if not all of the Judges and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies being intereſted in the ſaid ſubſequent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013102_0006_0F8EBBE4505B58F0"/>from the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and ſome of the principal Attornies, Patentees of the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Patents then on Tryal. And the Plaintiffs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in great Faſhion and State, which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Fraternity of Land-monopolizers, made a briliant Appearance. But the Defendants appearing in but ordinary Faſhion, having been greatly fatigued by hard Labour, wrought on the diſputed Premiſes, made a very diſproportionable Figure at Court; and, in fine, Intereſt, Connection, and Grandeur, eaſily turned the Caſe againſt the forlorn Defendants: The whole Diſtrict of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were greatly alarm'd at the Event that had begun to take Place, were in great Conſternation, each Individual reading his own intolerable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction from that which had already began.</p>
               <p>STILL there was more Actions of Ejectment commenced againſt ſundry of the Inhabitants, and the Sheriff of Albany County, by ſpecial Order from the Governor, was raiſing the Militia of the County to diſpoſſeſs the Defendants aforeſaid, of their Tenements. This was a moſt melancholy Scene—Women lamenting over their Children, and they crying; and Men pierced to the Heart with the moſt pungent Grief and Affection for them, and bitter Indignation at the approaching Tyranny of <hi>New-York.</hi> And what renders the Reflection of the Conflict more doleful, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the extreme Fatigue, Hunger, and infinite Hardſhips the Inhabitants had undergone in the Settlement and Cultivation of a Wilderneſs Country: It ſtill adds a twinge to the Smart to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013102_0007_0F8EBBE5EF97B740"/>take a retroſpect on the Interim; and view the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies and wealthy Gentlemen in the Province (and moſt of them in the City) of <hi>New-York</hi> "which fared ſumptuouſly every Day" peruſing the old obſolete and abdicated Charter from King Charles to the Duke of York, and inſpecting into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots</hi> and <hi>Hudſon's</hi> exploring this Continent; and withal, inſpecting cloſely, whether in ancient Time ſome Dutchman had not Poſſeſſion of ſome part of the abdicated Premiſes; and by ſuch round-about and ſalacious Pretences of deducing a Title, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ruin of the Inhabitants aforeſaid.—But to return to the Sheriff and the Poſſe of <hi>Albany</hi> County, who were in motion to diſpoſſeſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, Defendants aforeſaid, and deliver their Tenements to the Claimants under <hi>New-York.</hi> The Inhabitants being thus drove to the Extremity of either quiting their Country and Poſſeſſions, or make forceable Oppoſition to the Sheriff and Poſſe. In this State of Deſperacy they put on Fortitude, and choſe the latter Expedient, and managed with that Oeconomy that they defeated the Sheriff in diſpoſſeſſing them, without Bloodſhed: Though it ſhould be confeſſed that this Event was but partly owing to the Fortitude of the Inhabitants; the greateſt Reaſon was this, the People of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in general (but particularly thoſe that compoſe the Poſſe of the ſaid County of <hi>Albany</hi>) were fully perſwaded and conſcious, that the Cauſe of the Inhabitants was juſt; and that the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees was Oppreſſive and unjuſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would not hazard their lives to defend

               <p>THERE had before this time been ſeveral leſſer Combinations of the People of thoſe Grants to defend their Perſons and Properties from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of <hi>New-York,</hi> which by them are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opprobrious Names of Riots, Mobs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Felony, &amp;c—After the ineffectual Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Poſſe, the Land-Monopolizers in the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> adopted different Meaſures to accompliſh their Deſigns; perceiving they could not raiſe a Militia, that would Fight for the Title of their Subſequent Patents, and they being a cringing, fawnig, deceitful Fraternity; not enured to the Horrors of War, or any thing Heroic, durſt not Fight for their own Claims: Their accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Way, to carry Paints, being to deceive, cheat and over reach the Commonality of their Species, under a Pretence of Law, Juſtice, good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great pretended Zeal of Loyalty, &amp;c. They were therefore obliged to follow their old beaten Road of Politics, and by their Influence, cauſed to be indicted as Rioters, every of the moſt bold, ſpirited and leading Men, who were active in defending either their Country or themſelves, againſt their moſt egregious and intreiguing Wiles; hopeing to make ſuch an Example of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as to frighten the Reſt into their deſpotic Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.—The Inhabitants in general viewing this to be their Policy, guarded againſt it, and were active in defending themſelves, their Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo indicted, being fully perſwaded that the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013102_0009_0F8EBBE85EF811F0"/>Fraternity of <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees were the Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Planers of thoſe Indictments; and that they eventually, by ſuch Stratagems, deſigned to avail themſelves of the Fee-ſimple of the Lands which they, the aforeſaid Inhabitants poſſeſſed. And as for the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, and ſuch part of the Authority and People as they could Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they were active, endeavouring by all and every Method to apprehend the Rioters (ſo called) and puniſh them as Criminals: The Struggles that enſued between the Parties relative to taking and defending Rioters, terminated in Wrath, Strife, and Ill-Will: The Conſequences ariſing therefrom, (which are too prolix to be inſerted) are very ingeniouſly ſummed up in theſe Words, "Where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and every Evil Work." Tho' it is common (and almoſt without Exception) for both Parties to be more or leſs blameable in ſo long and ſpirited a Controverſy; yet in the Inſtances before us, it is beyond Diſpute certain, that the Yorkers act offenſively, and the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively, which will more fully appear.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Nathan Clark,</hi> Chairman of the Committee of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers aforeſaid, ordered the Clerk to read the Reſolves and Votes aforeſaid, to the general Committee, which was accordingly read ſundry Times, and the following Draught being preſented in Anſwer thereto, to the Publick Meeting; Seven Perſons were ſelected and choſen out of the ſaid general Committee, to examine the ſame, and report their Opinion thereon, which here follows.</p>
                  <p>"WHEN we conſider the numberleſs Troubles,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013102_0014_0F8EBBEBFB7E1A40"/>and almoſt inſurmountable Difficulties which our infant Settlements have been forced to ſtruggle with, ſince its firſt Beginning, which have been occaſioned by an unequal and biaſſed Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law, ever ſince our unhappy Misfortune of being annexed to a Government in which the Intereſt of the greater Part of the leading Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen thereof are in direct Oppoſition to our's. The tyrannical Meaſures they take to enſlave us, (we hope) will not fail to juſtify us in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments and Reſolves thereon; for we think it an intolerable Hardſhip, and Piece of inhuman Cruelty, that we cannot be ſaid to give ſufficient Proof of our Loyalty and Obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but at the Reſignation of our whole Fortunes, in the Purchaſe and Improvement of which, we have ſuffered an Infinity of Hardſhips. Yet, at the ſame Time, impreſſed with a Senſe of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we return our thankful Acknowledgment to theſe worthy Gentlemen, Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> and ſundry of His Majeſty's honorable Council, for the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> for their ſignal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to us in ſome Time paſt; which has, in ſome Degree, alleviated and ſupported us, under our heavy Troubles and Oppreſſions. But when we conſider that his Excellency is about to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and while we view the Spirit of the General Aſſembly, in their Reſolves; we cannot but reflect with ſome Regret, on what may of Conſequence prove the Reſult (without an Alteration) of their preſent Opinion; but there
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013102_0015_0F8EBBECDA97D0C8"/>are ſcarce any Circumſtances that entirely exclude Hope; therefore we are not yet in total Diſpair: For this Moment we happily call to Mind, that the General Aſſembly of the ſame Province, about two Years ago, did annex all that Part of the <hi>Bay</hi> Province, Weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to that UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMITED County of <hi>Albany;</hi> but their avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grappling not being of a ſufficient Strength for ſuch an unreaſonable Burthen, it failed, by which they loſt their ideal Booty.</p>
                  <p>"THE candid Reader will doubtleſs obſerve, that in the Reſolves of the Aſſembly afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, there is not a ſingle Word mentioned in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Title of the Land conteſted for, but that they level all their Spleen, and point all their Malice at notorious Rioters, as they call them, and make a pretended Shew and Figure, as though they were great Sticklers for good Order and Government; although at the ſame Time every Perſon of common Senſe, who has had any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Knowledge of the Controverſy, abſolutely knows, that our goodly Land, with the Labour thereon, is the only ſubject Matter, and grand Object of the whole Controverſy; and give the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> but that, and the Matter would be accompliſhed to their eternal Satisfaction; and it is preſumed the Words Riotous, Diſorderly, Licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grantees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occupants, for the whole Courſe of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Century.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013102_0016_0F8EBBED965F6EA8"/>
"FOR the Truth of the Caſe is, the Executors of the Law, are moſt (if not all) of them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Claimants to the Lands whereon the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grantees and Occupants dwell, and their Judgments on Writs of Ejectment, brought by the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, have not hitherto failed to correſpond with their imaginary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; but were they honeſt Men they would not undertake to be Judges in their own Caſe, or in any other wherein the Reſolution thereof would make a Preſident, for their own, eſpecially in Title of Land wherein Judge and Plaintiff are connected in one common Intereſt: ſuch a Diſtribution of Law is contrary to the Law of Reaſon and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—</p>
                  <p>"Therefore our Caſe ſtands thus, if we ſubmit to their Execution of Law, and become obedient and ſubmiſſive Subjects of their deſigning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt ſoon yield to be their Tenants and Slaves; and we cannot ſee Reaſon to conform to any Law, or ſuch Branches of it, as will apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring us and our Poſterity into Bondage, or manifeſtly deprive us of our Property; but inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we boldly adhere to the Maintenance of our Property, which to us is very precious, as it would be to the <hi>New-Yorkers,</hi> was it in their hands; we find it is immediately recommended to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Province by the General Aſſembly, to iſſue his Proclamation, Offering therein large Sums of Money to apprehend thoſe notorious
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013102_0017_0F8EBBEE4ADB1550"/>Rioters (as they are pleaſed to ſtile them) but any one who has had Opportunity to read the Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and particular Articles of the public Faith, pledged by the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> to the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grantees and Settlers, dated in July Anno Domini 1772, will immediately find a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon for the Governor's not ſigning ſuch a Proclamation; for it muſt indeed be ſhocking to common Senſe when the Reader comes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what notorious Complaints, and moſt horrid Accuſations are ſet forth in the Reſolves of the General Aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> mentioned in the fore Part of this Paper, againſt Thouſands of hard labouring, induſtrious, honeſt Peaſants, who are in Truth loyal Subjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, for their Violations of Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when at the ſame Time the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Orders from his Moſt Sacred Majeſty, to that litigious Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> will plainly ſhow that they do not make the leaſt Heſitation, to rebel and act in direct Oppoſition to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Crown, when (as in the preſent Caſe) they ſhow a Diſpoſition to take Advantage of the minor Part of thoſe under their Government; and throw them into Contention and Diſorder; and thereby build their Fortunes on the Ruin of the pretended Aggreſſors; and all under the ſpecious Pretence of good Order and Government which is in Fact what they eventually aim at, as will appear by the following Order.</p>

               <head>From the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Gazette, No. 915. REMARKS, &amp;c. on ſome late Laws, paſſed in <hi>New-York.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HIS Excellency Governor <hi>Tryon</hi> in Conformity to the Addreſſes of the General Aſſembly of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> having on the 9th Day of March 1774, with the Advice of his Council, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his Proclamation, offering therein large Sums of Money, for the Purpoſe of apprehending and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013102_0036_0F8EBC00C4FAC7C0"/>impriſoning the following Perſons, viz. <hi>Ethan Alten, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge,</hi> and <hi>John Smith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND whereas, his Excellency the Governor, by the ſame Proclamation, hath ſtrictly enjoined and commanded all Magiſtrates, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and other civil Officers of the Counties of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>Charlotte,</hi> to be active and vigilant in apprehending, and impriſoning the Perſons above named; and we the aforeſaid Perſons, who have hereunto ſubſcribed, being conſcious that our Cauſe is good and equitable, in the Sight of GOD, and all unprejudiced and honeſt Men, are determined at all Events, to maintain, and defend the ſame, 'till his Majeſty's Pleaſure ſhall be known, concerning the Validity of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Grants.—And we now proclaim to the Public, not only for Ourſelves, but for the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grantees, and Occupants in general; that the Spring and moving Cauſe of our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> was Self-Preſervation, viz. Firſtly, the Preſervation and maintaining of our Property: And Secondly, ſince that Government is ſo incenſed againſt us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtands us in Hand to defend our Lives; for it appears, by a late Set of Laws paſſed by the Legiſlature thereof, that the Lives, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers are manifeſtly ſtruck at; but, that the Public may rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Eſſence of the Controverſy, we now proclaim to thoſe Law-Givers, and to the World,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013102_0037_0F8EBC00F9681B20"/>that if the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees will remove their Patents that have been ſubſequently lapped and laid on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Charters, and quiet us in our Poſſeſſions, agreeable to his Majeſty's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and ſuſpend thoſe criminal Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us, for being Rioters (as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly denominated) then will our Settlers be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and ſubmiſſive Subjects to Government; but be it known to that deſpotic Fraternity of Law-Makers, and Law-Breakers, that we will not be fooled or frighted out of our Property; they have broke over his Majeſty's expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, in patenting thoſe Lands, and when they act in Conformity to the regal Authority of Great-Britain, it will be ſoon enough for us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them. It is well known by all wiſe and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Perſons in the neighbouring Governments, (that have animadverted on the Controverſy) that their pretended Zeal for good Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is fallacious, and that they aim at the Lands and Labours of the Grantees and Settlers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: and that they ſubvert the good and wholeſome Laws of the Realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>AND, inaſmuch as the Malignity of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards us, hath flamed to an immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable and murtherous Degree, they have in their new-fangled Laws, calculated for the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, paſſed the 9th of March, 1774; ſo calculated them, as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the depravedneſs of their Minds and Morals; in them Laws, they have exhibited their
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013102_0038_0F8EBC055FB8E538"/>genuine Pictures. The Emblems of their inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and blood-guiltineſs of Diſpoſition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is therein portraited in that tranſparent Image of themſelves, which cannot fail to be a Blot, and an infamous Reproach to them, to Poſterity.—We cannot ſuppoſe that every of his Majeſty's Council, or that all the Members of the General Aſſembly were active in paſſing ſo bloody and unconſtitutional a Set of Laws; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, ſome of them diſapproved thereof; and it is altogether poſſible, that many that were active in making the Law, were impoſed upon by falſe Repreſentations, and acted under miſtaken Views of doing Honour to Government; but be this as it will, it appears that there was a Majority. And it has been too much the Caſe with that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for a Number of deſigning Schemers, and Land-Jockeys, to rule the ſame. Let us take a View of their former narrow and circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Boundaries, and how, by Legerdemain, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and Deceptions of one Sort or other, they have extended their Domain far and wide; they have wrangled with, and encroached on all their neighbouring Governments, and have uſed all Manner of Deceit and Fraud to accompliſh their Deſigns: Their Tenants groan under their Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Oppreſſion; and they have gained, as well as merited the Diſapprobation and Abhorrence of their Neighbours, and the innocent Blood they have already ſhed, calls for Heaven's Vengeance on their guilty Heads; and if they ſhould come forth in arms againſt us, thouſands of their injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013102_0039_0F8EBC0634C62D78"/>and diſſatisfied Neighbours in the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, will join with us, to cut off, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate ſuch an execrable Race from the Face of the Earth!</p>
               <p>THIS Piece is not ſuppoſed to contain a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the new conſtructed Set of Laws aforeſaid; for ſuch a large TWO-YEAR OLD, hath never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſeen in America, it being of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and monſtrous Birth; nor is it ſuppoſed to give the Legiſlators their full Characters: But ſo much, and a little more may ſuffice for the preſent. To quote the Laws, and make Remarks thereon, would be Matter ſufficient for a Volume: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we will yet make ſome few ſhort Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, NEGATIVELY, it is not a Law for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> in general, but,</p>
               <p n="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a Law but for Part of the Counties of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and <hi>Albany;</hi> viz. Such Parts thereof, as are covered with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> CHARTERS, and it is well known thoſe Grants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but a minor Part of the Inhabitants of the ſaid Province; and we have no Repreſentative in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: The firſt Knowledge we had of ſaid Laws, was the Completion of them; which informed us, that if we aſſembled, Three or more of us together, to oppoſe (that which they call legal) Authority, we ſhall be adjudged Felons, and ſuffer the Pains of Death; and that ſame Fraternity of Plotters knew, as well as we, and the generality of the People in the adjacent Colonies, that they have for a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013102_0040_0F8EBC0852A233E0"/>of Years laſt paſt, endeavoured to exerciſe ſuch a Courſe of what they call Law, that had they not been oppoſed by the People of theſe Grants (called the MOB) in the executing the ſame, they would before this Time, have been in Poſſeſſion of that Territory, for which the Laws aforeſaid are calculated. Therefore the Caſe ſtands thus: If we oppoſe civil Officers, in taking Poſſeſſion of our Farms, we are, by theſe Laws, denominated Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons; or if we defend our Neighbours, who have been indicted Rioters, only for defending our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; we are likewiſe adjudged Felons. In fine, every Oppoſition to their monarchial Government is deemed Felony, and at the End of every ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there is the Word DEATH! And the ſame Laws further impower the reſpective Judges, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided any Perſons, to the Number of Three, or more, that ſhall oppoſe any Magiſtrate, or other civil Officer, and be not taken, that after a legal Warning of Seventy Days, if they do not come and yield themſelves up to certain Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Purpoſe of ſecuring them; then it ſhall be lawful for the Judges aforeſaid, to award Execution of DEATH, the ſame as tho' he or they had been convicted or attainted before a proper Court of Judicature, &amp;c. The candid Reader will doubtleſs obſerve, that the diabolical Deſign of this Law, is to obtain Poſſeſſion of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, or to make the People that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them Out-Laws, and ſo kill them whenever they can catch them.</p>
               <p>THOSE bloody Law-Givers know we are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013102_0041_0F8EBC093A921460"/>to oppoſe their Execution of Law, where it points directly at our Property, or give up the ſame: But there is one Thing is Matter of Conſolation to us, viz. that printed Sentences of Death will not kill us when we are at a Diſtance; and if the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners approach us, they will be as likely to fall Victims to Death as we: And that Perſon, or Country of Perſons, are Cowards indeed, if they cannot as manfully fight for their Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Life, as Villains can to deprive them thereof.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>New-York</hi> Schemers accuſe us with many Things, Part of which are true, and Part not.—With Reſpect to reſcuing Priſoners for Debt, it is <hi>falſe.</hi> As to aſſuming judicial Powers, we <hi>have not,</hi> except a well-regulated Combination of the People to defend their juſt Rights, may be called ſo. As to forming ourſelves into Military Order, and aſſuming Military Commands, the <hi>New-York</hi> Poſſies, and Military Preparations, Oppreſſions, &amp;c. <hi>obliged us to it.</hi> Probably Meſſ. <hi>Duane, Kemp,</hi> and <hi>Banyer,</hi> of <hi>New-York,</hi> will not diſcommend us for ſo expedient a Preparation; more eſpecially ſince the Decrees of the 9th of March, are yet to be put in Execution: And we flatter ourſelves, upon Occaſion, we can muſter as good a Regiment of Mark's-men and Scalpers, as <hi>America</hi> can afford; and we now give the Gentlemen above-named, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Mr. <hi>Bruſh,</hi> and Col. <hi>Ten Broeck,</hi> and, in fine, all the Land-Jobbers of <hi>New-York,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to come and view the Dexterity of our Regiment; and we cannot think of a better Time
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013102_0042_0F8EBC0A88265590"/>for that Purpoſe, than when the Executioners come to kill ſome or all of us, by Virtue of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity their Judges have lately received to award and Sentence us to Death in our Abſence. There is ſtill one more notable Complaint againſt us, viz. That we have inſulted and menaced ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and other civil Officers, ſo that they dare not execute their reſpective Functions: This is <hi>true,</hi> ſo far as it relates to the Magiſtrates. But the Public ſhould be informed, what the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Magiſtrates are: They are commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for the ſole Purpoſe of doing us all the Harm and Miſchief they poſſibly can, through their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and Influence; and that they might be ſubſervient to the wicked Deſigns of the <hi>New-York</hi> Schemers. Theſe are their Functions; and the Public need no further Proof than the Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that they are the Tools of thoſe extravagant Law-Makers; and it muſt be owned, they acted with great Judgment, in chuſing the moſt infernal Inſtruments for their Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>DRACO, the <hi>Athenian</hi> Lawgiver, cauſed a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Laws (in many Reſpects analogous to thoſe we have been ſpeaking of) to be <hi>written</hi> in Blood. But our modern <hi>Draco</hi>'s determine to have their's <hi>verified</hi> in Blood. They well know we ſhall more than <hi>Three,</hi> nay, more than <hi>Three Times Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> aſſemble together, if Need be, to maintain our common Cauſe, till his Majeſty determines who ſhall be and remain the Owners of the Land in Conteſt. <hi>"Wilt not thou poſſeſs that which Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, thy God giveth thee to poſſeſs?"</hi> So will we
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013102_0043_0F8EBC0AEB1C29D0"/>poſſeſs that which the Lord our God (and King) giveth us to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>AND laſtly, we addreſs ourſelves to the People of the Counties of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>Charlotte,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit to the Weſtward of, and are ſituated conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS, PROVIDENCE having allotted and fixed the Bounds of our Habitations in the ſame Vicinity, which, together with the Intercourſe of Trade and Commerce, hath formed an almoſt univerſal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Tie of Friendſhip between us, and hath laid ſuch a Foundation of Knowledge, that your People in general cannot but be ſenſible that the Title of our Land is in Reality the Bone of Contention, and that as a People, we behave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves orderly; and are induſtrious, and honeſtly diſpoſed; and pay juſt Deference to Order and good Government; and that we mean no more by that which is called the MOB, but to defend our juſt Rights and Properties. We appeal to the Gentlemen Merchants, to inform whether our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, do not exert themſelves to pay their juſt Debts; and whether ever they have been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Country's MOB, in the Collection of their Dues. But as the Magiſtrates, Sheriffs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Sheriffs, Coroners, and Conſtables of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Counties that hold their Poſts of Honor and Profit under our bitter Enemies, we have a Jealouſy, that ſome of them may be induced (to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013102_0044_0F8EBC0B6EA711C8"/>recommend themſelves to thoſe on whom they are dependant, and for the Wages of unrighteouſneſs, offered by Proclamation) to preſume to apprehend ſome of us, or our Friends: We therefore adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſuch Officers, and all Perſons whatſoever, that we are reſolved to inflict <hi>immediate Death</hi> on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may attempt the ſame: And provided any of us or our Party ſhall be taken, and we have not Notice ſufficient to relieve them, or whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them or not, we are reſolved to ſurround ſuch Perſon or Perſons, whether at his or their own Houſe or Houſes, or any where that we can find him or them, and <hi>ſhoot ſuch Perſon or Perſons dead.</hi> And further more, that we will <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> any Perſon or Perſons whomſoever, that ſhall <hi>preſume</hi> to be acceſſary, aiding or aſſiſting in taking any of us as aforeſaid; for by theſe Preſents we give any ſuch diſpoſed Perſon or Perſons to underſtand, that, altho' they have a Licence by the Law afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to <hi>kill</hi> us; and an "Indemnification" for ſuch Murther from the ſame Authority; yet they have no Indemnification for ſo doing, from the GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS; for our Lives, Liberties and Properties are as verily precious to us, as to any of the King's Subjects; and we are as loyal to his Majeſty or his Government, as any Subjects in the Province: But if the Governmental Authority of <hi>New-York</hi> will Judge in their own Caſe, and act in Oppoſition to that of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>killing</hi> us to take poſſeſſion of our "Vineyards" come on, we are ready for a Game of Scalping with them; for our marſhal Spirits glow with Bitter
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013102_0045_0F8EBC0C2D0BCCA0"/>Indignation, and conſumate Fury to Blaſt their Infernal Projections.</p>
               <p>"IT may be the Reader, not having ſeen the Law referred to in this Piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and ſpirited Conflict that hath ſubſiſted between the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> nor of the Progreſſive, Arbitrary and Monopolizing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court Party of the latter of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; may be apt to imagine that the Spirit of this Writing is too ſevere, inaſmuch as it Deſtines whoever preſumes to take us as Felons or Rioters, to immediate Death; but let the Wiſe conſider the State of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. PROVIDED we on our Part be taken, we have by them Laws the Sentence of Death already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt us, on Proviſo more than Three of us aſſemble together to maintain and defend our Property, till his Majeſty determines the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. MAY it be conſidered, that the Legiſlative Authority of the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> had no conſtitutional Right or Power to make ſuch Laws, and conſequently that they are Null and Void, from the Nature and Energy of the Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; therefore as they merit no Place among the Laws of the Realm of Great-Britain, but are the arbitrary League and Combination of our bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mercileſs Enemies, who, to obtain our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, have inhumanly, barbarouſly, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013102_0046_0F8EBC0D1C46A1D8"/>under the ſpecious and hypocritical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of legal Authority, and Veneration for Order and Government, have laid a Snare for our Lives. Can the Public cenſure us for exerting Ourſelves nervouſly to preſerve our Lives in ſo critical a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For by the Laws of the Province, into which we are unfortunately fallen, we cannot be protected in either Property or Life, except we give up the Former to ſecure the Latter; ſo we are reſolved to maintain both, or to hazard or looſe both.</p>
               <p>FROM hence follows a neceſſary Inference, That inaſmuch as our Property, nay our Lives, cannot be protected (but manifeſtly ſtruck at) by the higheſt Authority in the Province to which we at preſent belong; therefore in the Interim, while his Majeſty is determining the Controverſy, and till he ſhall interpoſe his Royal Authory, and ſubject the Authority aboveſaid to their Duty, or re-annex the Diſtrict of diſputed Lands to the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> or ſome Way in his great Wiſdom and Fatherly Clemency, put the diſtreſſed Settlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> on an equal Footing with our Brother Subjects in his Realm; we are under Neceſſity of reſiſting, even unto Blood, every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who may attempt to take us as Felons or Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as aforeſaid; for in this Caſe it is not reſiſting Law, but only oppoſing Force by Force; therefore inaſmuch as by the Oppreſſions aforeſaid, the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers are reduced to the diſagreeable State of Anarchy and Confuſion; in which State we hope for Wiſdom, Patience and Fortitude, till
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013102_0047_0F8EBC0DAA0E3C40"/>the happy Hour his Majeſty ſhall graciouſly be pleaſed to reſtore us to the Privileges of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

We expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Anſwer from your Excellency, to our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition to you delivered ſoon after your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's Acceſſion to the Adminiſtration of the Government, but for Reaſons to us unknown, your Excellency paſſed it by in Silence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we chearfully embrace this Opportunity of laying before your Excellency in Council the true State of our Controverſy, which we can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do, but by abſorbing our perſonal Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Community, and general Cauſe, to which we have obtained the Character of faithful. We aſſure your Excellency that we aſſent to your Authority of Juriſdiction inaſmuch as his Majeſty's Proclamation aſſures us it is his Will and Pleaſure we be under the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> and not only now Aſſent to it, but have ever done the ſame, except in Inſtances where ſuch perverſe Uſe has been made thereof, as would diſpoſſeſs us of our Property and Country, we are truly deſirous, and petitioning his Majeſty to re-annex us to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> But this is not the Ground of our Diſcontent, or at leaſt is far from being the principle Ground of it, though it was done <hi>ex parte,</hi> and we apprehend there were more or leſs wrong Repreſentations made to his Majeſty, to obtain the Juriſdiction: However, it is the unreaſonable and unconſtitutional Exerciſe of it that is the preſent Bone of Contention—our Properties are all at Stake; this we contend for, as the following known
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013102_0055_0F8EBC1588BD80C8"/>Facts will demonſtrate. A certain number of deſigning Men in <hi>New-York</hi> (and elſewhere) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Patents under the Great Seal of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and thoſe Grantees being non-reſidents, brought ſundry Writs of Ejectment againſt the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers on the ſame Land, covered by both Patents as aforeſaid, and obtained Judgment againſt them, and proceeded further and took out Writs of Poſſeſſion, and actually diſpoſſeſſed ſeveral of them by Order of Law, of their Houſes and Farms, leaving them to ſuffer the Inclemency of the Weather, bereaved of all the Neceſſaries of Life, their new Maſters having monopolized their earthly ALL, to themſelves. Theſe indigent Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies having in the firſt Place expended their ſeveral Fortunes, in bringing their Farms out of a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs State, into that of fruitful Feilds, Gardens and Orchards; the whole Country conſiſting of more than Fifteen Hundred Families, was greatly alarm'd at the Event which had already began to take Place, was in the greateſt Conſternation, each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, from theſe Inſtances, reading their own intolerable and univerſal Deſtruction.—Still the Writs of Ejectment came thicker and faſter, and univerſal Slavery, Poverty and Horror, emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically appeared in every Countenance.</p>
               <p>"THUS, things having come to this Paſs, the Oppreſſion was too great for human Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Engliſh Conſtitution, to grope under, for thoſe unparrallelled Inſtances ſtruck an infinitely more terrible Idea, than that of the Exertion of the Powers of Government.</p>

"LAWS and Society-compacts, were made to protect and ſecure the Subjects in their peaceable Poſſeſſions and Properties, and not to ſubvert them. No Perſon or Community of Perſons can be ſuppoſed to be under any particular Compact or Law, except it pre-ſuppoſeth, that that Law will protect ſuch Perſon or Community of Perſons in his or their Properties, for otherways the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would by Law be bound to be acceſſary to his own Ruin and Deſtruction, which is inconſiſtant with the Law of Self-preſervation; but this Law being natural as well as eternal, can never be abrogated by the Law of Men.</p>
               <p>"WE would acquaint your Excellency, that ſince our Misfortune of being annexed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York,</hi> Law has been rather uſed as a Tool (than a Rule of Equity) to cheat us out of the Country, we have made vaſtly valuable by Labour and Expence of our Fortunes.—We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe Things are yet unknown, or in a great Meaſure ſo to your Excellency, as your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's Commencement to the Adminiſtration, hath not been long, and a Set of artful, wicked Men, concealing the Truth from your Excellency, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to make a Booty of us, characterizing us, (ſpeaking of our Inhabitants in general) as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rioters if not Rebels; and we being a poor People at a great Diſtance from your Excellency's Place of Reſidence, fatigued in ſettling a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Country, have little or no Opportunity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting your Excellency of our Greivances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by one ſhort Petition delivered to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013102_0057_0F8EBC1743FF6C18"/>ſoon after your firſt taking Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—and as our Cauſe is repreſented before his Majeſty and Council, we did not expect your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to determine the Controverſy, nor do we yet expect it. We are ſenſible thoſe Men that ſeek our Ruin, thereby to enrich themſelves, do by Stratagems of every Kind, repreſent us to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency as Breakers of the Peace, and Enemies to the Government; and under this Pretence they hope to catch a Number of the boldeſt of our Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and puniſh them in the <hi>New-York</hi> Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with that Severity that the Reſidue may be frightened out of both Liberty and Property; for otherways they would ſoon be indicted Rioters, and thus under Colour of puniſhing Rioters, and a Zeal of Loyalty and Veneration for good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rob the Inhabitants of their Country. If we do not oppoſe the Sheriff and his Poſſy, he takes immediate Poſſeſſion of our Houſes and Farms, if we do, we are immediately indicted Rioters; and when others oppoſe Officers in taking ſuch their Friends ſo indicted, they are alſo indicted and ſo on, there being no End of Indictment againſt us ſo long as we Act the bold and manly Part, and ſtand by our Liberty.—</p>
               <p>"This is a ſhort Sketch of the diſingenuous Cunning of Meſſieurs <hi>Duane,</hi> and <hi>Kemp,</hi> and their Aſſociates; and it comes to this at laſt, that we muſt tamely be diſpoſſeſſed, or oppoſe Officers in taking Poſſeſſion, and as a next neceſſary Step, oppoſe taking of Rioters ſo called, or run away like ſo many Cowards, and quit our Country to a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013102_0058_0F8EBC176A94D548"/>of cringing, polite Gentlemen who have ideal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs'd themſelves of it already.</p>
               <p>"As to ſundry Men who have eloped lately from our Grants, and ſled to <hi>New-York</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Self-preſervation neceſſitated us to treat ſome of them roughly; and others, viz. <hi>Ebenezer Cowle,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan Wheat,</hi> of <hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> fled to <hi>New-York,</hi> on Account of their own Guilt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt or threatened. Would Time permit we could give a rational Account for moſt, or all of our late Conduct towards theſe Men. The general Reaſon is this, namely, they were a Set of Men that loved themſelves, and not their Country, they buſied themſelves in planning and aſſiſting to take Rioters ſo called. In fine, they were the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of that mercenary Core of Yorkers, and did more in Oppreſſing the People, than their prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Benefactors.</p>
               <p>"The Aſſault made upon Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> at Day break, of the Night of the 22d of March laſt, by a Number of Ruffians under the Command of the infamous <hi>John Munro,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was a notorious Riot, and gave Energy and Motion, to the ſubſequent Acts, your Excellency denominates illegal. This <hi>Munro</hi> and his bloody Party, by cuting, wounding and maiming, Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> his Wife and Children, in ſuch an inhuman and Savage Manner, was no leſs than proclaiming himſelf in a moſt public Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be a malicious and bloody Enemy, not only to Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> but alſo to all thoſe Men on our Grants, who manfully adhere to maintaining Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013102_0059_0F8EBC1CE023A940"/>and Property, and inaſmuch as the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Villian is alive, he has no Cauſe of Complaint—for after his Aſſault upon Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> he made another Aſſault upon Mr. <hi>Seth Warner,</hi> but not having ſo ſtrong a Party of Ruffians with him as in his other Expedition, it was not attended with the like Conſequences, for Mr. <hi>Warner,</hi> ſtruck his Head with a dull Cutlaſs, and levelled him to the Ground, but the Blow proved not Mortal, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, for his Satisfaction for the Wound, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the Lives of a Number of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers.—Your Excellency will undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as our Opponents have had the Manufactory of the Civil Laws ſo much under their Power, that this mercileſs Man could not be brought to Juſtice, nor could others among us be ſafe any other Way, but by uſing him in his own Play, he ſet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and enraged the People to mimick him from that natural Principle of juſtice in every Man's own Breaſt.</p>
               <p>"As to the Perfidious and treacherous <hi>Bliſs Willoggby,</hi> he always pretended to be a Friend of the ſaid <hi>Baker's,</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> had ever been truly a Friend of his—this Hypocrite, two Days before <hi>Baker</hi> was taken, made a frivilous Excuſe of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, went to ſaid <hi>Baker's</hi> Houſe, viewed the Strength of it, perceived <hi>Baker</hi> was ſomewhat care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſecure, and made Report to the ſaid <hi>Munro.</hi> In fine, <hi>Willoggby</hi> was the Planner and Inſtigator of that ſavage Cruelty exerciſed to ſaid <hi>Baker,</hi> which was perpetrated and brought into Action by the deteſtible ſaid <hi>Munro.</hi> But to deſiſt, as to the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013102_0060_0F8EBC1FA7F09430"/>Hiſtory of our late tranſaction, whether they be all Right or not, we on our Part have a few Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; Conſiderations more to lay before your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, as to the Cauſe of our Diſcontent, as well as to the Cauſe of our late Actions your Excellency denominates illegal.</p>
               <p>"The Alteration of Juriſdiction in 1764 could not effect private Property: Surely his Majeſty by this Alteration, did not purpoſe to take away the perſonal Property of a large Number of his loyal Subjects, and transfer it to other Subjects; the Engliſh Conſtitution will by no Means admit of this, for the transferring or alienation of Property is a ſacred Prerogative of the true Owner.—Kings and Governors cannot intermeddle therewith. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Your Excellency &amp; Council muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that we have a Petition lying before his Majeſty and Council, for Redreſs of our Grievances. That is an impartial Board; pray why may it not be determined there? For the very indentical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Diſpute, are now and for ſeveral Years paſt, have been lying before that Court, except the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Riotouſneſs, Diſorderly, &amp;c. which is improved as a Handle to ſubvert Property, and that only.</p>
               <p>"FURTHERMORE, in the Time of Sir Henry Moor's Adminiſtration, his Majeſty was pleaſed to lay the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> under abſoluto Prohibition not to grant or patent any of the Lands antecedently granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013102_0061_0F8EBC1FF0367FB0"/>forbid the Government to diſturb or moleſt the Settlers. This rightly underſtood, amounts to a Supercedies over the Authority of Common Law, and abſolutely controuls the Cognizance thereof. As to the particular Matters in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition ſet forth, or Matters lying before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by Petition, the Import of the Prohibition muſt needs be thus, Namely, that his Majeſty, by it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> that he has taken the Controverſy to him made known by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, under his Royal Conſideration, and that, after due Information and Evidence of the State of the Caſe, determines to ſettle the Controverſy; conſequently forbids the Government taking Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance thereof; and Common Senſe teaches us that under ſuch Prohibition, if a Judgment at Common Law be ſuppoſed to be valid, it would invalidate the Authority of the Crown, and ſubvert and overthrow the Authority of the Kingdom, as it would render the Prohibitions of the Crown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly impertinent. Therefore Common Law, in the Caſe before us, is not cloathed with Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of this Caſe, much leſs with Authority to diſpoſſeſs us; conſequently every Party of Men that have with Officers or otherwiſe, come into theſe Parts to diſpoſſeſs us, came in open Defiance and direct Oppoſition to his Majeſty's Orders and Authority: And tho' they ſtile us Rioters, for oppoſing them, and ſeek to catch and puniſh us as ſuch, yet in Reality, themſelves are the Rioters, the tumultuous, diſorderly, ſtimulating Faction, or, in fine, the Land-robbers; and every violent Act they have done to compaſs their Deſigns, tho' ever
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013102_0062_0F8EBC2071A98810"/>ſo much under Pretence of Law, is in Reality a Violation of Law, and an Inſult on the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Authority of the Crown, as well as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us in Perſon, who have been great Sufferance by ſuch inhuman Exertions of pretended legality of Law.—Right, and Wrong, are eternally the ſame to all Periods of Time, Places and Nations, and colouring a Crime with a ſpecious Pretence of Law, only adds to the Criminality of it; for it ſubverts the very Deſign of Law, proſtituting it to the vileſt Purpoſes. Can any Man, in the Exerciſe of Reaſon make himſelf believe that a Number of Attornies and other Gentlemen, with all their Tackle of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Compliments, and French Fineſſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their boaſted Legality of Law, that theſe Gentlemen have juſt Right to the Lands Labours and Fortunes of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers? Certainly they cannot. Yet this is the Object in View by that mercenary Fraternity.</p>
               <p>"WE do not ſuppoſe, may it pleaſe your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, we are making Oppoſition to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſuch; it is nothing more than a Party, chiefly carried on by a Number of Gentlemen Attornies (if it be not an Abuſe to Gentlemen of Merit to call them ſo) who manifeſt a ſurprizing and interprizing Thirſt of Avarice after our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but for a Collection of ſuch Intreaguers, to plan Matters of Influence of a Party, ſo as eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to become Judges in their own Caſe, &amp; thereby cheat us out of our Country, appears to us ſo audaciouſly unreaſonable and tyrannical that we view it with the utmoſt Deteſtation and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013102_0063_0F8EBC2146585808"/>and our Breaſts glow with a martial Fury to defend our Perſons and Fortunes from the Ravages of thoſe that would Deſtroy us; but not againſt your Excellency's Perſon or Government.</p>
               <p>"WE are fully perſwaded your Excellency's Ears have been much abuſed by ſubtle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Men, for we are informed from credible Authority, your Excellency has lately made Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to your Aſſembly to raiſe an armed Force to ſubdue us, but that the Motion was negatived: We apprehend your Excellency views us as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing your Excellency's Juriſdiction, and that the violent Acts, by us done, was in Rebellion to his Majeſty's Authority, or your Excellency had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver propoſed the ſubduing of us; We are moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Certain we can convince your Excellency, that it is not ſo; but that on the other Hand Meſſieurs <hi>Duane, Kemp,</hi> and their Aſſociates are the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>

And in order to clude &amp; defeat ſuch their diſingenuous and vicious Policy, the ſaid Inhabitants mutually agreed to oppoſe <hi>New-York</hi> Officers, in their Attempts to take Rioters, ſo characterized, and take every other requiſite, lawful and effectual Method to defend their Property.</p>
               <p>"And Matters having come to this, that Hoſtility, Revenge and Hatred, had began to put on their bloody, murtherous, and vengful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems—In which propitious Hour, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy WILLIAM TRYON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York,</hi> ſent the ſaid Inhabitants a kind, lenient and generous Letter, which breathed forth

Your Excellency further informs us, that you Look on our late Proceedings with great Concern, viewing them as daring Inſults to Government, a Violation
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013102_0070_0F8EBC26756AB2A8"/>of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to our Petition. We would with proper Submiſſion, give your Excellency and Council, a ſhort Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Facts, with a few Reflections and Reaſons thereon. And,</p>
               <p>"FIRST, we would obſerve, That our Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers your Excellency ſtiles Commiſſioners, was not authorized to eſtabliſh, and compleat Articles of public Faith for their Conſtituents. The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs aſſign'd them, was to deliver the written Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inform your Excellency and Council of the Facts of the Controverſy ſubſiſting, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negociate and forward the Matter of our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and return to us the Determination of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reſerving to Ourſelves the Power of aſſenting to, or diſſenting therefrom, tho' true it is, when the Articles of amicable Settlement, or Order of Government was read at a public Meeting held at <hi>Bennington,</hi> on the 15th Day of July Ultimo, the ſaid Order and Propoſals were univerſally complied with by thoſe preſent: From which Time we reaſonably Compute the Date of public Faith, and ſacred Bond of Friendſhip, but in the Interim, the Conditions of Faith was forming, and before a Ratification thereof, Mr. <hi>Kockburn,</hi> a noted Surveyor, unknown (as we ſuppoſe) to your Excellency, and Council, who, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, Aid and Employ of certain monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Adverſaries of our's, took a Tour to the northerly Parts of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, to ſurvey, and make Locations on our Land. Such Locating we view as a manifeſt Plan, and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013102_0071_0F8EBC274E8BFBD8"/>of invading our Property—the ſame as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching round the City, portraits a Siege thereof.</p>
               <p>OUR People having Notice of Mr. <hi>Kockburn</hi>'s Intruſion on our Borders, rallied a ſmall Party, and purſued, and overtook him and his Party, and in their Purſuit, paſſed the Towns of <hi>Panton</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> near the Mouth of <hi>Otter Creek;</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed Col. <hi>Reed</hi> of a Saw-Mill in ſaid <hi>Panton,</hi> which by Force, and without Colour, or even Pretence of Recourſe to Law, he had taken from the original Owners and Builders, more than three Years before, and did at that ſame Time extend his Force, Terrors and Threats into the Town of <hi>New-Haven;</hi> who, by the vicious and haughty Aid of Mr. <hi>Benzell,</hi> the fam'd Engineer, with a Number of Aſſiſtants, under their Command, ſo terrified the Inhabitants (which were about twelve in Number) that they left their Poſſeſſions and Farms to the Conquerers, and eſcaped with the Skin of their Teeth, although they had expended large Sums of Money in cutting Roads to, and ſettling in that new Country, as well as fatigued and laboured hard in cultivating their Farms: Col. <hi>Reed</hi> at the ſame Time, and with the ſame Force, did take Poſſeſſion of one Hundred and Thirty Saw-Logs, and fourteen Thouſand Feet of Pine Boards, which Boards were made in the ſame Mill, &amp; all lying thereby, all which he converted to his own Uſe. Not long after, the original Proprietors of the ſaid Mill, did re-enter, and take Poſſeſſion thereof, but was a ſecond Time attacked by Col. <hi>Reed</hi>'s Stewart, with a Number of armed Men, under his
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013102_0072_0F8EBC27EC4ED988"/>(ſuppoſed). Inſtructions, and by their ſuperior Force and Threats, obliged to quit the Premiſes again—all which Tenements, ſaid <hi>Reed</hi> occupied and enjoyed until diſpoſſeſſed, as your Excellency's Letter complains of.</p>
               <p>BUT to return to <hi>Kockburn</hi> again. Cur Party having taken him as aforeſaid, brought him to the Town of <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> near <hi>South Bay,</hi> where being firſt informed of your Excellency's Clemency as well as that of the honourable Council, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prayer of our Petition; and in Conformity to the Articles of Settlement agreed on, diſmiſſed him on honourable Terms.</p>
               <p>THIS is a ſhort Narrative of Facts, for the Proof of which, ſufficient Affidavits can be educed,</p>
               <p>WE are apprehenſive your Excellency has been hitherto unacquainted with theſe Facts, and have therefore exhibited them in this Letter; although it appears ſtrange to us, according as your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's own Letter ſtates the Matter, that we ſhould be ſuſpected or taxed with violation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith, and that our diſingenuous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Violation thereof, hath nullified and made void the late amicable Settlement; for at the ſame Time your Excellency charges us with breach of Faith, and Settlement, the very Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of this Faith was not known on our Part, and conſequently could not have been complied with, the very Stipulation and Faith ſpoken of, did not then exiſt, for it muſt be the Meeting of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013102_0073_0F8EBC296F6DA5B8"/>the Minds of the contracting Parties, which conſtitutes ſuch Faith and Agreement, and of Courſe cannot be broken before its exiſtence.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Kockburn</hi>'s locating our Lands in the mean Time the Preliminaries of Public Faith were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was at leaſt as much a Breach of that Faith, as what we are charged with. Nay, according to our Conception of the Matter, more ſo; as he made the firſt Movement towards the Invaſion of our Property.</p>
               <p>SOON after, our Meſſengers returned from New-York, and read the Minutes of Council, and your Excellency's Letter of Compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to a large Auditory convened at Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for that purpoſe, compoſed of the Inhabitants of that Place, the adjacent Country, and ſundry reſpectable Gentlemen from the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; your Excellency's gracious, wiſe, and benevolent Propoſals for ſettling Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in our Part of the Province, were by thoſe preſent, unanimouſly applauded, and conceded to; and all poſſible public Teſtimonies of Honour and Reſpect, paid to your Excellency and Council, by ſundry Diſcharges of Cannon and ſmall Arms; your Excellency's Health, long Life, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, as well as that of the honourable Council's, was the Toaſt; your Name commanded Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Eſteem, and your Excellency's Perſon in particular, became precious in our Eyes.</p>
               <p>AND, we do humbly aſſure your Excellency we have no Diſpoſition of Alienation of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013102_0074_0F8EBC2A2ADCE680"/>towards you, or knowingly break any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Publick Faith.</p>
               <p>THERE are two Propoſitions, which are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Attention.</p>
               <p>"FIRSTLY; The Protection and maintaining our Property.</p>

               <p>THESE two Propoſitions, we mean ſtrictly and religiouſly to adhere to. And for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Knowledge of the Preliminaries and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Publick Faith and Truſt, we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your Excellency and Council, that our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of thoſe Conditions on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> is, that they make no further ſettlements or Locations on our Lands, granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> until his Majeſty's Pleaſure be obtained, as to the validity of the Grants; although this was not ſo fully expreſſed, yet we ſuppoſe it was implied in the Abſtract of the Minutes of Council; if it was not, we pray, your Excellency and Council would undeceive us in that Particular, for if we are deceived in this, then, on this Hypotheſis, your Excellency and Council's lenient and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſpoſition towards Us, will not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (by us) be viewed as ſuch; for ſuch Locations and Settlements on our Lands, would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with Friendſhip, and a manifeſt Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013102_0075_0F8EBC2B04EE0238"/>on our Property, which has all along been the Bone of Contention.</p>
               <p>THE laſt part of your Excellency's Letter to Us, contains a Requirement of our immediate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in repoſſeſſing Col. <hi>Reed</hi>'s Tenants of ſaid Tenements. As to this Particular, had your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency have known by what Means Col. <hi>Reed</hi> obtained Poſſeſſion of them Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, undoubtedly your Excellency would not have required our Aſſiſtance in repoſſeſſing him; or have viewed with Concern, our diſpoſſeſſing him, as a daring Inſult to Government: For the Caſe right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, it appears, that his Conduct was a daring Inſult to Government, and continued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation for more than three Years, of the Laws, Reſtrictions, Regulations, and OEconomy, both of God, and Man; a notorious Breach of the Tenth Command of the Decalogue, which ſays, <hi>"Thou ſhalt not covet, &amp;c."</hi> He coveting, did take the Saw-Mill-Logs, Boards, and alſo, the Lands, Labours, Poſſeſſions, Farms, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. &amp;c. from the rightful Owners, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and firſt Occupants thereof, without a proceſs at Law, as aforeſaid, to their Excluſion from the Premiſes more than three Years, all which Time He has been enriching Himſelf, by the improvement of their Eſtates; and, ſhould we repoſſeſs him of the Premiſes again, We ſhould become Co-Partners with Him, in his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Such an Act we could not reconcile to our own Conſciences; it being a parently immoral, and moſt flagrantly Cruel and Unjuſt.</p>

WHEN your Excellency and Council views theſe Facts, and Arguments, we humbly conceive we ſhall not be required to repoſſeſs Colonel Reed of the Premiſes: Nor do we expect your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Council will adjudge us to be Violators of the late Articles of Public Faith: All which with due Submiſſion, we refer to your Excellency and Council.</p>

               <p>AS the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> rely on their Charters from that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the predicate and ground of their Title to the Property of the Land in Conteſt; ſo, on the other Hand, the Claimants under <hi>New-York,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and ground their Title to the ſame Land on the Validity of their Patents from <hi>New-York:</hi> This brings the Point in Iſſue between the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Claimants to this ſingle Queſtion, namely, <hi>Which of the ſaid Governments conveyed the Fee of the Land in Conteſt?</hi> For it is ſelf-evident both could not. And upon exploring the Controverſy, and animadverting on the Merits of the different Claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to ſtand the Teſt, and adjudged Valid, it will of Neceſſity invalidate the other. In the Diſcuſſion of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſearching into the Merit of the reſpective Claims, it is neceſſary to inſpect into the Validity of the Grant from King CHARLES to the Duke of York, from which Foundation only, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013102_0078_0F8EBC2FA48FF088"/>of <hi>New-York</hi> deduce their Right of patent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lands in conteſt; yet the Matter of Fact is, that neither the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> as ſuch, or any Individual therein, has ever had any Conveyance of any Land from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> nor doth any Landlord or Perſon whatever, in the Government hold the Fee or Property of their Land, by Virtue of any Conveyance from the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> but they hold the Fee of their Lands on a very different Footing, viz. by Conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that King CHARLES gave to his Brother James Duke of York, the Fee of the Lands Weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to the Head of <hi>Delaware Bay;</hi> and allowing the Fee to be ſtill veſted in him, his Heirs or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, upon this Hypotheſis no Perſon in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> hath the Fee or Property of the Land they poſſeſs, the Fee remaining the Property of the Duke of York, his Heirs or Aſſigns. And further, upon the ſame Principle, thoſe identical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents under the Seal of <hi>New-York,</hi> which were laid on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, are in their own Nature, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually null and void, with all other Conveyances of Land in the ſaid Province which have been given by the Crown, the Fee thereof being veſted in the Duke of York, &amp;c. So that the Grantees under <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> are both, upon this Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Caſe, equally deſtitute of the Fee of the Land conteſted for: But, upon this Stating, the Grantees under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> have the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Settlement, and Ocoupation, and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on their Side; which is abundantly ſufficient to give the Priority, and Preference of Title to them, ſo that neither the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> or
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013102_0079_0F8EBC30A4686B58"/>their Patentees, gain any Thing by building their Title on the ſaid Grant to the Duke of York—for if there be any Thing in it, it defeats their own Title as well as that of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> proving too much for their Purpoſe, or nothing at all: But, if the Lands contained in the Duke of York's Grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted back to the Crown, then the Duke of York's Patent became extinct, null, and abſolutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the ſaid Reverſion happened in Conſequence of the ſaid Duke's abdicating the Throne—turning Papiſt, or by any formal Surrendery, or by any Means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, provided the Fee became reveſted in the Crown, then the ſaid Charter became extinct, as aforeſaid: ſo that whether the Fee of the Land in Diſpute ſtill remains in the ſaid Duke of York, his Heirs or Aſſigns, or reverted, or was ſurrendered to the Crown, none of all this will in the leaſt juſtify the Government of New-York or its Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, in founding their Pretenſions of Title to the Lands aforeſaid, by Virtue of the aforeſaid Grant from King Charles to the Duke of York. For, take the Argument one Way, and it overturns both the Title of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> alſo, leaving the latter in Occupation and Poſſeſſion of the diſputed Premiſes, and that only, being intirely deſtitute of the Fee; and the <hi>New-York</hi> Claimants deſtitute of the leaſt Colour of Title whatſoever. But, take the Argument the other Way, viz. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Fee of the Lands aforeſaid reverted and been reveſted in the Crown, then the ſaid Lands at the Time of firſt granting were crown Lands the ſame as though the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had never exiſted: But the Truth of the matter undoubtedly
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013102_0080_0F8EBC310D688690"/>is this, the under Proprietors all except William Penn, who had the ſeveral Countries parcelled out to them by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Grant; ſurrendered their Charters to the Crown, whereby <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came royal Governments: This then being the State of the Caſe, the Lands in Diſpute became Crown Lands, and the Governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> as well as <hi>New-York</hi> Crown Officers, or King's Agents, and it is of no Conſequence to the King which of his Governors, grants his Land, if ſo be they be granted to, and ſettled by loyal and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Subjects, thereby adding to the Revenue of the Crown and enlarging and ſtrengthening the Kingdom: This being preſuppoſed, and admit for ſuppoſition only, that the Governor <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> exceeded his proper Limits in crown Lands, muſt the Grantees who have ſettled thoſe Lands, paid one of the crown Officers for granting the ſame, and expended their ALL, in ſettling and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating his Majeſty's Wilderneſs Land, and who are truly loyal Subjects, be turn'd off the ſaid Land by Thouſands, and reduced to ſtarving Poverty, together with their numerous Families, becauſe one of the crown Officers either ignorantly or deſignedly impoſed upon the People by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crown Lands over his Bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more ſo as it cannot be ſuppoſed that the Subjects are capable Judges of the Juriſdiction of Governments and conſequently there ſhould be the greateſt care taken to guard the Subject from injury in all Caſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Truth of which will more fully appear by the following Conſiderations, viz. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013102_0081_0F8EBC31B34E1820"/>the ſuppoſed Error in granting the ſaid Lands, yet the great End of the Crown in granting of it is compleatly anſwered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Subjects i. e. the Settlers are quieted in the Fee and Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Lands, they will not be injured, ſo that upon this Hypotheſis, neither King nor Subject would ſuſtain Damage: Indeed no Perſon in the Realm could have juſt Cauſe of Complaint. True, the reſpective Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>New-York</hi> may inſinuate, that upon this ſtate of the Caſe, the Governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> has cheated them out of their Fees for granting the ſaid Land—though it is evident, if Crown Officers are faithful to the King and Subjects, they could take no more Money for granting Crown Lands, than a reaſonable Compenſation for their Trouble, and the other Governor's being ſuppoſed to grant the Lands, ſaves the ſaid Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> the trouble; ſo that the Argument is brought to this ſingle Point only at laſt, that upon Suppoſition the Governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> exceeded his proper Limits in granting thoſe Lands, yet neither King nor Subjects are injured, (provided the Claimants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> hold the Fee of the ſaid Land as above) except the Governors of New-York, and if they be ſuppoſed to be honeſt Men, the Trouble of granting the Land would be equal to their Fees had they granted it; ſo that they have not been injured a Whit more in this Caſe, than they may be ſuppoſed to have injured the Subjects by taking exorbitant Fees for granting the ſame Lands; which to them is no Injury at all, but a providential Check to the Excerciſe of their Avarice. So that the reſpective Governors of <hi>New-York,</hi> in an equitable Senſe, are no Looſers in
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013102_0082_0F8EBAC9ABEE4AC8"/>this Affair; or at moſt the Privileges would be ſo very inconſiderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, eſpecially when ſet in Competition with the ſhocking and univerſal Deſtruction that would overſpread a large Country of his Majeſty's good Subjects, provided they be diſpoſſeſſed of the Lands aforeſaid. This ſeems to be the genuine Sequel of the Argument, even upon the Yorker's own Stating it.</p>

               <p>IT is not conceeded to on the Part of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> that the Governor did in Fact exceed his proper Limits in granting thoſe Lands, the contrary will abundatly appear from the following Conſiderations, viz. Before and at the Time the ſaid Governor of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> granted thoſe Lands they were reputed to be within his Juriſdiction, this was the Opinion of both Learned and Unlearned, the Wiſe as well as Simple, thus it was univerſally planed in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Maps down to the Year 1764, when, by royal Determination, the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> was extended over this diſputed Diſtrict of Land: But the general Opinion before this royal Adjudication was that the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> extended its Juriſdiction but Twenty Miles to the Eaſtward from <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, ſo general was this Opinion that the beſt Maps of the two reſpective Provinces, and the Hiſtory of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> adopted it as ſettled; it is of very great weight in the Queſtion to ſhew how univeſal this Maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate Geographer Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> in his Map compoſed ſo
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013102_0083_0F8EBC3369E6E9D8"/>late as the Year 1755, which with great Propriety and Certainty aſcertains the ſame Limits, this Map has the more Authority as it was according to the Certificate of Mr. Pownal, Secretary to the Board of Trade, and was undertaken with the Approbation and at the Requeſt of the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantation, and is chiefly compoſed from Draughts, Charts, and actual Serveys of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of His Majeſty's Colonies and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in America, great Part of which have been ſince taken by their Lordſhips Orders and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Office of the Governors of ſaid Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: This Twenty Mile Line was ſo far from being deemed unfavourable to <hi>New-York,</hi> that we find the Commiſſioners from that Province ſo late as the Year 1767, made an Offer to thoſe of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to let a Line at Twenty Miles diſtance Eaſt of <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River be the Diviſion between their reſpective Provinces, which the latter Commiſſioners would not then agree to it, being Thought by them too much in Favour of <hi>New-York,</hi> ſo little it ſeems did <hi>New-York</hi> Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conceive their Claim as far as <hi>Connecticut</hi> River could be ſupported.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it is true in the Year 1771 the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> by a publick Act of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, did annex all that Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, to the Weſtward from <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, to their County of <hi>Albany;</hi> and it is likewiſe true that in the Year 1773 the Governor's of the reſpective Provinces met at <hi>Hartſord</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> and came to a mutual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to ſettle that Line at Twenty Miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013102_0084_0F8EBC378A0EA178"/>Eaſtward from <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, which was the Hypotheſis of that Settlement, which hath ſince been ratified by His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>THE Report of the Lords Commiſſioners for Plantation Affairs in 1753, States the following Facts, from which is neceſſarily inferred that <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> extended its Juriſdiction to the Weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.—"There are, ſays their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, about 60,000 Acres of Land ſituate on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which was purchaſed by private Perſons from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to whom the Land had been laid out, by the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> as an equivalent for two or three Townſhips which the Latter purchaſed from the Former, this Tract of Land by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Boundary Line between the Provinces of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> in 1739 is become a Part of <hi>New-Hampſhire."</hi>—Thus we have their Lordſhips Sentiments that the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> extended over Part of the very Lands in Conteſt, Weſtward of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi> River, as long ago as the Year 1739, at which Time <hi>New-York</hi> never dreamed of extending their Claim to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.—There is another glaring and indiſputable evidence of the former Weſtern extent of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> viz. Relative to Fort Dummer which was Built by the Bay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in 1724, and garriſoned at their Expence a great Number of Years; but upon its being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from their Juriſdiction by the Settlement of the juriſdictional Line, between them and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, the <hi>Bay</hi> Province repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Government at Home, that the ſaid
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013102_0085_0F8EBC3863469BF0"/>Diſtrict of Land and Fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> having been determined to be the Property of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> they were no longer obliged to Garriſon and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and praying, That as it was neceſſary to the Defence of the Country, that <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> might be directed to ſupport it. In Conſequence of which, an Order paſſed the King and Council in 1744, that the Governor and Commander in Chief of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> ſhould forthwith move the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in His Majeſty's Name, to make a proper Proviſion for that Service; and at the ſame Time informing them that in Caſe they refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſo reaſonable and neceſſary a Propoſal, his Majeſty would find himſelf under a Neceſſity of reſtoring that Fort, with a proper Diſtrict of Land contiguous thereto, to the Province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſett's-Bay,</hi> who cannot with Juſtice be required to maintain a Fort no longer within their Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In conſequence of this, <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> did maintain this Fort, and paid a Demand of Arrears for its Maintainance, to the <hi>Maſſachuſett's-Bay.</hi> In the mean Time <hi>New-York</hi> was never a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor for the Burthen, willing as ſhe is to enjoy the Advantage of granting and engroſſing the ſaid Lands.</p>
               <p>THIS being the Caſe, the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> by the Royal Decree, was obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> and it being on the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticnt</hi> River, and on this very identical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Land now in Diſpute, can that Government be juſtly charged with granting Lands in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York,</hi> when but a little before his Majeſty in Council had adjudged the ſame Lands to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013102_0086_0F8EBAC9689A12D0"/>be in the ſaid Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and ordered them to defend it, as by maintaining Fort Dummer, &amp;c. Surely at that Time <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> did extend its Juriſdiction Weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; otherwiſe the King had ordered the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York to have maintained Fort Dummer. Nothing can be more flagrantly evident, than, that the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had a Right to Grant Crown Lands where the Crown compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Defend. From Hence it appears, that the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had a legal Right to grant the Lands now in Diſpute, and that, that Government and his Majeſty's good Subjects, the Grantees of, and Settlers on the ſaid Lands, acted upon honeſt and honourable Principles, in granting purchaſing, and ſettling the ſame, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, it appears, that the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> in re-granting the ſame Land, acted quite the reverſe; and the more unpardonably ſo, as they granted great Part of it, in open Defiance to His Majeſty's Authority manifeſted unto them by his expreſs Prohibition, dated the 24th Day of July 1767.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been already elucidated it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Line of Juriſdiction between the reſpective Provinces was not exactly aſcertained till the 20th of July 1764; but nevertheleſs that the Adminiſtration of Great-Britain had adjudged in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> extended Weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and that this was the general Senſe of the Nation (till aſcertained as aforeſaid) is real Matter of Fact.—True no Determination of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013102_0087_0F8EBC38780362D0"/>His Majeſty or Reports of the Lords of Trade had before particularized how far the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſhould extend Weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River: but ſuch Determinations of their's mightily ſtrengthened the common Opinion, nay, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, that that Government extended Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a twenty Miles Diſtance, Eaſt from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s River; interſecting a parrallel Line with the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and the Province of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſett's Bay,</hi> between them and ſaid Province of <hi>New-York.</hi> This was the Opinion both of King and Subjects at the Time the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe Lands; and Americans could not conceive of any intermediate Boundary in one Place more than another, between <hi>Connecticut</hi> River and the twenty-mile Limit aforeſaid; nor had they any Apprehenſion that the Government of <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> would extend to the Weſtward of that Limit. This parrallel Line took univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and deep Impreſſion on the Minds of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, and was the Underſtanding of the Britiſh Empire, and was thus portrayed in all former Maps.—The Certainty of this general Opinion may be further illuſtrated from the Conſideration that none of the Britiſh Subjects applied to the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> for Grants of thoſe Lands, till after the Alteration of Juriſdiction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <hi>New-York</hi> Scriblers, that their Government extended Patents from within the ſaid twenty mile Line a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the ſame, and on ſome Part of the Premiſes in Diſpute, many Years before the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe Lands—which will
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013102_0088_0F8EBC399740D1E0"/>be hereafter conſidered: But, would further add, it is Matter of Diſpute whether the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Home would recognize thoſe Patents grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes aforeſaid; though antecedent to thoſe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> inaſmuch as the Royal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> to grant them Lands, which by Royal Adjudication of the Line of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction between <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> fell within the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, as aforeſaid. However, for Argument only, we will ſuppoſe the Governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>New-York</hi> had each of them equal Authority to grant thoſe Lands—then on this Stating the Caſe, prior granting would of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be Priority of Title. The firſt Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, upon this Hypotheſis, being good and valid both in Law and Equity, muſt neceſſarily defeat any ſubſequent Grant from the Crown or its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, being as authentic, to all Intents and Purpoſes, as any Conveyance of the Fee of Land from the Crown can poſſibly be.—Thus it appears upon this moſt favourable Conceſſion to thoſe on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates in Favour of the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> as their Grants are prior to thoſe of <hi>New-York,</hi> (except in the Inſtances of the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, yet to be conſidered.)</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the expreſs Words of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, that the Grantees were not only intitled to the Fee of the Lands
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013102_0089_0F8EBC39FB7B7290"/>therein diſcribed, but alſo to all the Enfranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and each and every of the Privileges and Immunities that by Law his Majeſty's Subjects in the Province of <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> enjoy; ſo that at the ſame Time that the Grantees were veſted with the Fee of the Land, they were enfranchiſed with, and entitled to, all the Privileges and Immunities contained in their Charters; as the holding of Fairs, chooſing Town Officers, and making and mending their own Roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it ſhould be the future Pleaſure of his Majeſty, to continue the ſaid Lands in the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> (which by the Settlers aforeſaid is hoped will not be the Caſe) that the Claimants and Settlers under the ſaid Grants, will nevertheleſs have his Majeſty's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Approbation to enjoy without Let or Moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Privileges of Incorporation therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the Grantees having ever conſidered thoſe Privileges as inſeperably connected with the Grant of the Fee-Simple.</p>

               <head>SECTION III.</head>
               <p>FROM the Facts and Reaſons that have been advanced in the foregoing Sections, it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears, that the Title of the Claimants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> to the Lands in Queſtion is indefeaſible; yet ſtill there are ſundry Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may ſerve more abundantly to confirm and eſtabliſh this Title beyond Heſitation. As,</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, The far greateſt Part of the Extent
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013102_0090_0F8EBC3ADB1DD178"/>of Juriſdiction of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and great Part of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> depended entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his Majeſty's Pleaſure, being wholly in the Arbitration of the Crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real Grant on which the original Circumference of the Government of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> was founded, extended but Sixty Miles from the Sea into the Country, to the Weſtward, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating about Twenty Miles Eaſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. This Government was afterwards enlarged by his Majeſty's Commiſſion to <hi>Benning Wentworth,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of that Province, directing it to extend to the Weſtward until it ſhould meet with his Majeſty's other Governments. Which Clauſe of Weſtern Extention, in the ſaid Commiſſion, as well as the Royal Adjudication of the boundary Line between this Government and the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay</hi> in 1739, and Report of the Lords of Trade in 1755, and many Arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing Sections, all, on the Part of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> amount to ſufficient Evidence, that their Government extended ſo far Weſt as to interſect the parrallel Line of the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> and Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> as argued above. And with reſpect to the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> it's original Northen Circumference terminated South of the City of Albany, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as Plantations were extended Northerly, either on Patents procured immediately from the Crown, or Government, or meer Settlements on Extra-provincial Lands, Commiſſions from the King, to the reſpective Governors were enlarged, as in the Example following, viz. A. M. <abbr>Eſq.</abbr>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:013102_0091_0F8EBC3B75DCE508"/>Captain General, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> (then follows the Enlargement,) and the Territories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereon in America.—Theſe Territories are that Extenſion of Juriſdiction beyond their firſt circumſcribed Limits, terminating South of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> called the Province. This territorial Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Juriſdiction is altogether in the Arbitration of the Crown to curtail or extend as before repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. This being the Caſe, the reſpective Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors can no other Way be Judges of the Extent of their Juriſdiction, but by Directions given them in their Commiſſions, together with his Majeſty's expreſs Proclamations, and public Determinations relative thereto, as in the Inſtance of the Royal Adjudication in 1764; a Publication of which, by his Majeſty's Order, gave his Subjects to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it was his Pleaſure that the Territorial Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhould extend to the Weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which includes the diſputed Premiſes within that Government; before this it was impoſſible for the Subjects to know it; if they could have underſtood it without his Majeſty's Proclamation certifying the ſame, ſuch Proclamation would have been needleſs and impertinent. The Truth of the Matter is, his Majeſty in 1739, determined <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould cover the preſent diſputed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; he altered his Determination in 1764, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>New-York</hi> extended it's Territories over the ſame Land. And the King has an undoubted Right to alter and regulate the Juriſdiction of Royal Governments as may ſeem to Him mete;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013102_0092_0F8EBC3CAA2C2480"/>and for the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> to pretend to amuſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of common Senſe, pretending that it is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and indiſputable Right of the Colony of <hi>New-York</hi> to extend to the Weſt Banks of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, as it's eaſtern Boundary, is the very Height of Folly: It was in the Nature of Things abſolutely impoſſible his Majeſty himſelf ſhould have known that to have been the Caſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before he determined it, and equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent that the Subjects ſhould know it before his Majeſty proclaimed it.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was laid before his Majeſty by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Governor <hi>Colden,</hi> as an Inducement to prefix the Weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, the eaſtern Boundary of the Province of <hi>New-York</hi>—That they were Arguments of Conveniency, holding up to View that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, to be under the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York;</hi> which Arguments are incompatible with the Idea of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Right of Juriſdiction. Likewiſe, from hence we may ſee the Inconſiſtency of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or it's Patentees, in founding their Right in Fee to All or any Part of the Lands in Conteſt, by Virtue of the ſaid Royal Adjudication of the Boundary Line on the Weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; inaſmuch as it cannot operate to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage antecedent to the Date of that Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterward cannot be conſidered any Thing more than a mere Line of Juriſdiction between the reſpective Governments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:013102_0093_0F8EBC3D28A5EA10"/>
IT ſhould be furthermore conſidered, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments were veſted with the Fee of thoſe Lands; their Caſe in this Reſpect, is quite the Reverſe to that of Proprietary Governments, who have a Right to appropriate the Soil. In Royal Governments, it is true, the Governors have a delegated Authority from his Majeſty to grant Crown Lands; and in ſuch Governments it is a Prerogative of the Crown to alter the Limits of Juriſdiction; His Majeſty hath a Right to re-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the diſputed Premiſes to his Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> (in which it formerly was, and on the Faith of which the Claimants under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purchaſed and ſettled the ſame Lands) or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate it into a new Government, or continue it under the preſent Juriſdiction, as his Royal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may diſcern to be beſt for the governed: But, upon ſuch Alterations of Juriſdiction, private Property is never changed or ſubverted. For, if the Property of the Subject be in the Arbitration of the Crown, and liable to the ſame Viciſſitudes and Changes with Juriſdiction, this would deſtroy the very Nature of Property, and would render a King abſolute, and deſpotic, which is perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Conſtitution of the Kingdom.—Therefore, to convey or alienate Property, is the ſacred Prerogative of the rightful OWNER.—Kings and Governors (in the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) cannot intermeddle therewith. There is indeed as much Difference between the Change of Juriſdiction, and transfering of the Property of the Subject, as there is between Light and Darkneſs; although ſince the ſaid Royal Adjudication in
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013102_0094_0F8EBC3E028AB220"/>1764, the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> have endeavoured to blend them together to anſwer ſiniſter and lucrative Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.—They were ſenſible, undoubtedly, that ſuch the aforeſaid Arguments were concluſive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their monopolizing the Fee-ſimple of ſaid Lands; and as it is very common for People, who are upon a Deſign of engroſſing the Property of their Neighbour, to ſet up ſome ſpecious Pretence of Right to vindicate themſelves from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Diſhonor and Reproach; ſo in the preſent Caſe, the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> endeavour to draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Duke of York over their Knavery, and under the feigned Character of Heirs to that apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Duke, claim the Lands aforeſaid, and fancy themſelves the Owners of Towns, (Fields) and Houſes that they builded not.</p>

               <p>It appears from the Sequel of the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Narratives and Arguments contained in the <hi>New-York</hi> Pamphlet, that the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> do not pretend to any Conveyance of the Fee of the Lands in Conteſt from the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> But their Grand Hypotheſis is, that the Juriſdiction of their Government from the firſt Eſtabliſhment, was predicated on, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the deſcriptive Limits of the ſaid Grant; and conſequently, that the diſputed Premiſes was never in the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> and, that that Government never was veſted with Authority to grant thoſe Lands, and alſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the Grants by them made, are in their own Nature void.

                  <hi>New-York</hi> Arguments relative to their Title to thoſe Lands. Here,</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is neceſſary the deſcriptive Limits of the above rehearſed Charter be brought under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; which includes the Countries of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> adjoining <hi>New Scotland, Pemaquid,</hi> the River <hi>Kenebeque,</hi> and the Iſlands known by the Names of <hi>Martin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lying far Eaſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and within the actual Juriſdiction of the Provinces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay, New-Hampſhire,</hi> &amp;c. and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not contended for on the Part of <hi>New-York.</hi> Their General Aſſembly, in the <q>State of the Right.</q> &amp;c. had done well to have informed the Publick; whether their "ancient and indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right" of Juriſdiction extended to every Part of the diſcriptive Limits of the Grants aforeſaid, and if not, to which Part it was circumſcribed; and when done, and by what Authority; whether their Governors Commiſſions, at any Time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized and determined to what Part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ſaid Duke's Grant their Juriſdiction ſhould extend, more than another, or to the whole; or, whether any Royal Edict or Proclamation, had ever thus given them ſuch predicated Limits of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: this is abſolutely neceſſary for them to do, in Support of their Title to the Lands in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And furthermore, it is requiſite for them to demonſtrate that thoſe Lands were actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſuch their former Limits of Juriſdiction: but, if the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> from Royal Determination, cannot extend Juriſdiction to any
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013102_0100_0F8EBB3BC0EC2520"/>one Part of the deſcriptive Limits of the Grant afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, more than to another; then, on this Hypotheſis, their Juriſdiction includes the whole Limits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Grant, or none at all; that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Whole, will not be pretended, and that any Part, as predicated on them Limits, cannot be made to appear: But on the contrary, it appears His Majeſty and Council had no Reference to any Part of the Limits of this Grant, in determining the Boundaries of the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York</hi> in 1764, as may appear from the Royal Order itſelf, an Extract of which is as follows: <q>His Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Advice of his Privy Council, doth Order and Declare, That the Weſt Banks of the River <hi>Connecticut,</hi> from where it enters the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> as far North, as the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, to be the Boundary between the ſaid two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</q>—that Parrallel of Latitude is alſo eſtabliſhed it's North Boundary, &amp;c. The Source of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River is ſuppoſed to be ſomething to the Northward of Latitude Forty-Five, and comes much from the North-Eaſt, a conſiderable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after it paſſes that Latitude; but it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Source of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River is far South of it; ſo that by comparing the deſcriptive Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, with thoſe expreſſed in the Royal Order, they will be found to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different. The Limit of that Part of the Duke's Grant, which reſpects the preſent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is in the Words following: <q>Together alſo with the ſaid River called <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, and all the Lands from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:013102_0101_0F8EBB3C8C808020"/>to the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware Bay;</hi>
                  </q> which Limit in any poſſible Conſtruction of it, can include but Part of the diſputed Premiſes, (which ſaid Premiſes extend and are bounded on the Forty-fifth Degree of North Latitude,) as will more fully appear in a further Diſcuſſion of that Line. But,</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is manifeſt that the King and Privy Council, in determining the Extent of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> did not proceed upon the Idea of that Government's having any antecedent Right of Juriſdiction to thoſe Lands. Had that been the Caſe, the Royal Order had been predicated on the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Lines of the Duke's Grant aforeſaid, and could not have comprehended any more Land than <q>from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay;</q> and theſe Bounds are ſo looſe, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impoſſible to found a Line of Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following Obſervations on the diſcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits thereof, which may be ſeen at Large in the fore Part of this Section. Therefore, ſuch Part only, as is neceſſary for the Conſideration of the indeterminate Bounds, before ſpoken of, is here quoted; which, after deſcribing the Situation of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and that it abuts upon the Main Land <q>between the two Rivers there called or known by the ſeveral Names of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River,</q> begins the Diſcription under Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <q>together with the ſaid River called <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s River.</q> Obſerve, that as the Deſcription
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013102_0102_0F8EBB3D507C3AE8"/>of this River is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following Diſcriptions in ſaid Grant; nothing more can poſſibly be included in it, but a Diſcription of the River only, excluſive of one Foot of Land on either Side. The ſecond Diſcription <q>and all the Land from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay.</q> The beſt Mathematician on Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcertain theſe Limits, except upon arbitrary Principles, as there can be no prefixed Place on <hi>Connecticut</hi> River where to erect the firſt Bounds; and as to any particular Place on the <q>Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay,</q> where to erect a Second, is altogether undetermined in this Diſcription: But, inaſmuch as it includes all the Land from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, &amp;c. there is a little better Foundation to eſtabliſh the firſt Bounds than the Second. It ſeems in order to include All as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it would be neceſſary to extend either to the Head of the River, or to the moſt Northerly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the whole Stream, to make the firſt Bounds; and provided this imaginary Bounds ſhould extend North of the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, it would ſo far exceed the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Line in 1764. Be this as it will, the moſt Northerly Part of the River, which would moſt likely be the Head, would be the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable on the Part of New-York, for to eſtabliſh a firſt Bounds, and from thence to extend a ſtrait Line to ſome Place on the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay; this is ſomething of a natural Conſtruction, on the indeterminate deſcriptive Limits aforeſaid, without exploring <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, which in this
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013102_0103_0F8EBB3E0B426688"/>Caſe is neceſſary. And, Firſt, in tracing ſaid River to its Source, it is found towards it's Extremity, to come much out of the North-Eaſt. This being the Caſe, a ſtrait Line from it's Head to <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, would croſs ſaid River and include a large Tract of Land on the Eaſt Side, and perhaps croſs the River ſundry Times; the Conſequences may be drawn thus, that where the Line may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to croſs the laſt Time, ought to be the firſt real North Boundary, of the <q>ancient and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable</q> Limit of Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York.</hi> For, if the Bounds at the Head of the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, be ſo eſtabliſhed, it would include conſiderable Land on the Eaſt Side of the River, within the old Boundary of New-York, which is contrary to any Idea to be gained from the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Limit aforeſaid, viz. <q>and all the Land from the Weſt Side of Connecticut River, &amp;c.</q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another propoſed firſt Boundary better purporting with the Diſcription of <q>And all the Land from the Weſt Side of Connecticut River to the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay,</q> between the Head of the River, and the Place where the imaginary Line was ſuppoſed to paſs? To this it may be anſwered, that a Place between theſe two, ſo far up the River as in tracing a ſtrait Line from thence, to <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, would not croſs the River, may better agree with the above Diſcription: Still, from none of theſe imagined Lines, from the different imagined Bounds, or from any other projected, poſſible, firſt Bounds, can ſuch a ſtrait Line be aſcertained, till the Place for the South-Weſtern Boundary on the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013102_0104_0F8EBB3EAF0D9010"/>"Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay" be eſtabliſhed? And the Vagueneſs of the diſcriptive Limit is ſo great, that it cannot be determined whether that Bounds ſhall be at the Northern Extremity of the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, or at the Southern, where it communicates with the main Ocean, or at any other intermediate Place between theſe two: ſo, that from the uncertainty of the ſecond Bounds, it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh the firſt, ſo as exactly to include "all the Land from the Weſt Side of the ſaid River to the Eaſt Side of ſaid Bay," and no more. And,</p>
               <p>THUS it is demonſtrated from the Vagueneſs, Uncertainty and Obſoleteneſs of the diſcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Grant to the Duke of York, before quoted at large; that it is in the Nature of Things abſolutely impoſſible to aſcertain it. From hence follows a Second neceſſary inference, viz. That it is equally impoſſible and contradictory, that governmental Juriſdiction ſhould be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain Juriſdiction, in its own Nature incapable to be determined, is in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty none at all. And from hence follows a Third Inference which determines the Sequel of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the Subject of Property, concerning the Lands in Queſtion, to be in Favour of the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants under <hi>New-Hampſhire:</hi> For, it is in the laſt Place, equally contradictory and impoſſible, as in the Caſe of the Abſurdity of aſcertaining the Limits of the pretended "ancient" Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> predicating it on vague and undeterminate Boundaries, that, that Government ſhould predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013102_0105_0F8EBB406BDB66D8"/>their Right to the Fee of Lands, by them thus unaſcertainable; for as Uncertainty, and natural Impoſſibility of a Juriſdiction's being rendered determinate makes it in Reality to be none at all; ſo the Idea of Property, predicated thereon is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually impertinent.—True it is, by the royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in 1764, the Eaſt Line of <hi>New-York</hi> extended to the Weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. Which may be Foundation for Conjecture, that, that Limit might have Reference to a Diſcription in the Duke's Grant aforeſaid, "and all the Lands from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River," &amp;c. Yet when the Repreſentation made by Lieut. Governor Colden, to his Majeſty in Council, as mentioned in this Pamphlet, under the Head of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, &amp;c. comes to be conſidered it will reflect Light on this Point. The Arguments made Uſe of in the ſaid Repreſentation were thoſe of Conveniency and Advantage to the Settlers on thoſe Lands to be in the Government of New-York: And, that the Weſt Banks of Connecticut River was a good and certain Boundary," &amp;c. Theſe were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the preponderating Motives of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Weſt Banks of Connecticut River to be the Eaſt Boundary of New-York, and ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are utterly inconſiſtant with the Notion of an "Ancient indiſputable Right" of Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſtill another Conſideration which may be of Moment in the Obſervation of this, ſo Trumpt-up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the Province of New-York, to the Lands in Conteſt: If it be admitted a Line ſhould be drawn from the moſt northerly Part of Connecticut River
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013102_0106_0F8EBB40EFF67140"/>to the moſt northern Extremity of Delaware-Bay; ſtill, it is by no means probable ſuch Line would include more than one half (if ſo much) of the Lands in Diſpute ſo far as may be judged from the Latitude and Longitude of the reſpective Objects: For conſidering the Courſe of Connecticut River, which is nearly from North to South, except to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Extremity; and the Sea coaſt, from the River's Mouth, together with Delaware Bay, forming alſo an indened Line, to the South of Weſt; the Land included in theſe Limits, by a Line drawn from Connecticut River to Delaware Bay as aforeſaid, would (excepting the ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory formed by the Mouth of the Bay and the Ocean) lye in the Figure of an obtuſe angled Triangle; and the Courſe of the ſaid Line from the River to the Bay, according to occular Survey, would be from the Northeaſt a Southweſterly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Which very badly comports with the preſent North and Weſterly Exerciſe of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government of New-York, at Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, Detroit, &amp;c.—It may here well be obſerved, the Settlers under New-Hampſhire ſeem to be in a critical Situation; every arbitrary Meaſure under the preſent Adminiſtration of the Government of New-York, is excerciſed againſt them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they flee to the Eaſtward to procure Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, there they are fore-cloſed, the diſcriptive Limits of the ſaid ancient Juriſdiction covers them (to wit) the Countries of St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard, &amp;c.—Yet there is another large unknown Country to the Weſt and Northweſt, which has been but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013102_0107_0F8EBB41C892D6E8"/>explored; and provided, theſe People, inſtead of fleeing to the Eaſtward, ſhould turn their Courſe, to thoſe Countries; there, it is indiſputable but that, New-York would encircle them with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther odd Diſcription of Domain contained in their Governor's Commiſſions, i. e. <q>A. B. Captain General Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of New-York,</q> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Diſcription hinted <q>and the Territories depending thereon, in America.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the foregoing Diſcriptions of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York, it appears they lay Claim to ſo extenſive a Domain three different Ways, or have three different Modes or Modifications in comprehending and engroſſing their progreſſive Limits. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſtly. THE Province of New-York, which falls ſhort of, and terminates conſiderably South of the City of Albany.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. "THE Territories depending thereon in America." Theſe Territories comprehending ſuch Plantations, on extra-provincial Land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the Province till its Territories, are at preſent extended to Detroit and the Neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, and inaſmuch as the Grantees and Settlers on the Lands in Diſpute, hold their Title under New-Hampſhire, and that Government had for ſeveral Years exerciſed their Juriſdiction over thoſe Lands,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013102_0108_0F8EBB4275649058"/>even till 1764.—Therefore, in this Caſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of New-York could not extend their Territorial Sort of Juriſdiction over the Premiſes; for ſuch Sort of Juriſdiction might be challenged on the Part of New-Hampſhire (if it ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited at that Time, ſaid Premiſes was extra-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Lands) and that with far the moſt Propriety. Inaſmuch as that Government had granted the Land and began Settlements thereon. Add to this the following Clauſe in Governor Wentworth's Commiſſion, which they viewed to be of great Weight in this Caſe, which, after diſcribing the former Limits of New-Hampſhire, <q>and from thence extending Weſt till it meets with his Majeſty's other Governments.</q> Add to this alſo, the Reaſons held forth in the Chain of Arguments, contained in the three firſt Sections; all which were too potent for the New-York territorial Sort of Dominion to fruſtrate. At that Juncture, Therefore, the Lawyers, Land-jobbers, Politicians, &amp;c. planed out the aforeſaid third Modes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction predicating it on the diſcriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of York. And on this new modled Plan breathed an air of <q>ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT of</q> Juriſdiction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the Fee of the Lands in Conteſt.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Intimation that ever ſaluted the Ears of the Publick, aſſerting it to be the ancient Right of the Colony of New-York, to extend to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut River as its eaſtern Boundary, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd from a Proclamation, given under the Hand of William Tryon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013102_0109_0F8EBB4693DC1370"/>Province of New-York, &amp;c. and dated the 11th Day of December, 1771. His Proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins after the following Manner. <q>Whereas it is the ancient and inconteſtible Right of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to extend to Connecticut River, as its Eaſtern Boundary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was drawing a poſitive Concluſion from fictitious, and till that Time, unheard of Premiſes: and rather influenced People, in the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to purchaſe and ſettle under New-Hampſhire, than diſwade them therefrom, for common Fame, and common Senſe were a Barrier againſt the Belief of this New-York Doctrine, which from the Time of the royal Adjudication in 1764, was by the Proclamation aforeſaid, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to "Ancient." That this Doctrine till then, was inconteſted, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public Conſideration, and has ever ſince been conteſted.</p>
               <p>SHOULD this, their new Hypotheſis be admitted; yet, as hath been before obſerved, theſe Limits could include but Part of ſaid Lands, according to the beſt Judgment that can be formed without an actual, and accurate Survey of the diſcriptive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſaid Grant; which if the New-Yorkers can do and fairly Demonſtrate, to any able Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, and competant and impartial Judges, that they have rightly aſcertaned thoſe Limits, it is engaged on the Part of the Claimants under New-Hampſhire that they ſhall yield up, to the Land-jobbers of New-York, their Lands and Labours:
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013102_0110_0F8EBB4799F5F730"/>an Object which undoubtedly would be grateful and pleaſing to them; and which they have many Years been in Purſuit of, and have hitherto had the Mortification to be baffled. It is verily Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant on the Government of New-York, in order to found Tittle to thoſe Land on this new Scheme,</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, to aſcertain the Limits of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Bounds: This, the Claimants under New-Hampſhire, will expect compleated, or hear no more of thoſe "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" Boundaries of New-York.</p>

               <p>THE General Aſſembly of the Colony of New-York, in their State of the Right of that Colony, &amp;c. Page 3d. wave the Right of the Engliſh by firſt Diſcovery, as being foreign to their Purpoſe, &amp; that the Dutch Poſſeſſions are only material to be ſupported; and Claim no further Right by Pay of the Dutch, but priority of Poſſeſſion. Yet in the ſame Page inform, <q>when the firſt War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and Holland became inevitable, King Charles the Second, by Letters Patent dated the 12th Day of March 1663-4, granted to his Brother the Duke of York the Tracts of Country, which comprehend <hi>New-York.</hi> To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Gift effectual, before the War was proclaimed, a Fleet and Land Forces were ſent out to remove the Dutch and put the Duke in Poſſeſſion.</q>— The Circumſtancies that attended the making this Grant, and ſending the Armament
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013102_0111_0F8EBB47ADC66240"/>to render it effectual, are a ſufficient Reaſon to Determine that the Government at Home, at that Time, viewed the Dutch Settlement as an Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Poſſeſſion (which is all they rely on) gained by treſpaſs, in legal Conſtruction, is no Poſſeſſion at all. That the Engliſh had prior Right to all the Countries from Forty to Forty-eight Degrees of North Latitude, by Virtue not only of Diſcovery by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot</hi> and others, but by being in actual Poſſeſſion of ſeveral Parts of the Premiſes, is Matters too well known to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>WHETHER there was real Seiſin in the Crown, or not, or the Time of granting theſe Countries, is not truly in Queſtion; ſince every Grant ſo made is inconteſtibly valid againſt the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors; and the Colony of New-York be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely Dependant on the Crown of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for their Title; Priority of Charter is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to be determined.</p>
               <p>THE Grant of King James the Firſt to the Council of Plymouth bearing Date at Weſtminſter, the 13th Day of November, in the Eighteenth Year or his Reign: comprehends all the Lands, Iſlands, &amp;c. from forty to forty-eight Degrees of North Latitude, through the Main Land from Sea to Sea. On the 19th Day of March 1628, the Council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> under their common Seal, did grant to Sir <hi>Henry Roſwell,</hi> Sir <hi>John Young,</hi> and Others, their Heirs and Aſſociates for ever, all that Part of <hi>America,</hi> lying between the Great River
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013102_0112_0F8EBB486F06F890"/>there, commonly called <hi>Monomack,</hi> alias <hi>Merimack</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> River, within the Space of three Miles to the Northward of the ſame River, called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomack,</hi> alias <hi>Merimack,</hi> or to the Northward of any or every Part thereof, and in Length and Longitude of and within all the Breadth aforeſaid, thro'out the Main Lands there, from the Atlantic or Weſtern Sea or Ocean on the Eaſt Part, to the South Sea on the Weſt Part.</p>
               <p>THIS Deed of Sale at the Suit of the Grantees, with a Charter of Incorporation, was granted and confirmed by King CHARLES the Firſt, the 4th Day of March 1629, wherein the Limits are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame with thoſe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Conveyance; and the Proviſo of CHARLES, that the actual Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Subjects of other Chriſtian States to determine the Extent, the ſame as was the Proviſo in JAMES'S Grant to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Company.</p>
               <p>THIS ſame Charter of Incorporation was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed void in the High Court of Chancery of <hi>England</hi> in 1684; from which the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in their State, &amp;c. Page 5th, take Occaſion to ſay <q>the Title of that Colony now ſolely depends on their new Charter of 1691.</q> Nevertheleſs, the Right of Soil to All and every Part of the Deed of Sale aforeſaid, remained indefeaſible; for, only animadvert back to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Conveyance, and obſerve, that the Right in Fee, was by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Grantees; and trace it to King CHARLES'S Charter of Incorporation, which only veſted the Grantees with Powers of Government.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013102_0113_0F8EBB49357A6A18"/>Though it is true, this Charter contains all the Formality neceſſary in the Conveyance of the Fee; yet is, ſo far as reſpects the Fee, is no more than a Duplicate of what was before granted, which neither adds nor deminiſheth; and it is eaſy to ſee, that the Court of Chancery could not vacate or make Void, at moſt, any Thing more than thoſe incorporate Privileges; and likewiſe as eaſily diſcernable that nothing more was attempted. Thus the Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> ſtill hold their Right in Fee, by Conveyance from King JAMES to the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> who were their Grantors.</p>
               <p>IN the next Place it may be obſerved, that in 1691 the Privileges of Incorporation were reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though our Authors, in their State, &amp;c. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to curtail the Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> by conſtruing their laſt Charter to extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſt than the Eaſt Limit of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut.</hi> Their Words are theſe, "Theſe Words <hi>(as far as)</hi> being in the Caſe of the Grant of the Crown on the Suit of the Party, in legal Conſtruction, carry the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> Colony no farther Weſtward than till it meets the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and not to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and much leſs to the Weſtward of it." Be theſe bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions as they will, and provided it be here admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for Argument ſake, that the Powers of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> be ever ſo much curtailed, yet one Propoſition we can verily be aſſured of, viz. That it is not in the Power of King or Chancery to curtail or deprive them of their Property.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:013102_0114_0F8EBB49F4CFED90"/>
IT is to be further obſerved, that however our Authors may Criticiſe upon the gramatical or legal Conſtruction of ſelected Words or Phraſes; yet, a little Attention to the following real Facts, will clearly point out the Inconſiſtency of ſuch Sophiſms.</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, <hi>Connecticut</hi> Charter, granted by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April 1662, was bounded and extended in Length, by and with the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> firſt Charter, granted by King CHARLES the Firſt, the 4th Day of March 1629, which inconteſtibly extended agreeable with the aforeſaid diſcriptive Limits of the Deed of Sale from the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Roſwell,</hi> Sir <hi>John Young,</hi> &amp;c. and extended through the Main Land in Longitude to the South Sea on the Weſt Part.</p>
               <p>THIS Charter, as above, being nullified in the High Court of Chancery of England in 1684, and reſtored again in 1691, wherein the Weſt Extent of Limit is predicated by that of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and this Weſt Limit of <hi>Connecticut</hi> being predicated by the old Charter of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly extending in Longitude to the South Sea on the Weſt Part, exactly extends the preſent Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> with it's Powers of Juriſdiction to All, and every Part of the Limits of the old nulled Charter. This is the natural and legal Senſe of the preſent Charter of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> predicated on undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Facts,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:013102_0115_0F8EBB4AAC6B5A68"/>
IN the next Place 'tis neceſſary to conſider the Charter of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which our Authors inform ſhould not extend Weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, in the Words following: <q>This being a Crown Grant on the Suit and Petition of the Grantees, is to be taken moſt beneficially for the King. The diſcriptive Words, and the Intention of the Grant, will in legal Conſtruction be ſatisfied by giving the Colony the ſame Length as the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts Bay;</hi> and it is plain, both from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital and the ſaving Clauſe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, on which the <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s Title was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Latter cou'd not in any Senſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.</q> As this their Aſſertion is founded on the Hypotheſis of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Charter's being predicated on that of the <hi>Maſſachuſett's,</hi> and therefore the Arguments before exhibited on that Head, are equally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive for the eſtabliſhing the Weſtern Extent of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> nothing more is neceſſary for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but a Recital of the diſcriptive Words of their Charter, granted ſubſequent to their Purchaſe from the Council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April, 1662, <q>Bounded on the Eaſt by <hi>Narraganſet</hi> River, commonly called <hi>Narraganſet</hi> Bay, where the ſaid River falleth into the Sea; and on the North by the Line of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Plantation; and on the South by the Sea, and in Longitude as the Line of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony, running from Eaſt to Weſt: That is to ſay, from the ſaid <hi>Narraganſet</hi> Bay on the Eaſt, to the South Sea on the Weſt Part.</q> Thus it appears not
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013102_0116_0F8EBB4B6C3D3DB8"/>only by the Demonſtrations aforeſaid, but from the expreſs Words of the diſcriptive Limits of the Charter itſelf, which cannot admit of a double Meaning, (curious as our Authors be in the Art of playing with Words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal Meaning,) that it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Right of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> to extend it's Weſtern Boundary to the South Sea on the "Weſt Part;" and in this that Colony agree, who are now challenging their Right in Fee to thoſe Limits, and actually making Plantation, as at <hi>Suſquebannah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BY this Time, undoubtedly Queries will ariſe in the Mind of the Reader, What will become of the Grant to the Duke of York, if the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett's and Connecticut Colonies extend "to the South Sea on the Weſt Part?" The following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from our Authors will introduce an Anſwer to this Query; who, after diſcribing ſaid Grant further inform, in Page 3d of the State, &amp;c. That <q>a Fleet and Land Forces were ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Dutch, and put the Duke in Poſſeſſion.</q> Accordingly, on the 27th Day of Auguſt 1664, the Dutch Governor <hi>Stuyveſant,</hi> ſurrendered by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, all the Countries the Dutch then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, to King CHARLES the Second; when among other Terms it was ſtipulated, <q>that all the People ſhall remain free Denizens, and ſhall enjoy their Lands, Houſes, and Goods, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013102_0117_0F8EBB4E28C44398"/>for, as the King had antecedently diſpoſed of all the Eſtate the Crown was poſſeſſed of in theſe Countries, to the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay;</hi> therefore, his Right now could not extend any further than the actual Conqueſt, which, in legal Conſtruction, muſt be ſatisfied with, and can extend no further than the actual Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſcribed in the forementioned Capitulation. A further Information is in Page 4th, <q>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any Doubt of the Validity of the Dukes Title, either from the Want of Seiſin in the Crown when it originated, or on Account of the intermediate Conqueſt by the Dutch, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to his Royal Highneſs by further Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patent, dated the 29th Day of June, 1674.</q> That there was Want of Seiſin in the Crown at the Time of firſt Granting, is inconteſtible; for, as above ſaid, the King by antecedent Grants had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted the Crown of it's Right, and by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt became reveſted: So that from this, Occaſion will be taken to ſay, that in Fact the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> was originally ſounded on Conqueſt, and the Limits of it, as before mentioned, circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dutch Poſſeſſions pointed out in the Terms of Capitulation.

                  </gap>ourable this Concluſion may be thought, on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> yet, as the Crown had prior to either of the Duke's Grants, diſpoſed of its Right to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colonies—if it was not thus founded on Conqueſt, it hath no Foundation at all; and it's having any Place for Exiſtence, is but an "Intruſion on the Rights" of thoſe other Colonies. Furthermore, it is Myſterious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013102_0118_0F8EBB4FC98C6988"/>admitting that that Government was thus founded, to ſuppoſe the Duke could be Lord Proprietor; inaſmuch as by the Conditions of Capitulation, the Fee then acquired to the Crown, paſſed to the Dutch Inhabitants, who then became Engliſh Subjects.</p>
               <p>THE Reader is in the next Place invited to a more particular Conſideration of the aforeſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Premiſes, which are bounded South on the North Line of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> and Weſt by a Line about twenty Miles Eaſt of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, extending North ten Degrees, Eaſt till it comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt oppoſite to <hi>Ticondaroga;</hi> thence Weſt till it ſtrikes on <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> thence on the Eaſt Banks of ſaid Lake to the Forty fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, and on the North by the ſaid Latitude, and Eaſt on the Weſt Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. On this Tract of Country 'tis not pretended there ever was any ancient Dutch Poſſeſſions, nor any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Title from <hi>New-York,</hi> except on the Weſt Part of the Townſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> ſituate at the South-Weſt Corner of this Tract; and ſome Poſſeſſions in the Townſhip of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> on <hi>Otter Creek,</hi> which Colonel <hi>Reed</hi> gained and maintained by Force, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Years, and which by Force he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſurrender to the firſt Settlers, who were Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH this Tract of Land was contained in the original Grant to the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> yet, as they never made any Conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the Crown on the Surrender of that
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013102_0119_0F8EBB50B84E69D8"/>Grant, the 7th Day of June, 1635. From which it may be objected, on the Part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the above Conciſeneſs in the Circumſcription of the Boundaries of their Colony is too great; for, that the Grant to the Duke muſt hold good where the Crown, at the Time of granting, was veſted with a Right to the Lands granted. In Anſwer, it has been argued in the preceeding Section, that it is very uncertain whether the Limits of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant included this Tract of Land, or if any, how great a Part; and that the Limits of ſaid Grant cou'd not be aſcertained—and that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Juriſdiction, and Property cou'd not be predicated on ſuch obſolete and uncertain Bounds. It was alſo demonſtrated in the firſt Section, and will be further obſerved in this, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant reverted to the Crown, and that the Landholders in the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> hold under the Crown—and that, if it did not revert to the Crown, the Fee is ſtill in the Duke, his Heirs or Aſſigns, and no Landholders in the Government are veſted with the Fee of the Lands they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">This Argument and Coucluſion is founded on the <hi>New-York</hi> Hypotheſis, excluſive of the herein mention'd Article in the Dutch Capitulation.</note>. It would be too tedious as well as needleſs to recite the Arguments that have been offered in the three firſt Sections, which is humbly conceived are abundantly ſuſſicient to Anſwer the aforeſaid Objection, and fairly demonſtrate Priority of Title to be in Favour of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> to which the curteous Reader is referred for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

As has been before obſerved, the Deſign of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant was to include the Dutch Poſſeſſions, or in other Words, that it never was valid any further than to ſuch Poſſeſſion, which by Conqueſt, reverted to the Crown, and no farther than theſe Limits, to interfere with the Charter Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> And as a Twenty Miles Line to the Eaſtward from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s River would include the moſt Eaſtern Extent of the forementioned Poſſeſſions, the Reaſon why ſuch a Line was agreed to as the Boundary between the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-York:</hi> But, as theſe Poſſeſſions to the Northward of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> fell far ſhort of this Twenty Mile Line, or were ſo inconſiderable and uncertain as not to come within the Capitulation Reſerve, therefore, the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Colony contended with <hi>New-York</hi> for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſtern Extent than Twenty Miles Eaſt from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River; but the reſtleſs Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> ever uneaſy within it's own Boundaries, preſumed unrelenting, to intrude on, and conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the juſt Rights of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Patents far to the Eaſtward of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River; in Conſequence of which the greateſt Diſturbances have ariſen between the Inhabitants of the reſpective Colonies, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the Conflicts ſo ſevere, that human Blood ſpilt in the Conteſts redened the Hands of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders; but finally a boundary Line was agreed to by the reſpective Governments in 1773, at a Twenty Miles Diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, which has ſince been ratified by his Majeſty.</p>

IN the State of the Right, &amp;c.

               <p>IN the ſame Page they further inform, That <q>in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Commiſſions to his ſeveral Lieutenant Governors, Major <hi>Edmond Androſs</hi> on the firſt Day of July 1674, and Col. <hi>Thomas Dongan</hi> on the 30th Day of September 1682, among other Diſcriptions of the Boundaries of this Province, are expreſly comprehended all the Land from the Weſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay.</q> Note, thoſe Commiſſions were from the Duke before he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013102_0122_0F8EBB5231CB2D58"/>the Throne; undoubtedly in his Commiſſions to his Lieutenant Governors, he had referrence to the Limits of his Grant, to determine their Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries: But after his Abdication, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of King <hi>Willaim</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we find a Commiſſion from their Majeſty's to <hi>Henry Slaughter,</hi> to be materially different. <q>King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by their Commiſſion, dated the Fourth Day of January, in the Firſt Year of their Reign, appointed <hi>Henry Slaughter</hi> to be Governor of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the Territories depending thereon in <hi>America.</hi>

               <p>OUR Authors, in Order to maintain their Claim to the Lands in Conteſt, and if poſſible, to include it within One of the deſcriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> tell us many ſtrange Things about the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts:</hi> That <hi>Connecticut.</hi> "in legal Conſtruction" ſhould not have extended to the Weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that their Settlements Weſt of that River were an Intruſion on the Right of the Colony of <hi>New-York;</hi> yet, nevertheleſs for Peace ſake, and rather than conteſt with "a powerful Neighbour," they ſettled with that Colony at twenty Miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River.</p>

               <p>To give this pleaſing Scheme ſome Kind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they argue the Nullity of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> firſt Charter, and introduce the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Grant as the oldeſt Title, Page 5th, <q>The <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi> Charter was vacated, and the Title of that Colony now ſolely depends on their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 1691.</q>

               </p>
               <p>THEN they proceed to recite their old Grants, which they tell us <q>cover the Country the whole Breadth of the <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s Claim:</q> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Renſelaerwyck,</hi> granted in 1685, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 24 Miles each Side, from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River; and <hi>Weſtonhook,</hi> in 1705, which extends about 30 Miles from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River; and <hi>Hooſick,</hi> in 1685, which extends about 30 Miles from the River. It ſeems to have been a political, and univerſal Principle with the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to begin their Patents within the Twenty Mile Line, and extend them Eaſtward of it, that by this Means they might have Opportunity to encroach on, and jockey their neighbouring Colonies, more or leſs, out of their Lands, as ſubſequent Policy, Intrigue and Power, would render practicable.</p>
               <p>THAT Government, thus extended their Patent into <hi>Connecticut,</hi> One in particular, into the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Saliſbury;</hi> and it has ever been their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to wrangle till they find by Experience, that neither by Sophiſtry, Law, or Hoſtility, they can maintain their exorbitant Claims, and then capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on as good Terms as they can; and conclude
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:013102_0129_0F8EBB58EA985BA0"/>with branding their Competitors with Diſhoneſty, Encroachment and many hard Names, and don't ſcruple to impeach their Governmental Authority, (as in the Caſe juſt recited of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay) with being Diſreſpectful to his Majeſty's Authority, and guilty of great Miſchiefs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; although the Authority of their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by their unjuſt, avaricious Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> even to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, laid the Foundation of thoſe Diſorders, and they might have added Blood-ſhed; yet their Aſſembly have the Impudence to Palm it all upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Maſſachuſetts.</p>
               <p>THE Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> are ſo happy as to be almoſt exempted from any <hi>New-York</hi> Claims, by Patents from that Government prior to their's; the aforeſaid <hi>Hooſick</hi> and <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> Patents being the only ones of this Nature, the former includes about one Qaurter of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> on which Part were about four Settlers, when it was granted by <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> This Townſhip is bounded Southerly by the North Line of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and extends Weſt as far as the <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colonies; the latter, i. e. <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> Patent, was granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the common Seal of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> the 15th Day of June, 1739. This Patent is ſaid to interfere with the Townſhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> and it is Matter of Diſpute, whether in it's firſt Locati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it included more than about 30 or 40 Acres within that Town, tho' it ſeems the Patent by it's diſcriptive Limits, extends further into the Town,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013102_0130_0F8EBB5FB2FE88F0"/>and the Patentees produce a Map correſponding with thoſe Limits: However, an Indian, aged Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Nine, who was Pilot to the Party that located this Grant, informs of a certain Monument they then erected, where they broke a Bottle, &amp;c. for their Eaſtern Bounds. "And it is worthy a Remark," that this Indian happens to be exactly of the ſame Age with <hi>Ebenezer Cole,</hi> one of our Author's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deponants. This Monument is well known by the <hi>Bennington</hi> People, and is on the Weſtern Edge of the Town; and there has never been a Diſcovery of any Lines of the Survey of that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Eaſtward of this Monument. The many Circumſtances of this Nature, amount to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a Certainty, that the Patentees never made any actual Location further interfering with <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> than as aforeſaid; notwithſtanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one Eighth Part of the Town; which Lands are exceeding good in Nature, and are ſettled wholly under the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Title, by induſtrious Farmers, who form a Wilderneſs State, have culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and brought the moſt of it under good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, with many valuable Houſes, Barns and Orchards; ſome of them annually mowing at leaſt 80 Tons of Hay, and raiſe other Produce of the Country in Proportion. Not the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements or Poſſeſſions were ever made in that Town, except by theſe Inhabitants; neither had they the leaſt Knowledge of a Pretence of any <hi>New-York</hi> Patents extending there till ſeveral Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſettled the Land. As has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, there was about four Settlers on that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:013102_0131_0F8EBB6155CA1060"/>Part of <hi>Hooſick</hi> Patent, included in the Townſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> when it was granted; and if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has a right Information, there has not been any more Settlements made under the <hi>New-York</hi> Title ſince, though there hath ſundry Families ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on the Premiſes, included as aforeſaid, under the <hi>New-Hamſhire</hi> Title.</p>
               <p>As the State and Circumſtances of ſuch Part of the Townſhips aforeſaid, as are included in the old Patents, are materially different, in many Reſpects, from the Circumſtances of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants in general; it will therefore be neceſſary that this Matter have a particular Conſideration; and that none of the aforeſaid Arguments be conſidered in this Caſe but what are truly applicable: and in this Review of the Caſe, it will be admitted, that the old <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> Patent includes ſuch Part of <hi>Bennington,</hi> as the Plan the Patentees exhibit doth contain.</p>
               <p>IT is taken for granted that the Royal Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the boundary Line in 1764 cou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> antecedent to the Date of that Order, which was a Manifeſtation of Royal Power, and which was the ſole Cauſe of that Extention; therefore, at the Time the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> granted the forementioned old Patents, they could have no greater Authority for ſo doing than what they were then in Fact poſſeſſed of: It remains therefore to be conſidered, whether the Patents from the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or not, ſo far as they interfere with the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:013102_0132_0F8EBB646A9A24A8"/>of <hi>Bennington</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And Firſtly, it has been proved that the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> as diſcribed in their Governor's Commiſſions, doth not extend ſo far North as the City of <hi>Albany;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Northern Tracts of Country which theſe Patents of <hi>Hooſick</hi> and <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> cover, muſt be conſidered as belonging to their ſecond Sort of Domain, (to wit) the Territories. It has alſo been ſhewn, that theſe Territories are not circumſcribed to any particular Limits, but that they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally meant to include ſome ancient Grants that were Independent of the Province and adjoining Settlements, on Extra-provincial Lands: probably that Government may have Authority to grant Land to the Weſt and North-Weſt, where it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably unappropriated, and where the Claim of none other Government could interfere: But it will be inſiſted upon, on the Part of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, which are included in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid old Patents, that the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> had no Right to extend any of their Patents to the Eaſtward of a Line equivalent to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the Bounds between <hi>New-York</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts:</hi> This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit was ever thought by the People in general of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> as well as thoſe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Colonies, to be the Eaſtern Boundary of <hi>New-York,</hi> until the Aera of the late Determination, which extended it to the River <hi>Connecticut:</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Men that ſupport the World of Mankind, are obliged to form their Judgments of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Government's by the common received Opinions of Mankind they are converſant with;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013102_0133_0F8EBAD2AB05A430"/>and even admitting they make an erroneous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet, in the preſent Caſe, as the Lands were of but little Value, excluſive of their Toil and Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and as the Farmers in Reality uphold the State, it is therefore not only incumbent on the Laws, but on the Policy of the State to defend them in Caſes of this Nature—it muſt be admitted that where the Limits of Governments are clearly aſcertained and notoriouſly known, that a Farmer treſpaſſing in this Manner on another's Property, muſt bear the Loſs: But, provided a Country of People be generally under a Deception as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Juriſdiction, and purchaſe Land and make great Improvements, and all on a miſtaken Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Men in ſuch Circumſtances ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the moſt favourable Light. For, as not only Individuals, but the Country about them were in the ſame Manner deceived, and therefore, at the Time of purchaſing and Settlement, they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute of the Means of Knowledge; yet, however, it is not conceded to, that thoſe Farmers on whoſe Account the preſent Arguments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, are under a Deception about this Matter; for of all Sorts of governmental Juriſdiction, the <hi>New-York</hi> Territorial was the weakeſt, looſeſt and moſt vague; it was rather occaſional and political, than poſitive, and in it's own Nature almoſt or quite incapable of being extended faſter than Settlements were actually carried on, or at moſt the Lands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to this territorial Juriſdiction, ſhould not be patented faſter than his Majeſty's Subjects are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed forthwith to ſettle. The Neceſſity of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo faſt may be pleaded on Account of Order—the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:013102_0134_0F8EBB68D2BB8840"/>Policy of Government may demand it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an occaſional Juriſdiction would be altogether unable to abilitate the Government to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Right in Fee; although it is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable that ſuch a Juriſdiction in Matters of meer Government, is to all Intents and Purpoſes, equal to poſitive Juriſdiction; but with Reſpect to hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Power to convey the Fee of Lands, is Matter of Doubt: But thus much with Propriety may be inferred, that a Title ſo weak and impotent ſhould not claim Superiority over the leaſt Conception of Title whatever; a meer Poſſeſſion is of itſelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to maintain the Right in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, and on a judicious Tryal at common Law, (cou'd ſuch an One be had) would be judged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to it.</p>
               <p>There is another Conſideration that muſt totally extinguiſh and obliterate all poſſible remaining Idea of Right, that the Patentees of <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> may be ſuppoſed to have to the ſaid Tract of Land includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Limits of the Townſhip of <hi>Bennington.</hi> Only advert to the Date of that Patent, which is on the 15th Day of June, 1739, and compare it with the Time of the Commencement of the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which was in the Spring of the Year 1760, and there will be found to be 21 Years, from the Date of this Patent, to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Settlement under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi>—in all this Time there was not the leaſt Settlement or Poſſeſſion made in the Premiſes; although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Condition of the Patent was, that it ſhould be ſettled in three Years from the Time of granting.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:013102_0135_0F8EBB6982919BA8"/>Poſſibly in all that Time the Patentees might have got ſome Dutch Tenants on ſome Weſtern Part of the Patent, which, with the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> may be denominated a Fulfilment of the Condition of Settlement; many large Tracts hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been patented, ſome ſince, and others longer ago than that <hi>Wallumſcock,</hi> which are yet moſtly a howling Wilderneſs. This Practice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> in extending their Patents to the Eaſtward of a Twenty Mile Line from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s River, hath ever been conſidered as a diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and deſigning Policy in that Government; thereby to lay a Foundation for intruding on the Rights of their neighbouring Colonies; and has been attended with many diſagreeable Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as has been before obſerved. And as that Government have given up their exorbitant Claims where they interfered with the Right of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts,</hi> it would undoubtedly be their wiſeſt Way to do the ſame with Reſpect to ſuch Claims as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the Right granted under the great Seal of the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> and inſtead of treating the People that have ſettled thoſe Lands under that Title, as Rioters and Felons; to exerciſe that Juſtice and Humanity towards them, which becometh Governors, to the governed.</p>
               <p>IT remains ſtill, that there be a ſummary View exhibited, relative to the Rule of Right which ſhould take Place with Reſpect to the Settlers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Government, that are ſettled on ſuch Part of the forementioned Patents as are included in the Townſhips of <hi>Bennington</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013102_0136_0F8EBB6A2AAC2220"/>Superiority of Title is in Favour of thoſe under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> nevertheleſs, as the Line of Juriſdiction, in thoſe Times of granting and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not expreſly aſcertained or known.—Under theſe Circumſtances, it would not only be bad State-policy, but great Inhumanity and Injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Subject; for either the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> to diſpoſſeſs them, let them have ſettled under the Title of either; for Titles liable to ſo much Diſpute and Uncertainty as both muſt be confeſſed to be (though One may have much the Preference of the Other) are not ſufficient to ouſt the Poſſeſſor, inaſmuch as both challenge a legal Right; therefore, either Title, ſealed and confirmed with the Sweat and Toil of the Farmer is abundantly paramount to the Other.</p>
               <p>OUR Authors, in their Appendix, Page 19th, miſ-repreſent the Plea of the <hi>Bennington</hi> People, in ſaying, <q>To reaſon on their own Principles, if Equity confirmed the Claims of Others under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> on Account of Priority of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering Grants, it would have afforded a fatal Plea againſt the People of <hi>Bennington;</hi> becauſe they ought then themſelves to have yielded up all the Lands which are covered by more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Patents.</q> The People of <hi>Bennington,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inſiſted, that at the Time the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> granted thoſe Lands, they had good Right ſo to do; but that <hi>New-York</hi> had not. This Matter is illuſtrated and proved by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and real Facts, in this Treatiſe, particularly
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:013102_0137_0F8EBB6AF1647090"/>in the 2d and 3d Sections, to which the Reader is referred. 'Tis true, provided the <hi>Bennington</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no further Conſiderations in the Matter of Title, but the Priority of interfering Grants—according to this Method of arguing, they ought to yield up ſuch Part of that Town as interferes with <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> Patent; but the Conſideration of Settlement is undoubtedly, with the many other Matters, material to be conſidered, as argued afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

               <p>HAVING gone through with the Remarks on the <hi>New-York</hi> Pamphlet, ſo far as immediately reſpects the Title of thoſe Lands which has been the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of the Publication of this Treatiſe—ſhall nextly proceed to detect ſome notorious and diſhonorable Miſ-repreſentations contained in the Pamphlet aforeſaid, particularly in the Appendix. In this brief Review, it would be too tedious, as well as needleſs, to trace the Authors through all their diſguiſed and fictitious Repreſentations, and intricate Windings. Shall therefore paſs on with noteing ſuch of their Exhibitions as are the moſt cruelly fallacious; among which the Story of the Extention of the Townſhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> merely by a Vote of the Inhabitants, at a Town Meeting, to the Weſtward from where it was intended to be granted, and within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, is the moſt flagrantly opprobrious. The Story may be ſeen recorded in the 4th Page of their Appendix. <q>The Grantees of the Townſhip
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:013102_0138_0F8EBB6BCB10FE18"/>of <hi>Bennington,</hi> diſcovered that the Situation of the Tract according to the Intention of the Grant, would be both inconvenient and unprofitable, as it included a large Proportion of Mountain; and they therefore, by no better Authority than a Vote of their Town Meeting, preſumed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to the Weſtward, within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As this Repreſentation in All and every Part is entirely groundleſs, and no Pretence of Proof to ſupport it, but is the meer calumnious Aſperſion of thoſe who have an implacable Hatred to the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi> People, a oſitive Denial of the Facts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, would be a ſufficient Refutation of thoſe Facts. Nevertheleſs, as the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have made a principal Engine of this infamous Story of their own Creation, to deſtroy the good Character of the People aforeſaid, by repreſenting them to the Government at Home as the vileſt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents and Out-Laws—and inaſmuch as the Facts alledged are capable of Diſ-proof by mathematical Certainty, and ſundry Demonſtrations of this Sort having been actually made, (though not with a View of diſproving this Calumny, as it had not then been publiſhed,) by Admenſurations of the Diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, to the Weſterly Line of <hi>Bennington,</hi> all of which agree that it is at leaſt Twenty Miles. Mr. <hi>Samuel Robinſon</hi> for once made an actual Menſuration of that Diſtance, and found it to be Twenty Miles and Thirty-five Chains; his Affidavit and Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Wood's,</hi> together with an atteſted Copy of the Survey of that Town
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:013102_0139_0F8EBB6C84C58308"/>by Mr. <hi>Matthew Cleſſon,</hi> the Surveyor, is thought Expedient to tranſcribe in it's following Order, which will abundantly ſerve to exculpate the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bennington</hi> from that Odium wherewith they have been branded. The Author is furthermore eſpecially directed by the Inhabitants of that Town, to <q>requeſt the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> to vindicate what their Aſſembly have before alledged, by another accurate Menſuration of the Diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, to the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Line of <hi>Bennington;</hi> and further notify that Aſſembly, that as omnipotent as they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be, they muſt nevertheleſs recede from the Calumny wherewith they have abuſed the Inhabitants of that Town, and do public Penance for the ſame, or continue under the Reſentment of thoſe Inhabitans:</q> Which take an additional Affront at the ill Uſage, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as our Opponents tell us Page 3d, it is to <q>be tranſmitted for the Information of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at Home;</q> and further inform that it was to guard againſt the Impoſitions which from the Want of Candor, they were apprehenſive the ſaid Settlers, who <q>ſpared no Art of Act of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</q> would by their Agents deceive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at Home, and therefore they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to tranſmit a Narrative of thoſe Settler's Proceedings, for the Information of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſeems the ſaid Aſſembly fully reſolved that the Settlers and Agents from the Want of Candor, would endeavour artfully to deceive, &amp;c. and that themſelves were as fully reſolved to over match them in a Game of that Sort, being greater
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:013102_0140_0F8EBB6D44061338"/>Practitioners than Peaſants: But artful as they are, they made a fatal Miſtake in advancing for Matter of Fact that which in its own Nature is incapable of Proof, and what has been diſprov'd by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a mathematical Nature, and capable of further Diſ-proof by actual Menſuration. It is no Ways marvellous that thoſe Gentlemen which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in that Aſſembly have an Antipathy againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> who have had a great Share in defeating them in obtaining Poſſeſſion of the Country of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants: It ſeems they are no inſenſible of their Merit, for, ſay they, <q>it is to this Townſhip erected by a Charter in itſelf void, and ſo greatly abuſed, that we are to aſcribe all the Oppoſition which has ſince been given to the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </q> It is evident that theſe Gentemen have an evil Eye upon <hi>Bennington</hi> Inhabitants; for, when they mention the Oppoſition to their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they take Care to repeat the aforeſaid groundleſs Aſperſion, by adding theſe Words, <q>erected by a Charter in itſelf void, and ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed.</q> They ſtill proceed upon this their favourite Topic, and draw particular Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from it to their advantage, <q>for by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Situation of <hi>Bennington,</hi> it is made to comprehend a large Part of <hi>Wallumſcock,</hi> which was granted under the Seal of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſo early as the Year 1739.</q> This their ſcandalous Aſſertion is twice repeated in Page 8th. One of the Paſſages is as follows: <q>Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll,</hi> one of the moſt eminent Counſel in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selveſter</hi> of <hi>Albany,</hi> were concerned for
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:013102_0141_0F8EBB6DEBDBAD28"/>the Defendants. When theſe Gentlemen found <hi>Breakenridge's</hi> Farm to be within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, and greatly to the Weſtward of what the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-York</hi>—they told him that it was impoſſible to ſet up any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple for his Defence. Accordingly, when his Caſe was brought to Tryal, he refuſed to confeſs the Leaſe, Entry and Ouſture, agreeable to the Rule, and the Plaintiff being Non-ſuited, obtained Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſucceeding July Term, againſt the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Ejector.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is far from being the true State of the Caſe. Sundry Cauſes which had been tried, were determined againſt the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> perceived it was expending Money to no Purpoſe, to maintain a Suit at Law againſt the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, as they had ſuch a Combination of Intereſt with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Part of which were intereſted in the <hi>New-York</hi> ſubſequent Patents, which interfered with the Grants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> though not in thoſe on Tryal. This, with many other Things too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to particularize, was the Cauſe why Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> would not defend the aforeſaid Suit in Tryal; but there as not a Word ſaid, (as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me) between him and his ſaid Attornies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Farm's being within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River; nor is it likely never ſuch a Thing was mentioned in <hi>Albany</hi> County; the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well known. Undoubtedly, this was wrote "for the Information of Government at Home,"
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:013102_0142_0F8EBB6EC6C77D28"/>thinking the Fallacy would not there be detected, it being at ſo great a Diſtance.</p>
               <p>OUR Authors, P. 10th, after giving a Narrative of a riotous and tumultuous Outrage, committed by the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> for which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation had iſſued from the Earl of <hi>Dunmore,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the principal Authors of the Diſturbance "which could not be brought to Juſtice," then they introduce a particular Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Breakenridge,</hi> which is entirely deſtitute of Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. That he was One of the principal Rioters. To this they join the former Calumny of the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Extention of <hi>Bennington,</hi> 
                  <q>by a Vote of their  Town Meeting;</q> and add to both theſe, the groundleſs Story of Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi>'s Council's Inability to ſet up any Principle in his Defence, by Reaſon of his being ſeated <q>within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River.</q> All theſe Fictions blended together, make conſiderable of a Figure, in their own Words, <q>
                     <hi>James Breakenridge</hi> and <hi>Iſaiab Carpenter,</hi> were Two of the moſt inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the Offenders: the firſt had ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, where he knew it was impoſſible, on their own Principles, that he could be protected by the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claim, he had declined a fair Tryal, and ſuffered Judgment by Default.</q> With Reſpect to Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi>'s being active in any Expeditions (the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> denominate Riots, Mobs, Felony, &amp;c.) it is well known thro' the Country of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, he has not. In the 18th and 19th Pages of the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:013102_0143_0F8EBB6F87ED7310"/>they repeat their former Aſperſion againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Bennington</hi> in the moſt virulent and emphatical Language—<q>And what is ſtill more ſhameful, they contend, they arm, they ſight, for Lands, as a Part of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, and which the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> never claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but admitted to be beyond their Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS THERE can be no Doubt but theſe Gentlemen really wiſh theſe things to be true, and having ſo frequently repeated them as being ſo, it is conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured they by this Time begin to believe them, or at leaſt think others may; but that the imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reader may have the real Truth of the Matter, the following Evidence is exhibited.</p>

Undoubtedly, againſt the Colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> this was the Caſe; that in ſome Inſtances <hi>New-York</hi> loſt Land by the Windings of the River, in others it gained it ſo as to make it about equivalent to a Breadth Twenty Miles Eaſt from the River; had the Line commenced at that Diſtance from the River, and extended Equidiſtant to it, which would be a Line Difficult to aſcertain, and perpetuate.</p>

THAT ſome Time in the Month of October 1771, We was in Company together in the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Part of <hi>Rupourt,</hi> a Townſhip of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, and we perceived there was a Controverſy between the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers of that Townſhip, and ſundry Perſons that had newly come to that Place, with Axes and Saws, and other Farmery Inſtruments, to begin a new Settlement near the Weſt Line of ſaid Town, and within the Limits of the ſame, under ſubſequent Patents, under the Grant of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> which laped on the Township afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: And ſundry of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers of that Town were gathered together to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of about Nine, including <hi>Ethan Allen,</hi> and <hi>Remember Baker,</hi> which was not Inhabitants of ſaid Town; this Number of Perſons went to warn off Two Men, whoſe Names were <hi>Todd,</hi> that was then at work on a Lot of Land laid out to <hi>Robert Cochran</hi> in ſaid <hi>Rupourt,</hi> and on the ſame Piece, where ſaid <hi>Cochran</hi> had partly cleared before, and had in his Poſſeſſion: and we the Deponents went with the Party, having a Curioſity to ſee the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for we were informed that the Two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachers, viz. the <hi>Todds,</hi> had bid a Challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, and that they were provided with Arms, and had threatened the Life of the ſaid <hi>Cochran,</hi> and claimed the ſame Land by a ſubſequent Patent from the Governor of <hi>New-York:</hi> So the Party came to where the Two Perſons above named were at work, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Land, and warned them, to forthwith go off from the Premiſes, and they did accordingly.
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:013102_0149_0F8EBB7405FF3F70"/>And we found it true that the Two Encroachers was well furniſhed with Fire-Arms, and ſo was the Party of Nine Men that went to diſpoſſeſs them; expecting there would be near or quite as many to oppoſe them, but there was no Pretence of uſing Fire-Arms on either Side. After this, the Party of Nine Men went a little further, where another Perſon had began to build a Log-Houſe on a Lot of Land belonging to a <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grantee in ſaid Town; the Logs were laid, and the Rafters fixed thereon for the Roof; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Name that was building the ſame, was <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> the Party aforeſaid warned him off the Land; accordingly he departed the Town, but tarried to ſee the Logs he had collected together, pulled down, and laid in Four Heaps by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and burned with Fire. After this, the Party advanced a little further, where one <hi>Reid</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ſmall Improvement on a Piece of Land in the Town of <hi>Pollite,</hi> his Claim being alſo under <hi>New-York,</hi> on a ſubſequent Grant, where was a poor Shelter, four Crotches being drove into the Ground, and a Pole laid thereon, and Boughs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the heap in Lieu of a Roof: This ſhiftleſs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick was alſo conſumed by Fire by the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and we the Deponents, were Eye-witneſſes of the Fact before related; and directly after this, the Party diſperſed: But there was no Family diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed in the whole Affair, nor was there any that had moved on the Premiſes under Title from <hi>New-York.</hi> And further the Deponents ſay not.

                           <p>THAT, on or about the 19th Day of June, 1773. we arrived from <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>New-York</hi>—ſoon after
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:013102_0151_0F8EBB74D99846D0"/>our Arrival, we met with Col. <hi>Reid,</hi> in <hi>New-York,</hi> who invited us to ſettle under him in the County of <hi>Charlette,</hi> on Lands which he ſaid he owned in that County. We being Strangers to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and not knowing there was any Diſpute or Controverſy about Land in America, thought beſt to accept of his Offer; and accordingly agreed to go with him, on the following Terms, viz. That we ſhould have a Leaſe of our Land forever, with the firſt ſeven Years free from Rent, and after that, Six Pence per Acre yearly, and to deliver to him at his Mill or Mills, the Tenth Part of our Grain yearly, and not to cut any Timber, ſave what the clearing our Lands required. On the aforeſaid Agreement we ſet out from <hi>New-York,</hi> with ſaid <hi>Reid,</hi> and when we arrived at Fort <hi>Miller,</hi> we hear'd thoſe Lands that we agreed for, were in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; on which we went to ſaid <hi>Reid,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, that if his Lands were in Diſpute, we rather choſe to turn back, than to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but he affirmed to us, that his Land was not in Diſpute, and that he would put us in peaceable Poſſeſſion, and protect us there. On this Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement we went forward as far as Fort <hi>George,</hi> where we heard the News of the Diſpute again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us; on which ſome of our Company would have turned back, but Col. <hi>Reid</hi> refuſed to let them go, aſſuring us that the Lands was not in any Conteſt, and that he would compel us to go forward. After this we went to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> where we underſtood that the Land to which we were going, was granted to the Settlers that were on it by the Governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and that they
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:013102_0152_0F8EBB7571603688"/>would not give up their Title, it being antecedent to <hi>New-York</hi> Patents. After hearing that we ſhould have Trouble, we abſolutely refuſed to go any further, telling Col. <hi>Reid</hi> that we did not come to <hi>America</hi> to fight for any Man's Title, nor to take away any Man's Property, and deſired we might go back to <hi>New-York;</hi> but he refuſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that we ſhould fulfil our Agreement, and, that there was a Parcel of <hi>Yankies,</hi> or <hi>New-England</hi> Men, ſettled all over America, without any Right or Title to their Lands, and he would put us in Poſſeſſion, and defend us there. After this, he brought us to the Mouth of <hi>Otter Creek,</hi> and then he ordered every Man to load his Gun; but I, viz. <hi>James Henderſon,</hi> refuſed to load mine. Next Morning, at the Falls of ſaid <hi>Creek,</hi> he aſk'd me where my Firelock was? I replied, it was in the Battoe. Ay! Damn you! ſaid he, you dare not load your Firelock—you will make a bad Soldier. After this we went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> a Town above the Falls, where we found large Improvements made, and the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi>'s actually in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their Families, which Families ſaid <hi>Reid</hi> turned out, and put us, with the Reſt of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in their Place—then he ſaid, there was no further Danger, and went back and left us to keep Poſſeſſion of thoſe Houſes and Improvements. Soon after this, came a large Number of armed Men which ſtiled themſelves the <hi>Green-Mountain-Boys,</hi> and they demanded of us if we were <hi>Reid</hi>'s Settlers? We replied that we were. Then they informed us that their Buſineſs was to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs us, alledging that thoſe Lands were antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:013102_0153_0F8EBB764CE32220"/>granted to them by the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and that they would keep Poſſeſſion of them 'till his Majeſty's Pleaſure was further known, Then they ordered our Goods and Effects to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Houſes, that none of them ſhould be hurt, which was done; and then they demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and burned the Houſes, which were made with large Logs, but nothing of our Houſhold Goods were burned. Next Day they pulled down a Griſt Mill of ſaid <hi>Reid</hi>'s, and there was a ſmall Stack of Hay burned; which they ſaid accidentally took Fire; and that if they could find out that any of their Men put Fire to it, they ſhould pay for the Hay; for, they ſaid, they did not approve that any of the Effects of the Earth ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Their Horſes likewiſe deſtroyed ſome of the Wheat and Corn, but they did not otherways abuſe our Perſons, Effects or Families; neither did they exclaim againſt governmental Authority, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirmed that they would maintain their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and defend it from the Incurſion of Col. <hi>Ried,</hi> or any other Claims from <hi>New-York,</hi> until his Majeſty's Pleaſure ſhould be further known.

               <head>SECTION VIII.</head>
               <p>OUR Authors in the Twenty Seventh and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Page of their Narrative, diſcover great Invention and Subtilty, who after giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the unfortunate Circumſtances of the Town of <hi>Hinſdale</hi> which has, ſay they, <q>been taken up by a Royal Mandamus.</q> This Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had firſt been granted by the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> and upon the Settlement of the Boundary-Line between the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, it fell within the latter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Proprietors, who in Addition to their Title, had alſo the Indian Right. This Townſhip, by the Determination of the Boundary Line between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> fell within the Juriſdiction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <hi>Howard,</hi> after it had been ſettled about Seventy Years. The Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in Order to ſcreen their Government from the Imputation of the Blame juſtly due to ſo reprehenſible a Conduct, endeavour to palm it on the Government at Home, ſee Page Sixth, with Reſpect to <q>
                     <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> a Townſhip in the South Eaſt Corner of <hi>Cumberland</hi> County: Even this is not to be aſcribed to our Government, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a much greater, and the higheſt Authority: A Mandamus was produced from the Crown, on the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which veſted the Grantee with a Right of Election, an Act deciſive in itſelf, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013102_0156_0F8EBB7B18A9CC08"/>the Agency of the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil here, and the uſual Forms.</q> A very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Repreſentation! The Nature of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mandamus is diametrically oppoſite to this Interpretation: The Right of Election in the Grantees, is reſtricted entirely to Crown Lands which are unapropriated; in ſuch Lands, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee has a Right of Election, and common Senſe may teach, that neither a Mandamus or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crown Grant can ſubvert the Property which the Subject holds under the Crown by Prior Grants; and, though there be ever ſo many Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the Juriſdiction, ſundry of which have perplexed the Town of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> yet this ſhould have no Effect on the Property of the Subjects.—Theſe Grantees are likewiſe withheld from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereing on the Right of the Indian Subjects.—Yet, it ſeems Col. <hi>Howard</hi> had the Vanity to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Mandamus on the old Plantation of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> which was firſtly appropriated by a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe from the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſecondly, by a Grant from the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> and thirdly, by the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and fourthly, by an uninterupted Poſſeſſion and Occupancy about Seventy Years.</p>
               <p>THE Subterfuge the Gentlemen make Uſe of, to rid their Government from Diſhonour, in making this laſt Grant of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; it ſeems not well calculated <q>to be tranſmitted for the Information of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Home!</hi>
                  </q> who are undoubtedly compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of their own Mandamus's, and no
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013102_0157_0F8EBB7BEE0F6D78"/>Doubt will eaſily diſcern their Laſt Error to be worſe than the Firſt. Such prepoſterous grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lands, is Criminally injurious to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as it never fails to embarraſs the different Claimants with many concomitant Difficulties. Yet, ſtill to caſt the Blame due to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the King's Mandamus, is more dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly injurious to the higheſt Authority in the Nation.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, the manner of Redreſs preſcribed for the Sufferers, viz. the old Proprietors of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> is the moſt ſhocking Piece of Contrivance, Page 27, <q>
                     <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> a ſmall Townſhip which has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been taken up by Virtue of a Royal Mandamus, is alone unfortunate—but even here the Poſſeſſors may be relieved, by a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compenſation, equal to the Value of their Improvements in Crown Lands, free from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Fees.</q> Theſe Gentlemen in their great Clemency have alſo conceded that the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Settlers in general may be thus conſidered, <q>On the ſame Terms, may be aſſigned to each of thoſe who are ſeated on the Soil, actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to others by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the Poſſeſſions of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for that Reaſon be confirmed; ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Crown Lands, as the Governor and Council ſhall judge to be adequate to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Improvements.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEN they proceed to deſcribe the Tract, <q>A Fertile and extenſive Country, in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013102_0158_0F8EBB7C2BCB70E8"/>Part of the County of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Connecticut</hi> River and Lake <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,</hi> ſtill remains unpatented by either Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and might be planted and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by theſe People:</q>—What a ſurpriſing Condeſcention this! the Poſterity of the Original Proprietors of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> eſpecially, to be allowed the Privilege to pull up Sakes, quit their Farms and Poſſeſſions, Houſes, Orchards, &amp;c. and join Company with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and trudge off to the North-Eaſt Part of the Wilderneſs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and there commence another Settlement, leaving their pleaſant Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Fields, Tenements, and Country, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for a howling Wilderneſs; a pretty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change!—and this to gratify a number of <hi>New-York</hi> Cormorants. But, let's ſtop a little and conſider—whether it would not be more Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to change the Scene, and ſo the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees remove their Patents, that interfere with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, and lay them in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> as neither Government have appropriated it.</p>
               <p>A ſufficient Reaſon to be offered in favour of the latter of theſe Projects, is, that the Settlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> are in Deed, and in Truth the right and lawful Owners and Proprietors of the Lands they poſſeſs, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demonſtrated in the preceding Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Although theſe Gentlemen have, in the Courſe of their Narration, flung out very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Hints of rewarding his Majeſty's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013102_0159_0F8EBB7FD8E9C6F0"/>by the Diſtribution of thoſe Lands, yet, they may here again be reminded, (which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve as the above Reaſon) that his Majeſty's Proclamation directed the Soldiery to make their Pitches on unappropriated and vacant Lands; this therefore, they muſt do, at the Hazard of loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Grants, or repitching. For thoſe Lands which being antecedently granted by the Crown, by the Agency of the Governor and Council of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> muſt forever exclude the Soldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from pitching thereon; and put it entirely out of the Power of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> or the Crown, to grant them to a Second Perſon. And when it is conſidered, that the <hi>New-York</hi> Land-Jobbers have, long ſince purchaſed great Part of the Soldiery Rights, and that for a mere Trifle, and laid them out of themſelves, at their own Riſque; their Arguments on that Subject, cannot contribute greatly to the Removal of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, to the exterior Part of <hi>Charlotte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Authors have given a tedious Hiſtory of the Suits at Law, which have been commenced, by the <hi>New-York</hi> Patentees, againſt the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and Occupants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and have exhibited many ſpecious Appearances of Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Equity, and Impartiality in their Tryals. However, the Reader muſt obſerve, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe, ſo boaſted of, candid Tryals, the Defendants, by the Reſult, were to be diſpoſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Farms. They then continue to tell of the entire Satisfaction of the Vanquiſhed, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:013102_0160_0F8EBB80C1513050"/>with ſuch or the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants at attended the Courts) relative to the Validity of the <hi>New-York</hi> Title.—Soon after this, they give a ſurpriſing Account of Riots and Outrages, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by theſe Settlers, and mention <hi>Allen</hi> by Name, (who they ſay, but a little before was ſo fully perſuaded of the Validity of the <hi>New-York</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) as one of their Leaders. This Narrative is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf incredible, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that Men who were convinced, they had had an impartial Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at Law, and of the Inſufficiency of their own Title, and the Authenticity of that of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, would rally to arm, in Defiance of legal Authority, and in Defence of their own invalid Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; eſpecially, after they had publickly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own Sentiments concerning that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>THIS Aſſembly ſeem profuſely laviſh in the Praiſe of their own Government, concerning the Generoſity, Forbearance and Humanity, &amp;c. they have exerciſed towards the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers; and that nothing of that Sort may here paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, but that every Act, by them done, worthy of ſuch Appellations, may be duly acknowledged; it will be freely confeſſed that Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> and the Majority of his Majeſty's Council, conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Honour and Humanity toward them; while his Excellency was in the Adminiſtration, except in paſſing ſome very extraordinary Laws on the 9th of March, 1774, which may be ſeen in the fore Part of this Treatiſe, under the Head of the Narrative: But thoſe Settlers muſt have that
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013102_0161_0F8EBB81EF954A28"/>Charity for his Excellency, as to conclude he, would not have put his Sanction to thoſe Laws, had he not known the ſaid Settlers called the <hi>Green Mountain-Boys</hi> to be very expert with Fire-Arms and likewiſe very good Woodſers; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the <hi>New-York</hi> Land-jobbers cou'd not put theſe Laws in Execution. To view this Matter in any other Light, they would be obliged to diſtruſt the Fidelity of their worthy Friend Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Tryon.</hi> But to return to the Subject of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. The Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> are unwiſe to make ſo great a Buſtle about this Matter, inaſmuch as they have ſpoiled the Joke themſelves, by their ſo infamous a Propoſal of Accommodation, which as has been before obſerved, is, that the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers remove to the Wilderneſs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> in Order to gratify a certain Fraternity with the Country they have with much Toil and Expence ſubdued: We have a very beautiful Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this <hi>New-York</hi> Beneficence by a wiſe Author, <q>the tender Mercies of the Wicked are Cruelty.</q>—Now follows another Quotation from our Authors, which is no leſs than a barefaced Inſult on thoſe Inhabitants, and one of the boldeſt of Miſrepreſentations. <q>If the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants imagined that they were aggrieved by the Deciſions of our Judges, the Means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs were in their own Power; and they ought to have ſued their Writs of Error, and in the legal and ordinary Mode, to have referred their Cauſe to the final Sentence of his Majeſty: But to expect a Remedy incompatible with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice, and the Rights of the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:013102_0162_0F8EBB8233C883F8"/>Subject, either beſpeak the greateſt Ignorance, or Preſumption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>COULD they once get this eſtabliſhed, that there ſhould be no Acceſs to his Majeſty, or Trial, but in this "ordinary Mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire Satisfaction; Tryals in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would then eaſily become deciſive; for in no Caſe, wherein the Demand of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is below the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds, a Writ of Error in Favour of the Defendant can iſſue. And the <hi>New-York</hi> Attornies who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled the <hi>New-York</hi> Statings, and are alſo Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees under that Government, well knew that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Action brought againſt the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants has been deſignedly laid below that Sum. Yet they were poſſeſſed of that extreme Boldneſs to aver in expreſs Terms, that, <q>if the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants imagined, that they were aggrieved, by the Deciſions of <hi>their</hi> Judges, their Means of Redreſs were in their own Power.</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> by Way of a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing exhibited in this <hi>New-York</hi> Pamphlet which more ſenſibly deſerves Reſentment than their Pretenſions of Indulgencies, Favours, &amp;c. conferred on theſe Claimants by that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—<q>To the Honor of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> it may juſtly be aſſerted, that the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants have received every Mark of Favour and Indulgence which the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances permitted.</q> Such Hypocriſy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſes
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013102_0163_0F8EBB82ED033950"/>Human Nature, is the Peſt of Society, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Falſhood and Treachery; and what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it peculiarly vile, is, that it uſurps the Seat of Virtue, and deſtroys Faith in Communities, and is the Source of cruel Jealouſy. Had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York</hi> been truly friendly to thoſe Settlers, it had been return'd again; and mutual Good Will ſupplied the Place of Hatred an Strife. But, alas! ſo long as the Fee of the Country of the <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> Grants is the Object in View, by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> how it is poſſible for Peace and good Order to take Place, can't well be conceived. Well would it be for that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and infinitely better for the Settlers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> were they annexed to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government; but they ſay, No. Quere, Why? The Anſwer is eaſy. They would then looſe Sight of the aforeſaid deſirable Object: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſurely they would be glad to part with ſuch rebellious Subjects as they repreſent them to be. For the Truth no Doubt is, that they are in Hopes ſome better Fortune may in future, attend them. And that they can take and execute ſome of the leading Men among theſe Inhabitants; and ſo frighten and impoſe on the Reſt; and finally, by this Means, avail themſelves of their Eſtates and Property. This is all they can deſire in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Country under their Juriſdiction. That they have in Reality a View to this, will further appear, by ſome memorable Sentences recorded in the 25th Page of their Appendix. "We may," ſay they, <q>readily conceive, that <hi>Breakenridge,</hi> and his Party, have abundant Reaſon to wiſh
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:013102_0164_0F8EBB83B5CE8170"/>for an Alteration of Juriſdiction. The public Crimes, and private Wrongs which they have perpetrated, muſt make them look forward to the Hour of Tranquility, with the moſt anxious Apprehenſions. The injured may then demand Satisfaction for all their Sufferings.—An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement muſt then be made to the Country, for the Violation of it's Laws.</q> Here the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers may read their intended Doom, in Conſequence of the Ability of the Government of <hi>New-York.</hi> And one Reaſon why this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have not already deſtroyed the Inhabitants of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, with Fire and Sword, is their Want of Ability; and this Inability, in great Part, conſiſts in this, that the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Government, are univerſally of Opinion that the Inhabitants have a good Right to thoſe Lands, and ſhould not be moleſted in the peaceable Enjoyment of them; and conſequently will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their Civil Officers, in taking Poſſeſſion of their Tenements, or them as Rioters. That they are no further turbulent than what is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Perſons and Properties, from the Cruelty and Monopoly of their Rulers. This is the Ground of all the Lenity, Forbearance and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of that Government towards thoſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and it is hoped, if theſe exceſſive Favours ſhould be paſſed over without their Thanks, they may yet be excuſed for the Neglect.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, thoſe Gentlemen, after having thus ſoon out their in ſulcible Complaints, crown the Whole in Page 25th. <q>That they, i. e. the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:013102_0165_0F8EBAD14037AA00"/>
                     <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, may in Nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Character, they have appointed <hi>James Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenridge,</hi> (whom we have ſo often mentioned) a Fugitive from Juſtice, and who has rendered himſelf ſo obnoxious as to become the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Subject of a Proelamation—as one of their Agents.</q> What a monſtrous Crime is here!—Has Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> rendered himſelf obnoxious to Puniſhment in the Government of <hi>New-York?</hi> O ſtrange! Such a <hi>pacific</hi> Government too!—But what has he done? He has never, (notwithſtanding all their Inſinuations) been active in any Riots (as they term them) occaſioned by this Controverſy; but is become the Subject of a Proclamation—yet ſtill, what Evil has he done? As thoſe Gentlemen have not obliged the Public with an Information, the Author can ſupply their Defect. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was one of the firſt Settlers on the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Grants; and has had a great Share in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Oeconomy of that Country, is a Man of Probity and Stedfaſtneſs in Principle, and bleſſed with ſtrong Power of Ponderation, and has gained, as well as merited the Eſteem of theſe Settlers. He was by them choſen as Agent to repreſent their diſtreſſed Cauſe to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Preſident of the Board of Trade; and alſo, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Majeſty to interpoſe his Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and relieve his oppreſſed Subjects.—He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his Lordſhip, with a Repreſentation of the Conduct of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Conſtituents, and ſollicited his Lordſhip's Aid and Aſſiſtance, in Behalf of the Sufferers. He was received with Expreſſions of Kindneſs,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:013102_0166_0F8EBB869D6CEDB0"/>and when he had laid the Facts of the Cauſe before his Lordſhip, and ſubſtituted an Agent at <hi>London,</hi> and put the Cauſe in Readineſs for a final Tryal, before his Majeſty in Privy Council, returned to <hi>America;</hi> having done all Things to the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Employers.—Since his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Great-Britain, he has made his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at his own Houſe in <hi>Bennington,</hi> (which is not within Seventeen Miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,) although "a Fugitive from Juſtice,"—making further Preparations for the deciſive Trial depending before his Majeſty, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inhabitants, with the Hopes of his moſt gracious Deliverance. Theſe are the Things which have ſo exaſperated the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> againſt this good and worthy Man.</p>
               <p>AS THE Deſign of this Section was, in a conciſe Manner, to point out ſome of the moſt notorious Extravagancies of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> the Subject can't with Propriety be paſſed over, without taking a ſhort Review of the forementioned Laws of that Colony, which are the moſt apparent Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their horrid Malevolence and Caprice. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe Laws, which are evidently calculated with a Deſign of extirpating the Inhabitants, by them Laws alluded to, from their goodly Land, nay, from the Face of the Earth; is no leſs than laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foaming out their own Shame; Laws that ought, and are contemned and diſregarded by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lover of Virtue. Laws and Society-Compacts were originally deſigned to protect the Subjects in their Property. Loyalty and Subordination to

But, as in the preſent Inſtance, when Laws, in their original Deſign and Adminiſtration, are degenerated from the good Ends for which Laws and Government were inſtituted, terminating in the Ruin and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the Society it ſhould ſecure &amp; protect; from the ſame Principles, viz.

               <p>THESE Inducements are indiſputably Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and need no Commentation: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Priority and Preferance of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Title to that of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the ſo many corroberating and concomitant Inducements to the Claimants under the former, to ſettle and cultivate thoſe Lands; yet the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> in ſundry Parts of their State of the Right, &amp;c. and more particularly through the Appendix, treat thoſe Inhabitants, merely on Account of ſuch Settlement, with the moſt extreme Injury; who, inſtead of arguing, only declaim againſt them, and go on in a Gradation of Conſequences drawn from falſe Premiſes, till they have dragged them from their true Character of honeſt Men, to that of Uſurpers, Rioters, and Felons. Although the Quotations from our Authors have already been lengthy, yet that a Precedent of their Injuſtice may not here be wanted, the following, from the third Page of their Appendix is inſerted.</p>

To fortify their Pretentions they have ſpared no Art or Act of Violence, however Criminal; and after all, as if they were really injured, and the Objects of Regard, they do not heſitate to carry their Complaints to the Throne, and by ſpecial Agents to ſolicit ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Act of Favour, by which their Offences may be paſſed over with Impunity, and their Encroachments perpetuated in Prejudice to thoſe who enjoy a clear Title from the Crown, under the Great Seal of <hi>New-York.</hi>

As this clamorous Quotation is already moſtly anſwered, ſhall only remark, as to thoſe Settlers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Encroachments in a ten-fold Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince the Royal Determination. It hath been fully evinced that this Determination reſpected Juriſdiction only, and the before recited Royal Order and Report of the Board of Trade, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſufficient to exclude all manner of Doubts in the Minds of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claimants of the Validity of their Title. They truly cannot plead that <q>they were deceived or ignorant of the Nature or Merit of their Claim.</q> This Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was elucidated by the higheſt Wiſdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Nation; they rejoice in the Clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of their Sovereign, and in the Wiſdom and impartial Juſtice of the Honourable Board of Trade, exhibited as aforeſaid, upon which Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thoſe Claimants have greatly extended Settlements on thoſe Lands, in a more ſpecial Manner on Onion River, and Lake Champlain, between the Townſhip of Panton, which a-buts on the Lake oppoſite <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and the ſaid River, and North of it almoſt to the Forty-fith Degree of North Latitude, and preparations are vigorouſly making to extend theſe Settlements to the very Bounds of the Province of <hi>Quebec.</hi> It is ſeldom any new Country Settles with ſuch Rapidity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Oppoſitions they meet with from the Government of <hi>New-York:</hi> The Expence of clearing Roads, building Mills, Moving to and ſettling in that Wilderneſs Country only for Two Years laſt paſt, would amount to no very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sum. And thoſe Settlers from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:013102_0179_0F8EBB973512AB80"/>Reaſons, do not in the leaſt heſitate, but that they in ſo fulfilling the Conditions of their Charters, have and are acting agreeable to his Majeſty's Will and Pleaſure; and that thoſe Labours will not only be for their own Emolument, but for the Enlargement of the Britiſh Empire, and Addition of the Crown Revenue.</p>
               <p>THE Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have been very particular in their Hiſtory of the Tumults and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots made by thoſe Settlers, in Oppoſition to that Government, (many of which Facts muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be true) though they have carefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their manyfold Provocations, yet, with all their Particularity have given but a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Idea of thoſe Tranſactions. I ſhall here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, waving particulars, give a general Review of the Oeconomy of thoſe Settlers in their Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that Government. For defending their Properties, they were indicted Rioters, the next Thing was to defend Rioters; then they had two Objects as the Subjects of their Protection, viz. their Perſons, as well as Property: They were at Firſt greatly intimidated at the empty Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Law, that their Opponents were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with, ſometimes deſpairing of maintaining their Poſſeſſions; yet upon Extremity, rather than quit their Subſtance to the inſatiable Raviſhers, would rally and fruſtrate their Deſigns: Thus, when the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Albany</hi> with his Poſſe came to diſpoſſeſs ſome of them, they moſt generally, boldly took up Arms, and appointed Leaders. Matters having come to this, not long
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013102_0180_0F8EBB9800A17BD8"/>after, the Inhabitants aſſembled and appointed Committees of Safety in the ſeveral Towns through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Settlement; this general Committee have the conducting of the Public Affairs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for its Security, 'till his Majeſty ſettles the Controverſy. They have erected ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which by the Votes of the Soldiers are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Officers, theſe Companies form a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment which are known by the ſignificant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of GREEN-MOUNTAIN BOYS, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the Prime of Life, well verſed in the Uſe of Fire-Arms, and of robuſt Conſtitutions; probably no American Regiment in an interior Defence could excel them, or that would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute more to the Support of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> for it is obſervable, that ſuch Subjects that will not fight for their Property, will never fight for their King: And, the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the Committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing againſt the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> but on the Defenſive.</p>
               <p>IT is in the Nature of Things impoſſible to paſs a right Judgment on the Conduct of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Settlers, without taking into View the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> towards them. All Caſes muſt be determined upon the peculiar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending; no Act can ſcarcely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of which, under certain attending Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might not be lawful. It will be readily admitted on the Part of thoſe Settlers, that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees have a clear and inconteſtible Right to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:013102_0181_0F8EBAD0903D8FF0"/>thoſe Lands; and that they are Intruders, and by Force and Violence have maintained ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, then, they are truly guilty, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have alledged: But on the Contrary, if thoſe Settlers have a legal and inconteſtible Right to thoſe Lands, that they proſecute Settlement on the good Faith of that Title, and the ſundry Approbations of both their Title and Settlement from the Britiſh Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, then, they are not guilty in Manner as thoſe Gentlemen have declared; and the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Public, inſtead of viewing them as Uſurpers, Rioters and Felons, will juſtify them in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and eſteem them as good Members of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, leige Subjects to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and good Soldiers for defending their Perſons and Properties.</p>
               <p>THUS, is humbly ſubmitted the State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, which has for many Years ſubſiſted between the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> and the Settlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> by impartial Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice muſt every Act ſtand or fall; if thoſe Settlers are in the wrong, they are criminally ſo, but if not, then the Allegations of their Opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION, TO THE APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the <hi>French</hi> Government of <hi>Canada</hi> have made ſundry Grants of ſome of the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Part of thoſe Lands in Diſpute, between the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> and the Claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> on the Eaſterly Side of Lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> and even to the Southward of <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> And whereas the General Aſſembly of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> in their State of the Rights of that Colony, ſo far as concerns the <hi>French</hi> Grants aforeſaid, have very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly confuted the <hi>French</hi> Claim to thoſe Lands; ſhall therefore ſubjoin it as an Appendix to this Treatiſe, in aſmuch as the ſame Arguments equally Support the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Claim againſt that of the French, as they do that of <hi>New-York.</hi>—There were ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which induced the Author to make Uſe of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly,</hi> Becauſe he is not acqainted with many of the Hiſtorical Facts, on which the Arguments therein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are founded. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Conſideration that he cannot Argue ſo well. And a Third and ſpecial Reaſon is,</p>

               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:013102_0183_0F8EBB996D1CD400"/>
Becauſe be is credibly informed that the Gentlemen Land-ſchemers of New-York have altered their Plan of Operation, and have at an inconſiderable Price, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the greateſt Part of the <hi>French</hi> Claim to corobor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their own ſubſequent Patents, and by that Means to avail themſelves of an antecedent Claim to that of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> and that their preſent Scheme is to be ſilent at the Court at <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with Reſpect to their Claim under <hi>New-York,</hi> and carry on the Diſpute in the Name of the <hi>French</hi> Barons, hopeing by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to procure to themſelves the Fee of thoſe Lands which the <hi>French</hi> Grants cover; and fruſtrate and Diſpoſſeſs the Claimants and Settlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> which are ſeated on the Lands the <hi>French</hi> Grants include, to the Number of about Three Hundred Families, and on which there is not a ſingle Settler under either the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>New-York</hi> Claim. And inaſmuch, as the Chain of Arguments predicated on undeniable Facts, and exhibited in the following Appendix, of which this is an Introduction, are abundantly ſufficient to invalidate the <hi>French</hi> Claim, the Author therefore takes a peculiar Pleaſure in turning the Artillery of the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> againſt themſelves, in full Confidence that, that Aſſembly cannot, by Reaſon and Argument, gainſay what they have thus exhibited with the Help of any <hi>French</hi> Cunning whatſoever. And provided the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> had publiſhed the following Appendix, with a friendly Deſign towards the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers; that Aſſembly would have merited their grateful Acknowledgements; but though their Deſign at that Time was to defeat the <hi>French</hi> Claim to eſtabliſh their <hi>New-York</hi> Patents, nevertheleſs it ſeems a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath made Uſe of the learned Abilities and evil
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013102_0184_0F8EBB9A390A0530"/>Intenſions of the Gentlemen of that Aſſembly, which thoſe Settlers dreaded as their greateſt temporary Evil to be conducive to their greateſt temporary Good.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Arguments contained in the Appendix, to be hereafter inſerted, are full and compleat againſt the <hi>French</hi> Claim, they are nevereheleſs ſomewhat incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with meer imaginary Notions, relative to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious and antient Northern Extention of the Colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> even to the River <hi>St. Lawrence.</hi> They indeed aſcertain and vindicate the Right of the Crown of England to thoſe Lands, and then on ficticious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples aſſume the Right of that Colony to be co-extenſive with that of the Crown. Now the Reader will with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Attention, diſcern that Arguments relative to the <hi>French</hi> claim, do not at all depend on the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Extention of the Right of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> or of any of his Majeſty's colonies: Meerly the Right of the crown to that Extention of Territory is abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to nullify and make void the <hi>French</hi> claim. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly thoſe Lands granted by the <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Canada,</hi> adjoining to Lake <hi>Champlain</hi> were crown Lands when uſurped and granted by the <hi>French,</hi> and continued ſo to be till it was granted by his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> But of this enough has been already animadverted. The Diſpute between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> is committed to the Publick conſideration. What remains in this Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Appendix is only to point out to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch Part of the Arguments, or rather Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, therein contained as aſſume a colony Right to thoſe Lands, are foreign to the Point in Iſſue, in the Diſpute of the French claim; the ſame may be ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:013102_0185_0F8EBB9AEBD71178"/>the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> aſſume a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular colony Right of their's to the ſame Premiſes. Such Arguments may truly affect the colonies of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> but by no Means affect the Iſſue in Diſpute relative to the French claim, inaſmuch as the Right of the Crown of England to thoſe Lands Precludes the French claim intirely. Therefore ſuch colony Arguments as may be found interſperſed in the following Appendix are only Digreſſions from the Point in Iſſue, but cannot any Way affect the Arguments which centre in that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Point. Thoſe Digreſſions are alſo virtually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>THE Whole intermediate Coaſt between <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>'s <hi>Vineyard</hi> and the firſt Settlements in <hi>Virginia,</hi> remained entirely unknown 'till <hi>Hudſon's</hi> Diſcovery in 1609, when it began to be minutely explored, and the Bays, Rivers, Iſlands, and Creeks, diſtinguiſhed by Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River was again viſited in 1610, and the following Years, by <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, with a Grant under the States General for an excluſive Trade; and the Coloy which they denominated <hi>Nieuw Nederlant,</hi> advanced with ſuch Rapidity, that in 1612 they had a Town and Fort in <hi>New-Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> now <hi>New-York;</hi> and in 1615, another Town and Fort at <hi>Aurania,</hi> now <hi>Albany</hi> 160 Miles up <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River.</p>
            <p>IN 1623, they erected Fort <hi>Good Hope,</hi> on <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, and upwards of Thirty-five Miles from its Mouth.

            <p>IN 1663-4, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, granted to his Brother <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Diſtrict of Country comprehending <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> which were Territories poſſeſſed by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN that Year the <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſubdued by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament from <hi>England.</hi> By the Articles of Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, the Rights and Eſtates of all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were ſecured to them.</p>
            <p>IN 1673, the Country was again ſurrendered to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, but in 1674, by Treaty between the two Nations, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ceded all their Claim to this Country, to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the ſame Year King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all Doubts which might have ariſen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Validity of his firſt Grant to the Duke, on Account of the intermediate Conqueſt by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> confirmed the ſame Territories to his Royal
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:013102_0188_0F8EBB9D323EE270"/>Highneſs by a new Grant. There can be no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but that by the Words of the Duke's Grant, the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> was to have an Eaſtern Extent to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. That River takes it's Riſe to the Northward of the 45th Degree of North Latitude, and conſequently beyond the Boundary lately eſtabliſhed between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Quebet,</hi> by his Majeſty's Royal Proclamation of the 7th Day of <hi>October</hi> 1763.</p>
            <p>ON this Principle we have always claimed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Royal Grant, as the juſt and ancient Right of this Province, All the Country which lies to the South of Weſt Line drawn from the Head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River; except ſo far as it interferes with the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with which a Settlement was made in 1683, by Commiſſaries of both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under mutual Acts of Legiſlature, and which was confirmed by King <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Dutch</hi> on their firſt Eſtabliſhment here, made a Treaty of Peace and Alliance with the Five Nations, called by the <hi>French</hi> the <hi>Iroquois.</hi> Theſe warlike Tribes were the Conquerors and Maſters of a great Part of <hi>North-America,</hi> holding all the Natives in Subjection, from the River <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> down to <hi>Georgia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Engliſh</hi> became poſſeſſed of <hi>New-York,</hi> they alſo made an Alliance with the Five Nations,

            <p>THE Country as far Northward as the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> and Weſtward without any known Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, was their undoubted Property<note n="*" place="bottom">That the Country as far North as the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> or Five Nations, is proved by all the ancient Maps and Hiſtories. In the Map inſcribed <hi>Nova Belgica,</hi> et <hi>Anglia Nova,</hi> publiſhed in xi Vol. Geographiae Blavianae, in 1662, <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> is called <hi>Lacus Irocoienſis,</hi> and the Country on the Eaſt Side of the Lake is called <hi>Irocoiſia.</hi>
                  <p>In <hi>Johannes Van Keulen</hi>'s Atlas, publiſhed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in 1720, the River <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> is called <hi>Rio des Iroquois ou de St. Lawrence,</hi> and the Country on the South of that River and Weſt of <hi>Lake Champlain, Iroquois,</hi> and the Lake itſelf <hi>Lac Champlain on mere de Iroquois.</hi>

THE Crown, by a Participation in numberleſs Acts of Government, has juſtified our Right and Juriſdiction over theſe Countries. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that no ſingle Commiſſion, Inſtruction, or Act, either of our own or from Home, 'till the late Proclamation, had the leaſt Tendency to alter or infringe ſuch Juriſdiction; but it ſolely reſted on the Baſis we have mentioned.</p>
            <p>THAT the Crown conſidered the Five Nations, and their Country, to be under it's Subjection, <note n="†" place="bottom">That the Five Nations became Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and put themſelves under it's Protection, appears from many of their Treaties.—Vide <hi>Colden's</hi> Hiſtory, Page 53, 54, 62, 80, 139.</note> and that the <hi>French</hi> could have no Claim to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is manifeſt from the fifteenth Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> 11th <hi>April,</hi> 1713.</note> confirmed by that of <hi>Aix-La-Chapelle;</hi> ſtipulating that the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Canada,</hi> and elſewhere, ſhall not diſturb or moleſt in any Manner whatever, the Five <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, <hi>which are ſubject to Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> nor its other American Allies.

            <p>So long ago as 1696, a Grant paſſed the Great Seal of this Province to <hi>Godfrey Dellius,</hi> for a Tract of Country extending from the North Bounds of <hi>Saraghtoga,</hi> (which lies on <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River thirty four Miles North of the City of <hi>Albany</hi>) to the Rock <hi>Roſian,</hi> a Station indiſputable, and which is well known to lie on <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> upwards of twenty Miles to the North of <hi>Crown-Point;</hi> and extending twelve Miles Eaſt from <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, and the ſame Diſtance Eaſt from the Wood-Creek, and the Waters to the Northward.

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013102_0192_0F8EBBA567676ED0"/>Day, that the Legiſlature conceived the Grant of it to be too great a Favour to one Subject, and paſſed a Law in the Year 1699, repealing it as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Laws of <hi>New-York,</hi> 1 Vol. Page 35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FORMERLY, and before the Year 1731, we had a Trading-Houſe at Crown-Point, where our Traders occaſionally reſided; for it was not 'till that Year that the Canadians, in profound Peace, invaded this frontier Part of the Province, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Fort <hi>St. Frederick</hi> at Crown-Point, which has been the Occaſion of an almoſt uninterrupted Series of Contention and Bloodſhed. As it ſecured them the abſolute Command of the Lakes, and facilitated their In-roads not only into this but the neighbouring Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſett's-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> nothing could be more alarming; and no ſooner was it communicated than our Houſe of Aſſembly, in order to obtain Relief, and the King's Directions, addreſſed the Commander in Chief to repreſent to his Majeſty or his Miniſters, theſe Encroachments, and the fatal Conſequences they muſt be attended with.<note n="*" place="bottom">Journal of the General Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> Vol. 1, Page 632.—Alſo Minutes of the Privy Council of <hi>New-York,</hi> in 1731.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A COMPLAINT was accordingly tranſmitted to Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> but it made ſo little Impreſſion on that Miniſter, that our Government was left without the leaſt Direction from their Superiors; and conceiving an attempt to oppoſe or diſlodge the <hi>French</hi> (which probably muſt have drawn upon
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:013102_0193_0F8EBBA58155DBA0"/>them the whole Power of Canada) to be too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous an Undertaking, without the Authority or Aſſiſtance of the Crown, this important Paſs was left in the Hands of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' we were at that Time unable to do ourſelves Juſtice, it was not only the Opinion of this, but of all the neighbouring Colonies, that the Erection of the Fort at Crown-Point was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Encroachment; and that the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt demanded that proper Meaſures ſhou'd be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to ſecure the Colonies againſt the Miſchiefs to which it expoſed them.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY in 1755, and before the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, this Colony, in Conjunction with the <hi>Maſſachuſett's-Bay</hi> and Connecticut, formed a Plan for erecting one or more Forts on his Majeſty's Lands at or nigh Crown-Point, and the Troops were raiſed accordingly,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Journal of the General Aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> 2 Vol. Page 440.</note> but War being ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, our Operations became more extenſive.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, on the Principle that it was unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably a Part of the Britiſh Dominions within this Colony, the Government both at home and here, have ever conſidered the Occupancy of Crown Point by the <hi>French,</hi> as a perſidious and dangerous Encroachment, which in Effect was one of the principal Cauſes of both of the laſt Wars. Theſe Remarks juſtify an Inference of the utmoſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the preſent Controverſy, <hi>to wit,</hi> That as it was an ancient Right of this Colony, coeval with
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:013102_0194_0F8EBBA80486DFE0"/>it's firſt Plantation by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, to extend even further Northward than the Latitude of 45 Degrees, to which it is now reſtricted, his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Proclamation, inſtead of enlarging our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, (as has been underſtood by ſome, who have not conſidered the Subject, and pretended by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe Intereſt it is to miſrepreſent) does in Fact conſiderably abridge it, operating as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our original Title up to the Line it eſtabliſhes; and as an Extinction of Juriſdiction beyond it (<hi>to wit</hi>) over the Lands between that Latitude and the Head of Connecticut River, or more properly the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> our old Boundary.</p>
            <p>IT is true that ſince the Year 1731, the <hi>French</hi> by maintaining Forts and ſtrong Garriſons at Crown-Point, Tieonderoga, &amp;c. have deprived us of the Enjoyment of the Country to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Albany;</hi> nor was it poſſible to extend our Plantations, perpetually expoſed to the Ravages of a moſt cruel Enemy, 'till on the Approach of Sir <hi>Jeffery Amherſt,</hi> with the Engliſh Army in 1759, the <hi>French</hi> abandoned both their Forts and their Settlements.—Theſe laſt were very few in Number, and all of them in the Neighbourhood of Crown Point and Tieonderoga; which having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>French</hi> as Places of Arms, to annoy and diſtreſs this Colony the more effectually, no Cultivation had taken place but for the meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of their Garriſons. Sir <hi>Jeffery Amherſt</hi> apprehenſive of the bad Conſequences of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Settlements on the Banks of Lake Champlain,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:013102_0195_0F8EBBAAE8B40370"/>prohibited them, nor have they to this Moment been re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THE Capitulation granted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Inhabitants of Canada, on the Conqueſt in 1760, ſtipulates, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> French, <hi>in the whole Extent of the colony of</hi> Canada, <hi>ſhall preſerve the entire Poſſeſſion and Property of their Goods, noble and ignoble, moveable and immoveable; and ſhall have Liberty to keep, let, and ſell them, as well to</hi> French <hi>as to the</hi> Engliſh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BY the firſt Article of the definitive Treaty of Peace between <hi>Great-Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in 1763, <q>

               </q> His Britannick Majeſty, on his Side, agrees, <q>

The Term limited for this Emigration ſhall be fixed to the Space of eighteen Months, to be computed from the Day of the Exchange of the Ratification of the preſent Treaty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING ſeems more obvious than that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given to the Canadians, both by the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and the Treaty, was confined to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Colony of Canada; nor any Thing more abſurd, than to ſuppoſe it ſhould extend to a Part of the Country which the <hi>French</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly uſurped, and which they had only within the Compaſs of a few Years granted to the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to further their Encroachments.</p>

THE Government of <hi>New-York</hi> therefore, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of his Majeſty's late Eſtabliſhment of our Boundary with <hi>Quebec,</hi> could not but conſider all the Country on both Sides of Lake Champlain, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably within it's juſt and ancient Limits and Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>THAT the Canadian Grants can never be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a meer Encroachment, nor derive Stability or Confirmation either from the Capitulation or the Treaty, was not only the Opinion here, but alſo of his Majeſty and his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>IN Purſuance of the Proclamation of the 7th Day of October, 1763, Sir <hi>Henry Moore,</hi> and Col. <hi>Carleton,</hi> the Governors of the two Provinces, in the Month of September 1767, fixed the Place of the Latitude of 45 Degrees, by actual Obſervation, near the North End of the Lake. On the 12th Day of Auguſt 1768, his Majeſty was pleaſed to declare his Approbation in Privy Council, and to direct in favour of his new Canadian Subjects, <q>
                  <hi>That nothing in the Order of that Date contained, ſhould affect the Property of ſuch as had Poſſeſſions under proper Titles in Lands on the South Side of the Line, the Dominion of which was not diſputed on the Part of the crown of</hi> Great-Britain; <hi>and that the ſaid Determination ſhould not operate wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of ſuch conceſſions on the South Side of the ſaid Line whereon they had made actual Settlements and Improvements, altho' the ſaid Line might have been diſputed by the crown of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>but proportioned to their Improvements at the Rate of

            <p>CONFORMABLE to theſe Sentiments, a Royal Mandamus, directed to the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:013102_0198_0F8EC51E2F816468"/>actually iſſued upon the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Council, on the 11th Day of <hi>January</hi> 1769, requiring him to lay out for, and grant to <hi>Charles De Fredenburgh,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THIS Tract is likewiſe laid down on the Map, and actually includes a great Part of two of the Seigniories which are the Object of this Diſpute.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Map No. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Title of this Province, in Right of the Crown, to all the Country to the Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> ('till his Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and ſince that Act, to the Southward of the 45th Degree of Latitude) being thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed, it cannot be wondered at that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Peace was reſtored, our Government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Grant and Settlement of the Lands to the Southward of this laſt Boundary, without the leaſt Scruple.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty having been pleaſed by his Royal Proclamation of the 7th Day of <hi>October</hi> 1763, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the reduced Officers and diſbanded Soldiers, who had ſerved him ſo gloriouſly in <hi>America,</hi> each a Quantity of Land for their more comfortable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:013102_0199_0F8EC51EF754EEA8"/>and as a Reward for their Service; and having left to them <hi>the Right of Election,</hi> out of any Part of the different Colonies which remained veſted in the Crown, they in general applied to this Government for Patents, locating their ſeveral Lots along the Eaſt and Weſt Sides of <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> on the <hi>Wood Creek,</hi> and at and to the Southward of <hi>Crown Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE were ſeveral Reaſons which induced them to fix, and the Government to grant, in this Part of the Country.</p>
            <p>IT had been the Scene of War, and they were well acquainted with it. They ſeemed to have a peculiar Right to be provided for, out of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Fruits of their Victories; and above all, the reſt of the Province which remained unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated, belonged to the Native Occupants, and could not be patented without a previous Purchaſe from them: A Condition with which moſt of the Officers, and all the Soldiers, were unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Under theſe Circumſtances they were chiefly gratified by Grants of the Lands firſt mentioned, and the Country adjoining to the Southward and Eaſtward, after being put to great Trouble and Expence in the Diſcovery and actual Survey of their reſpective Allotments. Many Grants have alſo been made to the Inhabitants of the Colony in the ſame Diſtrict, which, as far as they concern this Controverſy, are laid down in the annexed Map.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Map No. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Canadian Grants cover a great Part of the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013102_0200_0F8EC52003CCAFD0"/>Country along both Sides of <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> not only to <hi>Crown Point</hi> but ſeveral Miles to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They include the Whole, or chief Part of antient Grant to <hi>Dellius;</hi> which has ſince been parcelled out among the Military. They are numerous, large in Extent, but unattended (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in very few Inſtances) with the leaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>THEY all originated at, and ſince the Time of the <hi>French</hi> Encroachments at <hi>Crown-Point</hi> in 1731, and ſeveral of them are ſo late as the Years 1757, and 1758: A Period when we were actually at War with <hi>France,</hi> concerning theſe very Lands!</p>
            <p>THE Number and Extent of theſe Grants, and how deſtructive it muſt prove to the Rights of the King's Military Subjects, as well as to others, to give them the leaſt Countenance, will be ſeen by a View of the annexed Map and the Notes which accompany it.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Map No. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ON this Subject we are furniſhed with two Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one preſented to his Majeſty by ſeveral Perſons whoſe names do not appear in the Copy; the other to the Lords of Trade, by Monſieur <hi>De Lolbinier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Merits of theſe Petitions are founded, 1ſt. On an Aſſertion that the Lands in queſtion lie within the ancient Bounds of <hi>Canada</hi> as <hi>peaceably</hi> poſſeſſed for many Years by the <hi>French,</hi> and have only been <hi>added</hi> to the Colony of <hi>New-York</hi> by the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:013102_0201_0F8EC520A773CAE0"/>King's Proclamation. 2d. On the Article of the Capitulation and Treaty of Peace before taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of 3d. On the <hi>actual Improvements and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Petitioners or their Grantors. 4th. On their having, in many Caſes, paid the Governor of <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Quint or fifth Part of the original Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Money of their reſpective Seigniories, and done Faith and Homage, and having been put in full Seiſen in the King's Name. 5th. On the Hardſhip of their having been turned out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, by Titles granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> and being further threatened with the ſame Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>We have anticipated the three firſt of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions. 1ſt. <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> nor any of the Lands Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> were ever a Part of <hi>Canada,</hi> but rightfully belonged to the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as within his Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and as the Country of the Five Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his Subjects; nor were they ever in the <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Poſſeſſion of the <hi>French.</hi> They were invaded in Time of profound Peace, with an armed Power. they were held by the ſame unjuſtifiable Means. They were the Source of perpetual Contention and Bloodſhed between the Provinces of <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>New-York.</hi> They were a chief Occaſion of two bloody Wars between the Nations. Can this be called <hi>a Title or a peaceable Poſſeſſion?</hi> 2d. We have ſhown that neither the Articles of Capitulation, nor the Treaty, can ſerve the Purpoſe of the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. The Capitulation can only apply to what the <hi>French</hi> had a Right to, and not to what they had unjuſtifiably ſeized; and as to the Clauſe of
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:013102_0202_0F8EC521976F11B8"/>the Treaty, it only gives leave to the <hi>French</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſell their Eſtates in <hi>Canada,</hi> but does not confirm or concern <hi>diſputable,</hi> and much leſs <hi>tortious and fraudulent Grants,</hi> founded in Breach of Faith; nor can it create a Right which had no prior Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. Beſides, this is a Point which the Crown has already ſolemnly determined, and it is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there can be little danger of the Change of a Reſolution grounded on the cleareſt Dictates of Reaſon and Juſtice. 3d. As to the third Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, actual Poſſeſſions and Improvements by the Canadian Claimants and their Grantors, it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any ſuch (worthy of Conſideration) have ever been made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crown-Point</hi> was a Place of Arms, and ſo was <hi>Tieonderoga.</hi> Theſe important Paſſes the <hi>French</hi> forfeited to facilitate their Hoſtilities againſt <hi>New-York,</hi> and not for the Sake of Cultivation; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on the Conqueſt of the Country, few <hi>French</hi> Improvements were found, and thoſe within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Compaſs about the Forts, and for the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of their Garriſons. With theſe inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Exceptions, the Country was a deſolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs all along on both Sides of the Lake. 4th. As to the Payment of the Quint or fifth of the original Purchaſe Money of their reſpective Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories, and their having been put into full Seiſen in the King's Name; the Canadian Claimants have pointed out no Inſtances. We may however, venture to affirm that this Aſſertion, if it relates to the Lands on the South Part of <hi>Lake-Champlain,</hi> cannot be ſupported; nor, with reſpect to the reſt,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:013102_0203_0F8EC521E2C86B40"/>is it to be preſumed that a Governor or any Crown Officer of <hi>Quebec,</hi> would interfere with the Lands or Affairs of the Colony of <hi>New-York.</hi> If ſuch Acts have been performed, in any ſingle Inſtance, we ſuppoſe it concerned Lands near the North End of the Lake, and was only calculated to give ſome Colour and Countenance to a Claim ſo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Be it as it may, this Government (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could rightfully interpoſe) has had no Agency in any ſuch Acts, and they muſt therefore be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as of no Validity. 5th. The fifth Suggeſtion,—the Hardſhip of their having been turned out of Poſſeſſion by Titles granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> and being further threatened with the ſame Diſtreſs,—is alſo without Foundation. No <hi>French</hi> Claimant has been evicted, nor has a ſingle Suit of any kind been proſecuted againſt them. Indeed there could be no Room for it, for as we before obſerved, ſince they abandoned their Forts and Settlements, in 1759, there has been no Attempt to re-eſtabliſh them. Some tranſient People from that Colony, have been employed on the Lakes in the Lumber Trade, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Leave of the <hi>New-York</hi> Proprietors, or as mere Treſpaſſers) but we have no Proof of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Improvement or Poſſeſſion, <hi>ſince the War,</hi> under a Canadian Grant.</p>
            <p>BESIDES all theſe Objections, it is worth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Petitioners aſk what is improper in itſelf, and, as we humbly conceive, out of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Crown to Grant.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. THEY aim at enjoying their Seigniories ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their original Tenures, which depend on the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>France.</hi> It is difficult
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:013102_0204_0F8EC525F6C18078"/>to comprehend how theſe Tenures can prevail in this Colony, where ſuch Laws and Uſages are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and where all Eſtates are held under the Crown upon Quit-Rents, in free and Common Socage as the Manor of <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> is held in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Tenure aimed at by the Petitioners, was free from this Objection, it would be a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Rights of the Crown, which derives a very valuable Revenue from the Quit-Rent of 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Sterling, upon every Hundred Acres of Land granted in this Colony.</p>
            <p>BUT, 2dly. It is preſumed that no <hi>preſent</hi> Act, or Order of the Crown, can have any legal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Grants in Queſtion. They muſt ſtand or fall by the Rules of Law.</p>
            <p>IF the Limits of the <hi>French</hi> Colony of <hi>Canada,</hi> originally extended as far Southward as is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and if the Articles of the Capitulation and Treaty, operate as a Confirmation of the Canadian Grants, then theſe Claimants have a good Title at Law: This Queſtion, in a Courſe of Litigation, will come judically before the King in Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, on an Appeal from the Judgments of the Courts of our Province, if either Party ſhould be diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The Petitioners need not be apprehenſive of Partiality, becauſe as a Deciſion here (upon the Point of Title) is not final, no Injuſtice can be done but what the Crown will eventually redreſs. To take up and determine the Matter extra judically, and without hearing the <hi>New-York</hi> Grantees, would
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013102_0205_0F8EC526DB729898"/>not only be premature but inconcluſive, for we ſuppoſe <hi>a mere exparte Order of the Crown</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Title. The Royal Interpoſition wou'd be very conſiſtent if the Lands had remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patented; but here the Crown in every View hath parted with it's Right.—If the Canadian Principle is juſt, to them, by the Capitulation and Treaty;—If it is inſupportable, then to the <hi>New-York</hi> Grantees under the Great Seal of this Province.</p>
            <p>But admitting that the Order of the Crown would be deciſive,—that this is an extraordinary Caſe, which ought not to move or depend upon the nice Principles of Law,—and that the Rules of Equity and Policy ought alone to be conſulted. This Iſſue, we conceive, muſt be equally favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Military Grantees, under <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. WITH reſpect to the Merits of the different Claimants, the <hi>French</hi> Subjects received their Grants from their Prince, for their Services in an unjuſt Encroachment upon the Britiſh Crown; and in Violation of our original Rights, and of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> The Military, who hold under <hi>New-York,</hi> received their Titles by virtue of his Majeſty's Proclamation, and as a Recompence for their Valour, in defence of his juſt and ancient Dominions. To reward the Aggreſſors at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the King's faithful Subjects, ſeems incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with every Idea of Juſtice. But it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Honour of the Crown is engaged to ſupport the Millitary Grants under <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR, 2dly. It would beſpeak a Language very
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013102_0206_0F8EC528574CA150"/>different from the Proclamation, and prove, inſtead of a Reward, a ſevere Puniſhment to People who have deſerved ſo much, if his Majeſty, after a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Limits between the two Colonies,—after ſo fully ſignifying that it was his Royal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give no Confirmation to theſe Canadian Claims,—after all the Trouble and Expence they have been put to in obtaining their Surveys, and maintaining their Grants, and ſettling and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their Lands,—ſhould now by any Order, queſtion or impeach their Validity; and which muſt involve them in the utmoſt Perplexity and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To confirm Claims, derived under the Authority of <hi>France,</hi> to the Southward of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> would hold up to the World a ſtrange Picture of the Juſtice and Equity of the Britiſh Court. After engaging in two bloody Wars, and particularly the laſt in Reſentment of ſuch flagrant Encroachments, ſhould it now be admitted that <hi>Canada</hi> extended as it's Advocates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what would be the Inference? Muſt it not neceſſarily follow, that the Occupancy of the Lakes, <hi>Crown Point, Tieonderoga,</hi> &amp;c. was no Invaſion or Act of Hoſtility, but the Exertion of a rightful Sovereignty? And conſequently, that we were the Aggreſſors in thoſe Wars, and not the <hi>French;</hi> for nothing leſs could be implied in the Confirmations ſollicited.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> and <hi>Lake George,</hi> open a moſt important Communication, and may be juſtly called a Key to the Northern Britiſh Colonies
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:013102_0207_0F8EC528C3AEE2E8"/>However humbled in the Courſe of a War, which has crowned <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with unexampled Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it is natural to think the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> will long look with an affectionate Eye towards their former Prince. The Canadian Barons in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, loſe a flattering Weight and Diſtinction; while under the Dominion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they are ſunk into mere Commons. Their Language, their Laws, and their Manners, but above all, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, muſt for an Age to come, forbid a cordial Attachment to our Government. They may not be without Hopes that the Fortune of War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two powerful and rival Nations, may one Day give <hi>France</hi> ſuch an Aſcendency as to reduce us to the Neceſſity of reſtoring <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM this View, it muſt be very impolitic to ſuffer the <hi>French,</hi> altho' now our Fellow Subjects, to ſettle on thoſe Lakes, ſince it will give them the fulleſt Opportunity of aſſiſting their Countrymen in invading and diſtreſſing this and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colonies, and eſtabliſhing a Footing, on the firſt Rupture, in the Heart of our Country. On the other Hand, if the fertile Lands ſurrounding the Lakes, were peopled with the King's natural born Subjects, this Danger, which ought not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly to be deſpiſed, would be avoided; it's ill Conſequences be prevented, and the Canadians themſelves, even if they ſhould be inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, would be over awed into Subjection.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not all.—If ever <hi>Canada</hi> ſhould be the Subject of a Ceſſion to <hi>France,</hi> what were her ancient Bounds muſt become a neceſſary Queſtion? Her original Grants to the Canadians, ſupported
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013102_0208_0F8EC529953A8260"/>by the Confirmation of the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> wold be conſidered as irreſiſtible Evidence of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Right; and thus not only <hi>Lake Champlain</hi> but <hi>Lake George,</hi> which are both interſperſed with theſe Grants, would fall again into the Hands of <hi>France.</hi> The Poſſibility of an Altercation of this Nature, will be wholly removed by conſidering the Claims of the Canadians to the Lands on thoſe Lakes, as unworthy of Attention.</p>
            <p>UPON the Whole, viewing this Subject in every Light, upon the Principles of original Right,—Treaty and Ceſſion,—Law and Juſtice,—Equity and Policy, it is conceived that the Military and other Grants under the Seal of this Province, ought not to be impeached; and that the Canadian Claims, extravagant in themſelves, and deſtitute of all Foundation, ought to be rejected.</p>
