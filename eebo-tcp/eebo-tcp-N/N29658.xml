            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heaven conſiſteth partly in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preparation of the Soul and body for that bleſſed Society above. The Paradiſe of God would be a Priſon, may I not ſay a hell, to the impious and unholy.</p>

And if none die comfortably, or go in with Chriſt but thoſe who have lived per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, then every man muſt go out of the World with deſpair and terrour; for the failings of Gods People are more than their duties, their Corruptions more than their Graces: ſo that whoever goes to Heaven, muſt be beholding to the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood, and juſtifying righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus. This being premiſed, I ſhall proceed to the Explanation of the Doctrine, in which I ſhall obſerve this Order and Method.</p>

after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.

Eph 4.23, 24. Heb. 3.1. 2 Pet. 1.4. 2 Cor. 3.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their Titles do ſpeak their Fitneſs; They are called, <hi>the Children of the Bride-chamber, Children of the Kingdom, Children of the Reſurrestion, Chriſts fair One, the Kings Daughter, Gods Jewels, his peculiar Treaſure, his excellent Ones, ſuch of whom the World is not worthy.</hi>

               <p>What is the chaff to the Wheat, or pebbles to Pearls, or clods of Earth to the bright Stars, or the children of hell to theſe earthly Angels.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, their Priviledges alſo do evidence this Fitneſs, which are all Royal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Believers are of God, and born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of men, but from above, <hi>John</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Moreover they have a Royal Spirit. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> told <hi>Daniel. In him was the Spirit of the holy Gods. Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> (that entred into the holy Land) were men of another ſpirit, <hi>Numb</hi> 14 24. This Spirit that fits them for Heaven is a holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4 <hi>A Spirit of Grace, a Spirit of Glory.</hi> 1 Pet 4 14 So called, becauſe it comes from the God of Glory, and prepares them for Glory.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, they have Royal attendance, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels; theſe Watchers who are great in ſtrength, ſtand as Sentinels at their doors to protect their Perſons, day and night while they live: And they muſt Convey their Souls thorough the Devils Territories ſafe to the Place of their everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, after they are dead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34 8 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. If you are by Grace prepared for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. God is your God, and this is your Guard.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: they have a Royal Law, which is the Rule and Standard of their Obedience to God. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. The Writing was the Writing of God, who was both the Doctator and the Scribe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.16. where note, that the Scripture is the word of God, <hi>John</hi> 10 35.</p>

               <p>That we do not make our ſelves fit, or meet for Heaven, God muſt do it. <hi>Who can make his heart clean?</hi> we may waſh the out-ſide of the Cup, God muſt cleanſe that which is within, <hi>viz.</hi> the heart, from wickedneſs. <hi>I am the Lord that healeth thee.</hi>

               <p>This ſhall cauſe the godly to wonder at the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Divine Grace. If a King caſt his favour on a mean ſubject or ſlave, and prefer him to a great and honourable Office, yet he cannot change his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and give him fitneſs for that place: But God doth not only give a Kingdom to his Saints, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adapt, and fit them for that Kingdom. And as none had right to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> but the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> ſo none have right to Heaven but the Saints; (but of this more afterwards.)</p>

               <p>SEcondly, <hi>This Readineſs is in the day and time of Life, not after death.

'Tis true, the eternal God is not limited to any term or means, but man is limited to time and means. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thou haſt a great work to do, a long journey to go, and many and mighty adverſaries to divert and hinder thee; thy Work is to prepare for Death and Judgment, which is very near; thy Voyage or Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to the everlaſting World, Proviſion muſt be

made while in the way. To apply this a little, and to quicken you to husband the precious Talent of Time in order to Eternity. I ſhall propoſe three things; Firſt, conſider how ſhort and uncertain our being in the World is. Secondly, as life is ſhort, ſo the continuance of the means of grace will not be long Thirdly, when gray hairs, old age, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (<hi>Solomons</hi> evil day) comes, that is not ſo fit and proper a ſeaſon to prepare for Heaven: Firſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how ſhort and uncertain thy being in the World is; <hi>Our life is but a vapour,</hi> Jam. 4 14. that ſoon appeareth and diſappeareth, diſperſed as ſoon as raiſed. 'Tis a little ſpot of time between two Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. One of the Ancients doubteth, whether to call it a dying life, or a living death: And if our life (which is a breathing death) had been leſs then a vapour, it had been nothing at all. The Pſalmiſt deſcribes Man as <hi>Graſs,</hi> Pſal. 90 <hi>In the Morning it flouriſheth, in the Evening it is cut down, and withereth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man continueth but a very ſhort time, his life is but a ſpan long, or but a day long, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, came up in a night, and periſhed in a night. The firſt ſtep man ſets upon the ſtage of this World, he is going out of the World. The Naturaliſts ſpeak of a Fly they call <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> a creature of one day, which cometh forth in the Morning, is very active about Noon, but when the Sun declineth, it declineth too, and ſets with the ſetting of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Man is an <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> a creature of one day. The Ancient of days ſets up our Glaſs in Heaven, there at is running, and we ſee not how it haſtens to an end. Think, O devout ſoul, of the ſugarity and ſwiftneſs of thy time here below, the Line and Leaſe of Life will quickly be out: It is but a point of time that we live, while we do but turn, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is preſent. This preſent Life is but the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039482_0011_1014257EB71643B0"/>
place of our Inn and Sepulchre; The Beginning of this Life is but the <hi>Exordium</hi> of Death, <hi>Vita hujus Principtum statim Mortis eſt Exordium</hi> We are carried every moment of time to the <hi>End of Time.</hi> Our Life is but but like one ſailing; he who doth ſail, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtand or ſit, whether he ſleep, watch or walk, he is carried nearer the Port; may we not ſay with old <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen 47.4 <hi>Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been</hi>: where we have his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count caſt up; God is the great Landlord of our time, the Leaſe is for life, not years but days, not many days but few. <hi>Life</hi> (ſaid one) <hi>is a Roſe which if we view in its growth the Cold nips it, the Heat wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it, the Wind ſhakes it, be it never ſo fair it withers:</hi> Another ſaith, <hi>Life is a counterfeit, what if the Colours be fair, and the Reſemblance near, the Shadows of Death, and the Curtains of the Grave will darken all</hi>; 'Tis a Play, We enter at our Birth, and Act all our Life, preſently there is an <hi>Exit,</hi> or end, and away we go. One being asked what was Life, he ſhews himſelf a little, and hides himſelf again, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was this. Our Life is but a little ſhew, no ſooner are we ſeen, but immediately we are hid and gone. O ſleepy and ſecure ſinner, think of the certainty of Death, the danger of thy Soul, the nearneſs and length of Eternity, and the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of preparing in a moment of time for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting eſtate. Die and leave the World we muſt, in the Grave there is no work, after Death the Judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 27.

               <p>Secondly, as Life is ſhort, ſo the continuance
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039482_0012_101425824CA56570"/>
of the means of Grace will not be long. There are many faithful, able, painful Miniſters have Preached their laſt; and an abundance, yea, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Sinners, time-loſers, that have heard their laſt; and this will be my caſe and yours in a little time. The Prophets, do they live for ever?</p>
               <p>We have but a little time to intreat and to treat with you about your Souls, to call, invite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to come to Chriſt, and accept of mercy: and which Miniſter or Sermon ſhall be the laſt thou ſhalt hear, who can tell? <hi>There are ſix days,</hi> ſaid the Maſter of the Synagogue, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>in which men ought to work, in them therefore come and be healed. We muſt ſeek the Lord while he may be found,</hi> Iſa. 55 6 <hi>For behold now is the appointed time, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. Moreover, as the Miniſtry and outward means is uncertain, ſo the time of the Spirits working with the Word is uncertain, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man:</hi> The Spirit is compared to the Wind, who can tell when the Wind will blow, and how long it will continue its ſweet gales to convey us to glory. The Door of grace is yet open to loſt and undone ſinners, who have ſlighted mercy. God did not deal ſo with the Angels that fell, they ſinned, and the Lord caſt them down, and ſhut the Gate of Glory upon them immediately. But the day for the things of thy peace is continued. Its ſaid, the Devil is buſie becauſe his time is ſhort, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. And ſhall we be worſe than the Devil: The time is ſhort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.27. <hi>The Angel will ere long ſwear by him that liveth that time ſhall be no more.</hi> You that are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards Heaven muſt make haſte, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſets a time for his task, liſtens to the Clock, and counts the hours. We have a great task and a ſhort time, redeem it in order to Eternity. This is Gods hour, and this is mine; what I do for my dear ſoul, what I lay up for Eternity muſt be now

done or never. O remember, its but an hour, but a day, and this will quickly paſs away: In what anguiſh of ſoul, deſpair and torment, will many wiſh for thoſe hours again: the loſs of ſo many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for the gaining of Heaven, will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sinner, if Death ſhould come, and find thee unready, thou art undone ſoul and body for ever.</p>
               <p>The time of gray Hairs, old Age, Sickneſs, is not the fitteſt ſeaſon to prepare for Heaven. When thou comeſt to a Bed of Languiſhing, and thy ſtrength waſted, thy breath ſhort, doſt thou think to Cough-up. <hi>Lord have mercy upon my ſoul,</hi> and that will be ſufficient to prepare thee for Chriſt, and bring thee to Heaven.

In the Word we have only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Thief upon the Croſs; but remember his Converſion was one of the Wonders of Chriſts Paſſion; when Chriſt was on the Croſs, the Sun was darkned from the ſixth hour to the ninth hour, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, the Earth did quake, the Rocks rent, the Graves opened, the Bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinner was converted, all which is wonderful. <hi>Auſtin</hi> being ſent to give his judgment of one that had delayed, and put off his repentance, returned this Anſwer, <hi>Non dico damnabitur, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THirdly, <hi>Let us now enquire what this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to go in with Chriſt is.</hi> And I wiſh that all who read this Diſcourſe may underſtand it, not only notionally, and ſpeculatively, but alſo heartily and experimentally.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this third Particular, here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Negatively, and ſomething Poſitively, and both in reference to believers and unbelievers.</p>
               <p>Negatively, Preparation for Chriſt and Heaven, doth not lie or conſiſt in any thing that is natural, or acquired by mans utmoſt induſtry. Let the Qualifications, Endowments, Improvements and Attainments of men be never ſo rare &amp; excellent, while without ſupernatural regenerating Grace, they cannot be fit and prepared for immediate &amp; eternal fellowſhip with God. To explicate this, take theſe four Particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Readineſs for Chriſt and Heaven doth not conſiſt in being Virgins, <hi>i. e.</hi> Church Members,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039482_0015_10142587B5B7B580"/>
and in having the ſpecious leaves of Profeſſion. There are more than a few who pretend to and profeſs the true Religion, that are carnal, rotten &amp; falſe in that Religion: All in the viſible Church, that are ſealed with the Sign and Sacrament of Initiation, are not fit for Divine Communion. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> was Circumciſed, yet not fit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtle &amp; Preacher, but the Son of Perdition: <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and in the gall of Bitterneſs.</p>
               <p>Many think, 'tis ſufficient to ſave them, that they were born in <hi>England,</hi> and deſcended of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or Proteſtant Parents, that they keep their Church, ſay their Prayers, receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and procure their abſolution when dying; The unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> gloried in their External Rites and Priviledges, crying out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord!</hi> And becauſe they had their Prieſts and Sacrifices and could go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, they were (as they thought) the happieſt people in the whole world. How many Atheiſts and Haters of God and Holineſs, have been Baptized?

               <p>Thirdly, Neither doth this readineſs for Chriſt lie in being of ſuch a party, and opinion, or in being hot and zealous for ſuch modes and forms of Religion and Worſhip. A man may be Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, a Presbyterian, an Independent, an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and a ſtranger to the Life and Power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

               <p>Fourthly, Neither doth it lie in mental Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and excellent rare Parts, Gifts, Common Grace, and good Opinion, and Approbation of the beſt, moſt ſerious and judicious men. A mans Mind and Intellectuals may be Adorned with rare Notions; he may be able to diſpute moſt readily, accurately and profoundly about Theological

Principles; he may Pray and Preach like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and be in high eſteem in the Church; and yet have nothing in him to Intitle him to Chriſt, and prepare him for heaven. There is ſhining Droſs and counterfeit Silver, which deceiveth many, as a <hi>Briſtol-ſtone</hi> may ſhew and ſhine like a Diamond, and a Counter like a piece of Gold; the Picture of a man may be like a man, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Flowers are as fair, and look like Natural Flowers; ſo Common Grace hath the reſemblance of Saving Grace; ſo that ſome queſtion whether it differs in Specie or Degrees only.

ſmall, and make Hypocriſy ſeem a good Web, &amp; go through the Market as Saints among men; and yet ſteal quietly to Hell without Obſervation: <hi>So eaſie it is to deceive men,</hi> (ſaid an Eminent Divine) <hi>'Tis doleful to think, and ſee ſuch Troops and Droves of prophane, ignorant, preſumptuons men and women, go down merrily to Hell, with a Golden dream and hope of Heaven</hi>; Like the Fiſh that ſport and play in <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and then fall into the Dead Sea; like <hi>Haman</hi> that went chearfully to <hi>Hesters</hi> Banquet, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life was the mark that ſhe aim'd at: How many ſecure Souls aſleep in ſin go out of the World; and never Awake till they come to Hell?</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken ſomething in the Negative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this fitneſs and readineſs for Chriſt. I proceed now to the Poſitive part of my Anſwer, wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an initial, or an habitual readineſs for Heaven, and there is alſo a more actual fitneſs to go in with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as a man is taken out of his Natural Soil, and the Seed of God is ſown in his heart, he is habitually ready for his future Happineſs. If a Believer ſhould Die the firſt Day of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he would certainly go to Heaven, witneſs the Thief upon the Croſs. But truly there are many dear Children of God not actually prepared, becauſe their Spiritual Eſtate is not ſo well ſettled. 'Tis a great Duty for all that are eſpouſed to Chriſt, to be in a conſtant and continual readineſs to meet Chriſt, and have immediate Communion with him: but ſad experience proves it is not ſo. A Woman may be Eſpouſed to another, and yet ſhe may be ſometimes not ready to meet him

her Ornaments may be off, and her ſoul Apparel on. To Reſolve this I ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the Chriſtian is not Ready.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he is actually Ready.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the Believers Soul, like <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Sun, is gone ſome degrees backward, <hi>i. e.</hi> under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable declinings; And the beſt things in him are ready to die, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, Inward Joy, Peace, Old Experiences, Godly Sorrow are ready to die. If the firſt warm, burning, flaming Love of the Eſpouſals be leſſened, and much abated towards Chriſt, ſo that the mans heart doth vigorouſly go forth after ſenſual Objects, and the Dead Child is put in the place of the Living Child; is he fit to go in with Chriſt? If Grace be under remarkable decays and witherings, and the Souls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, can a man then welcome Chriſt? What cauſe have thouſands to Cry out with the Prophet, <hi>My Leanneſs! My Leanneſs!</hi> Is it not Autumn or Winter in many a Soul? How little life and love have you, and much ado to maintain it. I heard a good Woman, in a deſpairing condition, complain of want of Natural Affection to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Children. And may we not with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bradford,</hi> weep for want of love to our deareſt Lord and embracing the boſom of a Stranger. If the Wives affection be withdrawn from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Perſon is ſhe fit now to appear before him, when ſhe hath no heart to receive him? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die, blow up the ſpark of love into a flame, and thou mayſt ſay, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When the poor Chriſtian, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Deſertion, is doubtful of his Eternal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cannot tell what will be his place when he leaves the world, he is unfit. When thick
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039482_0020_101806AE5DCECC60"/>
Miſts ſurround us, and black Clouds cover us, the many ſinking fears, jealouſies and damping doubts about the love of Chriſt renders us Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. This is the caſe of many a Soul who hath made choice of God to be his, and wonders at his love to him, yet is ready to ſpeak as the Church, <hi>Zion ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, my God hath forgotten me,</hi> Iſa. 49.14. <hi>My Soul is cast down,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, within me, all his billows paſs over me; hath God forgotten to be Gracious?</hi> I doubt my heart is not upright, that my foundation is not ſound, that I ſhall be ſhut out of Heaven, ſaith the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding Soul. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> tho' he walked before God with a perfect heart, yet bitterly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was cut off. A very Holy and Learned Miniſter complains thus, <hi>I have often diſputed, whether or no I knew any thing of Chriſtianity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Letter of the Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Woman in Mr, <hi>Bolton</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have been the Mother of Nine Children, and have born them with as much Pain as moſt Women, yet I could be contented to bear the ſame Pain every Day, that I have endured with all my Children, to be aſſured of my Part in Chriſt.</hi> Another Cried out, <hi>He could be contented that his Body ſhould burn in Hell a Thouſand Years, ſo that he might be aſſured of the least Favour from God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And will you not pity me,</hi> ſaith Mrs. <hi>Drake, that muſt burn in Hell for ever?</hi> Sirs, in a time of Deſertion, when God hides his Face, and Heaven is out of ſight, the Child of Light walks in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Soul is not ready. The thoughts of God are terrible. <hi>I remembred God, and was troubled,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I ſink, the deep waters are come into my Soul. The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poiſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit: the Terrors of God do
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039482_0021_101416B85C2AD0C0"/>
ſet themſelves in array against me,</hi> Job 6.4 <hi>O pity me my Friends,</hi> Job 19. Another walking in the Field (ſeeing a Fly) Cried out, <hi>This Fly comes Armed with the Wrath of God against me.</hi> Now when the trembling Soul apprehends it ſelf to hang like an equal ballance between two Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and cannot tell whether he ſhall go up or down, live or die, be ſaved or damned; he is not fit to ſhoot the Gulf: This made <hi>David</hi> Pray, Pſal. 39 ult. <hi>Spare me a little before I go hence and be no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Note, That there is a double Deſperation, <hi>A Deſperation of Infidelity,</hi> and, <hi>A Deſperation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity</hi>; The former, <hi>viz.</hi> A total and perpetual Deſperation, none of Gods Elect ones ſhall fall under: but the latter, the Deſperation of Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which doth cure their ſtupidity, and provoke and prompt them to the uſe of the means) they are obnoxious to: They are ſometimes brought very low in their Souls. <hi>Luther,</hi> by reaſon of the trouble of his mind, wiſh'd he had never been a man. The Chriſtian ſits ſolitary as a Widow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, his ſighs are many, and his heart is faint, when God covers Himſelf with a Cloud. This made a Godly Woman dying (whoſe Evidences for Heaven could not be read) Pray, <hi>Lord, Let me not go to the Place where the Wicked are, for I never loved them in my Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, After ſome ſad Fall, and when a man is under ſome violent Temptation, on Paſſion, he is Unready. A Good Man may be under the power of ſome ſudden, hot and ſinful Paſſion, and aſſaulted with an helliſh Temptation, he may be tempted to Curſe and Blaſpheme God, to Deſtroy himſelf; he may be bereaved of his Reaſon and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is the Law of the Soul, and <hi>brevis inſania,</hi> a ſhort Madneſs. <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in their Paſſion, did both Curſe the Day of their Birth; <hi>Jonas</hi> told God, <hi>He did well to be angry.</hi> Moreover, after a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath fallen into ſome groſs foul ſin God may frown and write bitter things againſt him, fill his Conſcience with terror, hang him over Hell, and threaten to remove him out of his ſight: till he hath renewed his Repentance. A foul Fall doth ſo grieve the Spirit, that it may make God carry himſelf towards his as if he were an Enemy. God doth deal with his for their great Tranſgreſſions, as <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who commanded him out of his ſight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24 In this ſad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Caſe, Evidences for Heaven are blurred, and all old Experiences of the Love and Favour of God are under Ground. <hi>David</hi> after his fall was as a Dead man, and Prayed, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence,</hi> Pſal. 51.11.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When a man hath Omitted known and commanded Duties, let down his Watch, and neglected his Lords Work: and falls a nodding, or into a Lethargy, (as theſe Virgins did) till rouſed up with the Cry of Midnight, he is not prepared to go in with Chriſt. If a Mans Conſcience draweth up a black Bill of Indictment againſt him, for the neglect of the moſt weighty and important Duties, he is no more fit to meet Chriſt, than <hi>Adam</hi> after he had eaten the Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, or a Steward who had much betruſted him to improve for his Lords uſe, and let all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons go wherein he might have Traded &amp; G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in'd ſomewhat for him. How can he appear before him when no fair account may be ſeen; ſo the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039482_0023_1014259B900D1D98"/>
Lord hath intruſted thee with many Talents, Grace, Parts, Time, Strength, Health, Means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And you are not Lords but Stewards of all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How can you with comfort and confidence ſtand before Chriſt, if that be neglected? O thus it is with many a Chriſtian, who hath loſt that vigour, zeal, activity and forwardneſs for the Work of God that once he had. Hence come thoſe ſad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, ſtings &amp; convictions of Conſcience, ſhakings and ſinkings of ſpirit under the ſenſe of guilt.</p>
               <p>And is not this the caſe of many Virgins? ſo that if Chriſt ſhould arreſt, and ſummon them by death, and call them to <hi>reddere rationem,</hi> give an Account, how many muſt Anſwer, <hi>Not ready Lord, my work is not done.</hi> O then betimes do your work, and ſet things right in your ſouls every day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When is a Chriſtian actually ready?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Chriſtian is actually ready when he hath thoſe rare and gracious qualifications of the wiſe Virgins, (<hi>viz.</hi>) his Veſſel clean, and the Oyl in his Lamp and Veſſel, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt &amp; the graces of the Spirit: which are called Rows of Jewels, Chains of Gold, and Rivers of Living Water. This is the Anointing, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.27. That Oyl upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Head which ran down to the Skirts of his Garment: Chriſt the Head of Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (of whom <hi>Aaron</hi> was a Type) was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above his Fellows, and of his fulneſs Saintſ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But more particularly,</p>
               <p>Firſt, When a Chriſtian (being paſt from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to grace) can prove by the Word that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth, that he is in a ſtate of Salvation, and hath therefore good hope, through grace, that his ſoul is ſafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:039482_0024_1014259E5A9972C0"/>When <hi>Noah</hi> was ſhut up in the <hi>Ark</hi> he was out of danger, and prepared for the deluge, and could not be drowned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When a Believer is gotten into Chriſt, he hath ſhot the Gulf, and cannot be damned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. If thine affection be eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus, and divorced from all others, ſo that thou haſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted him for thine Husband, and given him thine heart, thou canſt not fall ſhort of heaven, or miſs of going in with Chriſt.

What is brave Silken habit upon the body, Earings, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, upon the Neck, Plaited-Hair, Curls, Towers, Spots, and Paints on the face and forehead, to a Sanctified holy heart? The Church is glorious within, there is that in the Chriſtian (<hi>viz.</hi> the new Creature) that can call God Father; Holineſs is the Arms of heaven, the Harbinger of heaven; we may ſee the harveſt of glory in the ſeed of grace. Grace is glory in its nonage, and glory is grace grown up to its perfect ſtature: The time cannot be long between a Chriſtians Converſion and his Coronation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a believer is gotten into the ſuburbs of Glory by Communion with God, and his heart is ſincerely ſet to pleaſe and honor him; when it is thus, he may ſay with <hi>Jacob, this is no other but the houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 'Tis real Acquaintance and Communion with Chriſt, and conformity to Chriſt, muſt make us ready.

Now to adorn and beautifie ſouls ſtained and fullied within (in whom there is the filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement) is the higheſt evidence of the Power and Vertue of the glorious Grace of God When a Mans heart is moulded and faſhioned for God the Divine Spirit (like the Sword of the Lord and <hi>Gideon</hi>) doth great things, <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing is God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) 2 Cor. 5.5 <hi>Thine Hands have made me and faſhioned me,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully &amp; wonderfully made, marvellous are thy Works, I am curiouſly wrought.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> wondred at the Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of God in his well-formed comely body, conſiſting of ſuch various parts and members, how ſhould we ſtand and wonder at the transforming and renewing mans ſoul after the Image of God. The Law was written on the two Tables with the Finger of God, and this upon the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den man of the heart, is alſo the Lords Work, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our eyes. The Work in the Tabernacle and Temple was rare and curious, but yet not to compare with this of the Holy Ghoſt; It ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what hath God wrought. <hi>We are his workmanſhip, Eph.</hi> 2.10. In the great Houſe of God the Church, all are not Veſſels of Gold, and prepared for glory. But we may know what Veſſels are for ſpecial uſe, by their metal and curious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving on them. Sinner, if thine eyes were open, thou mighteſt ſee Heaven, God and Glory engraves upon every ſuch veſſel of mercy. Moreover, this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:039482_0038_101425C909E76680"/>
ſupernatural grace in the heart is not a dead habit, but a living ſpring, which prompts men to duty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 10.</p>
               <p>SEcondly, Faithful Miniſters (who are Workers together with God, and watch for mens ſouls) muſt vehemently urge the neceſſity of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Holineſs, without which none are ready, or can poſſibly be ſaved; There is a ſpiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy ſeiz'd upon the Chriſtian World: <hi>they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> How ſtirring in our Miniſtry muſt we be to awaken men out of this ſtupor and ſecurity, and to fit them for Heaven. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath its ſting, and its honey; there is Mount <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> the Rod as well as the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>; the Arrow of Repentance muſt be levelled at the heart, and we ſhould deliver the whole Councel of God. <hi>The Word that I ſhall ſpeak, that thou ſhalt ſpeak,</hi> ſaid the Angel to <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 22.35. Chriſts Embaſſadors have their Authority and Commiſſion from God &amp; his Word, &amp; therefore they muſt be plain, particular and piercing in their Preaching, otherwiſe the blood of never-dying ſouls will lie at their door: The Word of God like a well-drawn Picture, looks right upon every one: and what we find in Sacred Writ we muſt preach, pleaſe or diſpleaſe. Is not this written in the New Teſtament, <hi>that he that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> John 3. laſt. Men muſt be turned from darkneſs to light, from the Power of Satan to God (which is the chief end of Preaching) before they can receive the Inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. You muſt turn or die, repent or periſh, be in tears or flames, be holy or never ſee Gods Face in Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.5 <hi>Heb</hi> 12.14. Happy are they that live

under a Miniſtry who have will and skill to prepare ſouls for Heaven. Particular Preaching is penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and profitable, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preaching</hi> (ſaid a worthy Divine) <hi>is deceitful and deluding Preaching. He that Preacheth to every one preacheth to no one,</hi> (ſaith a learned Doctor.) <hi>'Tis like a loaf of bread ſet before a Company of little Children,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Hilderſham. Univerſaliae non operantur</hi> King <hi>James</hi> ſaid of a Reverend Prelate of this Land, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this man Preacheth of death, as if death were at my back. John the Baptiſt,</hi> who went before Chriſt in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Elias</hi> to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, was called a <hi>Crier:</hi> and how ſevere and ſtrict was he in his Doctrine and Life?</p>
               <p>Sinners aſleep upon the Mouth of Hell muſt be awakened, as it were with the voice of thunder. If a Traveller paſſing through a Town in the dead of the night, ſaw a houſe burning; Would he whiſper out <hi>Fire, Fire</hi>? no but cry <hi>Fire, Fire, Fire,</hi> with a loud voice. 'Tis the Cry at Midnight that muſt awake the ſlumbring Virgins, and nothing elſe; <hi>Jonah</hi> muſt cry in the ſtreets of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> muſt cry in the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But what muſt we ſay or cry to the ſecure World? Mercy, Pardon, Peace, Salvation, Heaven? No, Fire, Fire, Hell, Hell, Damnation, eternal Wrath and Vengeance, without ſpeedy and Hearty repentance to God: this is the Plough and Harrow of the Law, that muſt go deep and break the fallow ground, and turn up the Turf upon the Sinners impenient obdurate heart. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and Jeſus began their Miniſtry with the doctrine of repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8.4.17. Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſincerity, zeal, perſpicuity and impartiality in the diſtribution of the Word, is ordinarily bleſt of God, to make ready a people prepared for him. So did the holy Man preach who was called the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-driver. Our errand and buſineſs is the ſame
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039482_0040_101425CEA480A290"/>
with <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> to perſwade and woo for Chriſt, and when we have gained Mens conſent, and eſpouſed them to Chriſt, our work is half done. Miniſters are Gods Builders, Men muſt be fitted for the Building: The Stones in the Temple were not rude and unpoliſh'd Stones, but hewed, ſquar'd and made ready, ſo alſo were the Utenſils of the Tabernacle, the Gold, Silver, Braſs, and carved Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. There are no dead and durty ſtones fit for Gods great Houſe above, <hi>They that were ready went in with him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinner, is thy ſtate hopeful, who cannot, will not live a life of holineſs; It may be thou haſt the face, profeſſion, and form of Godlineſs, ſo had the fooliſh Virgins, ſo had the Paſtor and Members of the Church in <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3, 1. There are alſo many that have not ſo much as the bark or form of Religion, and hate the life and power of it. Canſt thou mock, and ſcoff at a vertuous pious life, and think thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to part with thy luſts, and give thy heart to God, and yet hope well? If Chriſt doth not reign in thine heart, and make it holy, thou canſt have no hope here, nor Heaven hereafter; <hi>Command</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that every Leper be put out of the Camp,</hi> Numb. 5.2.

               <p>THirdly, If none ſhall go in with Chriſt but thoſe which are ready, but a few then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively of this great World ſhall be Saved, and enter into Glory. God hath ſaid it, whoſe Word muſt ſtand. 'Tis but one of a City, and two of a Family, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 14 There is but a handful ready for Heaven, but Millions of men unready. How

few of the ſix hundred thouſand that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> entred into the Promiſed Land? Look into the broad way to death, and hell, and ſee what Troops and Droves of men and women are there, and how few there be in the narrow way: No wonder you hear the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Tho'</hi> Iſrael <hi>be as the Sand of the Sea, but a Remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And who can read, and hear this, and not be aſtoniſhed? Are there not Multitudes, Thouſands, and Ten Thouſands that have the Image of Hell on them, and ready to drop into Eternal Flames, and will you not believe it? Separate the Wheat from, the Tares, the Swine from the Sheep, the Precious from the Vile, <hi>viz.</hi> all Prophane perſons, all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and it will appear. What thoughts of heart, fear &amp; trembling, ſhould this cauſe in every place and among all people? When Chriſt told his Friends, the Elect, Tender-hearted Diſciples, there was but one bad among them, they were all afraid. What cares, fears, jealouſies ſhould we have about our Souls? All that concerns the ſoul is weighty, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. The evil of the ſoul is an Eternal evil, and the good of the ſoul is an Eternal good: Where then is your caution, and ſolicitude about this ſoul affair? If the Soul miſcarry and is loſt, all goes with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26 <hi>What will it profit a man, to gain the whole World, and to loſe his own Soul?</hi> Chriſtian, doſt thou not ſee many ſet out in the Race, that fall ſhort, and loſe the Crown? and ſhall we not ſerve the Lord with fear? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 1.

Converted. <hi>The Children of the Kingdom ſhall he cast out,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) Oh, how ſad is this! <hi>Mat.</hi> 8 12 Be not deceived, the heart is a great deep, very deceitful, a moſt accurate Impoſtor. Grace is a Myſtery, the Old Serpent is ſubtil and very buſie, and Pirate-like, ſets forth his falſe Colours, and transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take thine heart with thee in Private, and ſearch and try thy ſtate, and compare thy Heart and Life by the Word, that thou mayſt find whether thou art ready, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4</p>
               <p>FOurthly, If thoſe that are ready ſhall go in with Chriſt, then Gods dear Saints ſhould not fear Death, but rather deſire it. Thoſe that are fit to die, need not fear to die. Death is yours, (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to Believers) which tho' it diſſolve the Union between the Soul and Body, it cannot part God and his People. 'Tis more facil and eaſie to dry up the vaſt Ocean, or to ſeparate Light and Heat from the Sun, than to ſeparate Chriſt from his Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. God ſaith, <hi>They are his, my Portion my Jewels, not one of which ſhall be loſt.</hi> All Gods holy Ones ſhall come ſafe to their Fathers Houſe. Their Names are written in Heaven, their Head &amp; Husband is in Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 14 2. And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That Saints ſit there,</hi> Eph. 2.6. <hi>The Righteous,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Peter, are ſcarcely Saved,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.18. But truly ſaved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they that are but almoſt ſaved, are never ſaved. A thing done with difficulty is done; it was with difficulty and danger the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> got into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with danger <hi>Paul</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039482_0043_101425D615E18448"/>
got ſafe to ſhore, and tho' they were in great Peril, not one periſhed. A Babe in Chriſt is built upon a Rock, and a Child in the Ark had been as ſafe as a Giant. Heaven and Happineſs is not in our hands, but in the hands of One mighty to ſave. None can pluck them out of my Fathers hands, underneath are everlaſting Arms. Who can be too hard for Omnipotency, or fetch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever out of Gods Hand? The Covenant of Grace is an Everlaſting Covenant, and ſhall ſtand faſt. Death and the Grave could not diſſolve the Hypoſtatical Union of Chriſt, He took his humane Body never to be ſeparated from it; ſo alſo his Myſtical Body. 'Tis true, Death and Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day muſt be very terrible to Veſſels of Wrath, fitted to Deſtruction, God, Chriſt, Scripture, and Conſcience are againſt them, and all their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is here, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14 The Malefactor muſt needs fear the coming &amp; face of the Judge: <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>reaſon'd of Judgment,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled,</hi> and cauſe enough, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.26 But <hi>lift up your Heads and Rejoice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Haſte, my Beloved, Haſte.</hi> Amen. <hi>So come Lord Jeſus.</hi> When the Bride is attired, and her beautiful Ornaments about her, ſhe expecteth the coming of the Bridegroom; and when he comes his Reward is with him: The Martyr could ſay, <hi>'Tis well for the preſent</hi> (who had the Firſt fruits of Glory) <hi>and it would be better.</hi> Your ſorrow (ſaid Chriſt) to his diſconſolate Diſciples, ſhall be turned into joy, <hi>I will not leave you, I will ſee you again.</hi> Say then, Welcome Death, who muſt carry me home: The beloved Wife doth not fear, when abroad, to come to her Husband, nor the dutiful Child to his indulgent Father: Chriſt called his Death, <hi>A going to his

Father</hi>: Who died to bring many Sons to Glory. A Godly Gentlewoman had made Death ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her (by converſing with it, and preparing for it) that ſhe did look upon it as her Fathers Servant ſent to fetch her home, from School, Death doth the Saints more good than all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or Afflictions, it brings into fellowſhip with Chriſt quickly, immediately, eternally; the certainty of all Believers coming to Heaven, was Typified in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſing over the Red-Sea, not one was Drowned, neither was one <hi>Egyptian</hi> Saved. To note, that all wicked men will be Damned. The men of the world have a ſhort Heaven, and all in hand; but the Chriſtians beſt is yet behind. In this ſtrange Land, Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not known, being as Princes out of their own Countrey; <hi>But when Christ who is our life ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, and ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3.2.</p>
               <p>FIfthly, It greatly concerns all while they have time and means, to make ready for Eternity, Two things argues an excellent ſpirit and great wiſdom.</p>

Is it nothing, Sinner, to ſlight an offered Saviour, will it not be bitterneſs in the latter end? <hi>This is the Condemnation, for how ſhall we eſcape if we neglest ſo great Salvation?</hi> Heb. 2.3 Now, or never; the Holy God ſaith, <hi>To Day,</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He is at the Door,</hi> Rev. 3.20 Will you open to him, or keep the door of your Hearts ſhut? What, ſhut out, and put off a Chriſt, a Chriſt, who is worth infinite Worlds? God; forbid. Say in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Be ye lifted up ye everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in,</hi> Pſal. 24, 7, 9 Sinner, remember this, if thou doſt Bar and Bolt thy Door againſt Chriſt now, there will be two other Doors ſhut in a little time.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Door of Heaven, the Gate of Mercy and Glory, to keep all out that are out</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Gate of Hell will be ſhut to keep all in that are in. When <hi>Noah</hi> that righteous man was ſhut up in the Ark, there was no Entrance for any more, all without were left to the deluge, and loſt. It's dreadful to the Malefactor, when the Gaoler turns the Key upon him, and leaves him in his Bolts and cloſe Priſon. If it went ſo near <hi>Moſes</hi> his heart to be ſhut out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how wilt thou bear the ſhutting out of Heaven? There was a doleful Out-cry, when the Earth cloſed her Mouth, and <hi>Korah</hi> and his company went down.

Here are the green and freſh Paſtures in which the Souls of the Righteous flouriſh.

               <p n="1">1. You that are moſt remiſs and careleſs would be as well thought of, as the moſt Laborious, Lively, Watchful, Thriving Chriſtian, to whom the Word Preached is ſweet as Honey, and prefer'd above their appoinred food.

               <p n="3">3. You will be willing to go into Heaven with them. There were that would have gone into the Ark with <hi>Noah,</hi> who had no mind to build an Ark to ſave them. To cloſe this I ſhall add two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To live in the Neglect of commanded Duties, and in the Practice of known ſins, will be a ſting and ſtab to thy Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be ſleight, formal and heartleſs in Duties, will ſtarve thy Soul. Chriſtian, this will not make for thy comfortable Account, or prepare thee to go into Heaven with Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Chriſtians, you muſt not only have Grace habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but actually, in its moſt lively and vigorous exerciſe, to prepare you for Heaven. Grace is a Talent ſent down from Heaven, and put into our hands to trade with.

the new man is very weak and feeble in very many. What are become of the graces, comforts, and delights of the Spirit? This ſtreem doth not run, Rivers of Living Water do not flow out of our Bellies: Where is the old ſtock, and the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe? That plenty and fulneſs of the Spirit, that muſt ripen our Souls and make us ready? If grace like the houſe of <hi>David</hi> did revive, and wax ſtronger and ſtronger in you, it would cure your Stupor and Security: and give you (bear with the expreſſion) a freſh Start, or new Alarm for Heaven. That grace is not in the gaining hand, is moſt apparent by your letting down your Watch, and falling aſleep. By your Liſtleſsneſs to Duties, and want of Life, and affection in them, by them, by the prevalency of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and decay of Godly ſorrow for ſin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, by the blotting of your Evidences for heaven, and want of communion with Chriſt, who ſtands aloof off from the withered &amp; decayed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Friend, doſt then not hear the Lord ſay, I have ſomething againſt thee becauſe thou haſt loſt thy firſt Love?

               <p n="1">1. The ſtate of a godly man, and his future feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is not to be adjudged by the manner of his death, or his ſenſible comforts at the end of his days, but by the general courſe and tendency of his life. A Ship that comes home richly laden may meet with a ſtorm at the Harbours mouth. <hi>It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> to his holy diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wife,) <hi>whether comfort comes an hour before death, or an hour after death.</hi> A godly man may die mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; God may give him the Garment of gladneſs in Heaven, for his ſpirit of heavineſs in Earth.

               <p>Secondly, Believing doth precede ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>g<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the direct act of Faith goes before the reflect act of Faith, the Faith of Adherence before the Faith of Evidence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Kingdom of Glory is not promiſed to Aſſurance, but to Faith and Repentance. There are many now in heaven that were not aſſured of it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:039482_0062_101426074BD86110"/>
till they come thither. And how many tender ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſouls are there who prize none in the World like a Chriſt, who love him with all the regards of the Lord, who hate the Enemies of his Scepter with a perfect hatred, who would not willingly offend or grieve him in the leaſt meaſure, who cleave unto him as the only Rock of Salvation, who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their intereſt in him for Millions of Worlds. And yet they weep with <hi>Mary,</hi> becauſe they cannot ſee their Lord. They conflict with fears and doubts day and night, and have not that reflective Evidence and Aſſurance that he is their Chriſt their God. The hour (ſaid one) in which Aſſurance comes is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and its ſtay is ſhort. Thoſe that have it, have it not at all times; as there are degrees of Grace, ſo there are different meaſures of Aſſurance. The Jewels of Grace may lie hid in the cloſe and dark Cabinet of the heart, until the Spirit ſhine upon its own Grace, The choiceſt Flowers have their Roots out of ſight. There are who be as truly in the favour of God, as the Angels themſelves, but they are very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it. 'Tis reported that two Miniſters came to viſit a godly woman, who was weeping over her Child in the Cradle: and being asked by one of the Miniſters the cauſe of griefs, ſhe ſaid, Becauſe I have profeſt Religion more than twenty years, and am not Aſſured of my Salvation. One of the Miniſters asked the woman, Whoſe child is this in the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? ſhe anſwered, Mine, but ſaid he, Doth the Chriſt know you are the Mother of it? She replied, No: which queſtion was a conſolation to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, A man may come ſafe to heaven without Aſſurance, but not without Grace and inherent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. But remember this, the more careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different a man or woman is about the aſſurance of Heaven, the further off he is from it. Therefore
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:039482_0063_1014260AA1A40F80"/>
prize it highly, preſs after it vehemently, if thou wouldſt attain it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Great caſtings down, and ſoul-diſtreſſes, do often uſher in much joy and inward peace. As a dark miſty Night goes before a bright Morning, and a cold long Winter before a Fruitful Spring. Some that have been brought down to the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, have alſo been carried up to the Mount of Transfiguration. The Spirit of Bondage doth lead the way to the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. A Chriſtian that is poor and contrite in his own ſenſe, may have his Soul in a proſperous condition. And 'tis a great Faith to cleave to Chriſt and the Promiſes, when man hath little comfort. <hi>The time may come</hi> (ſaith a great Divine) <hi>when the Faith of Adherence may be all in all.</hi> Tho' thy ſoul is caſt down, aſſurance may be at the door. When <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi> was weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thought her Lord was riſen and gone, Chriſt was behind her, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Saints do not uſually die in a Swoon or Spiritual Conſumption. If <hi>Eutichus</hi> fall down dead, he muſt riſe up again. So God will one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recover his declining people, and revive his work in them, and make them ready. Conſider, it greatly concerns all that will live and die comfortably, and enjoy Chriſt and Heaven Eternally, to preſs after certainty, and to make ready. Are all our deſirable and beſt things in the world uncertain, and ſhall our Souls and Heaven be ſo too? In things of infinite leſs value, men are for certainty, and why not in this? The Uſurer would have Money told twice, who was wont to ſay to his man, It is good to be ſure. In caſe of Money lent, men will have double Security, by Bond and Land In <hi>London,</hi> there is an Enſuring-Office for Merchandize.

Let me ask you, What think you of the Infidel World, the Uncircumciſed in heart and fleſh? How many Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are there, who know not the way to a life of Immortality by a Mediator? Theſe are the Devils Free-hold, without hope, and ſtumble down to Hell in the dark. But to leave the poor Pagans, (who periſh for want of viſion) and to come nearer to our ſelves: What, vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are there in the Chriſtian World, and that among baptized Perſons, who enjoy the means of Salvation, and are altogether unready, for Chriſt and Heaven.</p>
               <p>To deſcend to Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

But to theſe, God, Chriſt, Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a myſtery. A woman being asked by a Miniſter, Whether Chriſt by whom ſhe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salvation, was a Man or a Woman? Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, She could not tell. Are ſuch ready? ſhall they be ſaved who are under the power of the Prince of Darkneſs? <hi>Righteous Father</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>the World hath not known thee,</hi> John 17.25. And

               <p n="2">2. What ſhall we think of thoſe that reſt only in outward Priviledges, who being born of Blood, and of the will of the Fleſh!

                  <p>Secondly, Let the holy Sabbath or Lords day be always welcome to thee. <hi>How glad am I,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>when I ſee the firſt light of the Lords day</hi>: Inure thy ſelf to the ſtrict Obſervation of that high and holy day of God, keep it as for thy life, that at the end of every Lords day, thou mayſt be fit to enter upon an eternal Sabbath: how ſeaſonable and ſweet is it when Gods Spirit and our Hearts meet in the Duties we perform. <hi>I was in the Spirit,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, on the Lords day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three Duties in Religion are very hard, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. we watch the heart. 2. To pray without wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:039482_0111_1014268F6154E9C8"/>
and diſtraction; and 3. To keep the Lords Day well.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be frequent and affectionate in the celebration of that moſt uſeful and glorious Ordinance the Lords Supper, by which we muſt ſhew forth the Lords death till he come. And if you would feed on, and feaſt with Chriſt in this bleſſed Banquet, of which Chriſt is both the Maſter and the Matter, do three things: Firſt, always come with due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Secondly, with high expectation. Thirdly, when come, make application.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be very ſolemn and ſerious in thy Cloſet-Viſits, <hi>viz.</hi> be early and late with God by ſecret Prayer. The great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain <hi>Scipio,</hi> before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took any buſineſs, was wont firſt to enter the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, pretending a conſulting with the gods; ſeveral Miniſters being at Table where the Queſtion was asked, <hi>What was the beſt Trade</hi>? One anſwered, <hi>Begging,</hi> meaning Prayer. Wouldſt thou be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to go in with Chriſt, follow him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable groans from day to day for Grace, and fitneſs for Heaven, ſpeak out thine heart before God, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did when ſhe obtained a Son. The Voice is not abſolutely neceſſary in Prayer, but the Heart: It matters not though the door of the Lips be ſhut, ſo the cloſet of the Heart be open. When thou art going into thy Chamber, or come into thy Cloſet to bow before the Lord, obſerve theſe Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Search and find out thine heart, and ſay, I am going about a great work, to beg Grace to prepare me for Heaven, Where art thou my heart?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Summon in thine heart; 'tis often out of the way, ſend a word of command after it, and fetch it in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Stir and lift up thine heart; the heart is like bell that will make no Muſick till it be raiſed
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:039482_0112_1014269292032520"/>
up, like green Wood that will not burn without much blowing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fix thy Heart on God to whom thou prayeſt, and on Jeſus Chriſt in whoſe Name thou doſt it. Should a Man make a ſuit to the King for his life, and not mind his buſineſs? The moſt High looks upon the heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Watch thine heart, and look for a return of thy Prayer, otherwiſe thine heart will give thee the ſlip, and thy Prayer is loſt. Prayer one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to a Chain, one end of which is faſtened to the Believers tongue, the other to Gods Ear, who is called, <hi>A God hearing Prayer.</hi> Say with <hi>Job, I will fill my mouth with Arguments.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had taken good order for building the Temple, he directs his Prayer to God to prepare their hearts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a cuſtom to ask nothing of their gods, but things of weight and moment. Is not this of greateſt concernment? Try what Prayer can do, plead before God by Ardent and Importunate Prayer to make thee ready, render thy ſelf to God as an undone Creature to new mould, form and faſhion thine Heart for himſelf; carry thy Heart to him on thy Knees, as <hi>Moſes</hi> brought the two Tables of Stone after the firſt were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and defaced, for God to Write what he Will. Say Lord, I have heard what a diſmal, dark, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place Hell is, and what a bleſſed and glorious place Heaven is, and yet I am not prepared for it. This heart of mine I have had on many a ſick-bed, and ſentence of Death, and under many a Sermon, and ſometimes it hath been ſtartled, and awakned, then I have purpoſed and promiſed to repent, pray, leave my ſins, to part with the World, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new man, but I have acted the Hypocrite, all this is come to nothing; Lord do that in me and for me, which none but a God can do.</p>

it ſelf. The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> cannot change his Skin, nor the <hi>Leopard</hi> his Spots. The preparation of the heart in man is from the Lord. <hi>And I have cryed day &amp; night before thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>David</hi>: 'Tis ſtoried of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> after the Sentence was paſt upon her, ſhe cryed ſo earneſtly to the Judge for Mercy, that the Judge and Juſtices rebuked her, to whom ſhe replied, <hi>I beſeech you my Lord, it is for my life.</hi> Chriſtian, 'tis for Heaven and the Eternal life of thy Soul, therefore be earneſt with God for his Spirit to ſanctifie, and prepare thine heart, which by Nature, is a filthy polluted Veſſel.

               <p>Firſt, In general, You ſhall go in from, and leave behind every thing that is afflictive and grievous to you. When <hi>Elijah</hi> went to Heaven,

he left his Mantle behind him. So when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians go in with Chriſt, they ſhall be perfectly and perpetually exempted from all Sinful and Penal Evils, both of Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In particular,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſhall be freed from all the Defector Deformities, and Superfluities of the Body. There will be no Dim or Sore Eyes, no Feeble Knees, Trembling Hands, Bald Heads, Crooked Backs, Broken Bones; no Wens, Warts, Wounds, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Fiſtulaes, Scars, or any Bodily Blemiſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſhall be Perfectly, and for ever free from all your Bodily Toil, Pain, Labour, with which the Lives of many of Gods People have been made bitter. Some to get a little bread have been labouring in the very Fire, others grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mill, ſome digging in the Mines, others caſting up of Ditches, ſome ſpinning at the Tourn, others weaving at the Loom, &amp; threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Barn, and carrying heavy Burdens, and many of them have been Servants to cruel hard Maſters, like <hi>Iſrael</hi> under their Task-Maſters: This will be the Jubilee and Year of the Lords Releaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſhall be freed from all your anxious, vexing and tormenting Cares and Perplexities, about your carnal and bad Relations, as Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Wives, parents, Children, Friends, Eſtates, Law-Suits, Debts, Ill-neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

You ſhall be freed from all your Pain and Travel, through Cold, Dirt, Winds, Storms, and other Difficulties, to come at the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and from all your Deadneſs and Wearineſs in Duties, which is the grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of your Souls.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You ſhall be perfectly freed from all your Fears, Corruptions, Temptations, Deſertions and Doubts, about your Souls and Heaven. The Spouſe will never ſay, Her Beloved is withdrawn and gone from her. <hi>Job</hi> ſhall never feel the poiſoned Arrows within him more. <hi>David</hi> will never ſay, <hi>Save me, O Lord, for the Waters are come in upon my Soul: mine Eyes fail, while I wait for my God.</hi> The Believer ſhall never be heard to ſay or wiſh, Oh! That I knew the work of Grace in me were true and ſaving, that God's Heart were towards me, and that my Heart were truly ſet on God. Then all their Deſires ſhall be ſatisfied, all their Fears removed, all their Doubts reſolved, all their Prayers fully anſwered,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:039482_0135_10188080630CBB88"/>
and all their Graces perfected: and each Saint ſhall come to the fulneſs of the Stature of the Gift of Chriſt. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Mount, he came ſhining down. Surely, the prepared Chriſtian ſhall go ſhining in, when clad with the Robe of Chriſts Glorious Righteouſneſs. The Bodies and Souls of Believers ſhall be as <hi>Adam,</hi> when the Crown of Original Righteouſneſs was ſet upon his head: The Body will be in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtrength, and (as ſome think) as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Thirty and Forty Years; and the Colours ſo rare, freſh, bright and tranſparent, that all the veins and nerves will be diſcerned, and ſo full of ſtrength and agility, as it ſhall be able (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) to Toſs the greateſt Mountain as a Ball. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Glory of the Bodies of the Saints at the Reſurrection, ſaith, <hi>It is ſown in Corruption, it is raiſed in Incorruption; it is ſown in Diſhonour, it is raiſed in Glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in Power,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.42, 43. The ſame Apoſtle affirmeth, <hi>That their vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be made like unto Chriſts Glorious Body.</hi> Then ſhall each Saint ſhine brighter than the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father, for ever and ever.</p>
