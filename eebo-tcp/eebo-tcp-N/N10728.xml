            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO LORD NORTH, PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS you are the Atlas of the ſtate, its religious and moral, as well as civil and commercial concerns are intruſted to your care; and, therefore, this ſketch of the times can ſo properly be addreſſed to no one as yourſelf. Give me leave then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin my addreſs to your Lordſhip (with only alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word) in the four well known beautiful lines of Horace, to the Emperor Auguſtus,
<q>
                  <l>Cum tot ſeſtineas &amp; tanta negotia, ſolus,</l>
                  <l>Res <hi>ANGLAS,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To the Royal Favour, my Lord, you owe what you are. What you ſhould be, the Guardian of the kingdom's morals as well as her revenues; and what you may be, if you will, the greateſt and beſt Prime Miniſter from the time of your predeceſſors Cardinal Wolſey, &amp;c. down to Lord Chatham, is now my buſineſs to point out to you.</p>
            <p>AMONG all the plans, then, which have been ever offered to your Lordſhip's conſideration, to improve the intereſt and welfare of the kingdom, I appeal to all honeſt, worthy, and good men, if you ever had one equal to this which I here offer in the following diſcourſe, as an hint only, and taken from the famous project, propoſal, or plan, for the advancement of religion and morality in this kingdom, of a late celebrated
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:013599_0003_0F9142C182EDAA10"/>
Stateſman, as well as Divine, Now, by putting this excellent plan of his into execution, as ſoon and as much as you can, you may be what I juſt now ſaid, the greateſt and beſt of Prime Miniſters, as their plans are limited only to this world, whereas the plan now before you extends to the next. But, alas! my Lord, I do moſt ſtrangely forget myſelf; the next world, did I ſay? I retract that expreſſion; for why do I mention it in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſeems, by the daily practices of too many by far of all orders, ranks, and degrees of people, to have baniſhed all thoughts of it? You ſee then how you may be, if you will, the Hercules to cleanſe this Augean Stable; and have in your hands, if you will uſe it, the ſword of Alexander to cut this Gordian Knot! But here, I ſuppoſe, my Lord, I ſhall have the old uſual plea thrown out againſt the plan as was done by Lord Oxford and the then Miniſtry, and afterwards by Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Walpole, Duke of Newcaſtle, and ſo on, that the times and reaſons of ſtate will not admit of it. If ſo, I am ſorry for it, and ſo muſt every honeſt man be in the whole kingdom. However, this will do for the ſame reaſon, I ſuppoſe, in the body politic as ſome phyſicians urge the nerves and bile in the body natural; and, indeed, the firſt has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the laſt by much too long. An ulcer has overrun it from head to foot, (the King and Queen, God preſerve them! excepted) and unleſs ſome ſtrictly honeſt ſtate ſurgeon ariſes, for as to ſkill there wants none, and will, with the intrepidity of the Eagle's eye, and the boldneſs of the Lion's heart, take the knife in one hand, and cauſtic in the other, and cut and burn all before him, till he has probed the wound quite to the bottom, (for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is only ſkinning it over) there may be a moſt violent ſhock, if not in end, to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our recovery is not only extremely hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:013599_0004_0F9142C24725E520"/>
but alſo, humanly ſpeaking, almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore, my Lord, unleſs a general and ſpeedy reformation of the religion and morals of this kingdom takes place by the divine aſſiſtance, what England may be in the beginning of the next century, if not before, every one who is a real friend to his King and country muſt dread to think!
<q>Hinc illae lachrymae!</q>
For whatever others may pretend to ſay, it is the firm perſuaſion of myſelf, and all good men, <q>that there is not only a general Providence over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo a particular one over individuals,</q> notwithſtanding what a late learned compiler of ſome voyages has ſuggeſted to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I have been urged, my Lord, to addreſs the following diſcourſe to you from no worldly motives whatſoever; but entirely from a moſt ſincere and hearty zeal for my King and country, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's honor in this world, and your happineſs in the next; and yet, don't think that I mean to flatter you. If I am guilty of flattery at all, (as people ſay) it is to the King, not to yourſelf; but if ſo, it is for a very good reaſon, becauſe (Heavens bleſs him) he has nothing in his power to give. You, my Lord, who have every thing in church as well as ſtate, I would ſcorn to flatter; the very thought itſelf I deteſt and abhor; and yet, I hope I have not ſhewn myſelf, either here or in my ſermon, to have been an entire ſtranger at the altar of the graces. This dedication, therefore, is not by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe at the ſhrine of your Lordſhip's power; for though I am leſs than the leaſt of all curates, city or country, and have been in orders now almoſt thirty years, without preferment, or ever the leaſt expectation of it, yet give me leave to tell you, my Lord, one thing, as a matter of fact: <q>That it is not two years ago when I was offered ſome
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013599_0005_0F9142C3327311D0"/>
of the firſt and beſt pieces of preferment in the church, by a certain gentleman near one of the ſquares, in great connections with men in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but were offered in ſuch a manner as no honeſt man would dare to accept; and therefore, though I had the honor of having them offered to me, yet (thank God) I had the grace to refuſe them.</q> No, my Lord, let me ever be without preferment with a good conſcience, infinitely before being poſſeſſed of Canterbury itſelf with a proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted one! I have neither the pleaſure nor honor of being known to you, but am no ſtranger to a certain gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> GRAY COOPER, <hi>Secretary to the Board.</hi>
               </note> in your Lordſhip's department of the Treaſury, with whom I was, about twenty-three years ago, ſeven years at Trinity College in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. A few words more, my Lord, and then I will relieve your patience: Upon the brightneſs of your character in private life, as an huſband, father, maſter, &amp;c. your very enemies will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I believe, to caſt even one injurious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious ſhade; ſo far, my Lord, I honor you. In public life, as a Prime Miniſter, Politician, Financier, &amp;c. as your Lordſhip's candor will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſilence on theſe points, ſo I leave them to be decided by thoſe who are beſt able to determine them. You are now arrived, and early in life too, at the very acme (as the Greeks call it) of greatneſs; and ſo we may well conclude, that you are the primum mobile of this great machine, the ſtate. But forgive me, my Lord, for once, if I err in aſking a queſtion or two, and offering an hint: Is there not ore in particular, and two or three others as from him, who oil all thoſe ſprings which you only ſeem to move, and accelerate or retard the wheels of ſtate as may beſt ſuit his or their projects? If not, how ſhall we account for all
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:013599_0006_0F9142C3C47A2610"/>
thoſe evils diſtreſſes, grievances, and oppreſſions, which have befallen this poor unfortunate king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not long after the year 1760? When no Prince upon earth ever came to a throne (and moſt deſervedly ſo) with a more meridian ſplendor, the hearts and ſouls of all his ſubjects. But oh! my Lord, we can't ſufficiently lament that this fair and goodly cedar tree, the pride and glory of the national foreſt, under whoſe ſhade we thought to have long and happily reſted, ſhould ſo ſoon have been n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt and chilled in the love and affection of his ſubjects, by this rough and inclement northern blaſt. You ſerve, my Lord, one of the beſt and moſt worthy maſters in the world, who ſtill lives in the hearts and affections of his people; and therefore they can the more eaſily and tenderly overlook his predilection occaſioned by prejudice of education. In gratitude to him, therefore, and in honor to yourſelf, do you neither miſlead him, nor (if in your power) ſuffer him to be miſled. You are too well verſed in hiſtory and mankind, my Lord, to be told, that favoritiſm will never do in any kingdom long, but in England eſpecially. Remember Sejanus, and forget not Mortimer and Buckingham. Emancipate then your royal maſter and yourſelf from the fetters of him in which you have been too long detained, and confine him and his Junto to a gentle baniſhment in his own iſland. Hence England may, perhaps ſee her halcyon days once more; and ſo you would be the better enabled to execute this plan to your own immortal honor, and the welfare and happineſs of our King and country. In the mean time, my Lord, give me leave however, to indulge myſelf in the pleaſing thoughts of ſeeing the kingdom ſomewhat reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your Lordſhip (under God!) as to its religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, morality, and virtue, in joining with the late learned and excellent Lord Roſcommon in part of

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE author of the following diſcourſe having too much reaſon to think that it has been ſtrangely repreſented, by ſome who have heard it from the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, to his brethren the clergy, whom he would not willingly offend, has now brought it to the bar of the public, to plead its own cauſe, and where it muſt be abſolved or condemned by the verdict of their juſt and impartial determination. He only begs leave to defend himſelf thus far, by aſſuring the reader, very faithfully, that neither his preaching nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it was by any means the reſult of a conceited ſingularity, as a clergyman, nor of a low paltry pride, or vanity of being an author! but entirely to an honeſt and hearty endeavour, as his laſt effort, to rouſe the attention of the miniſtry to ſomething elſe beſides themſelves, in order to revive the expiring cauſe of the religion and morals of his country!—The ſuſpicions of his brethren ariſing from the above miſrepreſentation of it, he takes to have been the chief, if not only, reaſon of his having been refuſed the pulpit at ſo many capital churches. His regard and tenderneſs, therefore, for them, as well thoſe who refuſed as thoſe who granted it, will, he doubts not, be a ſufficient apology with the reader for his concealing the churches. As to the reſpectable and worthy part of that venerable body of men, he very highly honors them, and ever ſhall; and as to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caroni and Jeſſamy ſprings of divinity, with their curled pates froſted o'er like a Twelfth Cake, to be ſure he honors them too, as the very worthy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of ſo much apoſtolical gravity and dignity! He is well aware of what cenſures he ſhall incur
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:013599_0009_0F9142C9D38F08C8"/>
by this ſermon and dedication, from many of the venal part of the laity, as well as ſome perhaps, of the clergy; but this, with many other things, give him not the leaſt concern, for (thank God!) he has neither hopes nor fears from any man living whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>What his principles are, religious or political, or whether he has any principles at all, he ſuppoſes to be of very little or no concern to the public from ſuch a very obſcure and inſignificant a perſon as himſelf. He, therefore, wants not to make the leaſt boaſt or parade of either his orthodoxy in the church, or his patriotiſm in the ſtate; but hopes that the candour of the public will allow him to ſay thus much of both, that, ſeparate from his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he looks upon the church of England to be the moſt truly primitive and apoſtolical, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt conſtituted church this day upon the face of the whole earth; and in which, however unworthy a member be may have lived, he ſhall alſo die. And as to eſtate, what little he has, together with his life, are and ſhall be ready to be laid at the feet of his king and country. Let ancient or modern patriotiſm ſay or do more. The clergy, he knows, are reckoned, and reviled by too many of their enemies as only dumb dogs, in the prophet's expreſſion. As to his own part, they may call him a ſurly, ſnarling, or what dog they pleaſe, if they will but allow him to be an honeſt dog, as he means not to bite, or even bark, any farther than to be a watchful one, as every honeſt dog ought to be, and to give the alarm againſt evil or negligent miniſters either in church or ſtate. He finds that he is accuſed of ill will and envy againſt a certain nation, both in his dedication and ſermon but he begs leave to aſſure them that it is very unjuſtly, as he bears a general love and good will to all mankind. He only wiſhes that their

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLESIASTES, ch. vii. ver. 10.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Say not thou, What is</hi> the cauſe <hi>that former days were better than theſe? For thou doſt not inquire wiſely concerning this.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>SINCE human nature and conduct have been much the ſame in all ages of the world, it will be of no great ſervice to us to inquire of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, whether former times have been better or worſe than the preſent? And for any one to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay that other nations, now living, are better or worſe than ourſelves, is ſaying much more than he can prove; and granting even that he could prove that they are much worſe than we are, yet this is no juſtification to us now as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor will it be ſo to us hereafter, as individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, at the laſt and great day of accounts! But however, I am very certain of this, that it is high time for us to be much better than we are, both as a nation and as individuals.</p>
            <p>Whoever, then, has a true regard for the honor and welfare of church and ſtate, which are ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily eſtabliſhed by the ancient laws of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to make us the pride of our own, and the admiration and envy of all other nations, and ſo nicely compacted with each other, that, like a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013599_0013_0F9142CF217527B0"/>
building moſt curiouſly framed, they muſt ſtand or fall together; and if he has but a tolerable ſhare of hiſtory, and will ſit down with a ſerious concern to conſider the preſent ſtate of this nation, as to its religion, morals, and virtues, muſt lament to ſee how exactly it reſembles the Grecian and Roman empires, when they were drawing towards the point of their diſſolution! That general deluge of luxury and pride, profligacy of morals, an open and avowed contempt of the Deity, infidelity, bribery, and corruption, which overflowed them juſt before their ruin, is but too glaring a picture of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, therefore, too ſad and diſagreeable to the eye of every true Briton to behold with the leaſt ſatisfaction!</p>
            <p>As to religion, and the ſacred writings, we are come to that paſs now, that you may blaſpheme your God, revile your king, think what you pleaſe, and ſpeak what you think, and no one take any notice of it! But in all other reſpects, as to mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, virtue, true patriotiſm, and common honeſty, we feel every day the diſmal effects of an iron age, while we in vain wiſh for the return of a golden one!</p>
            <p>As this little iſland of ours is ſeparated from the continent, it ſeems by its peculiar happy ſituation, to have been originally deſigned by Providence to make its inhabitants completely happy within themſelves, were they but ſenſible of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and knew how to value it aright! But God, in his juſt judgments, is pleaſed to let a curſe go forth upon ſome nations, for being ſo wilfully blind as that they will not ſee their own happineſs, and purſue them till they are ripe for an entire deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! How far this may be our caſe, (and much ſooner perhaps than we imagine) God himſelf only knows, if it is not timely prevented by a national repentance and reformation! Oh, England, how
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013599_0014_0F9142D0D31B8290"/>
art thou fallen! and how ſhamefully and baſely corrupted are thy ſons and daughters from their primitive piety, virtue, and integrity!</p>
            <p>We are daily talking that we wiſh to ſee better times (and it is our own fault if we do not) but as we ſeem to be going on, that is never likely till the final reſtitution of all things, at the end of the world!</p>
            <p>That the preſent times are extremely bad is too well known, and too ſadly and fatally felt by all in general; and, therefore, no wonder to hear ſuch daily complaints that they are ſo; but this is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to ourſelves! Hence it is not ſo very difficult, as ſome people may pretend, to find out, a way both to remedy the complaints of the times, and to remove the cauſe of them.</p>
            <p>Now, in order to do this the better, I ſhall ſtrike at the very root of all our evils, diſtreſſes, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and oppreſſions, at once, by ſaying, that there is but very little or no religion left among us; by which I mean, a fear of God, and a belief of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. Our great are, too many of them, above all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and our little people are as much below it. What ſmall remains of it are ſtill left among us, are to be found only, or however chiefly among our middle ſort of people; and even there, I fear, it is too much and ſadly corrupted! Now, if a kingdom has ſuch very little notion of living in the fear of God, can it poſſibly be any wonder that they live in no ſort of fear of man? But by far too many going daily on in thoſe iniquitous and infernal practices, which ſeem right in their own eyes, as though there was no judge in Iſrael.</p>
            <p>As to our nobility and gentry, they have two examples before them, who, as they are the greateſt, ſo are the beſt in all conjugal, parental, domeſtic, and ſocial virtues; inſomuch that they are both the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013599_0015_0F9142D1E3E2FF18"/>
glory and reproach of thoſe that are about them? Was I to conſider this ſubject of the times parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, you might well think me tedious indeed; but though it is ſo great and extraordinary, I ſhall endeavor to be as full, and yet as ſhort as poſſible, and therefore beg your patience.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now then ſtate the caſe of this nation very fairly and honeſtly with you, by ſhewing that the grounds and cauſes of all our complaints of the times will be found to ariſe entirely from ourſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> from a want of religion among us throughout the whole kingdom in general, and its capital city in particular; which, like all other capitals, in morals as well as trade, arts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, hath great influence upon the reſt of their reſpective kingdoms.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the firſt place, therefore, hint only at things in general; by way of queſtion; and, in the ſecond and laſt place, point out a method, which, if quickly and carefully practiſed, would (under God) moſt effectually reform the nation, and reſtore it to its ancient ſtate of religion, morality and virtue.</p>
            <p>To begin then with our nobility and gentry, for according to their examples, good or bad, the middle and lower ſort of people are obſerved to form their lives and converſations; I have already juſt mentioned, that they have two excellent examples at court before their eyes, in all conjugal, parental domeſtic, and ſocial virtues; and yet don't miſtake me, and think that I am putting on the courtier here, in ſpeaking this by way of flattery only; I deteſt even the thought of ſuch low, mean, unmanly, paltry, pitiful behaviour; I appeal to yourſelves for the truth, and eſpecially to thoſe who are daily about their perſons. I would therefore, only aſk, Do they imitate them (in general I mean) in theſe amiable virtues and qualities? If ſo, pray now how comes it to paſs that divorces, ſeparations!
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013599_0016_0F9142D201E74A18"/>

            <p>Again, do thoſe ſhew themſelves true friends to their King and country by complimenting their Majeſties on their birth days, at court, in dreſſes of French, or other foreign manufactury? And can this poſſibly be for the honor and intereſt of their own country, by inſulting their Sovereign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And are theſe debts paid before what they are pleaſed to call debts of honor at the gaming or card-table, which is only another term for injuſtice and villainy?</p>
            <p>As in the beſt governments the worſt corruptions are too apt to prevail through the baſe and artful intrigues of men of ambition and avarice, what muſt we think will be the certain conſequences, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>cked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it will deſtroy the very beſt conſtituted government upon earth! I muſt confeſs, for my own part, I am as far from being the leaſt friend to politics from the pulpit as any man living; nor would I, much leſs, be even thought to blow the horn of faction and ſedition from this ſacred place! But, when we are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to heal a ſore in the body politic as well as natura, every honeſt ſurgeon will always probe the wound to the bottom, by the knife, or cauſtic, in the one caſe as well as the other; and, therefore, here I would only juſt aſk again, Is it for the intereſt and happineſs of any nation to ſuffer ſuch a Machiavelian maxim ſtill to prevail, to let a parcel
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013599_0017_0F9142D2C4736780"/>
of little, mean, paltry boroughs, the fungous fleſh of the conſtitution, to be repreſented in parliament, while places of ſuch immenſe conſequence to trade; which is the life of this nation, are left without repreſentatives? And what muſt the repreſentatives of ſuch beggarly places be, but ſlaves to the nod of a miniſter to carry on either his arbitrary or pacific ſyſtem of corruption, whether he is the real miniſter, or only the oſtenſible one, as he is now called, <hi>i. e.</hi> one who is hung out by one or more behind the curtain, only as the ſign of a miniſter? Is it for the promotion of juſt and honeſt principles, in a nation of learning and merit in the church, and of induſtry, ſkill, integrity in the ſtate, for places in the one, and preferments in the other, to be expoſed to ſale, and publicly too in our daily news papers? Is there no perjury committed by thoſe of the clergy, who purchaſe livings for themſelves with their own money, either directly or indirectly? And ought not our biſhops, the governors of the church, to get an act paſſed either to aboliſh the oath againſt ſimony, or to put an abſolute ſtop to ſuch a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and iniquitous ſale of them?</p>
            <p>Again, is it likely for the morality and virtue of a kingdom to laſt long, when ſuch a multitude of places of diverſion, and diſſipation of people's time and money, are ſuffered by thoſe at the helm of affairs (who ought to be the guardians of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's morals as well as her revenues) to enervate bodies and unhinge the minds, not only of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city in particular, but alſo the whole kingdom in general, and that even in the ſolemn time and ſeaſon of Lent too! Formerly indeed, in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, valour and a true ſenſe of honor, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained even the appearance of any thing that was mean and baſe, was the characteriſtic of our men of quality and gentry, and virtue and modeſty were that of our women; but now, vice and villainy
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013599_0018_0F9142D38616BB28"/>
have entirely loſt their names! Adultery is no crime, and killing is no murder! And are the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned graces of both ſexes, which ſo much elevate and dignify them, likely to be continued at ſuch diabolical places as maſquerades and the gaming table? Is the preſent mode of education at our academies, large ſchools, and others throughout the kingdom, and at our two univerſities, for the riſing generation of the men, and our French and other boarding ſchools, in and about this great city in particular, and the nation in general, for the riſing generation of the women, ſo happily calculated and formed for improving the morals as well as the learning of children now a days? If ſo, how comes it to paſs, that we hear ſuch frequent and daily complaints from fathers, mothers, and guardians, that they ſcarce know where to put the one part of the ſex, to ſecure their morals, as well as improve them in learning; and the other part, that they learn nothing but pride, folly, and extravagance in dreſs, and of every other kind whatſoever? Is it either for the intereſt or honor of a nation, for its nobility and gentry to be drawing every year ſuch immenſe ſums of money out of it, and laviſhing it away abroad on their vices and follies, under the notion of travelling into foreign parts, and ſeeing the world; where, from the ignorance of their own nation, through the rawneſs and inexperience of their youth (juſt, as it were, thrown out of their mother's lap, and falſe notions imbibed in it) they are ſure to glean up every weed of vice and folly which falls in their way! Is it politic and prudent, again, in our middle ſort of people, to ſend their children over to France for education in their nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries and convents; where, however advantageous it may be to parents for cheapneſs, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, yet is it ſo for forming and faſhioning their young and tender minds in the principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013599_0019_0F9142D651AC8D28"/>
by thoſe who are well known to be quite of a moſt oppoſite perſuaſion? and, therefore, they would be much ſafer in that, and every other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, under the eye of their parents and guardians at home. And now, even from theſe two or three queſtions, does it not too plainly appear (and well for us if not too fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly felt a few years hence!) that our French, and other foreign faſhions, have done us infinitely more miſchief towards our ruin than all their wars with us (thank God! have been ever able to do? And yet don't miſtake me again in what I have ſaid, or may ſay, of our nobility and gentry, as though I was only taking a pleaſure in cenſuring their conduct; far from it! very far, indeed! On the contrary, I am ſo far from taking pleaſure in ſpeaking evil of dignities, that I would moſt gladly draw a veil over their foibles and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, did they not appear in ſome inſtances too flagrant to withold our ſilence! I am only aſking a few plan queſtions, as to the generality of them, and their proceedings; which I leave to thoſe to anſwer, who beſt underſtand them. There are ſome among them, of both ſexes, whoſe virtues and graces not only add a luſtre to the coronet, but alſo elevate and dignify human nature!</p>
            <p>Again, is it for the honor abroad, or the intereſt and happineſs at home, for any nation to be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently removing thoſe from their offices in the ſtate, who have approved themſelves worthy by their ſkill and integrity? If men are fit for their places in the various departments of ſtate affairs, the law, army, or navy, why are they removed? If not, why are they put in? Now theſe two queſtions are much more eaſily aſked, perhaps, than anſwered; and, therefore, I would aſk only how far the next queſtion will give an anſwer to them; are not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice ſuffered by perſons themſelves, as well as by others, to prevail at court, and thro'out
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013599_0020_0F9142D81E54A600"/>
the kingdom? If ſo, the caſe is plain, and theſe are the two great engines of miſchief, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet courts, but alſo kingdoms, and the whole world itſelf on fire! Can that nation ever raiſe up its head above the overflowings of ungodlineſs, and eſcape being drowned at laſt, about whoſe neck ſuch a monſtrous millſtone of places and penſions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tied? But if penſions are ſettled upon ſome in the ſtate, army, or navy, who have deſerved well at the hands of their King and country, and therefore properly and well beſtowed for their paſt ſervices, does this juſtify the civil liſt either here, or in a ſiſter kingdom, eſpecially that, being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with thoſe for ſuch ſervices, as it would be far from doing the leaſt honor either to thoſe who beſtow, or thoſe who accept them? Nay rather, would it not be an inſult to common ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a ſcandal and diſgrace even to modeſty and human nature, barely to mention ſome of them? Is it good management or policy in any kingdom, to ſuffer its land-tax, and all thoſe taxes, which are ſo grievouſly felt by the manufacturer and mechanic, upon the neceſſary articles of life, to be almoſt as high in time of peace as in war?</p>
            <p>The pride, glory, and ſtrength of this little iſland of our's, which we inhabit, is well known among you all to be its trade; and is that in ſo very flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a ſtate either at home or abroad, as to have no complaints among us, that the French, Dutch, or other nations underwork us, and conſequently underſell us at foreign markets? Now, can this be done by them without labour being cheaper? And can this be ſo without proviſions being cheaper? And can proviſions in any nation poſſibly be cheap, where all kinds, even of the bare neceſſaries of life, are witheld from the labouring poor, who are the ſtrength and ſinews of a nation, as well as the rich, by the monopoly, engroſſing, regrating, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013599_0021_0F9142D94858B418"/>
of a ſet of wretches, who, in almoſt any country but this (ſuch are the bleſſed effects of our liberty!) would be taken, half a ſcore of them, and hung up directly as a terror to the reſt, as indeed they ought to be, who are a diſgrace even to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity itſelf. For every one is ſo, who, like a vulture, can feed and prey upon his fellow creatures! Now have we laws againſt this vile op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and grievance, amongſt too many others, or have we not? If we have, for humanity ſake, why are they not ſtrictly and ſeverely executed? If not, why are not ſuch made, and inſtantly executed, as will effectually remove this great diſtreſs, which begins now to be very ſenſibly felt by the middle ſort of people, as well as the lower? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe does the ſupreme Father of Mercies, and God of all Comforts ſhower down his bleſſings daily and hourly upon us, giving us fruitful ſeaſons, and filling our hearts with food and gladneſs, if, at the ſame time, by an artificial ſcarcity, wickedly made by one ſet of men, and as wickedly overlooked by another, we are daily ſtarving in the midſt of a real plenty, now muſt not the fault of this lie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? How far the next queſtions will go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards anſwering what I have juſt now aſked, I leave you to judge, and thoſe to conſider, whom ſurely it moſt nearly and principally concerns: Do not too many of our nobility and gentry, ſuffer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and large pieces of waſte ground to be encloſed, and many of their ſmaller farms, which would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whole families, to be engroſſed by one perſon only, who is already too great and overgrown? If ſo, for mercy ſake, what muſt become of the poorer and labouring ſort of people? And is this enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one man, at the expence of many others, and whole families, likely to make him, his wife, or children, the ſame plain, honeſt, ſober, frugal ſort of people that farmers generally have been uſed to be?
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013599_0022_0F9142D9814A5280"/>
And moreover, to what end is all this oppreſſion of the ſmall tenants? Is it not to ſave the ſteward trouble in collecting the rents, and for his more eaſy and quick remittance of large ſums at once to the landlord? And for what? Is it not either to go abroad, and ſquander them away in France, and other countries, upon French follies, laces, and clothes, and import them in a low, paltry, ſneaking, clandeſtine manner, to the diſtreſs and ruin of our trade and manufactures; or elſe to ſupply all the various ſtreams of luxury, folly, and extravagance here at home, which are ſo conſtantly ſuffered to flow from this great city, as its fountain head? And therefore, if ſo, can it poſſibly be any wonder that ſo many hundreds of the poor and labouring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a year are conſtantly flocking over from England, Scotland, and Ireland, to our plantations in America? As to Scotland, indeed, happily for many of them! the tree of life has, within theſe thirteen years paſt, been imported, planted, watered, nouriſhed, and thrives ſo well as to afford them too much ſhade and ſhelter here, to quit it for the hot and burning ſuns abroad, except indeed for our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and principal offices of our colonies there.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, was I to go on aſking queſtions about what many evils, and what little good our late MARRIAGE-ACT has produced, the danger of SEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENNIAL PARLIAMENTS, the bad policy in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only ſuch a yearly EXPORTATION of HORSES to the neglect of AGRICULTURE, but too often of CORN, by not taking off the bounty upon it, when up at ſuch a price; the ABSENTEE-BILL in Ireland, and the TEA-TAX on our Colonies; the great corruptions which have crept into the church as well as the ſtate, from the neglect of diſcipline by our church governors, if it was only as to the dreſs of the younger part of the clergy, what offence it

gives to her few friends, and handle to her many enemies; the luxury and extravagance of the age through all orders, ranks, and degrees of people; the immorality and diſſipation of their time and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes at Newmarket; the gaming-table, and other places of ruin and debauchery, among too many of the younger part of our nobility and gentry; the ambition and avarice of the elder, and the too great neglect of both as to the divine Majeſty on his holy ſabbaths, by ſetting a good example to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants in frequenting church, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all good order and oeconomy at home; the bad policy (not to ſay iniquity) of thoſe whom it concerns, as pretenders to public oeconomy, in not ordering a yearly account to be ſettled of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal debt. Hence ariſe ſo many public defaulters of unaccounted thouſands and millions! and when this is the caſe with any nation, what muſt become of it in time, but, like a private man (whoſe expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by far outrun his income) take up the ſponge, quit ſcores, and become a bankrupt? Was I, I ſay, to go on aſking queſtions about the general bad influence of example, which the upper part of the kingdom has upon the middle, and they upon the lower; and, in ſhort, a multitude of things more which might be mentioned, I ſhould well be tho't tedious, and treſpaſs a great deal too much upon your patience! and therefore I would only obſerve here, once for all, that when the corruption of a nation is thus ſo univerſal, no wonder that we are ſo daily alarmed with murders, adulteries, perjuries, bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcies, robberies, houſe-breakings, decay of trade and manufactures, want both of public and private credit, diſobedience in children and ſervants, dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of proviſions, innumerable multitudes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſes all over the kingdom, to corrupt and ruin the morals of the labouring and lower ſort of people, neglect of God's worſhip at church on the

Sabbath day, and want of reverence and devotion in people's behaviour when they are there; the ſcandalous and offenſive books, prints, ſtatues, and ſongs, with which our eyes and ears are ſure to be peſtered as we go along the ſtreets and avenues of this great city; want of common faith and truſt in our dealings with one another, to that degree that you ſcarce know whom to truſt to the value of five ſhillings, barely upon the credit of his own word; want of charity and compaſſion amongſt too many of the rich; and want of induſtry, ſobriety, humility, modeſty, and gratitude amongſt the poor; the dreadful imprecations of our lower ſort of people among the men, and the horrible oaths and curſes even from the mouths of women and children! In a word, and to conclude this firſt and diſagreeable part of the ſubject, ſins, crimes, and vices beyond meaſure, of every kind and ſhape whatſoever!</p>
            <p>To be drawing now towards a concluſion with the ſecond and laſt part of it, which is to ſhew you particularly that the grounds and cauſes of all the evils in this nation, and our complaints of the times, will be found to ariſe entirely from ourſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> from a want of a due ſenſe of religion among us, through the whole kingdom in general, and its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city in particular. For religion (however it may be derided and reproached in this nice, ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and delicate age) was always thought by the wiſer and more ſober heathens to be a moſt laſting foundation of laws and ſocieties, as without it no government can ſubſiſt, nor juſtice be adminiſtered. Thus Plato calls religion "the barrier of power and juſtice, and a tye of honeſty," and Tully ſays of the Romans, "that they conquered ſo many nations not ſo much by ſtratagem, or ſuperior ſtrength, as by their ſtrict regard and ſacred reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for religion and virtue." And therefore had
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013599_0025_0F9142DDE2693440"/>
a moſt admirable project, propoſal, or plan of a late celebrated writer<note n="*" place="bottom">DEAN SWIFT,</note>, for the advancement of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality in this kingdom, been but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted when it was publiſhed, about ſixty years ago, the face of affairs now would have been chiefly, if not intirely, changed. I ſhall, therefore, point out to you ſuch an obſervation or two of his from it as will be moſt ſerviceable towards filling up this ſketch of the times, which I have here given, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to a far more able pencil to complete the piece.</p>
            <p>"As the power (ſays he) of giving away all employments in church and ſtate is in the crown, either by the King himſelf, or by his miniſters, it is in the power of every prince to make religion and virtue become the faſhion of the age, provided they are made to be, at the ſame time, the direct and neceſſary ſteps to favor and preferment. If princes, therefore, deſire to ſee their people happy and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, let them make it every man's intereſt and honor to be religious and virtuous, by making irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vice a diſgrace, and a ſure bar to their promotion in either; this they ſhould firſt endeavor to do in their own courts and families; and then religion and virtue would ſoon become faſhionable graces at court, and would be carefully practiſed as the only methods to get and keep employments there, which alone would have great influence on the nobility and gentry; for if religion and virtue were once underſtood to be the neceſſary and direct ſteps to favor and preferment, then no one would openly offend againſt them, who had the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for their reputation and fortune."</p>
            <p>Now to this firſt part of the plan, I may juſtly add my former remark, that they have two as ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able examples before their eyes, as any court in Europe, or the whole world can produce! Whether a method to reſtore this nation to its real greatneſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013599_0026_0F9142DF00C15FE8"/>
and glory, <hi>i. e.</hi> its religion and virtue, agreeable or no, I know not, nor does it concern me; otherwiſe, I mean, than moſt heartily wiſhing it was put in practice; and that it is practicable will be readily confeſſed by every one who are their King and country's real friends! There is only wanting an hearty deſire and ſteady reſolution for all parties to unite in ſo good and neceſſary a work; for, alas! what can half a ſcore or an hundred do, if all don't join? And (as the plan obſerves again) that ſome effectual attempt ſhould be made towards ſuch a reformation, is more neceſſary than people may imagine, as the ruin of a nation is ſure to follow a general corruption of morals, and contempt of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ſeems to be too much our caſe at preſent! For when men, in places of great truſt and power in a nation, do their duty for conſcience ſake, affairs will not ſuffer then by fraud or neglect; and if they believed a divine Providence and a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, and acted accordingly, what an happy change of affairs we ſhould then have throughout the kingdom, by ſuch ſtrong and powerful examples!</p>
            <p>His preſent Majeſty (whoſe life may God long preſerve, it being moſt particularly dear and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us in theſe critical and hazardous times) is a prince well known to have many great and good qualities, among which integrity and truth, an heart truly honeſt and proteſtant, a ſtranger to hypocriſy, and deteſting diſſimulation and flattery; and therefore, was I now preaching before him, he muſt give me leave to tell him alſo, according to the plan ſomewhat varied, that his beſt endeavors to inſtil ſome ſhare of thoſe virtues, of which himſelf and his moſt amiable conſort are poſſeſſed, into his people, are a moſt important part of his duty, as well as his intereſt and honor.</p>

To conclude, let us conſider and well remember, that the once famed Grecian and Roman empires were entirely overturned and deſtroyed by their conqueſts in Perſia, Aſia, Africa, and Judea, letting in upon them ſuch a deluge of luxury, profaneneſs and immorality! How far the Britiſh Empire has been already affected (and may be ſtill more ſo) as to its religion and morals, by that immenſe flow of wealth and luxury from our conqueſts in the Eaſt-Indies; and how far thoſe who have brought it over, acquired there in ſo very few years, can reconcile to their own conſciences the manner in which they got it; and the luxury and corruption, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the decline of religion and virtue in this kingdom, I leave to themſelves to conſider. But moſt ſure I am of this one thing, that in any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, either abroad or at home, when the man once ſuffers himſelf to be enſlaved to ambition and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to luxury and pleaſure, the Chriſtian is not very likely to ſtay long behind! There muſt be then, you ſee plainly, one grand reſtoration to the principles of religion and virtue, in educating the riſing generation of the rich, middle, and lower ſort of people in this kingdom; otherwiſe all the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the clergy till doomſday, and all the pretences to patriotiſm and public ſpirit, are, and will be, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing at all; as he, that would have his garden fruitful in autumn, muſt take care to dig, weed, and plant it well in the ſpring; accordingly Solomon finely and juſtly obſerves to us, "Train up a child, ſays he (but how: Not in the way he is going, for then tèn thouſand to one but he is ruined! No, but) in the way that he ſhould go, for when he is old he will not depart from it!" Let all parents and guardians then make it their chief care and concern to plant in their children's hearts the early ſeeds of religion and virtue! Let them teach them, almoſt from their very cradle, and repeating to them as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013599_0028_0F9142E0411F5A80"/>
they grow up, ſuch as to think and ſpeak awfully of the MOST HIGH GOD, reverently of religion, and reſpectfully of its miniſters, honor and obedience to parents, duty to their King and country, ſobriety and temperance to themſelves, juſtice and honeſty to others, and a general love and good will to all their fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>One great error prevailing in this kingdom, and its capital city in particular, is that we have here too much preaching, and too little catechizing children, at church by the clergy, and at home by their parents! Now the want of this is the fountain head of all our evils and diſtreſſes, as this would be laying the true and only foundation of religion and virtue in their young and tender minds, by inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and keeping them to the very firſt principles of it. Had we, therefore, leſs preaching and more catechiſing, I am moſt certain we ſhould have a much deeper, and conſequently a much better ſenſe of religion, which would influence our whole lives and converſations, for to preach to people without their knowing the principles of their religion, is like building an houſe without firſt laying a foundation. It is this want of catechiſing, or inſtructing youth in theſe principles, that has been the true and only cauſe of all thoſe various ſects and opinions, which have ſo diſturbed the private peace and happineſs of families, as well as the public, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed what little religion there is now left in the nation! For the minds of too many people now are ſo blown up with noiſe, nonſenſe, wild and empty notions, that among thoſe of forty or fifty years old, you will ſcarce find any able to give that account of their faith, as Chriſtians, which formerly you might have heard from a boy of ten or twelve; and therefore what the pulpit has neglected, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſordered and deſtroyed, the deſk muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore. Had this been done at the beginning of the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013599_0029_0F9142E12F9F8B28"/>
preſent century, and conſequently kept up, not only in the time of Lent, but alſo all the year round, we ſhould have had no room for complaints, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times were better than the preſent. We live now, at this day, in the very beſt times of the world! and moſt ſorry I am to ſay it, in the very worſt times alſo! Beſt from God, and worſt from ourſelves! And therefore, after all, if private peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will, by a fooliſh and amazing extravagance, plunge themſelves headlong into debt, and then rail and cry out at the badneſs of the times, becauſe they are arreſted; and if the public money, inſtead of being ſkilfully and honeſtly applied (as it ought to be) to the public ſervice, is embezzled and ſquandered away, for ſecret ſervices, and other baſe, mean, and ſcandalous purpoſes, and no enquiries ever made, or ſuffered to be made, what is become of it, or how is it applied? and if an honeſt, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and loyal body of citizens petition and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to their ſovereign (the father of his people!) againſt encroachments on their liberties, and the grievances are ſuffered to remain, by thoſe that are about him, ſtill unredreſſed.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if the public welfare and honor, peace and happineſs of a kingdom muſt be ſacrificed to all the little dark cabals, and private perſonal piques, reſentments, and revenge of thoſe in power, who, while pretending to be the King's friends, are only ſecuring poſſeſſions for themſelves, and titles, places, and reverſions for their wives and families! I ſay, if even theſe few things are ſo (and many more I could mention) how unreaſonable, fooliſh, and abſurd, are all our complaints of the badneſs of the times! Prime miniſters, politicians, and others, may offer plans, ſchemes ways and means to make a nation great and powerful as they call it; but let me tell them, that they muſt, firſt of all, make it religious and virtuous, and then it will be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013599_0030_0F9142E1E830FC78"/>
truly great; and therefore, there is but one thing that can poſſibly ſave this nation, and that is, by rouzing it from its ſtupid lethargy of ſin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, with the Almighty thunder of ſome ſignal judgment! There is but one thing that can diſarm the Almighty from his thunder, and that is a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal repentance and reformation! And there is but one thing more that can continue to ſave it, after it has been thus rouzed and reformed, and that is, by keeping the riſing generation to a proper ſenſe of their duty in catechiſing, or inſtructing them in the principles of religion! But all nations, like the human body, have their infancy, growth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. How far we of this kingdom are paſt that perfection, and our colonies abroad every year ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing towards their growth, needs no great ſagacity to foreſee, or to foretel, that the ſeat of the Britiſh Empire may be tranſlated over there much ſooner than we imagine. The ſevere and unnatural treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the colonies have felt ſince the war, has not yet withdrawn their affections; but when chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren find the mother is reſolved to be arbitrary, oppreſſive, and tyrannical, no wonder they, in their turn, endeavor to do the beſt they can for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. How far thoſe in the adminiſtration of affairs of this, and our other two kingdoms, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, either paſſively or actively, in enabling them to go on in this manner, I leave to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to determine; but, to be ſure, all ſuch muſt be the king's real friends, and, no doubt, the ſame honeſt and worthy friends to theſe poor, diſtreſſed, and depopulating countries! I have now done my duty ſo as becomes every honeſt Briton, real patriot, and true miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, in crying aloud (as the prophet ſays) and ſparing not, even from the throne down to the cottage, in ſhewing my countrymen their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of England their ſins; in being (as St. Paul ſays) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

            <p>Let us then, my brethren, of all ranks, orders, and degrees of people in this kingdom, utterly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from us all our faſhionable ſins and vices, and take up, and conſequently practiſe the oppoſite vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces! that ſo we may turn aſide the wrath of the great God of Heaven; and let us well conſider and remember, that his mercy will not permit him entirely to overlook his juſtice. I have now, with more freedom perhaps than is agreeable to the times, in ſome meaſure laid before you the preſent ſtate of affairs in this nation. Be it ſo. But I appeal to all true Britons and ſincere Chriſtians to juſtify me.
