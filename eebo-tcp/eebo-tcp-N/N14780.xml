            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</hi> Of the <hi>IMPORTANCE</hi> of the <hi>REVOLUTION</hi> which has eſtabliſhed the Independence of the United States.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING, from pure conviction, taken a warm part in favour of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies (now the United States of America) during the late war; and been expoſed, in conſequence of this, to <hi>much</hi> abuſe and <hi>ſome</hi> danger; it muſt be ſuppoſed that I have been waiting for the iſſue with anxiety—I am thankful that my anxiety is removed; and that I have been ſpared to be a witneſs to that very iſſue of the war which has been all along the object of my wiſhes. With heart-felt ſatisfaction, I ſee the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in favour of univerſal liberty which has taken place in <hi>America;</hi>—a revolution which opens a new proſpect in human affairs, and begins a new aera in the hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018739_0004_0FA81C5E99EAEB10"/>
—a revolution by which <hi>Britons</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will be the greateſt gainers, if wiſe enough to improve properly the check that has been given to the deſpotiſm of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and to catch the flame of virtuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which has ſaved their American brethren.</p>
            <p>The late war, in its <hi>commencement</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,</hi> did great good by diſſeminating juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the rights of mankind, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of legitimate government; by exciting a ſpirit of reſiſtance ſo tyranny, which has eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated one <hi>European</hi> country, and is likely to emancipate others; and by occaſioning the eſtabliſhment in <hi>America</hi> of forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more equitable and more liberal than any that the world has yet known. But, in its <hi>termination,</hi> the war has done ſtill greater good by preſerving the new governments from that deſtruction in which they muſt have been involved, had Britain conquered; by provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a ſequeſtered continent poſſeſſed of many ſingular advantages, a place of refuge for oppreſt men in every region of the world; and by laying the foundation there of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which may be the ſeat of liberty, ſcience and virtue, and from whence there is reaſon to hope theſe ſacred bleſſings will ſpread, till they become univerſal and the time arrives when kings and prieſts ſhall have no more power to oppreſs, and that ignominious ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which has hitherto debaſed the world is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018739_0005_0FA81C5F541835F8"/>
exterminated. I therefore, think I ſee the hand of Providence in the late war working for the general good; and can ſcarcely avoid crying out, <hi>It was the Lord's doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon, as well as tradition and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lead us to expect that a more improved and happy ſtate of human affairs will take place before the conſumination of all things. The world has hitherto been gradually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving. Light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life <hi>at preſent,</hi> compared with what it <hi>once</hi> was, is much the ſame that a youth approaching to manhood is compared with an infant.</p>
            <p>Such are the natures of things that this progreſs muſt continue. During particular intervals it may be interrupted, but it cannot be deſtroy'd. Every preſent advance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for farther advances; and a ſingle experiment or diſcovery may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give riſe to ſo many more as ſuddenly to raiſe the ſpecies higher, and to reſemble the effects of opening a new ſenſe, or of the fall of a ſpark on a train that ſprings a mine. For this reaſon, mankind may at laſt arrive at degrees of improvement which we cannot now even ſuſpect to be poſſible. A dark age may follow an enlightened age; but, in this caſe, the light, after being ſmothered for a time, will break out again with a brighter luſtre.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018739_0006_0FA81C608B993D00"/>
The preſent age of increaſed light, conſidered as ſucceeding the ages of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> and an intermediate period of thick darkneſs, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a proof of the truth of this obſervation. There are certain kinds of improvement which, when once made, cannot be entirely loſt. During the dark ages, the improvements made in the ages that preceded them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to be recovered immediately at the reſurrection of letters, and to produce after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that more rapid progreſs in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has diſtinguiſhed modern times.</p>
            <p>There can ſcarcely be a more pleaſing and encouraging object of reflection than this. An accidental obſervation of the effects of gravity in a garden has been the means of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the laws that govern the ſolar ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem<note n="*" place="bottom">This refers to an account given of Sir Iſaac Newton, in the Preface to Dr. PEMBERTON'S View of his Philoſophy.</note>, and of enabling us to look down with pity on the ignorance of the moſt enlightened times among the antients. What new digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been given to man, and what additions have been made to his powers, by the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of optical glaſſes, printing, gun-powder, &amp;c. and by the late diſcoveries in navigation, mathematics, natural philoſophy, &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>But among the events in modern times tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the elevation of mankind, there are none
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018739_0007_0FA81C611ACAD360"/>
probably of ſo much conſequence as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one which occaſions theſe obſervations. Perhaps, I do not go too far when I ſay that, next to the introduction of Chriſtianity among mankind, the American revolution may prove the moſt important ſtep in the progreſſive courſe of human improvement. It is an event which may produce a general diffuſion of the principles of humanity, and become the means of ſetting free mankind from the ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of ſuperſtition and tyranny, by leading them to ſee and know <q>that nothing is <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> but impartial enquiry, an honeſt mind, and virtuous practice—that ſtate policy ought not to be applied to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſpeculative opinions and formula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of faith.</q>—<q>That the members of a civil community are <hi>confederates,</hi> not <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> and their rulers, <hi>ſervants,</hi> not <hi>maſters.</hi> —And that all legitimate government conſiſts in the dominion of equal laws made with common conſent; that is, in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of men over <hi>themſelves;</hi> and not in the dominion of communities over commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or of any men over other men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Happy will the world be when theſe truths ſhall be every where acknowledged and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed upon. Religious bigotry, that cruel demon, will be then laid aſleep. Slaviſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments and ſlaviſh Hierarchies will then
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018739_0008_0FA81C619BA6DB80"/>
ſink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the old prophecies be verified, <q>that the laſt univerſal empire upon earth ſhall be the empire of reaſon and virtue, under which the goſpel of peace (better underſtood) <hi>ſhall have free courſe and be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, many will run to and fro and knowledge be increaſed, the wolf dwell with the lamb and the leopard with the kid, and nation no more lift up a ſword againſt nation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a conviction I cannot reſiſt, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca is one of the ſteps ordained by Providence to introduce theſe times; and I can ſcarcely be deceived in this conviction, if the United States ſhould eſcape ſome dangers which threaten them, and will take proper care to throw themſelves open to future improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to make the moſt of the advantages of their preſent ſituation. Should this happen, it will be true of them as it was of the people of the Jews, that <hi>in them all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> It is ſcarcely poſſible they ſhould think too highly of their own conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Perhaps, there never exiſted a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on whoſe wiſdom and virtue more depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: or to whom a ſtation of more importance in the plan of Providence has been aſſigned. They have begun nobly. They have fought with ſucceſs for themſelves and for the world; and, in the midſt of invaſion and carnage, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018739_0009_0FA81C62A4623D50"/>
forms of government favourable in the higheſt degree to the rights of mankind. —But they have much more to do; more indeed than it is poſſible properly to repreſent. In this addreſs, my deſign is only to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a few <hi>great</hi> points which ſeem particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to require their attention, in order to render them permanently happy in themſelves and uſeful to mankind. On theſe points, I ſhall deliver my ſentiments with freedom, conſcious I mean well; but, at the ſame time, with real diffidence, conſcious of my own lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to error.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT ſeems evident, that what firſt requires the attention of the United States is the redemption of their debts, and making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to that army which has carried them through the war. They have an infant cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to cheriſh and rear, which, if this is not done, muſt periſh, and with it their character and honour for ever. Nor is it conceivable they ſhould meet with any great difficulties in doing this. They have a vaſt reſource peculiar to themſelves, in a continent of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018739_0010_0FA81C6344EFA048"/>
lands poſſeſſing every advantage of ſoil and climate. The ſettlement of theſe lands will be rapid, the conſequence of which muſt be a rapid increaſe of their value. By diſpoſing of them to the army and to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, the greateſt part of the debts of the United States may probably be ſunk <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</hi> But had they no ſuch reſource, they are very capable of bearing taxes ſufficient for the purpoſe of a gradual redemption. Suppoſing their debts to amount to <hi>nine milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſterling, carrying intereſt at 5½ <hi>per cent.</hi> taxes producing a revenue of a million <hi>per ann.</hi> would pay the intereſt, and at the ſame time leave a <hi>ſurplus</hi> of <hi>half</hi> a million <hi>per ann.</hi> for a <hi>ſinking fund,</hi> which would diſcharge the principal in thirteen years. A ſurplus of a <hi>quarter</hi> of a million would do the ſame in 20½ years. After diſcharging the principal, the appropriated revenue being no longer wanted, might be aboliſhed, and the States eaſed of the burden of it. But it would be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to aboliſh it entirely. 100,000<abbr>l.</abbr>

ever<note n="*" place="bottom">The lands, foreſts, impoſts, &amp;c. &amp;c. which once form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>patrimony</hi> of the crown in <hi>England,</hi> bore moſt of the expences of government. It is well for this kingdom that the extravagance of the crown has been the means of alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating this patrimony, for the conſequence has been making the crown dependent on the people. But in America ſuch a patrimony would be <hi>continental</hi> property capable of being applied only to public purpoſes, in the way which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic (or its delegates) ſhould approve.</note>. Such a <hi>reſerve</hi> would (ſuppoſing it improved ſo as to produce a profit of 5 <hi>per cent.</hi>) increaſe to a capital of three millions in 19 years, 30 millions in 57 years, 100 milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in 81 years, and 261 millions in 100 years. But ſuppoſing it capable of being improved ſo as to produce a profit of 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> it would increaſe to five millions in 19 years, 100 millions in 49 years, and 10,000 millions in 97 years.</p>
            <p>It is wonderful that no ſtate has yet thought of taking this method to make itſelf great and rich. The ſmalleſt appropriation in a ſinking fund, <hi>never diverted,</hi> operates in cancelling debts, juſt as money increaſes at compound intereſt; and is, therefore, <hi>omnipotent</hi>

if <hi>diverted,</hi> it loſes all its power. BRITAIN affords a ſtriking proof of this. Its ſinking fund (once the hope of the kingdom) has, by the practice of alienating it, been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impotent and uſeleſs. Had it been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably applied to the purpoſe for which it was intended, there would in the year 1775, have been a <hi>ſurplus</hi> in the revenue of more than five millions <hi>per ann.</hi> But inſtead of this, we were then encumbered with a debt of 137 millions, carrying an intereſt of near 4½ mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and leaving no ſurplus of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. This debt has been ſince increaſed to 280 millions, carrying an intereſt (inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding expences of management) of <hi>nine</hi> millions and a half.—A monſtrous bubble;—and as no effectual meaſures are likely to be taken (or perhaps <hi>can now</hi> be taken) for reducing it within the limits of ſafety, it muſt, ſome time or other, produce a dreadful convulſion. Let the United States take warning—Their debts at preſent are moderate. A Sinking fund, guarded <note n="*" place="bottom">When not thus guarded, public funds become the worſt evils, by giving to the rulers of ſtates a command of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for the purpoſes of corruption.</note> againſt miſapplication, may ſoon extinguiſh them, and prove a reſource in all events of the greateſt importance.

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018739_0013_0FA81C6850E5BEA0"/>I muſt not, however, forget that there is ONE of their debts on which no ſinking fund can have any effect; and which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to diſcharge:—A debt, greater, perhaps, than has been ever due from any country; and which will be deeply felt by their lateſt poſterity.—But it is a debt of GRATITUDE only—Of GRATITUDE to that General, who has been raiſed up by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make them free and independent, and whoſe name muſt ſhine among the firſt in the future annals of the benefactors of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>The meaſure now propoſed may preſerve America for ever from too great an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of debts; and, conſequently, of taxes —an evil which is likely to be the ruin not only of <hi>Britain,</hi> but of other <hi>European</hi> States. —But there are meaſures of yet greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, which I wiſh ardently to recommend and inculcate.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of mankind, I wiſh to ſee every meaſure adopted that can have a tendency to preſerve PEACE in America; and to make it an open and fair ſtage for diſcuſſion, and the ſeat of PERFECT LIBERTY.</p>

            <head>Of <hi>PEACE,</hi> And the Means of perpetuating it.</head>
            <p>CIVIL Government is an expedient for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the wiſdom and the force of a community or confederacy, to preſerve its peace and liberty againſt every hoſtile inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whether from <hi>within</hi> or from <hi>without.</hi>— In the latter of theſe reſpects, the United States are happily ſecured; but they are far from being equally happy in the <hi>former</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Having now, in conſequence of their ſucceſsful reſiſtance of the invaſion of <hi>Britain,</hi> united to their remoteneſs from <hi>Europe,</hi> no external enemy to fear, they are in danger of fighting with one another.—This is their <hi>greateſt</hi> danger; and providing ſecurities againſt it is their <hi>hardeſt</hi> work. Should they fail in this, America may ſome time or other be turned into a ſcene of blood; and inſtead of being the hope and refuge of the world, may become a terror to it.</p>
            <p>When a diſpute ariſes among <hi>individuals</hi> in a State, an appeal is made to a <hi>court</hi> of law; that is, to the wiſdom and juſtice of the State. The court decides. The loſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acquieſces; or, if he does not, the power of the State <hi>forces</hi> him to ſubmiſſion; and thus the effects of contention are ſuppreſt, and peace is maintained.—In a way ſimilar
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018739_0015_0FA81C69D290E630"/>
to this, peace may be maintained between any number of confederated States; and I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imagine, that it is not impoſſible but that by ſome ſuch means <hi>univerſal</hi> peace may ſome time or other be produced, and all war excluded from the world.—Why may we not hope to ſee this begun in America?—The articles of confederation make conſiderable advances towards it. When a diſpute ariſes between any of the States, they order an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Congreſs—an enquiry by Congreſs,— a hearing,—and a deciſion.—But here they ſtop.—What is moſt of all neceſſary is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. No proviſion is made for enforcing the deciſions of Congreſs; and this renders them inefficient and ſutile. I am by no means qualified to point out the beſt method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this defect. Much muſt be given up for this purpoſe, nor is it eaſy to give up <hi>too</hi> much. Without all doubt the powers of Congreſs muſt be enlarged. In particular, a power muſt be given it to collect, on certain emergencies, the force of the confederacy, and to employ it in carrying its deciſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. A State againſt which a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is made, will yield of courſe when it knows that ſuch a force exiſts, and that it allows no hope from reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>By this force I do not mean a STANDING ARMY. God forbid, that ſtanding armies ſhould ever find an eſtabliſhment in America!
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018739_0016_0FA81C6B07991568"/>
They are every where the grand ſupports of arbitrary power, and the chief cauſes of the depreſſion of mankind. No wiſe people will truſt their defence out of their own hands, or conſent to hold their rights at the mercy of armed <hi>ſlaves.</hi> Free States ought to be bodies of armed <hi>citizens,</hi> well regulated, and well diſciplined, and always ready to turn out, when properly called upon, to execute the laws, to quell riots, and to keep the peace. Such, if I am rightly informed, are the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of America. Why then may not CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESS be furniſhed with a power of calling out from the confederated States, <hi>quotas</hi> of <hi>militia</hi> ſufficient to force at once the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of any State which may ſhew an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to break the union by reſiſting its deciſions?</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that it will be difficult to guard ſuch a power againſt abuſe; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, better means of anſwering this end are diſcoverable. In human affairs, however, the choice generally offered us is "of two evils to take the leaſt." We chuſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of civil government, becauſe a leſs evil than anarchy; and, in like manner, in the preſent inſtance, the danger of the abuſe of power, and of its being employed ſometimes to enforce wrong deciſions, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, becauſe a leſs evil than the miſery
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018739_0017_0FA81C6BA5FFB4F8"/>
of inteſtine wars. Much, however, may be done to leſſen this danger. Such regulations as thoſe in the ninth of the articles of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will, in a great meaſure, prevent haſty and partial deciſions. The rotation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by the fifth article will prevent that corruption of character which ſeldom fails to be produced by the long poſſeſſion of power; and the right reſerved to every State of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling its Delegates when diſſatisfied with them, will keep them conſtantly reſponſible and cautious.</p>
            <p>The obſervations now made muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to money tranſactions. Congreſs muſt be truſted with a power of procuring ſupplies for defraying the expences of the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of contracting debts, and providing funds for diſcharging them: and this power muſt not be capable of being defeated by the oppoſition of any minority in the States.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the credit of the United States, their ſtrength, their reſpectableneſs abroad, their liberty at home, and even their exiſtence, depend on the preſervation of a firm political union; and ſuch an union cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, without giving all poſſible weight and energy to the authority of that delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which conſtitutes the union.</p>
            <p>Would it not be proper to take periodical ſurveys of the different ſtates, their numbers of both ſexes in every ſtage of life, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

occupations, property, &amp;c.?—Would not ſuch ſurveys, in conjunction with accurate regiſters of births, marriages and deaths at all ages, afford much important inſtruction by ſhewing what laws govern human mortality, and what ſituations, employments, and civil inſtitutions, are moſt favourable to the health and happineſs of mankind?—Would they not keep conſtantly in view the progreſs of population in the ſtates, and the increaſe or decline of their reſources? But more eſpecially, are they not the only means of procuring the neceſſary information for determining accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and equitably the proportions of men and money to be contributed by each ſtate for ſupporting and ſtrengthening the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

            <p>THE next point I would inſiſt on, as an object of ſupreme importance, is the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a ſyſtem of perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>religious</hi> as well as <hi>civil,</hi> in America, as ſhall render it a country where truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall have fair play, and the human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers find full ſcope for exerting themſelves, and for ſhewing how far they can carry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man improvement.</p>
            <p>The faculties of man have hitherto, in all countries, been more or leſs cramped by the interference of civil authority in matters of

ſpeculation, by tyrannical laws againſt hereſy and ſchiſm, and by ſlaviſh hierarchies and religious eſtabliſhments. It is above all things deſirable that no ſuch fetters on reaſon ſhould be admitted into America. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, with inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, that at preſent they have no exiſtence there. In this reſpect the governments of the United States are liberal to a degree that is unparalleled. They have the diſtinguiſhed honour of being the firſt ſtates under heaven in which forms of government have been eſtabliſhed favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>univerſal</hi> liberty. They have been thus diſtinguiſhed in their <hi>infancy.</hi> What then will they be in a more advanced ſtate; when time and experience, and the concurring aſſiſtance of the wiſe and virtuous, in every part of the earth, ſhall have introduced into the new governments, corrections and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which will render them ſtill more friendly to liberty, and more the means of promoting human happineſs and dignity?— May we not ſee there the dawning of brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days on earth, and a new creation riſing. But I muſt check myſelf. I am in danger of being carried too far by the ardor of my hopes.</p>
            <p>The liberty I mean includes in it liberty of conduct in all <hi>civil</hi> matters—liberty of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in all <hi>ſpeculative</hi> matters—and liberty of conſcience in all <hi>religious</hi> matters.—And it is

            <p>In liberty of diſcuſſion, I include the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of examining all public meaſures, and the conduct of all public men; and of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and publiſhing on all ſpeculative and doctrinal points.</p>

            <p>IT is a common opinion, that there are ſome doctrines ſo ſacred, and others of ſo bad a tendency, that no public diſcuſſion of them ought to be allowed. Were this a right opinion, all the perſecution that has been ever practiſed would be juſtified. For, if it is a part of the duty of civil magiſtrates to prevent the diſcuſſion of ſuch doctrines, they muſt, in doing this, act on their own judgments of the nature and tendency of doctrines, and, conſequently, they muſt have a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſcuſſion of all doctrines which they <hi>think</hi> to be ſacred for diſcuſſion or too dangerous in their tendency; and this right they muſt exerciſe in the only way in which civil power is capable of exerciſing it, "by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting penalties on all who oppoſe ſacred doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, or who maintain pernicious opinions." In <hi>Mahometan</hi> countries, therefore, civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018739_0021_0FA81C6ED0A039C0"/>
have a right to ſilence and puniſh all who oppoſe the divine miſſion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a doctrine there reckoned of the moſt ſacred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The like is true of the doctrines of tranſubſtantiation, worſhip of the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. in <hi>Popiſh</hi> countries; and of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Trinity, ſatisfaction, &amp;c. in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> countries.—In <hi>England</hi> itſelf, this principle has been acted upon, and produced the laws which ſubject to ſevere penalties all who write or ſpeak againſt the Supreme Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt, the Book of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Church Articles of Faith. All ſuch laws are right, if the opinion I have mentioned is right. But in reality, civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has nothing to do with any ſuch matters; and civil governors go miſerably out of their proper province, whenever they take upon them the care of truth, or the ſupport of any doctrinal points. They are not judges of truth; and if they pretend to decide about it, they will decide wrong. Th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> all the countries under heaven think of the application of civil power to doctrinal points in every country but their own. It is, indeed, ſuperſtition, idolatry, and nonſenſe, that civil power at preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports almoſt every where, under the idea of ſupporting ſacred truth, and oppoſing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous error. Would not, therefore, its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect neutrality be the greateſt bleſſing?— Would not the intereſt of truth gain unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, were all the rulers of States to aim at

            <p>All the experience of paſt time proves that the conſequence of allowing civil power to judge of the nature and tendency of doctrines, muſt be making it a hindrance to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of truth, and an enemy to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was tried and condemned in Greece for teaching that the ſun and ſtars were not Deities, but maſſes of corruptible matter. Accuſations of a like kind contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the death of <hi>Socrates.</hi> The threats of bigots and the fear of perſecution, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>Copernicus</hi> from publiſhing, during his whole life time, his diſcovery of the true ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the world. <hi>Galileo</hi> was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the doctrine of the motion of the earth, and ſuffered a year's impriſonment for having aſſerted it. And ſo lately as the year 1742, the beſt commentary on the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of human genius (NEWTON'S <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>) was not allowed to be printed at ROME, becauſe it aſſerted this doctrine; and the learned commentators were obliged to prefix to their work a declaration, that on this point
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018739_0023_0FA81C7025462128"/>
they ſubmitted to the deciſions of the ſupreme Pontiffs. Such <hi>have</hi> been, and ſuch (while men continue blind and ignorant) <hi>will</hi> always be the conſequences of the interpoſition of civil governments in matters of ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>When men aſſociate for the purpoſe of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government, they do it not to defend truth, or to ſupport formularies of faith and ſpeculative opinions; but to defend their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rights, and to protect one another in the free exerciſe of their mental and corporeal powers. The interference, therefore, of civil authority in ſuch caſes is directly contrary to the end of its inſtitution. The way in which it can beſt promote the intereſt and dignity of mankind, (as far as they can be promoted by the diſcovery of truth) is, by encouraging them to ſearch for truth wherever they can find it; and by protecting them in doing this againſt the attacks of malevolence and bigotry. Should any attempt be made by contending ſects to injure one another, its power will come in properly to cruſh the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to maintain for all ſects equal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by puniſhing every encroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. The conduct of a civil magiſtrate, on ſuch an occaſion, ſhould be that of <hi>Gallio</hi> the wiſe Roman proconſul, who, on receiving an accuſation of the apoſtle Paul, would not liſten to it, but drove from his preſence the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers who had laid violent hands upon him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

giving them the following admonition;— <hi>If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdneſs, reaſon would require that I ſhould bear with you. But if it be a queſtion of words and names and the law, look you to it. For I will be no judge of ſuch matters.</hi> Acts xviii. 12. &amp;c. How much happier would the world have been, had all magiſtrates acted in this manner? Let <hi>America</hi> learn this important leſſon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the experience of paſt times. A diſſent from <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> opinions and doctrines has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed often miſerably diſturbed ſociety, and produced miſchief and bloodſhed. But it ſhould be remembered, that this has been ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of the points diſſented from, and the uſe of civil power to enforce the reception of them. Had civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment done its duty, left all free, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf in <hi>procuring</hi> inſtead of <hi>reſtraining</hi> fair diſcuſſion, all miſchief would have been avoided, and mankind would have been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed higher than they are in knowledge and improvement.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtianity, that firſt and beſt of all the means of human improvement, was firſt preached, it was charged with turning the world upſide down. The leaders of Jewiſh and Pagan eſtabliſhments were alarmed, and by oppoſing the propagation of it, converted a religion of peace and love into an occaſion of violence and ſlaughter; and thus verified
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018739_0025_0FA81C7463757BF0"/>
our Lord's prophecy, that he was come <hi>not to ſend peace, but a ſword on earth.</hi> All this was the effect of the miſapplication of the powers of government. Inſtead of <hi>creating,</hi> they ſhould have been employed in <hi>preventing</hi> ſuch miſchief, and been <hi>active</hi> only in cauſing the Chriſtian cauſe to receive a fair hearing, and guarding the propagators of it againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.—The like obſervation may be made concerning the firſt reformers.—What we all ſee would have been right in <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> governments with reſpect to Chriſtianity and the Reformation; would it not be <hi>now</hi> right in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> governments, were any attempts made to propagate a new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or any doctrines advanced oppoſite to thoſe now held ſacred! Such attempts, if unſupported by reaſon and evidence, would ſoon come to nothing. An impoſter cannot ſtand the teſt of fair and open examination. On the contrary, the cauſe of truth will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſerved by it. <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> would have ſunk as ſoon as it roſe, had no other force than that of evidence been employed to propagate it; and it is an unſpeakable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that it made its way till it became the religion of the world in one of its moſt enlightened periods, by evidence only, in oppoſition to the ſtrongeſt exertions of civil power. There cannot be a more ſtriking proof, that nothing but fair diſcuſſion is neceſſary to ſuppreſs error and to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018739_0026_0FA81C75972500C8"/>
propagate truth. I am grieved, indeed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I find any Chriſtians ſhewing a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call in the aid of civil power to defend their religion. Nothing can be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to it. If it wants ſuch aid it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God. Its corruption and debaſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment took place from the moment that civil power took it under its patronage; and this corruption and debaſement increaſed, till at laſt it was converted into a ſyſtem of abſurdity and ſuperſtition more groſs and more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than Paganiſm itſelf.—The religion of Chriſt diſclaims all connexion with the civil eſtabliſhments of the world. It has ſuffered infinitely by their <hi>friendſhip.</hi> Inſtead of ſilencing its opponents, let them be encouraged to produce their ſtrongeſt arguments againſt it. The experience of <hi>Britain</hi> has lately ſhewn that this will only cauſe it to be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and more firmly believed.</p>
            <p>I would extend theſe obſervations to all points of faith, however ſacred they may be deemed. Nothing reaſonable can ſuffer by diſcuſſion. All doctrines <hi>really</hi> ſacred muſt be clear and incapable of being oppoſed with ſucceſs. If civil authority interpoſes, it will be to ſupport ſome miſconception or abuſe of them.</p>
            <p>That <hi>immoral tendency</hi> of doctrines which has been urged as a reaſon againſt allowing the public diſcuſſion of them, may be either
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018739_0027_0FA81C761080A7B8"/>
               <hi>avowed</hi> and <hi>direct,</hi> or only a <hi>conſequence</hi> with which they are charged. If it is <hi>avowed</hi> and <hi>direct,</hi> ſuch doctrines certainly will not ſpread. The principles rooted in human nature will reſiſt them; and the advocates of them will be ſoon diſgraced. If, on the contrary, it is only a <hi>conſequence</hi> with which a doctrine is charged, it ſhould be conſidered how apt all parties are to charge the doctrines they oppoſe with bad tendencies. It is well known, that <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians, Trinitarians</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians, Fataliſts</hi> and <hi>Free-willers,</hi> are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exclaiming againſt one another's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as dangerous and licentious. Even Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity itſelf could not, at its firſt introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſcape this accuſation. The profeſſors of it were conſidered as <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe they oppoſed Pagan idolatry; and their religion was on this account reckoned a deſtructive and pernicious enthuſiaſm. If, therefore, the rulers of a State are to prohibit the propagation of all doctrines in which they apprehend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral tendencies, an opening will be made, as I have before obſerved, for every ſpecies of perſecution. There will be no doctrine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true or important, the avowal of which will not in ſome country or other be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to civil penalties.—Undoubtedly, there <hi>are</hi> doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which have ſuch tendencies. But the tendencies of ſpeculative opinions have often very little effect on practice. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature has planted in the human mind
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018739_0028_0FA81C769C9B7898"/>
principles and feelings which will operate in oppoſition to any <hi>theories</hi> that may ſeem to contradict them. Every ſect, whatever may be its tenets, has ſome <hi>ſalvo</hi> for the neceſſity of virtue. The philoſophers who hold that matter and motion have no exiſtence except in our own ideas, are capable of believing this only in their cloſets. The ſame is true of the philoſophers who hold that nothing exiſts <hi>but</hi> matter and motion; and at the ſame time teach, that man has no ſelf determining power: that an unalterable fate governs all things; and that no one <hi>is</hi> any thing that he can avoid <hi>being,</hi> or <hi>does</hi> any thing that he can avoid <hi>doing.</hi> —Theſe philoſophers when they come out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world act as other men do. Common ſenſe never fails to get the better of their theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and I know that many of them are ſome of the beſt men in the world, and the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends to the true intereſts of ſociety. Though their doctrine may ſeem to furniſh an apology for vice, their practice is an exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of virtue; and a government which would ſilence them would greatly injure itſelf. —Only overt acts of injuſtice, violence or defamation, come properly under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Were a perſon now to go about London, teaching that <q>property is founded in grace,</q> I ſhould, were I a magiſtrate, let him alone while he did nothing but <hi>teach,</hi> without being under any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than that he would ſoon find a lodging

            <p>I am perſuaded, that few or no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies would ariſe from ſuch a liberty. If magiſtrates will do their duty as ſoon as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence begins, or any overt acts which break the peace are committed, no great harm will ariſe from their <hi>keeping themſelves neutral</hi> till then.

            <p>IN LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE I include much more than <hi>Toleration.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt has eſtabliſhed a perfect equality among his followers. His command is, that they ſhall aſſume no juriſdiction over one another, and acknowledge no maſter beſides <hi>himſelf.</hi>—It is, therefore, preſumption in any of them to claim a right to any ſuperiority or pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over their brethren. Such a claim is implied, whenever any of them pretend to <hi>tolerate</hi> the reſt.—Not only all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but all <hi>men</hi> of all religions ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by a State as equally intitled to its protection as far as they demean themſelves honeſtly and peaceably. <hi>Toleration</hi> can take place only where there is a civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a particular mode of religion; that is, where a predominant ſect enjoys <hi>excluſive</hi> advantages, and makes the encouragement of its own mode of faith and worſhip a part of the conſtitution, of the State; but at the ſame time thinks fit to SUFFER the exerciſe of other modes of faith and worſhip. Thanks be to God, the new American States are at preſent ſtrangers to ſuch eſtabliſhments. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as well as many others, they have ſhewn, in framing their conſtitutions, a degree of wiſdom and liberality which is above all praiſe.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:018739_0031_0FA81C790D33E9D0"/>Civil eſtabliſhments of formularies of faith and worſhip are inconſiſtent with the rights of private judgment—They ingender ſtrife—They turn religion into a trade—They ſhoar up error—They produce hypocriſy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication—They lay an undue byaſs on the human mind in its enquiries, and obſtruct the progreſs of truth.—<hi>Genuine</hi> religion is a concern that lies entirely between God and our own ſouls. It is incapable of receiving any aid from human laws. It is contaminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſoon as worldly motives and ſanctions mix their influence with it. Stateſmen ſhould countenance it only by exhibiting in their own example a conſcientious regard to it in thoſe forms which are moſt agreeable to their own judgments, and by encouraging their fellow-citizens in doing the ſame. They cannot as <hi>public men</hi> give it any <hi>other</hi> aſſiſtance. All beſides that has been called a <hi>public leading</hi> in religion, has done it an eſſential injury, and produced ſome of the worſt conſequences.</p>
            <p>The Church Eſtabliſhment in <hi>England</hi> is one of the mildeſt ſort. But even here what a ſnare has it been to integrity? And what a check to free enquiry? What diſpoſitions favourable to deſpotiſm has it foſtered? What a turn to pride and narrowneſs and dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has it given the clerical character? What ſtruggles has it produced in its members to accommodate their opinions to the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018739_0032_0FA81C799A325450"/>
and teſts which it impoſes? What a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of learning has it occaſioned to defend obſelete creeds and abſurdities? What a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then is it on the conſciences of ſome of its beſt clergy, who, in conſequence of being bound down to a ſyſtem they do not approve, and having no ſupport except that which they derive from conforming to it, find themſelves under the hard neceſſity of either <hi>prevaricating</hi> or <hi>ſtarving?</hi>—No one doubts but that the Engliſh clergy in general could with more truth declare that they <hi>do not,</hi> than that they <hi>do</hi> give their <hi>unfeigned aſſent to all and every thing</hi> contained in the thirty-nine Articles and the Book of Common-Prayer; and yet, with a ſolemn declaration to this purpoſe, are they obliged to enter upon an office which above all offices requires thoſe who exerciſe it to be examples of ſimplicity and ſincerity.—Who can help execrating the cauſe of ſuch an evil?</p>
            <p>But what I wiſh moſt to urge is the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of religious eſtabliſhments to impede the improvement of the world. They are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries preſcribed by human folly to human inveſtigation; and incloſures which intercept the light and confine the exertions of reaſon. Let any one imagine to himſelf what effects ſimilar eſtabliſhments would have in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, Navigation, Metaphyſicks, Medicine or Mathematicks. Something like this took place in Logick and Philoſophy; while the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018739_0033_0FA81C7A5A4017C0"/>
IPSE DIXIT of Ariſtotle and the nonſenſe or the ſchools maintained an authority like that of the creeds of churchmen: And the effect was a longer continuance of the world in the ignorance and barbarity of the dark ages. But civil eſtabliſhments of religion are <hi>more</hi> pernicious. So apt are mankind to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the character of the Deity, and to connect his favour with particular modes of faith, that it muſt be expected, that a religion ſo ſettled will be what it has hitherto been—a gloomy and cruel ſuperſtition bearing the name of religion.</p>
            <p>It has been long a ſubject of diſpute, which is worſt in its effects on ſociety, <hi>ſuch</hi> a religion or ſpeculative Atheiſm. For my own part, I could almoſt give the preference to the latter. —ATHEISM is ſo repugnant to every principle of common ſenſe, that it is not poſſible it ſhould ever gain much ground, or become very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. On the contrary; there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proneneſs in the human mind to SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERSTITION, and nothing is more likely to become prevalent.—ATHEISM leaves us to the full influence of moſt of our natural feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſocial principles; and theſe are ſo ſtrong in their operation, that in general they are a ſufficient guard to the order of ſociety. But SUPERSTITION counteracts theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by holding forth men to one another as objects of divine hatred; and by putting them
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018739_0034_0FA81C7B5962FE30"/>
on harraſſing, ſilencing, impriſoning and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another in order to do God ſervice.— ATHEISM is a ſanctuary for vice by taking away the motives to virtue ariſing from the will of God and the fear of a future judgment. But SUPERSTITION is more a ſanctuary for vice, by teaching men ways of pleaſing God without moral virtue, and by leading them even to compound for wickedneſs by <hi>ritual</hi> ſervices, by bodily penances and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by adoring ſhrines, going pilgrimages, ſaying many prayers, receiving abſolution from the prieſt, exterminating heretics, &amp;c.— ATHEISM deſtroys the ſacredneſs and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an oath. But is there not alſo a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (ſo called) which does this, by teaching that there is a power which can diſpenſe with the obligation of oaths, that <hi>pious</hi> frauds are right, and that faith is not to be kept with heretics?</p>
            <p>It is indeed only a rational and liberal reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; a religion founded on juſt notions of the Deity as a being who regards equally eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſincere worſhipper, and by whom all are alike favoured as far as they act up to the light they enjoy; a religion which conſiſts in the imitation of the moral perfections of an almighty but benevolent Governor of nature who directs for the beſt all events, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the care of his providence, in reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his will, and in the faithful diſcharge
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018739_0035_0FA81C7BD618B148"/>
of every duty of piety and morality from a regard to his authority and the apprehenſion of a future righteous retribution.—It is only THIS religion (the inſpiring principle of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing fair and worthy and joyful, and which in truth is nothing but the love of God and man and virtue warming the heart and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the conduct.)—It is only THIS kind of religion that can bleſs the world, or be an advantage to ſociety.—This is the religion that every enlightened friend to mankind will be zealous to promote. But it is a religion that the powers of the world know little of, and which will always be beſt promoted by being left free and open.</p>
            <p>I cannot help adding here, that this is in particular the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion.—Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity teaches us that there is none good but one, that is, God; that he willeth all men to be ſaved, and will puniſh nothing but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; that he deſires mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (benevolence rather than rituals); that loving him with all our hearts, and loving our neighbour as ourſelves, is the whole of our duty; and that in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſs is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him. It reſts its authority on the power of God, not of man; refers itſelf entirely to the underſtandings of men; makes us the ſubjects of a kingdom that is not of this world! and requires us to elevate our minds
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018739_0036_0FA81C7C8DDFAE78"/>
above temporal emoluments, and to look forwards to a ſtate beyond the grave, where a government of perfect virtue will be erected under that Meſſiah who has <hi>taſted death for every man.</hi>—What have the powers of the world to do with ſuch a religion?—It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims all connexion with them; it made its way at firſt in oppoſition to them; and, as far as it is now upheld by them, it is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and vilified.</p>
            <p>The injury which civil eſtabliſhments do to Chriſtianity may be learnt from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The ſpirit of religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is oppoſite to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity. It is a ſpirit of pride and tyranny in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Chriſtian <hi>lowly</hi> ſpirit; a contracted and ſelfiſh ſpirit, in oppoſition to the Chriſtian enlarged and benevolent ſpirit; the ſpirit of the world in oppoſition to the Chriſtian <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Religious eſtabliſhments are founded on a claim of authority in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church which overthrows Chriſt's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He has in the ſcriptures given his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a code of laws, to which he requires them to adhere as their <hi>only</hi> guide. But the language of the framers of church eſtabliſhments is <q>We <hi>have authority in controverſies of faith and power.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018739_0037_0FA81C7DC391A2A0"/>
to decree rites and ceremonies.</hi> We are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of Chriſt upon earth, who have been commiſſioned by him to interpret his laws, and to rule his church. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow us. The ſcriptures are inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Our interpretations you muſt receive as Chriſt's laws; our creeds as <hi>his</hi> doctrine; our inventions as <hi>his</hi> inſtitutions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident, as the excellent HOADLY has ſhewn, that theſe claims turn Chriſt out of the government of his own kingdom, and place uſurpers on his throne.—They are therefore derogatory to his honour; and a ſubmiſſion to them is a breach of the allegiance due to him. They have been almoſt fatal to true Chriſtianity; and attempts to enforce them by civil penalties, have watered the Chriſtian world with the blood of ſaints and martyrs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The difficulty of introducing alterations into church eſtabliſhments after they have been once formed, is another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them. Hence it happens, that they remain always the ſame amidſt all changes of public manners and opinions<note n="*" place="bottom">This is an inconvenience attending <hi>civil</hi> as well as <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> eſtabliſhments, which has been with great wiſdom guarded againſt in the new <hi>American</hi> conſtitutions, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing that there ſhall be a reviſal of them at the end of certain terms. This will leave them always open to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, without any danger of thoſe convulſions which have uſually attended the corrections of abuſes when they have acquired a ſacredneſs by time.</note>; and that a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018739_0038_0FA81C7E5A3B4948"/>
kingdom may go on for ages in idolatrous worſhip, after a general conviction has taken place, that there is but one object of religious worſhip, namely, <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What a ſad ſcene of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hypocriſy muſt ſuch a diſcordance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween public conviction and the public forms produce? At this day in ſome <hi>European</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the abſurdity and ſlaviſhneſs of their hierarchies are ſeen and acknowledged; but being incorporated with the ſtate, it is ſcarcely poſſible to get rid of them.</p>
            <p>What can be more ſtriking than the State of <hi>England</hi> in this reſpect?—The ſyſtem of faith and worſhip eſtabliſhed in it was formed above two hundred years ago, when <hi>Europe</hi> was juſt emerging from darkneſs and barbarity. The times have ever ſince been growing more enlightened; but without any effect on the eſtabliſhment. Not a ray of the increaſing light has penetrated it. Not one imperfection, however groſs, has been removed. The ſame articles of faith are ſubſcribed. The ſame ritual of devotion is practiſed.—There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that the <hi>abſolution of the ſick</hi> which forms a part of this ritual, is often reſorted to as a paſſport to heaven after a wicked life; and yet it is continued.—Perhaps nothing more ſhocking to reaſon and humanity ever made a part of a religious ſyſtem than the damning clauſes in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> creed; and yet the obligation of the clergy to declare aſſent to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018739_0039_0FA81C7F201EF620"/>
this creed, and to read it as a part of the public devotion, remains.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary conſequence of ſuch a ſtate of things is, that,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſtianity itſelf is diſgraced, and that all religion comes to be conſidered as a ſtate trick, and a barbarous mummery. It is well known, that in ſome Popiſh countries there are few Chriſtians among the higher ranks of men, the religion of the State being in thoſe countries <hi>miſtaken</hi> for the religion of the Goſpel. This indeed ſhews a criminal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention in thoſe who fall into ſuch a miſtake; for they ought to conſider that Chriſtianity has been grievouſly corrupted, and that their ideas of it ſhould be taken from the New-Teſtament only. It is, however, ſo natural to reckon Chriſtianity to be that which it is held out to be in all the eſtabliſhments of it, that it cannot but happen that ſuch an error will take place and produce ſome of the worſt conſequences.—There is probably a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of rational Chriſtians (that is, of Chriſtians upon enquiry) in <hi>England,</hi> than in all Popiſh countries. The reaſon is, that the religious eſtabliſhment here is Popery <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and that a conſiderable body diſſent from it, and are often inculcating the neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing between the Chriſtianity eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law and that which is taught in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018739_0040_0FA81C7FC7970228"/>
Bible.—Certain it is, that till this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, Chriſtianity can never recover its juſt credit and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>Such then are the effects of civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of religion. May heaven ſoon put an end to them. The world will never be generally wiſe or virtuous or happy, till theſe enemies to its peace and improvement are demoliſhed. Thanks be to God they are giving way before increaſing light. Let them never ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in America. Let no ſuch monſter be known there as HUMAN AUTHORITY IN MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS OF RELIGION. Let every honeſt and peaceable man, whatever is his faith, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected there; and find an effectual defence againſt the attacks of bigotry and intolerance. In the United States may RELIGION flouriſh. They cannot be very great and happy if it does not. But let it be a better religion than moſt of thoſe which have been hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the world. Let it be a religion which enforces moral obligations; not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which relaxes and evades them.—A tolerant and <hi>Catholic</hi> religion; not a rage for proſelitiſm.—A religion of peace and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; not a religion that perſecutes, curſes and damns.—In a word, let it be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Goſpel of peace lifting above the world, warming the heart with the love of God and his creatures, and ſuſtaining the fortitude of good men by the aſſured hope of a future
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018739_0041_0FA81C82A2AB4268"/>
deliverance from death, and an infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the <hi>everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the preceding obſervations it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it is impoſſible I ſhould not admire the following article in the declaration of rights which forms the foundation of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett</hi>'s <q>conſtitution.—In this State every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Chriſtians demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably and as good ſubjects of the commonwealth, ſhall be EQUALLY under the protection of the law; and no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law<note n="*" place="bottom">The NORTH CAROLINA conſtitution alſo orders that there ſhall be no eſtabliſhment of any one religious church or denomination in that place in preference to any other.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is liberal beyond all example.—I ſhould, however, have admired it more had it been MORE liberal, and the words ALL MEN OF ALL RELIGIONS been ſubſtituted for the words <hi>every denomination of Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears farther from the preceding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that I cannot but diſlike the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious teſts which make a part of ſeveral of the <hi>American</hi> conſtitutions.—In the <hi>Maſſachuſett's</hi> conſtitution it is ordered, that all who take ſeats in the Houſe of Repreſentatives or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſhall declare <q>their firm perſuaſion of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018739_0042_0FA81C840296D780"/>
truth of the Chriſtian religion.</q> The ſame is required by the <hi>Maryland</hi> conſtitution, as a condition of being admitted into <hi>any</hi> places of profit or truſt. In <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Repreſentatives is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to declare, that he acknowledges the <q>Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament to be given by divine inſpiration.</q> In the State of <hi>Delaware,</hi> that <q>he believes in God the Father, and in Jeſus Chriſt his only Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt, one God bleſſed forever-more.</q> All this is more than is required even in <hi>England,</hi> where, though every perſon however debauched or atheiſtical is required to receive the ſacrament as a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for <hi>inferior</hi> places, no other religious teſt is impoſed on members of parliament than a declaration againſt Popery.—It is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation no leſs juſt than common, that ſuch teſts exclude only <hi>honeſt</hi> men. The dishoneſt never ſcruple them.</p>
            <p>MONTESQUIEU probably was not a Chriſtian. NEWTON and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </head>
            <p>SUCH is the ſtate of things which I wiſh to take place in the united <hi>American</hi> States. —In order to introduce and perpetuate it, and at the ſame time to give it the greateſt effect on the improvement of the world, nothing is more neceſſary than the eſtabliſhment of a wiſe and liberal plan of EDUCATION. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible properly to repreſent the importance of this. So much is left by the author of nature to depend on the turn given to the mind in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life and the impreſſions then made, that I have often thought there may be a <hi>ſecret</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to be diſcovered in education, which will cauſe future generations to grow up vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and happy, and accelerate human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to a greater degree than can at preſent be imagined.</p>
            <p>The end of education is to direct the powers of the mind in unfolding themſelves; and to aſſiſt them in gaining their juſt bent and force. And, in order to this, its buſineſs ſhould be to teach <hi>how</hi> to think, rather than <hi>what</hi> to think; or to lead into the beſt way of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for truth, rather than to inſtruct in truth itſelf.—As for the latter who is qualified for it? There are many indeed who are eager to undertake this office. All parties and ſects think they have diſcovered truth, and that they alone are its advocates and friends. But the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018739_0044_0FA81C84E3A49E58"/>
very different and inconſiſtent accounts they give of it demonſtrate they are utter ſtrangers to it; and that it is better to teach <hi>nothing,</hi> than to teach what they hold out for truth. The greater their confidence, the greater is the reaſon for diſtruſting them. We gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſee the warmeſt zeal, where the object of it is the greateſt nonſenſe.</p>
            <p>Such obſervations have a particular ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſhew that education ought to be an initiation into candour, rather than into any ſyſtems of faith; and it ſhould form a habit of cool and patient inveſtigation, rather than an attachment to any opinions.</p>
            <p>But hitherto education has been conducted on a contrary plan. It has been a <hi>contraction,</hi> not an <hi>enlargement</hi> of the intellectual faculties; an <hi>injection</hi> of falſe principles hardening them in error, not a <hi>diſcipline</hi> enlightening and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them. Inſtead of opening and ſtrengthening them, and teaching to think <hi>freely;</hi> it hath cramped and enſlaved them, and qualified for thinking only in <hi>one</hi> track. Inſtead of inſtilling humility, charity, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and thus preparing for an eaſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and a readier admiſſion of truth; it has inflated with conceit, and ſtuffed the human mind with wretched prejudices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018739_0045_0FA81C858D4D6540"/>The more has been learnt from <hi>ſuch</hi> edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the more it becomes neceſſary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn. The more has been taught in this way, of ſo much the more muſt the mind be emptied before true wiſdom can enter.—Such was education in the time of the firſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of chriſtianity. By furniſhing with ſkill in the arts of diſputation and ſophiſtry, and producing an attachment to eſtabliſhed ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems, it turned the minds of men from truth, and rendered them more determined to reſiſt evidence, and more capable of evading it. Hence it happened, that this heavenly inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when firſt communicated, was <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and that, in ſpite of <hi>miracles themſelves,</hi> the perſons who rejected it with moſt diſdain, and who oppoſed it with moſt violence, were thoſe who had been educated in colleges, and were beſt verſed in the falſe learning of the times: And had it taught the true philoſophy inſtead of the true religion, the effect would have been the ſame. The doctrine <q>that the ſun ſtood ſtill and that the earth moved round it,</q> would have been reckoned no leſs abſurd and incredible, than the doctrine of a <hi>crucified Meſſiah.</hi> And the men who would have treated ſuch an inſtruction with moſt contempt, would have been the <hi>wiſe and the prudent;</hi> that is, the proud ſophiſts and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doctors of the times, who had ſtudied the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> ſyſtem of the world, and learnt, by
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018739_0046_0FA81C86C2187020"/>
cycles and epicycles, to account for all the motions of the heavenly bodies.</p>
            <p>In like manner, when the improvement of Logick in Mr. LOCKE'S <hi>Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding</hi> was firſt publiſhed in <hi>Britain,</hi> the perſons readieſt to attend to it and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it were thoſe who had never been trained in colleges; and whoſe minds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had never been perverted by an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the jargon of the ſchools. To the deep profeſſors of the time, it appeared (like the doctrine taught in his book on the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of chriſtianity) to be a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous novelty and hereſy; and the Univerſity of OXFORD, in particular, condemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated the author.—The like happened when Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S diſcoveries were firſt publiſhed. A romance (that is, the Philoſophy of DESCARTES) was then in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the philoſophical world. Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had rivetted it in the minds of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it was twenty-ſeven years before NEWTON'S <hi>Principia</hi> could gain ſufficient cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to bring it to a ſecond edition.—Such are the prejudices which have generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt new lights. Such the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been thrown in the way of improvement by a narrow plan of education. —Even now the principal object of education (eſpecially in divinity) is to teach eſtabliſhed ſyſtems as certain truths, and to qualify for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018739_0047_0FA81C8754D55FC0"/>
defending them againſt opponents; and thus to arm the mind againſt convictiOn, and render it impenetrable to farther light. Indeed, were it offered to my opinion which I would have, the plain ſenſe of a common and untutored man, or the deep erudition of the proud ſcholars and profeſſors in moſt univerſities, I ſhould eagerly prefer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, from a perſuaſion that it would leave me at a leſs diſtance from real wiſdom.—An unoccupied and ſimple mind I think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely preferable to a mind warped by ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems; and the entire want of learning better than a learning, ſuch as moſt of that is which hitherto has been ſought and admired—A learning which puffs up, while in reality it is nothing but profounder ignorance and more inveterate prejudice.</p>
            <p>It may be worth adding here, that a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row education (ſhould it ever happen not to produce the evils now mentioned) will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably produce equal evils of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I mean, that there will be danger, when perſons ſo educated come to ſee the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of <hi>ſome</hi> of the opinions in which they have been educated, that they will become prejudiced againſt them <hi>all,</hi> and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, throw them <hi>all</hi> away, and run wild into ſcepticiſm and infidelity.—At preſent, in this part of the world this is a very common event.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:018739_0048_0FA81C87F4ECF340"/>I am by no means qualified to give a juſt account of the particular method in which education ought to be conducted, ſo as to avoid theſe evils: That is, ſo as to render the mind free and unfettered; quick in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning evidence, and prepared to follow it from whatever quarter and in whatever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may offer itſelf. But certain it is, that the beſt mode of education is that which does this moſt effectually; which guards beſt againſt filly prejudices; which inflames moſt with the love of truth; which diſpoſes moſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and fairneſs, and leaves the mind moſt ſenſible of its own need of farmer infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.—Had this been always the aim of education, mankind would now have been farther advanced.—It ſuppoſes, however, an <hi>improved</hi> ſtate of mankind; and when once it has taken place, it will quicken the progreſs of <hi>improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in theſe obſervations expreſſed a diſlike of ſyſtems; but I have meant only to condemn that attachment to them as ſtandards of truth which has been too prevalent. It may be neceſſary in education to make uſe of them; or of books explaining them. But they ſhould be uſed only as guides and helps to enquiry. Inſtruction in them ſhould be attended with a fair exhibition of the evidence on both ſides of every queſtion; and care ſhould be taken to induce, as far as poſſible
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018739_0049_0FA81C889E9475F0"/>
a habit of believing only on an overbalance of evidence; and of proportioning aſſent in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe to the degree of that overbalance, without regarding authority, antiquity, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, novelty, or any of the prejudices which too commonly influence aſſent.— Nothing is ſo well fitted to produce this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit as the ſtudy of <hi>Mathematics.</hi> In theſe ſciences no one ever thinks of giving his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a propoſition till he can clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and ſee it proved by a fair deduction from propoſitions previouſly underſtood and proved. In theſe ſciences the mind is inured to cloſe and patient attention; ſhewn the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of juſt reaſoning; and taught to form diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ideas, and to expect clear evidence in all caſes before belief. They furniſh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the beſt exerciſe for the intellectual powers, and the beſt defence againſt that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and precipitation and confuſion of ideas which are the common ſources of error.</p>
            <p>There is, however, a danger to be avoided here. Mathematical ſtudies may abſorb the attention too much; and when they do, they contract the mind by rendering it incapable of thinking <hi>at large;</hi> by diſqualifying it for judging of any evidence except mathematical; and, conſequently, diſpoſing it to an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſcepticiſm on all ſubjects which admit not of ſuch evidence.—There have been many inſtances of this narrowneſs in mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:018739_0050_0FA81C89654E8598"/>But to return from this digreſſion,—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help obſerving on this occaſion, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to CHRISTIANITY in particular, that education ought to lead to a habit of judging of it as it is in the code itſelf of Chriſtianity; that the doctrines it reveals ſhould be learnt only from a critical and fair enquiry into the ſenſe of this code; and that all inſtruction in it ſhould be a preparation for making this enquiry and a communication of aſſiſtance in examining into the proofs of its divine original, and in determining to what degree of evidence theſe proofs amount, after allowing every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty its juſt weight.—This has never yet been the practice among Chriſtians. The New Teſtament has been reckoned hitherto an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi> ſtandard of Chriſtian Divinity; and, therefore, formularies of human invention, <hi>pretending</hi> to explain and define it (but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity miſrepreſenting and diſhonouring it) have been ſubſtituted in its room; and teaching <hi>theſe</hi> has been called teaching <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And it is very remarkable, that in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities no Lectures on the New-Teſtament are ever read, or even ſuffered to be read; and that, through all Chriſtendom, it is much leſs an object of attention than the <hi>ſyſtems</hi> and <hi>creeds</hi> which have been fathered upon it.</p>
            <p>I will only add on this ſubject, that it is above all things neceſſary, while inſtruction is conveyed, to convey with it a ſenſe of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018739_0051_0FA81C8A757257B0"/>
imbecility of the human mind, and of its great proneneſs to error; and alſo a diſpoſition, even on points which ſeem the moſt clear, to liſten to objections, and to conſider nothing as involving in it our final intereſt but an HONEST HEART.</p>
            <p>Nature has ſo made us, that an attachment muſt take place within us to opinions once formed; and it was proper that we ſhould be ſo made, in order to prevent that levity and deſultorineſs of mind which muſt have been the conſequence had we been ready to give up our opinions too eaſily and haſtily. But this natural tendency, however wiſely given us, is apt to extend its proper limits, and to render us unreaſonably tenacious. It ought, therefore, like all our other natural propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be carefully watched and guarded; and education ſhould put us upon doing this. An obſervation before made ſhould, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, be inculcated, <q>that all mankind have hitherto been moſt tenacious when moſt in the wrong, and reckoned themſelves moſt enlightened when moſt in the dark.</q>—This is, indeed, a very mortifying fact; but attention to it is neceſſary to cure that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride and dogmaticalneſs which are ſome of the worſt enemies to improvement.—Who is there that does not remember the time when he was entirely ſatisfied about points which deeper reflection has ſhewn to be above his comprehenſion? Who, for inſtance, does
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018739_0052_0FA81C8AE453AAD8"/>
not remember a time when he would have wondered at the queſtion, <q>why does water run down hill?</q> What ignorant man is there who is not perſuaded that he underſtands this perfectly? But every <hi>improved</hi> man knows it to be a queſtion he cannot anſwer; and what diſtinguiſhes him in this inſtance from the leſs improved part of mankind is his knowing this. The like is true in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs other inſtances. One of the beſt proofs of wiſdom is a ſenſe of our want of wiſdom; and he who knows moſt poſſeſſes moſt of this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>In thinking of myſelf I derive ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from this reflexion. I now ſee, that I do not underſtand many points which once appeared to me very clear. The more I have enquired, the more ſenſible I have been growing of my own darkneſs; and a part of the hiſtory of my life is that which follows.</p>
            <p>In early life I was ſtruck with Biſhop BUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER'S <hi>Analogy of religion natural and revealed to the conſtitution and courſe of nature.</hi> I reckon it happy for me that this book was one of the firſt that fell into my hands. It taught me the proper mode of reaſoning on moral and religious ſubjects, and particularly the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of paying a duel regard to the imperfection of human knowledge. His ſermons alſo, I then

thought, and do ſtill think, excellent. Next to <hi>his</hi> works, I have always been an admirer of the writings of Dr. CLARK. And I cannot help adding, however ſtrange it may ſeem, that I owe much to the philoſophical writings of Mr. HUME, which I likewiſe ſtudied early in life. Though an enemy to his Scepticiſm, I have profited by it. By attacking, with great ability, every principle of truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he put me upon examining the ground upon which I ſtood, and taught me not haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to take any thing for granted.—The firſt fruits of my reading and ſtudies were laid before the public in a Treatiſe entitled, <hi>A</hi> REVIEW <hi>of the principal Queſtions and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in Morals.</hi> This publication has been followed by many others on various ſubjects.—And now, in the evening of a life devoted to enquiry and ſpent in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (weak indeed and feeble) to ſerve the beſt intereſts, preſent and future, of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I am waiting for the GREAT TEACHER, convinced that the order of nature is perfect; that infinite wiſdom and goodneſs govern all things; and that Chriſtianity comes from God: But at the ſame time puzzled by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties, anxious for more light, and reſting with full and conſtant aſſurance only on this ONE truth—That the practice of virtue is the duty and dignity of man; and, in all events, his wiſeſt and ſafeſt courſe.</p>

            <p>I HAVE obſerved in the introduction to this Addreſs, that the <hi>American</hi> States have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers to ſhun. In what follows I ſhall give a brief recital of ſome of the chief of theſe dangers.</p>
            <p>The danger from an endleſs increaſe of PUBLIC DEBTS has been already ſufficiently noticed.</p>
            <p>Particular notice has been likewiſe taken of the danger from INTERNAL WARS.—Again and again, I would urge the neceſſity of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing every meaſure and uſing every precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which can guard againſt this danger. It will be ſhocking to ſee in the <hi>new</hi> world a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of all the evils which have hitherto laid waſte the <hi>old</hi> world—War raging where peace and liberty were thought to have taken their abodes—The points of bayonets and the mouths of cannon ſettling diſputes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the collected wiſdom of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—and perhaps one reſtleſs and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous State riſing by bloody conqueſts above the reſt, and becoming a <hi>ſovereign</hi> State, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

impiouſly (as <hi>Britain</hi> once did) <q>full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make laws that ſhall bind its ſiſter States in all caſes whatever,</q> and drawing to itſelf all advantages at their expence.—I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate this calamity. I ſhudder when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how poſſible it is; and hope thoſe perſons are miſtaken who think that ſuch are the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies which govern human nature, and ſuch the imperfections of the beſt human arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is not within the reach of any wiſdom to diſcover any effectual means of preventing it; without encroaching too much on the liberty and independence of the States. I have mentioned an enlargement of the powers of CONGRESS.

But it is obvious, that this will be attended with greater inconveniencies, and encroach more on the liberty of the States, than the enlargement I have propoſed of the powers of CONGRESS.—If ſuch a parliament is not to ſuperſede any of the other parliaments, it will be the ſame with CONGRESS as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſtituted.</p>

            <head>Of an <hi>UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a trite obſervation, that <q>dominion is founded on property.</q> Moſt free States have manifeſted their ſenſe of the truth of this obſervation, by ſtudying to find out means of preventing too great an inequality in the diſtribution of property. What tumults were occaſioned at ROME in its beſt times by attempts to carry into execution the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law? Among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the direction of heaven, all eſtates which had been alienated during the courſe of fifty years, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their original owners at the end of that term. One of the circumſtances that has been moſt favourable to the <hi>American</hi> States in forming their new conſtitutions of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been the equality which ſubſiſts among them.</p>
            <p>The happieſt ſtate of man is the middle ſtate between the <hi>ſavage</hi> and the <hi>refined,</hi> or between the wild and the luxurious ſtate. Such is the ſtate of ſociety in CONNECTICUT, and ſome others of the <hi>American</hi> provinces; where the inhabitants conſiſt, if I am rightly informed, of an independent and hardy YEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANRY, all nearly on a level—trained to arms,—inſtructed in their rights—cloathed in home-ſpun—
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018739_0058_0FA81C8FDD5FB2F8"/>
of ſimple manners—ſtrangers to luxury —drawing plenty from the ground—and that plenty, gathered eaſily by the hand of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and giving riſe to early marriages, a numerous progeny, length of days, and a rapid increaſe—the rich and the poor, the haughty grandee and the creeping ſycophant, equally unknown—protected by laws, which (being their own will) cannot oppreſs; and by an equal government, which wanting lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative places, cannot create corrupt canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <note n="*" place="bottom">In this State, and alſo the State of MASSACHUSETTS, NEW-JERSEY, &amp;c. any attempt to canvas, or even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a wiſh to be choſen, will exclude a candidate from a ſeat in the Houſe of Repreſentatives.

May you continue long thus happy; and may the happineſs you enjoy ſpread over the face of the whole earth!—But I am forgetting myſelf. There is danger that a ſtate of ſociety ſo happy will not be of long duration; that ſimplicity and virtue will give way to depravity; that equality will in time be loſt, the curſed luſt of domineering ſhew itſelf, liberty languiſh, and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gradually degenerate into an inſtrument in the hands of the <hi>few</hi> to oppreſs and plunder the <hi>many.</hi>—Such has hitherto been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of evil in human affairs. In order to give them a better turn, ſome great men (<hi>Plato,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> &amp;c.) have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018739_0059_0FA81C907A939718"/>
plans, which, by eſtabliſhing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods and annihilating property, would make it impoſſible for any one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a State to think of enſlaving the reſt, or to conſider himſelf as having any intereſt diſtinct from that of his fellow-citizens. Such theories are in ſpeculation pleaſing; nor perhaps are they wholly impracticable. Some approaches to them may hereafter be made; and ſchemes of government may take place, which ſhall leave ſo little, beſides perſonal merit, to be a means of diſtinction, as to exclude from ſociety moſt of the cauſes of evil. But be this as it will; it is out of doubt that there is an equality in ſociety which is eſſential to liberty and which every State that would continue virtuous and happy ought as far as poſſible to maintain.—It is not in my power to deſcribe the beſt method of doing this.—I will only obſerve, that there are THREE enemies to equality againſt which <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> ought to guard.</p>

Perſons thus diſtinguiſhed, though perhaps meaner than the meaneſt of their dependents, are apt to conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as belonging to a higher order of beings, and <hi>made</hi> for power and government.

Let there be honour to encourage merit; but let them die with the men who have earned them. Let them not deſcend to poſterity to foſter a ſpirit of domination, and to produce a proud and tyrannical ariſtocracy.—In a word, let the United States continue for ever what it is now their glory to be—a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of States proſperous and happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out LORDS—without BISHOPS<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>I muſt add, that by what is here ſaid I do not mean to expreſs a <hi>general</hi> preference of a <hi>republican</hi> conſtitution of government. There is a degree of political degeneracy which unfits for ſuch a conſtitution. BRITAIN, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, conſiſts too much of the high and the low, (of <hi>ſcum</hi> and <hi>dregs</hi>) to admit of it. Nor will it ſuit <hi>America,</hi> ſhould it ever become equally corrupt.</p>
               </note>—and without KINGS.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The right of primogeniture. The tendency of this to produce an improper inequality is very obvious. The diſpoſition to raiſe a name, by accumulating property in one branch of a family, is a vanity no leſs

unjuſt and cruel, than dangerous to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of liberty; and no wiſe State will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or tolerate it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; FOREIGN TRADE is another of the enemies againſt which I wiſh to caution the united States. But this operates unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to a State in ſo many more ways than by deſtroying that equality which is the baſis of liberty, that it will be proper to take more particular notice of it.</p>

            </head>
            <p>FOREIGN trade has, in ſome reſpects, the moſt uſeful tendency. By creating an intercourſe between diſtant kingdoms, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends benevolence, removes local prejudices, leads every man to conſider himſelf more as a citizen of the world than of any particular State, and, conſequently, checks the exceſſes of that <hi>Love of our Country</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The love of our country is then only a noble paſſion when it engages us to promote the <hi>internal</hi> happineſs of our country, and to defend its rights and liberties againſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and foreign invaſion, maintaining at the ſame time an equal regard to the rights and liberties of other countries. But this has not been its moſt common effects. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it has in general been nothing but a ſpirit of rivalſhip between different communities, producing contention and a thirſt for conqueſt and dominion.—What is his <hi>country</hi> to a <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp;c. but a ſpot where he enjoys no rights, and is diſpoſed of by owners as if he was a beaſt? And what is his <hi>love</hi> to his country but an attachment to degradation and ſlavery?—What was the love of their country among the <hi>Jews</hi> but a wretched partiality for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and a proud contempt for other nations? Among the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo what was it, however great in many of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, but a principle holding together a band of robbers in their attempts to cruſh all liberty but their own?—Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity has wiſely omitted to recommend this principle. Had it done this, it would have countenanced a vice among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—It has done what is infinitely better—It has recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE.</note> which has been
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018739_0062_0FA81C92732988C0"/>
applauded as one of the nobleſt, but which, <hi>really,</hi> is one of the moſt <hi>deſtructive</hi> principles in human nature.—Trade alſo, by enabling every country to draw from other countries conveniences and advantages which it cannot find within itſelf, produces among nations a ſenſe of mutual dependence, and promotes the general improvement.—But there is no part of mankind to which theſe uſes of trade are of leſs conſequence than the <hi>American</hi> States. They are ſpread over a great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and make a world within themſelves. The country they inhabit includes ſoils and climates of all ſorts, producing not only eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but every <hi>convenience</hi> of life. And the vaſt rivers and wide-ſpread lakes which interſect it, create ſuch an inland communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between its different parts, as is unknown in any other region of the earth. They poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs then within themſelves the beſt means of the moſt profitable <hi>internal</hi> traffic, and the ampleſt ſcope for it. Why ſhould they look
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018739_0063_0FA81C932A20CE28"/>
much farther? What occaſion can they have for being anxious about puſhing <hi>foreign</hi> trade; or even about raiſing a great naval force?— Britain, indeed, conſiſting as it does of <hi>unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> inhabitants, and threatened as it is by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and powerful neighbours, cannot hope to maintain its exiſtence long after becoming open to invaſion by loſing its naval ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—But this is not the caſe with the American States. They have no powerful neighbours to dread. The vaſt Atlantic muſt be croſſed before they can be attacked. They are all a well-trained <hi>militia;</hi> and the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſiſtance which, in their infancy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a naval force, they have made to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the firſt <hi>European</hi> power, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably diſcourage and prevent all future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions. Thus ſingularly happy, why ſhould they ſeek connexions with <hi>Europe,</hi> and expoſe themſelves to the danger of being involved in its quarrels?—What have they to do with its politics?—Is there any thing very important to them which they can draw from thence—except INFECTION?— Indeed, I tremble when I think of that rage for trade which is likely to prevail among them. It may do them infinite miſchief. All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſpreading ſnares for them, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a dangerous intercourſe. Their beſt intereſt requires them to guard themſelves by all proper means; and, particularly, by laying heavy duties on importations, But in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018739_0064_0FA81C93D94E5520"/>
no caſe will any means ſucceed unleſs aided by MANNERS. In this inſtance, particularly, there is reaſon to fear that an increaſing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for foreign ſrippery will render all the beſt regulations ineffectual. And ſhould this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that ſimplicity of character, that manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, that diſdain of tinſel in which true dignity conſiſts, will diſappear. Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, ſervility and venality will enter; and liberty and virtue be ſwallowed up in the gulph of corruption. Such may be the courſe of events in the American States. Better <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely</hi> will it be for them to conſiſt of bodies of plain and honeſt farmers, rather than opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſplendid merchants.—Where in theſe States do the pureſt manners prevail? Where do the inhabitants live moſt on an equality, and moſt at their eaſe? Is it not in thoſe inland parts where agriculture gives health and plenty, and trade is ſcarcely known? —Where, on the contrary, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants moſt ſelfiſh, luxurious, looſe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and at the ſame time moſt unhappy? Is it not along the ſea coaſts, and in the great towns, where trade flouriſhes and merchants abound?—So ſtriking is the effect of theſe different ſituations on the vigour and happineſs of human life, that in the one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation would languiſh did it receive no aid from emigrations; while in the other it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes to a degree ſcarcely ever before known.</p>

               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:018739_0065_0FA81C94EA9277D0"/>But to proceed to ſome obſervations of a different nature—</p>
            <p>The United States have, I think, particular reaſon to dread the following effects of foreign trade.</p>
            <p>By increaſing importation to feed luxury and gratify prodigality, it will carry out their coin, and occaſion the ſubſtitution of a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive paper currency; the conſequence of which will be, that <hi>ideal</hi> wealth will take place of <hi>real,</hi> and their ſecurity come to depend (as the ſecurity of BRITAIN does) on the ſtrength and duration of a <hi>Bubble.</hi>—I am very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that paper credit is one of the greateſt of all conveniences; but this makes it likewiſe one of the greateſt of all temptations. A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Bank, (while it can circulate its bills) faciliates commerce, and aſſiſts the exertions of a State in proportion to its credit. But when it is not carefully reſtricted and watched; when its emiſſions exceed the coin it can command, and are carried near the utmoſt length that the confidence of the public will allow; and when, in conſequence of this, its permanence comes to depend on the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of public credulity—In theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a BANK, though it may for a time (that is, while a balance of trade too unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able does not occaſion a run, and no events ariſe which produce alarms) anſwer all the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018739_0066_0FA81C9577E63610"/>
ends of a MINE from which millions may be drawn in a minute; and by filling a kingdom with caſh, render it capable of ſuſtaining <hi>any</hi> debts, and give it a kind of OMNIPOTENCE.— In ſuch circumſtances, I ſay, notwithſtanding theſe temporary advantages, a public BANK muſt <hi>at loſt</hi> prove a great calamity; and a kingdom ſo ſupported, at the very time of its greateſt exertions, will be only ſtriving more violently to increaſe the horror of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convulſion.</p>
            <p>The United States have already verified ſome of theſe obſervations, and felt in ſome degree the conſequences to which I have allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. They have been carried through the war by an emiſſion of paper which had no ſolid ſupport, and which now has loſt all value. It is indeed ſurpriſing that, being ſecured on no fund and incapable of being exchanged for coin, it ſhould ever have obtained a currency, or anſwered any important purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Unhappily for <hi>Britain,</hi> it has uſed the means of giving more ſtability to its paper-credit, and been enabled by it to ſupport expences greater than any that have been yet known, and to contract a debt which now <hi>aſtoniſhes,</hi> and may hereafter produce a cataſtrophe that will <hi>terrify</hi> the world.—A longer duration of the late war would have brought on this cataſtrophe immediately.

            <p>OATHS are expedients to which all States have had recourſe in order to obtain true information and aſcertain facts by ſecuring the veracity of witneſſes. But I know not how to reliſh that <hi>imprecation</hi> which always makes a part of an oath. Perhaps, there is no ſuch neceſſity for it as is commonly imagined. An AFFIRMATION ſolemnly made, with laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting ſevere penalties on falſhood when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, would probably anſwer all the ends of oaths.—I am, therefore, diſpoſed to wiſh, that in the United States <hi>imprecatory</hi> oaths may be aboliſhed, and the ſame indulgence in this reſpect granted to all which is now granted to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But I am afraid they will think this too dangerous an experiment; and what is of moſt conſequence is to avoid,</p>

            <p>THE NEGRO TRADE cannot be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in language too ſevere. It is a traffick which, as it has been hitherto carried on, is ſhocking to humanity, cruel, wicked, and diabolical. I am happy to find that the United States are entering into meaſures for diſcountenancing it, and for aboliſhing the odious ſlavery which it has introduced. 'Till they have done this, it will not appear they deſerve the liberty for which they have been contending. For it is ſelf-evident, that if there are any men whom they have a right to hold in ſlavery, there may be <hi>others</hi> who have had a right to hold <hi>them</hi> in ſlavery.—I am ſenſible, however, that this is a work which they cannot accompliſh at once.

            <p>SUCH is the advice which I would <hi>humbly</hi> (but <hi>earneſtly</hi>) offer to the United States of <hi>America.</hi>—Such are the means by which they may become the ſeats of liberty, ſcience, peace, and virtue; happy within themſelves, and a refuge to the world.</p>

            <p>MR. FRANKLIN has in your name, Sir, put into my hand the new edition of your obſervations upon civil liberty, &amp;c. I am under double obligations to you: In the firſt place for your work, of which I long ſince knew the value, and which I had read with avidity, notwithſtanding the multiplied oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018739_0072_0FA81C9CE3C6EB98"/>
by which I was beſieged, when it firſt appeared in print; and in the next place for your civility in ſuppreſſing that imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my want of addreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">What is here ſaid refers to an account of M. <hi>Turgot</hi>'s adminiſtration in the <hi>ſecond</hi> tract on <hi>Civil Liberty and the War with America,</hi> p. 150, &amp;c. In the firſt edition of this tract I had mentioned improperly his <hi>want of addreſs</hi> among the other cauſes of his diſmiſſion from power. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a letter from him to inform me of the true reaſons of his diſmiſſion, and begun that correſpondence of which this letter is a part, and which continued till his death.</note> which you had mixed with the praiſe otherwiſe given to me in your additional obſervations. I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, if you had not in view any other want of addreſs than my inability to diſcover the ſprings of intrigue which played off againſt me a ſet of men much more adroit in that ſcience than I am, than I ever ſhall be or than I wiſh to be. But it appeared that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me the indiſcretion of having flown in the face of the general opinion of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there, I think, you neither did juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to me nor to my nation, which is much more enlightened than is generally ſuppoſed amongſt you, and in which perhaps it is eaſier than even with you to call the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ideas of reaſon. I judge ſo from the infatuation of the Britiſh in the proſpect of conquering America, which continued until the adventure of Burgoyne made them in ſome degree open their eyes. I judge ſo from the ſyſtem of monopoly and excluſion which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all your political writers upon commerce,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:018739_0073_0FA81C9DA45DEBD8"/>
except Mr. Adam Smith and Dean Tucker,—a ſyſtem which is the true prime cauſe of your ſeperation from your colonies. I judge ſo from all your polemic writings upon queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been agitated for 20 years back, and in which, before your's appeared, I do not recollect to have read a ſingle piece where the true point in diſpute has been right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up. I have been unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a nation which hath cultivated ſo ſucceſsfully every branch of the natural ſciences can have continued ſo greatly beneath herſelf in the moſt intereſting ſcience in the whole—that of the public good; a ſcience wherein the liberty of the preſs, which ſhe alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, muſt have given her a mighty advantage over all the reſt of Europe. Is it national pride which hath hindred you from making the utmoſt of that advantage? Is it becauſe you were ſomething better off than others, that you have turned all your ſpeculations towards perſuading yourſelves that you were quite happy? Is it the ſpirit of party and the wiſh to form ſelf-ſupport out of popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which hath retarded your progreſs, by leading your politicians to treat as empty<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Burk's letter to the Sheriffs of Briſtol.</note> metaphyſicks all thoſe ſpeculations which tend to eſtabliſh ſome fixed principles reſpecting the rights and true intereſts of individuals and of nations? How comes it to paſs that you are almoſt the firſt among your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018739_0074_0FA81C9E68947D20"/>
who have given juſt notions of liberty, and who have expoſed the falſehood of that thread-bear ſentiment of the greateſt claſs of even the moſt republican writers, <hi>that liberty conſiſts in being ſubject only to laws,</hi> as if a man oppreſſed by an unjuſt law, was free? That is would not be true even if we ſuppoſe all the laws to be work of the entire nation aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; becauſe, in fact, the individual has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rights which the nation cannot take from him but by violence and an illegal uſe of the general force. Although you have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this truth, and have explained your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereon, yet perhaps it merits your care to develope it more at large, conſidering the little attention which hath been paid to it by even the moſt zealous partizans of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>It is alſo a ſtrange thing that it ſhould not be counted, in England, a trifling obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay, that one nation can never have right to govern another; and that ſuch a government could have no foundation but that of force, upon which alſo are ſupported robbery and tyranny; that the tyranny of a people is of all known in the world the moſt cruel and moſt intolerable, leaving no remedy for the oppreſſed; whereas a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle deſpot is at length ſtopped in his career by ſelf-intereſt, he has the check of remorſe, or that of public opinion; but a multitude makes no calculations, feels no remorſe, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018739_0075_0FA81C9F68FEEF20"/>
decrees to itſelf glory when in fact it deſerves the utmoſt diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Events are to the Engliſh nation a terrible commentary upon your book. For ſome months they have been falling headlong with accelerated rapidity. The knot is untied in regard to America. Lo ſhe is independent irrecoverably! Will ſhe be free and happy? Will this new people, ſituated ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to give to the world the example of a conſtitution wherein man may enjoy all his rights, exerciſe freely his whole faculties and be governed only by nature, by reaſon, and by juſtice, know how to form ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? know how to fix it upon everlaſting foundations, by guarding againſt all the cauſes of diviſion and corruption which would ſap it by degrees and overturn it?</p>
            <p>I am not ſatisfied, I own, with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions which have as yet been framed by the different American States. You blame with reaſon that of Pennſylvania for exacting a religious teſt upon admiſſion into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body. It is much worſe in others. There is one of them, I think that of the Jerſies which requires <note n="(†)" place="bottom">It is the conſtitution of DELAWARE that impoſes the teſt here meant. That of the JERSIES, with a noble libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, orders that there ſhall never in that province be any eſtabliſhment of any one religious ſect in preference to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that all Proteſtants of all perſuaſions ſhall enjoy equal rights and privileges.</note> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. I ſee in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018739_0076_0FA81C9FE9C67D10"/>
an unreaſonable imitation of the uſages of England. Inſtead of bringing all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities into one, that of the nation, they have eſtabliſhed different bodies, a Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, a Council, a Governor, becauſe England has an Houſe of Commons an Houſe of Lords and a King. They undertake to balance theſe different authorities as if the ſame equilibrium of powers which has been thought neceſſary to balance the enormous preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of royalty could be of any uſe in repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, formed upon the equality of all the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and as if every article which conſtitutes different bodies was not a ſource of diviſions. By ſtriving to prevent imaginary dangers they have created real ones. They wiſh to have nothing to fear from the clergy, and yet unite them under the barrier of a common proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By rendering them ineligible they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formed into a body and ſuch an one as is foreign to the State. Why ſhould one citizen who has the ſame intereſt as others in the common defence of liberty and property be excluded from contributing towards it his genius and virtues, becauſe he is of a profeſſion in which genius and virtue are eſſentials? The clergy are only dangerous when they compoſe a body in the State; when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to have rights and intereſts as a body; or when it has been deviſed to have a religion eſtabliſhed by law; as if men could have any right, or any intereſt in regulating each other's conſciences; as if an individual
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018739_0077_0FA81CA0A9458570"/>
could ſacrifice to civil ſociety thoſe opinions on which he thinks his eternal ſalvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, or as if mankind were to be ſaved or to be damned by the lump. Wherever true toleration, that is to ſay, the abſolute incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of government over the conſcience of individuals is eſtabliſhed, there an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic when he is admitted into the national aſſembly is but a citizen, when he is excluded from it he becomes again an eccleſiaſtic.</p>
            <p>I do not perceive that there has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to reduce to the loweſt poſſible number the kinds of buſineſs which the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of each State is to manage; or to ſeperate the objects of legiſlation from thoſe of the general and from thoſe of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and local adminiſtration; to conſtitute ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding local aſſemblies, which, by performing all the functions of detail in government, may free the general aſſemblies from engaging therein, and ſo take from the members of theſe latter all means and perhaps all deſire, to abuſe an authority which ſhould only be occupied about objects general in their nature, and therefore unconnected with the little paſſions which agitate mankind.</p>
            <p>Nor do I perceive that due attention has been paid to the great diſtinction, and the only one founded in nature between two claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men; I mean thoſe who are proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in lands and thoſe who are not;—to their
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018739_0078_0FA81CA15A8F9B38"/>
intereſts and conſequently to their different rights, with reſpect to legiſlation, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice and of the police, to the contribution for public expences and to their employments.</p>
            <p>No fixed principle is eſtabliſhed in regard to impoſts. Each State is ſuppoſed to be at liberty to tax itſelf at pleaſure, and to lay its taxes upon perſons, conſumptions, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that is to ſay, to erect an intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the other States.</p>
            <p>They ſuppoſe in all the States that they have a right to regulate commerce. They even authorize the executive bodies or the governors to prohibit the exportation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain products upon particular occaſions; ſo far are they from ſeeing that the law of intire liberty of all commerce is a corollary of the right of property; ſo far are they ſtill invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the miſts of European illuſions.</p>
            <p>In the general union of the States with one another, I do not ſee a coalition, a melting of all the parts together, ſo as to make the body <hi>one</hi> and homogenious. It is only an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of parts, always too ſeperate, and which have a continual tendency to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from the diverſity of their laws, their manners, and their opinions; from the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of their preſent ſtrength, but more ſtill from the inequality of their future progreſs. It is only a copy of the republic of Holland; and this
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018739_0079_0FA81CA22440CAD0"/>
had no occaſion like that of America to dread the poſſible growth of any one of its provinces. This whole edifice has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported until now upon the falſe baſis of very ancient and very vulgar policy; upon the prejudice which nations, which provinces may have concerning intereſts as a province or a nation, different from thoſe which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals have of being free and defending their properties againſt robbers and conquerors: —a pretended intereſt in carrying on more commerce than others, in not buying mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of foreigners, but in forcing theſe to conſume our productions and the works of our manufacturers:—a pretended intereſt in having more extenſive territory, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſuch and ſuch a province, ſuch and ſuch an iſland, ſuch and ſuch a town—an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in inſpiring other nations with dread:—an intereſt in excelling them in the glory of arms or that of arts and ſciences.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe prejudices is cheriſhed in Europe, becauſe the ancient rivalry of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the ambition of princes obliges all States to be in arms for defence againſt their armed neighbours, and to regard a military force as the principal object of government. Such is the good fortune of America that ſhe cannot have for a long time an external enemy to fear, if ſhe does not become ſelf-divided; therefore ſhe may and ought to eſtimate, at their true value, thoſe pretended intereſts, thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018739_0080_0FA81CA3545B6530"/>
grounds of diſcord which are all that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger her liberty. The ſacred principle of freedom of commerce being conſidered as the neceſſary conſequence of the right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, all the pretended intereſts of trade vaniſh before it. The pretended intereſt of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more or leſs territory vaniſhes alſo when the territory is juſtly conſidered as not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to nations but to the individual proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the ſoil; and when the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a canton or ſuch a village ought to belong to ſuch a province or ſuch a ſtate is not decided by the pretended intereſt of that province or that ſtate, but by the intereſt which the inhabitants of the canton or village have in aſſembling themſelves to tranſact their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in places the moſt convenient of acceſs; when that intereſt, being meaſured by the length or ſhortneſs of the way which a man can go to manage his moſt important without too much injury to his common concerns, becomes the natural and phyſical meaſure of the extent of the juriſdiction of States, and eſtabliſhes, throughout, an equilibrium<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſeems to be a particular of much conſequence. The great inequality now exiſting, and which is likely to increaſe, between the different States, is a very unfavourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the embaraſſment and danger to which it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the union ought to be guarded againſt as far as poſſible in laying out future States.</note> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and power which annihilates all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of inequality and all pretentions of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:018739_0081_0FA81CA3DBE69BD0"/>The intereſt of being dreaded becomes null when we make no <hi>demands,</hi> and when we are in a ſituation not to be attacked even by a conſiderable force with any hope of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The glory of arms cannot compare with the felicity of living in peace. The glory of arts and ſciences belongs to every one who has ſpirit to acquire it. There is an harveſt of this kind abundantly ſufficient for every body; the field of diſcoveries cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled, and ALL profit by the diſcoveries of ALL.</p>
            <p>I imagine that the Americans have not felt theſe truths ſo ſtrongly as they ought to be felt by them for the ſecurity of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their poſterity. I blame not their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. There was a neceſſity of providing againſt the exigencies of the moment by ſome ſort of union, againſt an enemy actually preſent and formidable; there was not time to correct the defects in conſtitutions or in the models of the different States. But there ſhould be a dread of perpetuating them, and an application to the means of uniting opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intereſts, and of reducing them to uniform principles throughout all the States.</p>
            <p>In this purſuit there are great obſtacles to be overcome.</p>
            <p>In Canada—the conſtitution of the Romiſh
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018739_0082_0FA81CA4C76D90C8"/>
clergy and the exiſtence of a body of nobleſſe.</p>
            <p>In New-England—a ſpirit of rigid puritaniſm ſtill ſubſiſting, and always, as is ſaid, in ſome degree intolerant.<note n="*" place="bottom">This has been ONCE true of the inhabitants of NEW-ENGLAND, but it is not ſo NOW. See p. 41.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In Pennſylvania—a great number of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens who ſupporting a religious principle that the profeſſion of arms is illicit, of courſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from ſuch arrangements as are neceſſary to lay the foundation of a military ſtrength for the State, in an union of the quality of citizen with that of ſoldier and militia-man; which brings on a neceſſity of making the buſineſs of war a buſineſs for mercenaries.</p>
            <p>In the middle States—a too great inequality of fortunes and more eſpecially the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of black ſlaves whoſe ſlavery is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with a good political conſtitution, and who, even if ſet at liberty, would ſtill give em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment by forming two people in one State.</p>
            <p>Throughout—prejudices, an attachment to eſtabliſhed forms, an habitude of certain tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, a dread of ſuch as ſhould be ſubſtituted in their place, the vanity of thoſe States who have thought themſelves the moſt powerful, and an unhappy beginning of national pride.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:018739_0083_0FA81CA5385831C0"/>I think the Americans are bound to agran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe themſelves not by war but by cultivation. If they leave at their backs thoſe immenſe deſerts which extend even to the weſtern ocean, a mixture of the baniſhed and other vile ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects eſcaped from the correction of laws may there ſettle with the Savages, and compoſe ſwarms of robbers, who would ravage America as the Barbarians of the North have ravaged the Roman empire; hence another danger,—the neceſſity of being in arms on the frontiers and living in a continual ſtate of war. The ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements near to theſe would conſequently be more warlike than the reſt: and that inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of military force would be a terrible ſpur to ambition. The remedy for this inequality would be to maintain a ſtanding force to which all the States ſhould contribute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their population; but, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans who have ſtill all the fears which the Engliſh ought to have, dread nothing more than a permanent army. They are in the wrong. Nothing is eaſier than to connect the conſtitution of a permanent army with the militia, ſo that the militia may thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better, and liberty thus be rendered more ſecure. But it is far from eaſy to calm their fears on this head.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee are many difficulties; and, perhaps, the ſecret intereſts of powerful indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals will unite with the prejudices of the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018739_0084_0FA81CA5D1F467B0"/>
vulgar to reſiſt the efforts of true ſages and true citizens.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to refrain from fervent wiſhes that this people may arrive at all the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which it is ſuſceptible. It is the hope of the human race. It may become their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. It ſhould prove to the world in fact that men may be free and tranquil, and may rid themſelves from the many ſhackles which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and impoſtures of every garb have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to impoſe on them, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the public good. It ſhould give an example of political freedom, of religious freedom, of the freedom of commerce and of induſtry. The aſylum which it opens to all the oppreſſed of all nations, ought to conſole the whole earth. The facility of taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this to get free from the effects of bad governments will oblige ſuch governments to grow juſt and enlightned; and the reſt of the world will by degrees open their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that bubble of illuſions wherein politicians have lulled themſelves. But, for this Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ought to become guarantee, and that ſhe will never come to be what your miniſterial writers have ſo often repeated, an image of our Europe, an amas of divided powers, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling about territories or the profits of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and continually cementing the ſlavery of the people with their own blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:018739_0085_0FA81CA69039A7F0"/>All men of underſtanding, all the friends humanity ſhould at this time unite their knowledge and join their reflections to thoſe of the ſage Americans to contribute the great work of their legiſlation. This, Sir, would be worthy of you. I wiſh I may kindle up your zeal: And, if in this letter I have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to be hurried on by my own ideas further than was proper, that wiſh hath been my only motive, and will, as I hope, excuſe me where I may have been tedious to you. I am deſirous that the blood which hath flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or which may it ſtill flow in this quarrel, ſhould not be uſeleſs towards the happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>Our two nations are about to do each other much injury, though neither of them will from thence reap any real profit. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of debts and expences * * * * * * * * * * * * *, and the ruin of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of citizens will perhaps be the only reſult. England appears to me to be nearer to it than France. If, inſtead of this war, you had been able to behave with a good grace from the very beginning; if policy had been allowed to do before hand what ſhe will infallibly be forced to do in the end; if the national opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion could have been brought to allow your government to prevent what has happened, ſuppoſing it to have been foreſeen, if it
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018739_0086_0FA81CA7599AF650"/>
could have conſented out-right to the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of America, without making war upon any one, I firmly believe that Britain would have loſt nothing by the change. Now ſhe will loſe whatever ſhe has expended, or ſhall yet expend: She will experience a great diminution for ſome time in her commerce, and great internal confuſion, if ſhe is forced into a bankruptcy; and, be that as it may, a great loſs of political influence abroad.</p>
            <p>But this laſt article is of very ſmall import to the real happineſs of a people; and I am not at all of Abbe Rainal's opinion in your motto. I do not think that this will bring you to be a contemptible people and throw you into bondage.</p>
            <p>Your misfortunes will perhaps on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, produce the effect of a neceſſary ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They may be the only means of ſaving you from the gangreene of luxury and corruption. If in your agitations you could correct your conſtitution by making elections annual, by diſtributing the right of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation more equally and in better proportion to the intereſts of thoſe repreſented, you would gain perhaps as much as America by this revolution; becauſe your liberty would remain to you, and your other loſſes would ſoon be repaired with that, and by that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:018739_0087_0FA81CA84C38A980"/>You ſhould judge, Sir, from the frankneſs with which I open myſelf to you upon theſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate points, of the eſteem with which you have inſpired me, and of the ſatisfaction which I feel upon obſerving that there is ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in our modes of thinking. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe myſelf that this confidence will reſt with you only. I even beg you not to anſwer me at large by the poſt, becauſe your letter would be infallibly opened in our offices: and they would diſcover me to be far too much a friend to liberty for a miniſter, even for a miniſter in diſgrace.</p>
