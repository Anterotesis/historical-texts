            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no way in which what is amiable can be better recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, than by holding up to view ſome eminent and unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable example in it's kind. We are formed for imitation, and find within ourſelves an aptitude to reſemble thoſe we live among, and are converſant with. While our propenſities are on the ſide of vice, as they will be until they are rectified by divine grace, we ſhall be more inclined to copy after a vicious, than a virtuous character; but this notwithſtanding, few are corrupt to ſo great a degree as to be incapable of perceiving the beauty of virtue, or of being put upon endeavours to become poſſeſſed of it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſet in an agreable light by the luſtre of ſome excelling example.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011206_0004_0F862C30C0A033B8"/>Hence it is that the ſacred penmen have taken care to exhibit to public view the character of one and another, under the ſeveral diſpenſations of the kingdom of God's grace, who were eminently holy in their day; ſtrongly recommending to univerſal obſervation theſe patterns of virtue, that ſuch as are acquainted with them may be influenced to copy after them, to the honor of God, and the ſecurity of their own eternal well-being.</p>
            <p>My text preſents to the chriſtian Jews ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of faith and patience, as they had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with; and exhorts to an imitation of them: Eſpecially, as it was through theſe graces, that they went to the enjoyment of the promiſed heavenly inheritance. "Be ye followers of them, who, through faith and patience, inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes". In which words three particulars are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which it may not be unprofitable, or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, to ſpend a few thoughts upon.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. An intimation of the happineſs of departed ſaints.</item>
               <item>II. The deſcribed and ſpecified way, through which they came to this happineſs. And,</item>
               <item>III. A recommendation of their example to our ſpecial notice.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt thing obſervable in the text is, an intimation of the bleſſedneſs of departed ſaints. It is ſaid of them, they "inherit the promiſes"; that is, the happineſs "promiſed" to be enjoyed in the future world. And what deſerves a particular remark, they are ſpoken of as NOW in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011206_0005_0F862C3172CAE630"/>
of this happineſs. "Who inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes". The words are a periphraſis, expreſſive of the bleſſedneſs they are actually the ſubjects of in their <hi>unbodied</hi> ſtate. Not that the ſpirits of juſt men are in a ſtate of compleat happineſs. This will not commence, until the great day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is over, when they ſhall aſcend, in body as well as ſoul, with their Redeemer, to the heavenly world, and be fixed in thoſe "manſions" of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is "gone before to prepare for them". But previous to this, and inſtantly upon their death, they will enter upon a ſtate of happineſs; a ſtate ſuted to them as naked ſpirits; a ſtate wherein they ſhall be perfectly freed from all ſin, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſorrow; and in which they ſhall enjoy the bleſſed God, far beyond what they ever did, or could do, while here on earth.</p>
            <p>This truth, however uncertain from the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of meer reaſon, ſeems plainly evident from what is ſaid upon it in the revealed word of God. It does not indeed, in a formal manner, ſpeak of the ſpirits of good chriſtians in their ſeparate ſtate, particularly deſcribing their happineſs there; but it ſays that concerning them, in ſo many places, and in language ſo poſitively clear and expreſs, as to leave it beyond all reaſonable doubt, that they ſtill live, and that they live happy.</p>
            <p>In the parable, recorded in the 16th chapter of Luke, Lazarus is ſpoken of as received, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at his death, to joy in the inviſible world. So the account is, ver. 22. "And it came o paſs, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's boſom". And, in the 25th ver. it is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011206_0006_0F862C31AB92B578"/>
ſaid, though he had here received "evil things", yet that he was "now comforted". What can theſe words intend, if his ſpirit was not in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of happineſs? This ſeems to be one of the main thoughts, our Lord had in view to convey to us.</p>
            <p>Very pertinent alſo to our purpoſe are thoſe words of our Savior, Luke 23.43. "Verily, I ſay unto thee, TO DAY ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe". They contain a promiſe to a poor dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malefactor, which would have no meaning, if it did not aſſure him, that, inſtantly upon his death, he ſhould be admitted to a place of happineſs; for that is the ſcripture idea of the word, "paradiſe". And what our Lord here promiſed to this thief, he promiſes alſo to all, who like him, are ſincerely penitent. They alſo ſhall "be with him in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe", upon their leaving this world. The day of their death will be to them a day of bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>I may alſo bring to view thoſe words of the Apoſtle, Philip. 1.21. "For me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain". But how could death have been "gain" to him, if he did not thereupon enter into a world in which he ſhould be happy? He adds, in the 23d ver. "for I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better". He here ſpeaks of his "departure by death", as his "going to be with Chriſt", and ſo as that it would be "far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter" for him, than to "abide in the fleſh". But could there be a poſſibility of this, unleſs it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that there is a happy ſtate, in which his ſoul would exiſt, after it's ſeparation from his body?
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011206_0007_0F862C328DBC1530"/>
And why ſhould he be "in a ſtrait", not knowing whether it was his "deſire to depart, or abide" here, if his departure would not have placed him, as to his ſpirit, in a better ſtate than that he was in at preſent?</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add one text more, which deſerves a more than ordinary notice; as it is introduced with all imaginable ſolemnity, as it were on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to engage our attention. It is thus recorded, Rev. 14.13. "And I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying unto me; write, bleſſed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, faith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labors, and their works do follow them". It is obſervable, they are dead ſaints that are the ſubjects of this bleſſedneſs; they are "from henceforth", from the day of their death, made thus bleſſed; and the ſpecial reaſon why they are thus bleſſed, is ſignified by no leſs a perſon than the Spirit of God. "Yea, ſaith the ſpirit", for that "they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and their works do follow them", that is, the reward of their works; which would be impoſſible, unleſs, at death, they went into a ſtate, in which they were favored with the enjoyment of the bleſſed God, the ſupreme good?</p>
            <p>How ſhould this truth, we have been illuſtrating, ſupport and comfort ſuch as have been bereaved of relatives, friends, or acquaintance, who were, in the eye of hope, the true diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. You have no reaſon to mourn on their account. For, though their bodies may be laid in the dark and ſilent grave, they are ſtill alive in regard of their ſouls, and incomparably more happy than
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011206_0008_0F862C3328C3E5D8"/>
they could have been, had they ſtill continued here. Should not the tho't of this, compoſe your minds to ſilence, however deſirable thoſe taken from you may have been, however bright their virtues, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever amiable their converſation in the world? The higher they had attained in grace here, the greater is their reward in the ſtate beyond the grave.—</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, ſuch as are the faithful ſervants of God, have abundant reaſon to be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the thought of dying themſelves. If, at death, the ſoul as well as body lay down ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inactive, it would be no wonder, if, when they turned their view to the grave, ſhuddering horror was excited in their breaſts; though they knew, that, at the general reſurrection, they ſhould be again brought to life to be made happy forever. Death would appear, to the good man, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy gloomy form, if it ſtripped him of all ſenſe and life in ſoul, as well as body; and he might well be averſe to paſs through ſo dull an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. But the truth is, his better and ſuperior part, the ſpirit God has formed within him, liveth, and abideth forever. His ſoul does not, like his body, lie down ſtupid; but is "carried, by the angels of God, to Abraham's boſom", where it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts happy in the enjoyment of that good, which is laid up in the divine promiſes. And, as this is the reſult of death to the true believer in Jeſus, why ſhould he be afraid to die? He ſhould rather "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to depart, that he may be with Chriſt", where he will ſin no more, nor be any more ſubjected to the tryals, and ſorrows, that are inſeperable from this preſent, frail, mortal ſtate. —But I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011206_0009_0F862C33E3E3AEE0"/>II. Second thing contained in my next, which is, the way through which the ſaints come to "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſes"; namely, that of "faith and patience". This is the way marked out in the "Goſpel of the bleſſed God".</p>
            <p>Without "faith", no chriſtian was ever yet ſaved; nor will any one, in future time, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the joy of his Lord. Our Savior, who ſurely knew the way to heaven, has plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it is through "faith" in him. You are all acquainted with the texts to this purpoſe. Only, it ſhould ever be remembered, this faith is not an empty ſpeculation. It is not an inactive, dead faith; but a faith that "works by love", that "purifies the heart", and argues the ſubject of it to be one "born of God", and an "over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer of the world". It is that faith, by which "the juſt do live", and that is an abiding, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, powerful principle of all holy conformity to the will of God, both in heart and life, in a way of ſuffering as well as doing.</p>
            <p>And as it is "through faith", ſo is it likewiſe "through patience", that the ſaints "inherit the promiſes". Hence that exhortation of the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.1. "Let us run with patience the race ſet before us". The way to the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is rough. It is ſtrawed with difficulties of one kind, and another. And thoſe who would walk in this way, had need be armed with "pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence". They will often have occaſion for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this grace; nor can they, unleſs they are, in a meaſure, the ſubjects of it, ever make progreſs towards the heavenly ſtate. None have ever gone
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011206_0010_0F862C35CB513398"/>
to "inherit the promiſes", but through tryals, and ſo many of them, as that, if they had not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with "patience", they would have given out. This grace in them has been often called forth to exerciſe; and, in this way, they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to happineſs in the future ſtate.</p>
            <p>But it may more emphatically be ſaid, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome of the ſaints, that, "through faith and patience", they are gone to "inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes".</p>
            <p>It was in this way that many of the firſt chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians glorified God, and went to the enjoyment of him. The tryals and ſufferings they were called to endure for the name of Chriſt, were many, and grievouſly heavy. They had "the tryal of cruel mockings and ſcourgings; yea, of bonds and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment". They were "ſawn aſunder; and ſlain with the ſword". They were "deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented". And, under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of diſtreſs, how did they rely on God! What full credit did they give to his word and promiſes! How chearfully did they reſign up, even their very lives into his hands! And how exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary was their "patience"? They made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the conduct of heaven: They did not murmur, or repine; but bore all that was laid upon them, with compoſedneſs of mind. They were willing to ſuffer in the cauſe of Chriſt; and "counted not their lives dear to them, ſo that they might finiſh their courſe with joy".</p>
            <p>And as it was with the firſt chriſtians, ſo it has been with many ſince, and with ſome even in theſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011206_0011_0F862C371ACD09C8"/>
days; they went to the "inheritance" eminently "through faith and patience". God's hand was laid heavy upon them. Many, various, and ſadly grievous were the tryals it pleaſed the alwiſe, and righteous Governor of the world to exerciſe them with. And, when diſtreſſed on every ſide, how bright did the graces of "faith and patience" ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them! They "ſet their hope in God".— They reſted their ſouls on his promiſes.—And the more ſharp and cutting their ſorrows, the more firm was their faith in the revelations of God, the more vigorous the actings of it. And, in ſtead of "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the will", or "diſputing the pleaſure" of the almighty, they juſtified the wiſdom of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, and "patiently" received correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the hand of their heavenly father. Their greateſt concern was, leſt they ſhould reflect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor on the name and religion of Chriſt, by a temper and behavior, unbecoming their character as his diſciples; and, by the aids of divine grace, they were enabled to bear their tryals, however ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, with meekneſs of wiſdom, a calm, patient, and ſubmiſſive frame of mind. And in this way it was, that they went to "inherit the promiſes".</p>
            <p>We ſhould herefrom learn to entertain juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the tryals good men are often called, in the providence of God, to conflict with. It is by theſe occaſion is given, and opportunity offered, for thoſe diſcoveries of faith, patience, and other chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian graces, whereby God is, in a ſignal manner, glorified, and his tried ſervants prepared for more diſtinguiſhed manſions in the place of future bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Perhaps, there is no ſuch ſchool to train up, and perfect the chriſtian, as that of affliction.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011206_0012_0F862C37ABCCB908"/>
Thoſe who have been called to paſs through the heavieſt, and moſt numerous tryals, have, by their improvements under them, being aſſiſted herein by the divine Spirit, been enabled to ſhine with a peculiar luſtre, to the honor of Chriſt; and their reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon has been "great in heaven". Let not any eſteem good men unhappy, though they ſhould be ſorely afflicted: Neither ſhould they think thus of themſelves. "If they ſuffer with Chriſt", in the exerciſe of faith and patience, in imitation of him, they ſhall be "glorified with him". And "what are the ſufferings of this preſent life", when "compared with the glory", which ſhall, in the next ſtate, be "revealed in thoſe who are the ſons of God"? They are not worthy to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—They are lighter than nothing. But I may not enlarge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The next thing obſervable in my next is, an exhortation to follow thoſe, who, "through faith and patience, inherit the promiſes".</p>
            <p>We ſhould be imitators of them in every thing, wherein they appeared amiable and lovely. Have we beheld, in departed ſaints, any thing worthy of God, and of their character as the diſciples of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt? We ſhould not reſt ſatisfied in having ſeen theſe things; but ſhould carefully place their example before our view, and copy after it, wherein it was praiſe-worthy. It is a favor of God, to have had ſuch patterns of virtue, and his expectation that we make a wiſe and good uſe of ſuch an advantage: Nor can we, without ſin, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch examples to paſs our notice; expreſſing little or no care to be imitators of them. We ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011206_0013_0F862C387272B7F8"/>
employ our thoughts on the virtues and graces, ſaints departed exhibited, in their lives, learn therefrom our own duty, and encourage ourſelves heartily to engage in the practice of it. We ſhould make uſe of their good examples, both as a <hi>copy,</hi> and a <hi>motive:</hi> Only keeping in mind this needful thought, that the beſt of men are but men, and to be imitated with ſubſerviency to the great rule of duty contained in the ſacred books of ſcripture. Their virtues, and not their frailties and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are to be remembered and followed by us. We ſhould be "followers of them, wherein they followed Chriſt"; and no farther.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould endeavour an imitation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſaints, eſpecially in their "faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence". Theſe are amiable, as well as important graces; beautifying to the ſubjects of them, and nearly connected with their higheſt intereſt in the coming world. It will therefore conduce to our own honor, and beſt good, to become poſſeſſed of them; and that we may ſo do, we cannot be too careful to copy after the pattern ſet us by thoſe, who, as occaſions were offered therefor in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of providence, have ſignaliſed themſelves for the exerciſe of theſe graces.</p>
            <p>Have any, within the reach of our notice, been, in an uncommon degree, exemplary for the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſtancy, and vigor of their "faith" in the perfections, and revelations of God; ever repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as the ſupreme object of their truſt, the ultimate refuge of their ſouls, in thoſe lively act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of "faith", which we could not but admire? We ſhould not be forgetful obſervers of ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011206_0014_0F862C39508C57E8"/>
faith in God, and in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; but ſhould keep it ſteadily in our view, that we alſo, under the influence of heaven, may become eminent inſtances of "like precious faith".</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, if we have had opportunity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the "patience" of thoſe, whoſe lot it has been to paſs through numerous difficulties, and ſore tryals; if we have ſeen them, under the heavieſt preſſures, calm, quiet, reſigned to God, and in a temper of mind, not to murmur and complain, but to acknowledge, and ſay, "I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou haſt afflicted me";—we ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ourſelves as inſtructed by God, and laid under obligations, ſhould there be opportunity for it, to be like examples ourſelves of this grace, which has been thus gloriouſly diſplayed in the conduct of others.</p>
            <p>One deſign of God, in placing before our view theſe inſtances of "faith and patience" is, that we might learn our duty, and be animated with zeal and reſolution to put it in practice. It ſhould be our earneſt endeavour to anſwer this intention of heaven; taking all due care, that ſuch examples of God's grace may not, by our own non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or miſ-improvement, of them, riſe up in judgment to our ſhame and condemnation.</p>
            <p>The reflections, upon what has been diſcourſed, are as follow.</p>
            <p>We ſhould, while we admire and imitate what we have ſeen, that is amiable in departed good chriſtians, give God the glory of his grace beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011206_0015_0F862C3AD24B51B0"/>
on them. Whatever we may have ſeen in them, that was lovely and beautiful, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to God for it. He it was that made them to differ. While therefore we take notice of what was virtuous and praiſe-worthy in them, we ſhould remember to acknowledge God. We ſhould look through them to him, and be diſpoſed to give him the honor of that grace which appeared in them.</p>
            <p>We ſhould alſo take occaſion, from the good example of other, to humble ourſelves wherein we have been unexemplary, and endeavour a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We cannot make a wiſer and better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the piety, the humility, the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the faith, the patience, and other chriſtian graces, we may have ſeen manifeſted in the lives of thoſe we have been acquainted with, than by turning our view to ourſelves, and enquiring, with a becoming ſeriouſneſs, how we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world. And wherein we are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that, which we could not but approve as exemplarily excellent in thoſe that are gone before us, we ſhould be abaſed in a ſenſe of our own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent careleſſneſs; condemning ourſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, in the ſtrength of God, that we will take better heed to our ways for the time to come. If we have been greatly deficient in any of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces, in which they ſhined with peculiar brightneſs, we ſhould look upon ourſelves as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and warned of God; and be inſtant, and arduous, in our endeavours to cauſe our light to ſhine with the like luſtre.—And if, in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only defective in their graces, we are defiled with the contrary vices, we ſhould ſee ourſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and ſolemnly called upon to repent and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011206_0016_0F862C3B8B327868"/>
reform. Can we think of that grace of God, which eminently appeared in this, or the other relative, or friend, or neighbour, or miniſter, that is gone to "inherit the promiſes", and not feel the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an accuſing conſcience? We have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly awful reaſon to judge, and condemn our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. May we receive reproof, learn our folly, be ſtruck with the beauties of holineſs in theſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of it, and copy after them, ſo as to exceed them in glory!</p>
            <p>In fine, we are obviouſly taught, from what has been diſcourſed, our duty with reſpect to departed ſaints. We ſhould not pray for them, neither ſhould we pray to them. Such prayers, however common in the Roman church, are both needleſs and ſenſeleſs. But we ſhould remember the grace of God, which appeared in their faith, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their holy, heavenly, and chriſtian behavior in life; and be excited herefrom to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diligence, in the uſe of all proper means, that we alſo may attain to a noble eminency in very thing that is virtuous.</p>
            <p>This leads me to take ſome ſpecial notice of the occaſion which put me upon bringing you ſuch a diſcourſe at this time, the death of the Reverend Dr. SEWALL; who was juſtly held in high reputation, throughout the town, and land, for thoſe excellent qualities, in which he ſhone with exemplary brightneſs, both as a chriſtian, and a miniſter, from a youth to protracted old age.</p>
            <p>The father of Spirits was pleaſed to furniſh him with valuable intellectual powers. Theſe, by the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011206_0017_0F862C3CDB482950"/>
advantage of a good education, were happily cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and improved; and, being ſanctified by divine grace, were faithfully employed in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the intereſt of "pure and undefiled religion".</p>
            <p>He was early devoted to the ſervice of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary by his father, that upright CHIEF JUSTICE, the honorable Judge SEWALL, who, for a long courſe of years, was a member of this Church, and one of it's greateſt ornaments. And to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, from inclination, he freely devoted himſelf.</p>
            <p>He was called by you of this Church to the work of the Goſpel-miniſtry, the 25th of April, 1712; but he returned no anſwer to your call, until he had often aſked direction of God; ſetting apart ſome ſpecial ſeaſons for this purpoſe by himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and once at leaſt in union with his venerable, pious father, who was ever ready to the buſineſs of prayer, and took great delight in it.</p>
            <p>He was publicly and ſolemnly ſeperated to the work, to which you had called him, "by faſting, and prayer, and laying on of the hands of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery", the 16th of September, 1713; from which time, he labored in the Goſpel-miniſtry, among you, with as little intermiſſion, by reaſon of thoſe infirmities to which we are all ſubject, as has been ordinarily known. Few miniſters ever enjoyed a more uninterrupted ſtate of health, going on with more ſteady conſtancy in his public labors for the Lord.</p>
            <p>His diſcourſes from the pulpit were chiefly upon the diſtinguiſhing, and moſt important points of chriſtianity, relative both to faith &amp; practice. They
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011206_0018_0F862C3CE749C510"/>
were the effect of ſtudy; compoſures diſcovering judgment, and an intimate acquaintance with the holy ſcriptures. His manner in delivering them was ſerious, grave, ſolemn; and ſometimes he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf with a voice ſo elevated with zeal, and ſo modulated under the influence of a deeply affected heart, as that he arreſted the attention of his hearers; putting them under advantage to be impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of the importance of what he was ſaying to them. The bleſſed Jeſus, in fulfillment of his promiſe, made to the Apoſtles, and ſucceeding goſpel-miniſters, was graciouſly preſent with him, to enliven his faith, to comfort his heart, and to ſtrengthen his hands in going on with reſolute, diligent, and perſevering fidelity in diſcharging the great truſt it had pleaſed God to commit to him; and his labors, thro' the bleſſing of heaven, were not in vain: Some, we truſt, were by him, as the inſtrument in the hands of Chriſt, "turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſin and ſatan unto God"; while others, who had been walking "in the path of the juſt", were enabled to walk on "ſhining more and more" until they arrived at "perfect day". It is not to be doubted, but that, upon his entrance into the inviſible world, he became aſſociated with thoſe, among other "ſpirits of juſt men made perfect", who were formed by his miniſtry, under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the holy Ghoſt, for their admiſſion to ſuch bleſſed company, beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>He was in converſation agreably pleaſant; and the more ſo, as his affability was ever mixed with a becoming gravity. He ſeldom failed of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing diſcourſe that tended to ſpiritual edification.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011206_0019_0F862C3DA44195F0"/>
This was more eſpecially his manner in the latter part of his life. I queſtion, whether he allowed himſelf to go out of company without dropping ſomething of the religious kind; and he did it ſo naturally, without any appearance of affectation, that he left a teſtimony in the hearts of all, to the greatneſs of his piety.</p>
            <p>This indeed was eminently his glory. He was "a dovout man, one that feared God, and prayed alway". I find, in his private papers, the record of numerous days ſet apart for ſolemn prayer, often with faſting, moſtly by himſelf alone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in union with others; at which times, you, the people of his charge, were particularly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered before the throne of mercy. He had upon his mind an habitually prevailing ſenſe of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending government of God, both in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of providence, and of grace; and he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ever repaired to him as the alone all-ſufficient help. And this was eſpecially his practice under the various tryals he was called to paſs through, ſome of which were grievouſly heavy, and gave opportunity, as well as occaſion, for the ſignal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that "faith and patience through which" he is gone to "inherit the promiſes". His whole conduct indeed was a bright pattern of thoſe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian graces, which, being ſo often thrown out into act, became in him the governing principles of life. You of this Society are "witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblamably he behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed" among you. "Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, (decent, comely) whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011206_0020_0F862C3F538B0188"/>
things are of good report":—Theſe were the things in which he was an example to you, and to the whole town; who are all ready to riſe up, and ſpeak of him as one they venerated for his conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous piety, uprightneſs, and univerſal goodneſs.</p>
            <p>His conſcience, from his youthful days, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably tender. This made him, all along in life, watchful over his heart, and ways; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his care to "abſtain from even the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil". The life of no one was more freed from the defilements of ſin. He was, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree, "blameleſs and harmleſs; a ſon of God without rebuke in the midſt of a perverſe generation, among whom he ſhined". Poſſibly, he might be ſcrupulous to an exceſs. And if he was herefrom reſtrained, at any time, from thoſe exertions which would have tended to good, it ought to be aſcribed to that "awe of God", which was habitually and powerfully preſent in his mind. Whenever duty lay clearly open to his view, he acted with vigor and boldneſs; as being influenced from that love of God, which overpowered the fear of man.</p>
            <p>He was diſtinguiſhed among the Clergy for his wiſdom, not "the wiſdom of this world", to which he was an utter ſtranger; but "the wiſdom that is from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, without partiality, and without hypocriſie". I know of no man that diſcovered more prudent caution, through his whole behavior in life. He ever acted, eſpecially in affairs of importance, with deliberation, and upon having viewed them in their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011206_0021_0F862C3FEE1F01C0"/>
circumſtances, and probable conſequences. No one, I believe, can mention an inſtance wherein he conducted with precipitant raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of the many good qualities in which he excelled, he was, ſo long ago as the year 1724, upon the death of Preſident Leverett, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, in his room, to take the head ſhip of Harvard-College, in Cambridge. Upon the news of this, which, as his own words are, was "ſurpriſing to him", I find him making that pious reflection, "O Lord! what am I, a ſinful worm, that there ſhould be any tho't of me for ſo conſiderable a truſt"! This choice of him to ſo important a ſervice, lay with great weight upon his mind, partly from his own modeſt diffidence, but principally from the ardor of his affection towards you of this Church and congregation. He often carried the caſe to God in humble earneſt prayer, and more than once ſet apart a day for ſolemn application to him who dwelleth on high for direction in an affair of ſuch conſequence. On one of theſe days, he writes thus; "I beſought the Lord to give all needed direction to the overſeers, the flock I ſtand related to, and to my ſelf. I alſo endeavoured to examine myſelf;—and, if I know my own heart, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is to abide with my dear people, and to ſpend and be ſpent in the work of the miniſtry here, if this be the will of God, and moſt for his glory. I think I can truly ſay, that no proſpect of greater worldly honor, or gain, would prevail with me to leave this people; and that I do not account my life too dear to be ſpent in the ſervice of Chriſt among them". You, the people of his charge, expreſſed a like affection towards him, in
<pb n="24"
                   facs="unknown:011206_0022_0F862C40AC81D450"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
your voted unwillingneſs to part with him. Upon which, your beloved Paſtor, having again aſked the direction of heaven, thus writes; "I ſuppoſe that now God makes my way plain to give an anſwer in the negative, which I accordingly did"; adding that wiſh of piety, "Lord! provide a more ſutable and ſufficient perſon for that important truſt".</p>
            <p>About four years after this, he was elected a member of the College-corporation; which truſt he accepted, and executed with conſciencious fidelity, and a becoming zeal to promote, among the ſons of HARVARD, not only learning in the liberal arts and ſciences, but religion alſo both in it's <hi>doctrinal</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> purity. He ſuſtained this office, approving himſelf a ſteady faithful friend to the trueſt intereſt of the College, until it became inconvenient, by reaſon of his age, to attend the neceſſary ſervices of it any longer. He was more than once generouſly handſome in his donations to this Society.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Belcher returned from England, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of this Province, he brought for him the honor of a Diaploma from the famous univerſity at Edinburgh, in Scotland, conſtituting him a Doctor in Divinity. This honor was conferred on him without his ſeeking it, or indeed ſo much as knowing any thing relative to it, until it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him.</p>
            <p>He was, for many years, one of the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners from the London-Corporation for propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel in New-England, and parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011206_0023_0F862C4168989400"/>
as alſo a correſpondent-member of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in Scotland, for promoting chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And as his duty, in theſe truſts, reſpected the intereſt of Chriſt among the INDIAN natives, a more ſutable perſon could not have been ſelected, and commiſſioned. His heart was ſtrongly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pity towards theſe periſhing barbarous people; and, from a deep ſenſe of their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, through ignorance of the true God, and the only Savior, Jeſus Chriſt, he was ever diſpoſed to do whatever lay in his power, in execution of the truſt that had been committed to him, to ſerve the intereſt of their ſouls, according to the Goſpel-plan of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It would be a great omiſſion, if I did not make mention of him as one of thoſe "good men, for whom one would even dare to die". He was, in his temper, pitiful, tender-hearted, courteous, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affectioned; and, from principle as a chriſtian, he "forgat not to do good, and communicate", as he had opportunity, and according to his ability. It was his practice to lay by one full tenth of his income for the uſes of piety and charity. And ſometimes, as occaſions in providence called for it, he went even beyond this. Many are gone to heaven, and many ſtill live on the earth, who were often relieved, under ſtraits and neceſſities, by the diſtributions of his bounty. I doubt not, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will ſay to him, in the great day of judgment, "I was, in my myſtical body, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, and thou gaveſt me meat; I was thirſty, and thou gaveſt me drink; naked, and thou clothedſt me: I was ſick, and thou viſitedſt me; I was in priſon, and thou cameſt unto me:" In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011206_0024_0F862C422D7373C8"/>
of which, we may hope, he will beſpeak him in thoſe words of abounding grace, "come thou bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee from the foundation of the world."</p>
            <p>He was a ſtrenuous aſſerter of our civil and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical CHARTER-RIGHTS and PRIVILEDGES. He knew the value of them.—He knew they were the purchaſe of our fore-fathers at the expence of much labor, blood, and treaſure.—He could not bear the thought of their being wreſted out of our hands.—He eſteemed it our duty, in all wiſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and legal ways, to endeavour the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them.—And it was the earneſt wiſh of his heart, that they might be fully enjoyed by us, and tranſmitted from us, in the fulleſt extent, to the lateſt generations.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 26th of laſt Auguſt, the day on which he compleated FOURSCORE YEARS, he ſpake to you from this deſk, with affectionate gratitude to God upon ſuch an extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſo as to endeavour your ſpiritual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He was not permitted, after this, to preach to you more than three or four times. It ſeemed good to the wiſdom of God to confine him ſeveral months to his chamber; in which time he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to diſpenſe, to the many who went to viſit him, thoſe counſels and inſtructions of piety, which, if it be not their own fault, may be of laſting ſpiritual advantage to them. And occaſion alſo was now offered him, in the providence of God, by the repeated attacks that were made upon his naturally firm, but now breaking, conſtitution, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary exerciſe of faith, patience, and thoſe other
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011206_0025_0F862C42EC83D408"/>
virtues, which adorned his character as a chriſtian, and goſpel-miniſter, and reflected honor on his maſter and Lord, whoſe grace, beſtowed on him, now ſhone with conſpicuous luſtre. It was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to behold the peaceful, placid, reſigned, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame he was in. He could, while life remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any conſiderable degree of ſtrength, ſpeak of dying with a cheerful countenance, and as one that "had a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better than to abide in the fleſh". I have ſometimes heard him, with a ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging pathos, expreſs himſelf in theſe words, "Come Lord Jeſus! come quickly"! His fear was, leſt he ſhould not wait with due chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, until his change ſhould come. For ſome hours before his deceaſe, he was unable to ſpeak; though he appeared to have the exerciſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: And, doubtleſs, he breathed out his ſoul, "calling upon God", and ſaying, in ſome ſuch language as that, "Lord Jeſus, receive my ſpirit"! Which, we truſt, he graciouſly did; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy angels, thoſe "miniſtring ſpirits, who miniſter to them who are heirs of ſalvation", to convoy it ſafe to that apartment of the inviſible world, which is the aſſigned place of reſidence for "the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect".</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no apology for having ſaid ſo much to do honor to the memory of Dr SEWALL: Had I ſaid leſs, it would have needed one. Such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſhining virtue, and eminent uſefulneſs, are highly inſtructive, and ſhould be held up to the view of the world; eſpecially in this day of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degeneracy. It would be unſutably to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that, which would happily tend to promote
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011206_0026_0F862C43CE5F1B90"/>
the honor of God, and the good of mankind, if no juſt notice ſhould be taken of thoſe, who have ſo worthily ſerved God, and their generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will.</p>
            <p>It may have moved the paſſions of thoſe nearly related to the deceaſed, while attending to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that has been given of him; but if they weep, it ſhould be for themſelves, not for him; as they have ſuch abundant reaſon to believe, that he has "entered into the joy of his Lord". May they be enabled to make a wiſe and holy uſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in the alwiſe providence of God!</p>
            <p>We unite in our prayers for the only ſon, and immediate deſcendant from him whoſe death we are ſolemniſing. Be thankful to God for the ſignal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you enjoyed in having ſo good a father, and in having him continued a bleſſing to you for ſo protracted a ſpace of time. His prayers for you, eſpecially for your ſpiritual welfare, were frequent and earneſt. He ſcarce ever ſet apart a day for prayer, which was a common thing with him, but you are mentioned by name, in his records, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a ſpecial ſhare in his ſupplications before the throne of grace. May they be anſwered in the beſtowment of all needed favors on you, eſpecially of ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings thro' Jeſus Chriſt! Your children are, ſome of them, in childhood, others in their youthful days. It would be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of joy to their grand-parent, even in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, could he know that they are "found walking in the truth, as they have received a commandment from the father". And could he ſpeak to them from the excellent glory, as he often did while here on
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011206_0027_0F862C44655294A8"/>
earth, it would be in ſome ſuch language as that, "remember now your Creator in the days of your childhood and youth;—know ye the God of your fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: If ye ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forſake him, he will caſt you off forever". Let me, who was your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's friend, and relative, be permitted, in his ſtead, now he is gone, to exhort you, my children, in your earlieſt days, to devote yourſelves to the honor of your maker, through Jeſus Chriſt the redeemer; taking him to be your inſtructor, guide, God, and everlaſting portion. This will be your beſt guard againſt the temptations of an evil world; this will yield you moſt ſatisfaction all along in life; this will be your ſupport and comfort in the day of death; and this, of the rich mercy of God, through Jeſus Chriſt, will ſecure your eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in the ſtate that is beyond the grave. The good Lord impreſs your young and tender minds with a deep ſenſe of theſe things, which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely important!</p>
            <p>It may be eſteemed a frown in providence, that the ELISHA of this chriſtian Society ſhould not be preſent to ſee their ELIJAH taken away, and to aſſiſt them in making a ſanctified improvement of ſuch a viſitation. Had he been here, he might with propriety have "cried, my father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof"! Nor could he have made a better adapted prayer for himſelf than that, "let a double portion of thy ſpirit reſt upon me"! May it pleaſe the Savior of his people to help him under his infirmities, to proſper his long journey for the removal of them,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011206_0028_0F862C45CF808180"/>
and to return him to his flock with a reſtored, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſtate of health, and to continue him for many years yet to come an eminently pious, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, faithful, and uſeful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, after the example of his departed father, and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in the Goſpel-miniſtry! We cannot wiſh for him a greater bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The death we are taking a religious notice of, is a loud call to the town in general, and to it's miniſters in particular; and the louder, as it was preceeded, the week before, with the death of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of it's moſt ancient and valuable laborers in the work of the Goſpel. The like was never known, from the firſt ſettlement of the town, until now. Such reiterated diſpenſations, in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy government of heaven, deſerve a more than ordinary attention. The voice of God, eſpecially to the miniſters here, is that, "be ye alſo ready";—"work the work of him that ſent you, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work". May they "to day hear his voice, and not harden their hearts"! This voice from God more eſpecially ſpeaks to thoſe among us who are advanced in years. We are told by it, that we ſhall "ſhortly put off theſe our tabernacles". The Lord impreſs our hearts with a juſt ſenſe of this ſerious and important truth! And may we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from be powerfully guarded againſt being "neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to put" the people of our reſpective charges "in remembrance" of the great truths of God and religion; and equally excited, "as long as we are in theſe tabernacles, to ſtir them up" by calling their attention to theſe things, which are infinitely intereſting and important! And may we ſo "take
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011206_0029_0F862C46348B3F88"/>
need to ourſelves, and to our doctrine as to ſave both ourſelves, and them that hear us"!</p>
            <p>Permit me now to leave a few ſeaſonable words with the flock of Chriſt in this place; which, if received in love, and duly deliberated on, may, by the bleſſing of God, be profitable to you.</p>
            <p>Be thankful to the great "head over all things to the church, which is his body", for the rich gift you received from him, when he gave you your now deceaſed paſtor.—Take a becoming notice of the uncommon kindneſs of heaven in continuing him to you, with ſo little interruption in his work, for ſo long a period as nearly fifty ſix years.— Conſider his death as brought about, as to it's manner, and in all it's circumſtances, under the ſuper-intending agency of that glorious Sovereign, "whoſe throne is in the heavens, and whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all"; and give him the honor of a profound ſubmiſſion to his alwiſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Enquire each one of you, what effect the meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, God was pleaſed to ſend you by this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, have had upon you. Some of you, it may be, have been awakened to attend to the concerns of your ſouls.—Do not reſt ſatisfied, until you have ſo gone to Chriſt, as to be in a ſtate of ſafety, reſpecting the eternal world! Some of you, it may be, have been ſavingly converted to God;—while you aſcribe to him the glory of his rich grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in your minds a becoming affection for the inſtrument uſed in the conveyance of it. Some of you, it may be, have been ſupported and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ſpiritual fears and temptations, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011206_0030_0F862C4789F42438"/>
diſtreſſing difficulties, while others have been encouraged, and ſtrengthened to go on with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſpeed, reſolution and vigor, in the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heavenly kingdom;—you will never forget him, who, under God, has been ſo great a bleſſing to you. His name, with you, will be as "precious ointment". Some of you, it may be, have turned a deaf ear to die many warnings he has ſolemnly given you, from this deſk, in the name of the Lord; "ſetting at nought all his counſels", and practically throwing contempt upon his reproofs: You have abundant reaſon for deep humiliation before God. Let me urge you to ariſe out of your ſleep in ſin, and to call on God, if perhaps he may grant you repentantce and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. This only will ſave you from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>In a word, you ſhould all frequently call to mind the great truths pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, which you have had ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly delivered to you. "I beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and exhort you, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that, as ye have received" of your deceaſed paſtor "how ye ought to walk, ſo ye would abound more and more". Be not "led away with the error of the wicked"—"fall not from your ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs; but "give all diligence to add to your faith every other chriſtian grace". For "if theſe things be in you, and abound, ye ſhall never fall; but entrance ſhall be miniſtred to you abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior Jeſus Chriſt".</p>
            <p>You are, by reaſon of the preſent diſtance of your ſurviving paſtor, as ſheep without a ſhepherd.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011206_0031_0F862C4823B15440"/>
May it pleaſe "the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls" to keep you from "going aſtray", to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your union in love, to direct your ſteps, and govern your whole conduct, in your preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſo as that your ſpiritual advantage may thereby be promoted in the end!</p>
            <p>I ſhall not think it impertinent, becauſe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, to ſay here, though out of place, that Dr. SEWALL, after he had been excuſed, at his own repeated deſire, on account of the infirmities of age, from taking his turn at the THURSDAY-LECTURE, was prevailed on to preach it once more, when he thought it his duty to bear his laſt, and, as it were, dying teſtimony againſt the ſhameful neglect with which this religious opportunity was treated; at the ſame time, offering that which was powerfully adapted to awaken a concern in all ſerious minds to improve this ſpecial ſeaſon for their ſpiritual good, as they might eaſily do it, in much greater numbers, without damage to their ſecular buſineſs. The pious and well-judged ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs he was enabled to make, upon this occaſion, had a temporary good effect. The lecture was obſervably better attended;—but there ſoon came on a relapſe into that ſame careleſſneſs, which he had reproved, and endeavoured to guard againſt. Surely, our churches here have loſt their firſt love to God's worſhip, and zeal to improve ſutable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for their edification in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! And they ſhould "remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their firſt works". That prayer was never more pertinent, than at this day; "revive thy work, O Lord", in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining churches! And ſhould it pleaſe God to do
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011206_0032_0F862C4BF9865950"/>
this, I may venture to ſay, without pretending to the ſpirit of prophecy, that there will not then be ſo thin, and ſcandalous an appearance at our FIFTH-DAY-LECTURE.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, as occaſion is given us, in the government of providence, to adopt the language of ſcripture, and ſay, "our fathers where are they? and the prophets do they live for ever"? We ſhould be in the exerciſe of faith in the only living God, with whom is "the reſidue of the Spirit"; truſting that he will raiſe up, qualifie, and ſend forth, a ſucceſſion of thoſe, who ſhall ſupport his cauſe, and ſhine more conſpicuouſly in his Church, than any who have gone before.</p>
            <p>Now "to him who only hath immortality"; who is "the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever"; who is "God over all from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting":—To him be given all glory and honor, dominion and bleſſing, by all creatures in heaven and earth, throughout the endleſs ages of Eternity. AMEN AND AMEN.</p>

            <p>ON Tueſday Evening laſt died the Reverend JOSEPH SEWALL, D. D. ſenior Paſtor of the South Church in this Town, in the 81ſt Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>Dr. SEWALL's deſcent was honourable—His Father<note n="*" place="bottom">The Hon. SAMUEL SEWALL, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> was elected a Magiſtrate of the Maſſachuſetts Colony 1684, was afterwards appointed one of the firſt Council under the preſent Charter, and was annually elected until 1725, when he reſigned his Seat at the Council-Board— He was alſo many years Chief Juſtice of the Province and Judge of Probates for the County of Suffolk, and was one of the moſt eminent Perſons of his day for piety, learning, wiſdom, integrity and univerſal charity.</p>
            <p>The Son was every way worthy of ſuch an excellent Father. Scarce any one ever paſſed through life with a more unblemiſhed character, or performed its various duties with more univerſal eſteem.</p>
            <p>He who formeth the ſpirit of man within him, was pleaſed to favour him with valuable intellectual endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; theſe were rendered more bright and uſeful by his literary acompliſhments—He particuarly excelled as a claſſic ſcholar; and retained his claſſical learning to an uncommon degree in his advanced years— But the gifts of nature and all his acquired learning were eclipſed by his exalted piety and exemplary virtue.</p>
            <p>He was under the influence of religion from his early days. While but a youth, there was ſuch an uncommon ſeriouſneſs and ſtrict regularity in his whole walk, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the notice of all his acquaintance, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpect even from thoſe who were ſuperior to him in age.—Tho' his family was among the firſt in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, both for dignity and eſtate, he aimed at nothing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011206_0034_0F862C4D8E5E5C28"/>
higher than to ſerve God in the miniſtry of his Son.— Divinity was always his favourite ſtudy, not ſo much from duty as inclination. The ſubject ſuted his taſte, as it led him to a more intimate acquaintance with God, and tended to improve his mind in piety and holineſs.</p>
            <p>The South Church no ſooner had a taſte of his gifts, than they invited him to take part of the miniſtry with that great and good man the late Rev. Mr. PEMBERTON. He was ordained over them Sept. 16, 1713, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt conſtantly to carry on the work of the miniſtry till the laſt year of his life.</p>
            <p>From his childhood he knew the holy ſcriptures, his acquaintance with them encreaſed as he grew in years— He could recite them with an exactneſs to which few have attained, and knew how to explain and apply them with readineſs and propriety, both in public and in private. "From theſe he extracted his Divinity; from theſe, the maxims of his conduct; and by theſe, was made wiſe to ſalvation"</p>
            <p>His preaching was ſolid, ſcriptural, inſtructive and pathetic—He had a clear and diſtinct apprehenſion of the truths of religion, and well underſtood the analogy of faith—He did not entertain his hearers with the ſubtleties of the ſchools, or with curious and unprofitable ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—His chief care was to explain and enforce the great articles of the chriſtian faith and evangelical rules of life; to teach what we muſt believe, and how we muſt live, in order to be eternally happy— He was in principle a Calviniſt, and made the doctrines, which are uſually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doctrines of Grace, the foundation, and the chief ſubjects of his preaching; but he was far from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extremes to which ſome have carried theſe doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines. While he was ſolicitous to ſecure the honor of divine grace, he was equally careful to ſhow the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of holy obedience, and earneſtly preſſed on unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners the importance of their improving the means of grace, if they had any deſire to obtain an intereſt in Chriſt, and to become his ſincere diſciples. He convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſentiments in eaſy, chaſte language; and delivered himſelf with that becoming gravity, and ſeriouſneſs, that commanding elocution and decent affection, as almoſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011206_0035_0F862C4E27A2DDA8"/>
neceſſarily engaged the attention of the aſſembly, and greatly tended to impreſs their minds and reach their hearts. He had an inward vital ſenſe of religion, that animated his diſcourſes with the ſame divine paſſions he felt in himſelf.</p>
            <p>He diſcharged the other parts of his ſacred truſt with prudence and fidelity, diligence and impartiality, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man and teaching every man in all wiſdom, not only publicly but from houſe to houſe, that he might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, he did not run in vain nor labour in vain. There is reaſon to believe, that no ſmall number, now among the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, are bleſſing and praiſing God for him, as the inſtrument of that happineſs they now enjoy; and that there are many yet living, who are the ſeals of his miniſtry, and will be his crown and joy in the day of the Lord. His whole deportment was a proof of the truth of religion. It is hard to ſay what virtues were moſt eminent in him, he ſat ſuch a ſhining example of all. He always ſeemed to have a ſenſe of God upon his mind, and earneſtly preſs'd after a nearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Divine Maſter. He kept at a great diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from that uſeleſs and trifling Manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which viſibly diſgraces the character of too many Chriſtans. He ſcarce ever enter'd into company but ſomething ſerious and good dropt from his lips. His very preſence baniſhed every thing of levity, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the minds of all who were with him—and yet there was ſuch a mixture of decent chearfulneſs that every one was fond of his Society.</p>
            <p>Prayer was the delight of his ſoul. He was frequent in his retired devotions, and was ever ready to join with others in this ſacred exerciſe. He ſeemed to breathe his native air when he drew near to the throne of grace— and was not willing to engage in any affair of importance, without having firſt made his religious acknowledgments to the God of heaven. His public prayers were ſerious, pertinent and pathetic—and he prayed always with all prayer almoſt in a literal ſenſe, as his mind was always heaven ward, and there was ſomething in his attitude and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011206_0036_0F862C4EEB2ACFD0"/>
appearance that led us to think he was continually ſending up pious ejaculations; and yet his religion was ſo eaſy, ſo natural, and ſo graceful, that none ever charged him with affectation, or imagined that he aimed at the praiſe of men. His prayers were accompanied with alms—He conſtantly devoted a tenth part of his income to pious and charitable uſes.—He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor, his righteouſneſs endureth forever.</p>
            <p>His heart was exceeding tender, and he ſacredly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heared to the dictates of conſcience—ſcrupulouſly afraid in all his tranſactions of doing wrong, no arguments or perſuaſions could prevail with him to act at all, until he was ſatisfied he ſhould act right. A ſolidity and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of judgment, even in caſes of great difficulty; and a diſtinguiſhing prudence both in public and private life, made him juſtly eſteemed one of the wiſeſt men of his day. His natural caution, improved by religion unto holy watchfulneſs, render'd him to the laſt degree careful not to give any juſt occaſion of offence; but when the cauſe of God required it, he was zealous, reſolved and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. He bore a faithful teſtimony againſt prevailing errors and faſhionable vices, how great ſoever the character of thoſe who patronized them. "No pretence could make him tranſgreſs his own line, and from the duties of his poſt nothing could move him. His ſpirit was truly pacifie, and could ſacrifice every thing but duty for peace; and accounted nothing too dear but truth and holineſs, for the purchaſe of it".</p>
            <p>He had a great veneration for our excellent Fathers, and could not calmly hear them reproached or vilified. He thought their magnanimity in encountering ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the ſake of preſerving the rights of conſcience, and their wiſdom and piety in laying ſuch happy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, both civil and religious, ought to cover any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſtakes they might have fallen into. He was greatly alarmed with every motion to introduce the Hierarchy into theſe Colonies, whoſe predeceſſors had, at the peril of every earthly comfort, fled from the face of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tyranny. Nor was he leſs jealous of the attempts made to deprive us of our civil liberties. Though he warmly preſſ'd ſubmiſſion to the powers that be, while
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011206_0037_0F862C4FB5D8CE28"/>
they are the miniſters of God for good to their ſubjects, yet he was greatly affected with the encroachments lately made upon us, and could not think a people were to be blamed for adhering to their rights and privileges, that had been purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. Theſe things lay with weight on his mind as long as he lived, he ſpake with freedom, and ſome degree of warmth, on this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting topic, and often addreſſed heaven to interpoſe for our relief. His prayers, we truſt, have been heard and will be graciouſly anſwered.</p>
            <p>With ſuch an aſſemblage of virtues, and ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form courſe of life, it is no wonder Dr. SEWALL lived in the higheſt reputation; venerated by all, loved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by the wiſe and good; he received the higheſt honors which were conſiſtent with his ſtation of life.— On the deceaſe of the Hon. and Rev. Preſident LEVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETT, in the year 1724, he was choſen to preſide over Harvard-College, but his Church not conſenting to reſign him at the call of the public, he reſpectfully declined the honorable truſt to which he had been invited. In 1728, on the reſignation of Dr. COLMAN, he was elected a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Corporation, and faithfully attended the duties of that ſtation until 1765, when his age and infirmities obliged him to reſign. He had a great and ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the intereſt of religion and learning in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and expreſſed his regard by many important ſervices. A few years ſince he made a generous donation to the College in money, the income to be for the help of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſcholars. When Harvard Hall was conſumed by fire, he was one of the firſt to repair the loſs, by a preſent of many choſen and valuable Authors out of his own library.</p>
            <p>In the year 1731, he was created Doctor of Divinity, by the Univerſity of Glaſgow —He was appointed one of their Commiſſioners by the Honourable Corporation in London for the propagation of the Goſpel in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and parts adjacent; and once and again a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent member by the Society in Scotland for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge. Indeed, there was no public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſuted to his ſtation and character, in which the undertakers did not think it an honor to have Dr. SEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALL an aſſociate; none calculated to promote the intereſt
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011206_0038_0F862C506D1AEBB8"/>
of Chriſt's kingdom, in which he did not willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; and when engaged, he punctually attended their reſpective meetings; being as willing to do the duty, as to have the honor, of a public truſt.</p>
            <p>The Lord of life was pleaſed to continue his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a good old age; the evening after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his 80th year, he preached to a ſerious and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed audience, when he took a humble and thankful notice of the ſparing mercy of God to him. The Lord's day following he was ſeized with a paralytic diſorder, which ſoon put an end to his public labors, and confined him to his houſe. But though incapable of public ſervice, he was ſtill employed in his Maſter's buſineſs. As he was viſited by great numbers, deſirous of hearing the laſt words of the aſcending Prophet, ſo he was inceſſant in his counſels, directions and prayers. Here you might ſee the humble gracious ſaint. Others were ready to applaud the rectitude and uniformity of his life, his diligence and fidelity in his Lord's work. He, on the other hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his ſenſe of his own defects, acknowledged himſelf an unprofitable ſervant, bewailed the remains of ſin, and looked to the atoning ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt for pardon and acceptance.
