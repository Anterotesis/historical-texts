            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Oration, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAD this day, AMERICANS, returned auspicious as former anniversaries, I should, after the example of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, restrict myself to discharge the tribute due to the past glories and future prospects of our country. But at a time, when dark and gloomy clouds hang over the hopes of our nation, when hostile passions attribute this aspect of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs to various causes, when through the false opinions of some, and the artful misrepresentations of others, the principles of our revolution have been abused as precedents, or dreaded as instruments, of factious enterprize; higher du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are added to the ordinary obligations of this day and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. Not only to extract from our ancient history the principles, feelings and manners, which led to that glorious event; but also to compare them with those of our day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vindicate that period, and illustrate the events of the present.</p>
            <p>THE principle which stimulated, the feelings and manners which made successful our revolution, are in nothing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from those, on which our country must, at this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for salvation. And that system of oppression, which made our declaration of Independence necessary, originated in the same malign passions, which, in our time, have produced dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress to the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:034431_0004_0FFDC4C49D91A808"/>
THE principle of our revolution was simple; a passion for Independence; a high sense of the eternal right of a great people to govern themselves after their own choice and manner. However assiduous our ancestors were to hide it from Great Britain, perhaps fortunate enough to conceal it from themselves, their emigration, their struggles in defence of their rights and soil, their sentiments of civil freedom and subjection were dictated by the genuine spirit of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. That to this dignity the genius of our fathers aspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is evident from the principles and manners adopted in the earliest, and pertinacously pursued to the latest periods of their history. Records of a memorable spirit exist. A spirit always vigilant and active, ever constructing barriers against European influence, cementing opposition to it into a principle of patriotism, spurning every concession remotely implicating the independence of their establishment, and hazarding, at all times, every thing dear, to preserve for their offspring a pure, and unincumbered inheritance. Even to us, accustomed as we are to hardy avowals of right, their favorite maxims are objects of equal pride and admiration. That subjection terminated with removal.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Hutchi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

They sprang up under the old Charter, and were nourished by the moral, civil, religious, and military character of our ancestors. The new charter, imposed after the restoration, checked but did not destroy the seeds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional freedom. They are discovered bursting forth on all sides in opposition to the king's governors and parliamentary influence, in disregard of acts of trade,<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Ib. 83.</note> in declarations of the invalidity of taxation without representation,<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Ib. 166.</note> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the controul of the Treasury, (<hi>s</hi>) and grasping under every favourable pretence the claims of prerogative.</p>
            <p>THIS bold sentiment and practice, so inconsistent with the principle of monarchy and the Colonial relation, could not fail to touch the pride of Britain. Fortunately she did not anticipate the importance of the Colonies, until age and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals had given energy and character to their establishment, nor commence her aggressions, until the evils, in presence and prospect of European controul had roused the spirit of our ancestors; whose most precious legacy to their descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants is the exemplary discernment and vigour, with which the designs of their enemies, open and concealed, were pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and opposed. The political history of our country ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits scarce any other prospect than the work of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gradually advancing under cover of assertion of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights and resistance to regal aggression; successive assumption followed by successive irritation; materials for explosion collecting: till at length the attempt to tax without actual representation, "instinct with fire and nitre," convuls<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and separated the new world from the old.</p>

THE evils, which provoked this spirit of Independence to the solemn declaration, which gives this day celebrity, were produced by external <hi>luxury, avarice and lust of domination, co-operating with an internal, depraved, ambitious, disappointed faction.</hi> To support the pressure of her massive debt, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain naturally looked to the aid of her colonies. Their wealth, industry and enterprize promised a rich resource of revenue. And these hopes were fostered by a small discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented party, which had existed among them from their first settlement, the leaders of which, having no resort in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents or virtue, could alone quench the thirst of ambition at the fountain of foreign supremacy. By falshood, by misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, by appealing to her avarice, and exposing the nakedness of the land, this party encouraged and invited the aggressions of Britain. And by insidiously sowing dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions between the Colonies, by striving to dissever their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, by malicious invectives against their chief patriots, by every art, through which groveling intent captivates gross understandings, they attempted to scatter discord and disu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among the people. As early as 1646, the serpent fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which fattens in a free soil, lurked at the root of our republic. Petitions for rights and privileges, hostile to the inclination or interest of the people and its representatives, were preferred, accompanied by the memorable threat of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to parliament if denied.<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8.</note> The government of the Colony replied to their complaints, but as their expressions had been contemptuous and seditious, they were reduced to reverence by the bitter, but wholesome, New-England regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Fine, suretyship and imprisonment avenged the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the government and the majesty of the people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted in their rulers. There is this remarkable of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to parliament of these first American malcontents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record, that none of their successors have materially devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from their path. They complain of the government, of the people and the pulpit. Of government, because, it was not managed by them. It must of consequence be ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034431_0007_0FFDC4C93490BDC8"/>
Of the people, that they were so ignorant, or so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, that they would have confidence in their rulers, and would have none in the complainants. Of the pulpit, that it "sided with government and denouunced the judgment of heaven against such as were going to Europe with evil inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against the country."</p>
            <p>THESE powers, operating without and within the colonies, produced those aggressions, which led on our revolution. One saw in the controul of our revenues a rich resource for luxury and necessity. The other sought to supply the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their ambition by external patronage. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of both rendered the colonies so contemptible in the eyes of foreigners, and so weakened the ties of domestic union, that the hopes of the people had well nigh been frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. But the spirit of Independence triumphed. The genius of America rose slow, but terrible in wrath, and burst those chains, which foreign vice had forged, and domestic treachery attempted to impose.</p>
            <p>THE design of this institution is to enliven and record in our bosoms, those sacred and pure principles, manners and feelings, to which our country is indebted for the high and happy rank she holds among nations. A duty, at all times pleasant and useful, is, at this day, peculiarly incumbent. Passions are abroad and operating in the land similar to those, against which our fathers struggled. External luxury, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and lust of domination have again grasped at the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of our nation, and supported internally, by a deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ambitious and disappointed faction, had well nigh effected its intent. The spirit of our ancestors, which had slumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too long, is roused from its repose. Like trials threaten us. We have duties equally solemn to fulfil. Much is due to ourselves. Much to a government the work of our hands, and which secures to us all the right of man, and all the blessing of the social compact. More to posterity, of whose hopes, we are trustees and guardians. But to the memories of our forefathers, to those principles which wrought our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, whose truth and value they sealed with their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034431_0008_0FFDC4D0A8D579D8"/>
blood, not to tarnish their glories, nor fall behind them in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we owe an eternal obligation.</p>
            <p>IT does not need a nice eye to mark the similarity between the principles and duties of past and present periods. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and objects, means and ends are the same. Names and nations have changed. But foreign and domestic tyrants, the enemies of public liberty and social order, providence, in mercy to man, has restricted to one system of schemes, with power only to vary the composition and application of their poisons, according to the varied sanity and disorder of the public mind. The projects of <hi>Andross,</hi> and <hi>Randolph,</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> and <hi>Hutchinson,</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> are revived in our day. Those projects are confined neither to time nor place. They are universal as human passion, and eternal as the nature of man. Whenever ambition and luxury unite in the supreme power of a potent nation, it will never fail to invade the rights, and under some pretence or other to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of its neighbours. And real republics always open a wide field for "diplomatic agencies." In that species of government, a party ever has arisen, and ever will arise, hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to the interests and liberties of the people. In the strife for popular favor all cannot be gratified. Disappointment will seek revenge. Envy pursue its rival. Lust of power pant for elevation. There will ever exist ignorance to be misled, and vicious hopes to be pampered. If the nation in itself do not afford these passions means of gratification, they will seek satiety from foreign connections and influence. The union of these has been always fatal to republics.</p>
            <p>THE factious spirits, whose intrigues have produced such losses and distress to the United States, and forced our fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated stars from the pathway of peace and heaven, are servile copyists of those antient enemies of Colonial Independence. They have neither the claim of originals, the merit of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, nor the charm of novelty. It is not a mere general resemblance. It is the old piece in a new position. The same in character and attitude, in expression and passion, in drapery and design. The tories and royalists of old time,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034431_0009_0FFDC4CF256E9888"/>
compared with the true friends of America, were a small and weak party; unable to acquire the confidence of the people. Ambition, which cannot be gratified by honorable means, has a sure resource in intrigue. Their invitations stimulated and encouraged aggression. They marked out the plan for our enemies. Divide and conquer. Insert your influence amid the parties of the state. Corrupt the avaricious, fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the weak, vilify virtue, turn talents to ridicule, weaken the obligations of morality, destroy the influence of religion, make men worthy to be slaves, and they will sue for fetters. How minutely the opponents of the will of the people have adhered to these principles in our day is too obvious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. We shall find the likeness not less striking, if, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own times in view, we call to recollection the arts by which the tories and royalists formerly played this eternal game of tyranny. To encourage and unite the inhabitants of the old world, they every where proclaimed us a divided people; that embarked in a common cause, we refused to bear our share of expence; that reared under their wing, in our strength, we were unmindful of our patrons. In Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica different changes were rung. They attempted to set at variance the southern and northern colonies; to make the orders of state contend; to render the poor suspicious of the rich; the rich fearful of the poor. They told the people of fleets and armies; of the power of the adversary, and their weakness. The arms and victories of a nation, then stiled terrible to her enemies, and generous to her friends, were painted in colours best suited to alarm. The sin, the crying sin of ingratitude, to a nation, who had fought our battles, the bones of whose warriors were mingled in the same plains with ours, was blazoned in terms designed to make us odious and contemptible at home and abroad. Every man of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and virtue was designated as an object of the most atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious slander. Our Clergy,—God ever preserve to them the glorious prerogative!—calumniated by the enemies of their country. Our patriots, loaded with every insult, which abandoned minds could invent. <hi>Otis</hi> the spirited and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

            <p>THIS is history. May we not say, it is also prophecy? Exchange Britain for France, monarchical for republican forms of controul and corruption, instead of a British Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, place a French Envoy at the head of the party; in the room of a rebel and traitor let them be furnished with the offensive epithets, Aristocrats and Englishmen, give them new weapons and new cloaks, and the tories and royalists of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Five are the Jacobins and Exclusive Patriots of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Eight<note n="*" place="bottom">Since this performance was pronounced, it has been suggested to me that justness and accuracy require a discrimination in favour of those who in former and present times were mistaken followers of arch tories and Jacobins. I cannot be expected that a work necessarily of a general nature, should include minute shades of character. I owe it however to truth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that on the one hand, as the mystical names of loyalty and allegiance, as well as the venerable onces of order and good government, form an apology for many enemies of our revolution, so on the other, names equally mystical, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and fraternity, and those equally venerable, liberty, equality, and the rights of man, are no less a palliation for the aberration of good men into paths, which terminate in the utter destruction of all that is sacred and venerable on earth.</note>. The resemblance between these periods results from the uniformity of the passions, by which despotic design is necessitated to operate. Notwithstanding the infinite shapes it assumes, its hopes exist on two resources only; to deceive, or to debase the people. To the former, ignorance and falshood are the ready paths, and all vicious projects are advanced by demoralizing man. For moral sense once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and confidence in virtue shaken, the people, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of chart or compass, will commit the charge of the vessel to every bold adventurer, who will seize upon the helm. Let us not then deceive ourselves. But instead of loose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations, examine the evil, and apply the remedy.</p>
            <p>SOME men exclaim, "The vile spirit of party is our ruin. Corruption has gained ground among us. These insults and aggressions are fruits of their encouragement." It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less true that such influence exists in our country. Against ours, as against all preceding republics, corruption and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034431_0011_0FFDC4D5218DD418"/>
are leagued. But the attempts of these, although they produce inconvenience, can never, without other aid, destroy our national independence. Others cry, "the perfidy and avarice of the ruling powers in France have laid a deep scheme against our sovereignty." It is not to be doubted that in the career of victory and crimes, such plans are drawn, and even now executing. But schemes like these, though formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cannot alone sap our establishment. The government of the United States, extending protection to its citizens, show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering blessings around the people, rich and strong in their affections, cannot be uprooted by such enemies, however pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. The danger lies nearer home. It exists—pardon the reflection, not such as are pleasant, but such as are useful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this period—it exists—I fear you will think me too presumptuous—it exists, Americans, in our own bosoms. It is the indolence, with which we have supported government, the calmness, with which we have heard it calumniated, the feeble, and sometimes doubtful, support, we have yielded to it, that have given strength and spirits to destructive design, internal and external. Immersed in private interests, and personal projects, we have not been attentive enough to those establishments, which can alone give permanent value to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition or improvement. While each man has been shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the burden of supporting government, on his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, all have viewed, with surprize and indignation, at one time, a domestic insurrection threatening its infancy; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an insolent foreigner seizing the dearest attributes of sovereignty; and now, sacrifices equally derogatory to nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al honor and interest demanded from us. But could we reasonably expect the reverse? An individual is thought to merit insult, if he suffer it with impunity. Want of spirit to resent, not only invites injury, but is among the marks of its desert. Yet we, Americans, the descendants of Sires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their justice and spirit, have heard daily a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own choice and creation ridiculed, vilified, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated, we have seen every art exerted to propagate the tale of falsehood, not only without punishment, but almost without reproof. If a people will not take the trouble to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue

its government from infamy among themselves, have they right to complain, if it be not respected by foreigners? If in the full bloom and vigor of youth, while profusely scattering around us rich fruits, it cannot interest us enough to protect its character from obliquy, and its existence from attack, is it not natural for our enemies to expect its utter dissolution, when, checked by embarrassments, it cannot yield such luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant bounties? And how certainly do they rely on its des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, when, by the necessities to which it has been ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitously reduced, it shall apply to the direct contribution of the people!</p>
            <p>AGAIN; the rulers of our nation were selected by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from amid themselves, for their talents, virtues, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotism. Emanating from the common mass, returnable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it at stated periods, with interests, views and feelings, which could not be hostile to those of their constituents; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, for the most part, leaders and pride of our Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, what other requisites could exist to ensure the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and confidence of the people? Yet what has been the result? From the adoption of the Federal Constitution, a current of calumny and abuse, replenished from sources the most vile and wicked, has never ceased to pour upon our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. While we, high spirited republicans, in full exercise and boast of the energy of virtuous, and the foresight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent minds, have listened calmly to these invectives; and without <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ecting, that the keenest of all insults against the people is that, which holds up its representatives to dishonor, this language has been submitted to from men, the loudest, on all occasions, in their pretended veneration and care of the people. Need I call you this day to the disgusting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the calumnies and falsehoods, which have been propagated concerning our best and most virtuous citizens; our clergy; the majority of both houses of Congress; the heads of all the departments of State; the present head of our nation; or shall I point you to that injured Hero, who, like the departing sun looks through the shades of Mount Vernon, on this western world, refulgent with his glories?</p>
            <p>THIS practice and forbearance we have not learnt, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034431_0013_0FFDC4DA248A6690"/>
of our ancestors. They were well apprized that such abuse is treachery the most malignant against the republic; in as much as it destroys the moral qualities of the people; breaks down the barriers which separate and distinguish vice from virtue; diminishes the greatest security of the people in a ruler, by making one event to patriots and traitors. Of these facts, and of the spirit, which has gone forth to lay principle and character low, none of us are ignorant. The evidences are before and around us. They meet us in the street. They follow us into our houses. They infect the purity of the country; and disturb the tranquillity of the town. Americans are every moment witnesses of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their virulence. Yet, strange infatuation! the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers and venders of these poisons are supported and encouraged among us. And there are many, who give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to their intentions, or in charity, transfer the guilt, from their hearts, to their understandings. But have not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a dear property in the virtues of their rulers? Will they look on unconcerned spectators, while that property is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? Are men of talents and integrity of such spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abundant growth, that we can afford to trample on them rudely, or make them abhor our favours? To what will these things lead? Experience daily gives the answer. Men of talents retire, or refuse your proffered honors. True spirit cannot long bear to be a butt for the shafts of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. If the justice of their country will not secure the fame of good men, they will seek, in retirement, consolation for its injustice. And who will succeed? Bold and hardy am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that seeks his own emolument, not the welfare of the State; from whose brazen front, the darts of just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach leap back, blunted; that will sacrifice his country, and take care to recompence upon the people—Ah! keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recompence their unjust suspicions of virtue, or thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less indolence in its defence.</p>
            <p>MERCIFUL and righteous have been the ways of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to our nation. It had crowned our cup high with bounties. The United States walked forth among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034431_0014_0FFDC4DDD46A9BB8"/>
of the earth, in the bloom and majesty of youth and freedom. Prosperity began to obliterate the principles of our forefathers, to corrupt their simple and pure manners, and to weaken that attachment to country, which was their distinguishing attribute. Like the other chosen people of the most high, we began to run after strange deities, the idols of other nations; to forsake his altar for the new temple of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which has NO GOD; to look with less awe on constitutions, resting on religion, the rock of ages, cemented by the blood of our fathers, upheld by morals, venerable by early hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it and recent obligation The black whirlwind, which spreads disorder and desolation over the face of Europe, curls threatening towards our shores. The impending evil has hastened us back to ourselves, to the principles and feelings of our ancestors, to a right and high sense of our duties. Our coasts ravaged from the Mississippi to the St. Croix, the blood of thousands streaming again for Independence, a century of war is a cheap price for this renovated temper and unclouded vision.</p>
            <p>BUT on this spirit alone, we must not rely for salvation. The day of trial will require higher energies and severer duties. Let no man persuade himself that this state of things will cease, or Independence be preserved without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous conflicts; without conflicts of blood. Look around you, my countrymen, and burst those films with which faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty love and momentary interests, heretofore darkened your vision. Recollect the obstinate perseverance, with which every agent of republicanized France has striven to grasp your sovereignty; to revive antient antipathies; and, by os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious display of love, to create a claim for dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity. Recall to your minds the venom, with which her missionaries, principal and subordinate, open and concealed, have corroded your first Patriots and Virtues, and with what rancour they continue to this hour, shameless, their infamous falshoods and calumnies. Turn your eyes to the other side of the Atlantic, and shake off that indolence and love of ease, into which peace and delusive security have sunk you.

Behold in Europe, a new Empire, like the Macedonian and Roman, progressing forward, in the same paths, and by the same means, to universal dominion. See it, under specious pretence of giving liberty and rights, entailing slavery and wretchedness, on prostrate man. And learn, that in all this, there is nothing new either in project or execution. When <hi>Philip</hi> aspired to seize the sovereignty of Greece, think you that he proclaimed his designs to the world? He<note n="(v)" place="bottom">Travels of Anarcharsis the younger by the Abbe Barthelemi, vol. 5 ch. 61. vol. 7. ch. 82.</note> too first interested the zeal of the Grecians, by pretended concern for their religion and rights; by splendid successes over distant nations, he exalted their admiration; and by professions of pure and virtuous intent, excited their enthusiasm. While he was securing the surrounding kingdoms, some by conquest, others by alliance, and while the true patriots and statesmen of Greece were striving to rouse the people from their lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, before he became invincible, his "diplomatic agents" were composing their fears, weakening the influence of all the friends of their country, calling them mercenaries of the great Persian king, the antient enemy of Greece, painting the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of peace and the horrors of war, and notwithstanding one nation after another was falling victim to his arms, by these arts, they rocked the people into such fatal repose, that they collected not their force, until it was too late. Greece like her neighbours, sunk into subjection. And under a feigned alliance, became a tributary stream to that Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian torrent, which desolated the Asiatic world.</p>
            <p>THE same projects on a broader scale made the Universe pass under the Roman yoke. Hear one of their historians. "By affecting moderation in victories,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Ferg. Rom. Rep. 21<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

other words, they reserved nothing but the power of seizing the whole, at a proper time, and for the present, the supreme ascendant over all the conquered provinces, that were given away, and over those who received them. Taking care so to balance<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Ib. 215.</note> the parties in the State, to which they had given a nominal Independence, that no formidable combination could be formed against their sovereignty, and if one or a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should presume to withstand their power, many others were ready to join the cry of ingratitude; and to treat oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to them, as an unworthy return to those, who had so generously espoused the cause of mankind." Shall I insult your understandings by a formal application of this history? Look at Italy and Holland, plundered, prostrate, and enslav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; paying their whole wealth for their freedom, and their liberties, yet at nurse, under the bayonets of Fifty Thousand Frenchmen. See Venice given away at a bargain; and Swiss mountains, whose bare and icy breasts upheld liberty to the heavens, penetrated, vanquished and chained. Behold an hundred thousand warriors, with swords encrusted with blood, ready to pass into Britain. Into Britain did I say? Into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, into any land, that opposes obstacles to their ambition, or offers plunder for their rapine. We have allowed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too long to be deluded, Americans. The fear of that abuse, which in ours, as in all countries, is the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of virtue and patriotism, has kept truth too long in the shade. But the day of apology is passed. It is in vain; it is treacherous now to palliate the iniquitous design Our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has declared, and the people from one end of the continent to the other are echoing the disgraceful truth. That Independence, for which our fathers so long and ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strove, and to which they waded through blood and peril, has been assaulted; our rights invaded; the liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding on its own interests denied to our government; its most solemn acts insidiously represented as the work of a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and you, yes you, my countrymen, been incited to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034431_0017_0FFDC4A8B7ACDA78"/>
plunder your constituted authorities of your choicest delegated powers, and under the plausible pretext of assuming your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights, to open an opportunity to foreigners to seize your liberties by your divisions. Praise be to him who rules among the passions of the human heart, the insidious appeal of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to the people has been answered to their confusion. With an holy indignation, worthy the chiefs of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worthy their descendants, the people have vindicated their Independence, they have scorned to be cheated out of their rights, have broken the shackles of too partial an affection, and dissolved the charms of gratitude, under which, too long for their honor or interest, they had slumbered. Thanks to the firm and stern texture of our constitution; thanks to the bold Independence of the head of our nation; to the firm and manly conduct of our envoys; above all, thanks to the spirit of our forefathers, descended again to bless their posterity, we have escaped the snare. Instead of gloom, it is a day of exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Instead of despondence, joy should penetrate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven our countenances and hearts. Americans have returned to their government; they have returned to the principles of their revolution; to the influence of their best and most virtuous citizens, from whom, by dark policy, they had been estranged. We had drank deep of the cup of her love, brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with principles, noxious to morality, as well as to Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. At the moment, when the last dreadful draught was mingled for us, it is stricken from her hand, and the swords of millions of freemen gleam half sprung from their scabbards, indignant at the insult. Think you Americans, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our departed patriots and heroes, from amid the band of the perfect and just, look not down complacent on the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of our day? Yes, surely; and on their thrones exult, "THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN."</p>
            <p>Laudable is your zeal, my countrymen; just your indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What! Americans, with your knowledge, habits, and virtues, rich in governments, and rulers of your choice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by morality, inspired by the hopes of religion, shall ye be placed on a level with the gross and restless slaves of antient
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034431_0018_0FFDC7880E749790"/>
despotisms? Shall ye be dupes of the same hacknied arts as they? Shall your governments, the result of your calm inves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, filled with pure, guarded by youthful blood, be drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the same gross opiates as have drenched in death, aged, corrupt European sibres? With the records of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in your hands, their maxims on your hearts, shall ye be frightened into disgraceful sacrifices, or descend to try li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by arithmetical process, open accounts between Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and submission, strike balances, and make nice calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how much it will cost to be freemen, and what you may hope to keep, and be slaves? The tombs of your fathers, alas! untimely reared; the bleached bones of your warriors, which the plough share, in industrious progress, upturns to the sky, excite different sentiments, rouse to other duties. Not a paltry tax, less than the necessities of all governments require, not burdens incumbent, but threatened, prompted their struggles, pointed them to glory. It is better to die, than be slaves. And to their high sentiment, payment of a pepper-corn on principles derogatory to their rights or their honour was slavery, worthy to be repelled at the risque of life and of all that is dear to man. They also were tempted by the fair names of peace and of plenty. But, what security for peace, except national spirit and power? And what can the sword take away, which rapine will spare? Away then, with these fallacious hopes, which delude our hearts and weaken our vigour. With no common voice our country commands us to shield her from disgrace; from devastation, this land, the delight of freemen; from destruction, those dwellings now the abode of peace and of joy; from defilement, these altars, where reason unites her incense with devotion; and from pollution those fair bosoms, native mansions of purity and truth.</p>
            <p>THE ark of liberty is, among the virtuous, union invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Guard, therefore, against faction, the viper. Guard, as the bulwark of your hopes, the fame and honor of your rulers. Above all, guard against those base, unmanly suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, by which foreign and domestic enemies strive to break
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034431_0019_0FFDC789A2FDE6A8"/>
the anchor of Independence, confidence between rulers and people. Then, Americans, you may rely with assurance, that,—if such be the will of the Supreme ruler,—you shall preserve the peace and liberty, you so justly prize, and your country maintain, in honor and virtue, that high and happy rank, she holds among nations.</p>
