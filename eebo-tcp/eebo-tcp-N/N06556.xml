            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was led by extraordinary impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to compute the numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who are both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved prophets, and the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to each other: They contain the beginning and end of all the great confuſion, which ſin has brought into the works of ALEIM JEHOVAH.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I was led to conſider, where the theocracy of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ended, after the ancient departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when his judges or rulers were caſt off by their kings.</p>
            <p>

This fell out in 427 years, when <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen: Then was I led to conſider, that about this time the ANTICHRIST of falſe interpretation for the goſpel was nouriſhed with great eaſe and honour at the courts of emperors, eaſtern and weſtern, who did as much deſtroy the ſpirit of the goſpel, as the kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did the ſpirit of the law and the prophets.</p>
            <p>This was near 1095 years before the CHRIST of the ALEIM of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is the king or head of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> promulged again the theocracy of the triune JEHOVAH in the beloved Son.</p>
            <p>From this date I was conducted to calculate the laſt number of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the cloſe of his prophecy:<note place="margin">Dan. xii. 12.</note>—<hi>bleſſed and holy is he, that cometh to the thouſand three hundred and five and thirty days, but go thy way 'til the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt and ſtand in the lot at the end of the days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two numbers make</hi> 1762.</p>
            <p>In verſe 9 <hi>Daniel</hi> was bid to go his way; for the words were <hi>cloſed up</hi> and <hi>ſealed,</hi> 'til the <hi>time of the end:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 9.</note> that is, it would not be revealed, 'til the ſeaſon of its fulfilling was coming on and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring. The LOT here is a term of the law, the LORD'S PORTION, or the FIRST-BORN, the leading character of that diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:008320_0004_10347A5E4E645F38"/>
Within four years of this time, under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">SIXTUS III. in the year 432.</note> there was a pope, whoſe name was Sixtus III. which period nearly agrees.</p>
            <p>This ought to appear an extraordinary mark to ſuch, who believe, that the <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> and <hi>the great city,</hi> ſignify the corrupt church of Rome only: ſince the THIRD SIXTH in all the languages of Babylon the great, anſwers to 666.</p>
            <p>But if this number ſhould compoſe the name of the BEAST, it muſt be remembered, that the <hi>whore rideth</hi> on the <hi>ſcarlet or purple coloured beaſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xvii. 3.</note> and therefore it cannot be interpreted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly. For ſhe appears the ſame as Babylon the great, which contains all the peoples,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.</note> and multitudes and kindreds and tongues. We muſt allow that all mankind riſe out of water and blood of <hi>fallen Adam,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of this <hi>outer court.</hi> This is the whore, ſitting over theſe <hi>waters.</hi> The 70 tongues aroſe in <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, though the typical hiſtory be ſhewn at old Babel. It means then in ſpiritual propheſying, that the carnal and corrupt heart, the animal man of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> the heart and fleſh of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> had ſo defiled the goſpel by baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, that the power of the beaſt was ſet up upon the <hi>new ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>water and blood</hi> of JESUS,<note place="margin">Ezek. xi. 19.</note> to be poured out upon all of the old fleſh. Then the ſchools and ſons of the prophets were confined to a few only: And the two great leaders of the church in this age were <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Corin. xiv. 29, 30, 31, 32.</note> we need not ſay more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008320_0005_10347A5CCC45F7C0"/>
The world, the corrupt heart ſet up the beaſt, a falſe interpretation to ſave the crucifying and living and dying with Jeſus, becauſe he had done all, as was pretended, and carried away the law and the prophets;<note place="margin">John v. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> inſtead of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus opening the law and the prophets, and fulfilling his mighty powers and ſpiritual prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in them, of a <hi>new ſpirit, and water and blood,</hi> the <hi>one holy ſeed</hi> and <hi>work</hi> that he had been, and will be doing till ſin, and miſery its wages and curſe, are no more,—<hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the baſeneſs and ſubmiſſion of other churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> had the greateſt hand, in bringing in one confuſion and falſe lip of interpretation after another, ſhe may be conſidered as an eminent <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> full of falſe tongues and ſtammering lips;<note place="margin">Iſaiah xxviii. 11.</note> but in what light can ſhe anſwer to the name <hi>Myſtery</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, which comprehendeth all the <hi>peoples,</hi> and <hi>tongues,</hi> and <hi>languages,</hi> and <hi>nations;</hi> and in <hi>her was found the blood of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of ſaints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xviii. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can words deſcribe the <hi>World</hi> more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which our ſaviour uſes ſo continually in the goſpel of <hi>St. John,</hi> and he ſcatters this word through his epiſtles. This diſciple of the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi> beſt knew the myſteries, the deep and prophetic ſenſe of his maſter's kingdom.</p>
            <p>There are many antichriſts, ſaith this belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writer,<note place="margin">1 John ii. 18.</note> who underſtood the full force and ſpirit of propheſying: And antichriſt will come, that is, an eminent one, the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and another, even <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008320_0006_10347A5B03400800"/>
Yet it muſt be conſidered, that the one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition, which ſlew all the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters and meſſengers of the revelation of God, in every part of the <hi>great city,</hi> which is the world, ſlew them in <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Rome;</hi> under <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and in <hi>Gentiliſm:</hi> They ſlew their bodies, or rejected their interpretation by a falſe lip and lying tongue ſet up againſt them, which is the ſpiritual death of propheſying in the ſenſe of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> evangelical prophets, and of the ancient prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I was led to compute the time, when the temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſeized by the old typical <hi>Babylonians</hi> after its building; and the ſpiritual prophets, or interpreters of that temple had written.</p>
            <p>The ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fell out in 428, and the taking of the temple, about <hi>two</hi> years after.</p>
            <p>This is near the ſame time as before, and would expire by adding the 1335 days of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in 1763, or 1765. This is near the ſame time when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the PROPHET of his own ſpiritual, and heavenly temple diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner: For after he had ſhewn the MYSTERY which he had been doing among the 70 nations, or tongues of the world, by all the rites and figures of the law; how he had killed and ſlain and poured out the falſe water and blood of <hi>Adam,</hi> and had been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pure and holy water, and blood and ſpirit, which he brought to light on the croſs?
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008320_0007_10347A58E39C7868"/>how he had done all the parts of the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer and feeder of his people: Then came the time, when the true temple and all its ſpiritual and inward prieſthood was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; when things imputed were ſetting up inſtead of the royal bleſſings implanted and ingrafted into the old dead tree, the tree of mortal fleſh, through him as the <hi>tree of life,</hi> with <hi>twelve fruits,</hi> mediating or coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our foul water and blood. For theſe holy powers were to quicken the dry bones, the dead earth, and veſſels of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fallen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, into living ſpirit, and water and blood, by continual union, touch and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Lord of the GLORY, or the CHERUBIM overſhadowing the world, as the <hi>temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was then led to compute the number 666, by adding the <hi>one thouſand two hundred</hi> and <hi>ſixty</hi> days for the propheſying of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in ſackcloth,<note place="margin">Rev. xi. 3.</note> before the falſe prophets ſhould be caſt down.</p>

This feaſting and drinking out of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the temple expreſſes in that fine way, in which GOD hides himſelf from prophane and mocking tempers; it expreſſes too the blindneſs of the chriſtian age we are now in, who uſe the veſſels without the ſenſe of the new temple.<note place="margin">2 Peter liii, 3.

            <p>The 70 weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> are 490 days;<note place="margin">Dan. ix. 27.</note> by centuries 49,000 years, or by <hi>ten</hi> times <hi>ſeven hundred</hi> for each week, they will make 7000 years according to the myſtic ſenſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jews,</hi> who allowed 7000 years for the week of the world. <hi>Seven</hi> of theſe weeks run up to the <hi>ſeven</hi> weeks of pentecoſte, and to the <hi>ſeven</hi> ſabbatic years to the jubilee.

            <p>On this ground a week of years in <hi>Daniel</hi> is 7000. In verſe 26th he ſays, <hi>deſolations are cut off,</hi> by which we may underſtand, that the time of them were ſhortned, as our Lord has told us,<note place="margin">Matth. xxiv. 22.</note> that <hi>thoſe days</hi> ſhould be ſhortened for the elect's ſake.

            <p>It ſeems then to refer to the cutting of the laſt part, whatever portion GOD ſhall appoint for it.</p>
            <p>This circumſtance is anſwered again by <hi>St. John,</hi> where the <hi>woman</hi> is nouriſhed in a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> for a <hi>time, times,</hi> and half <hi>a time,</hi> from the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>ſerpent.</hi>

            <p>Both theſe prophets <hi>beloved</hi> of their <hi>Lord,</hi> (whoſe deep ſenſe veil the whole kingdom of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the beginning to the fall of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of death,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi>) bear a view to their <hi>maſter</hi>'s language; that thoſe days, or the time of <hi>one week</hi> ſhould be cut off, or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; and for the reaſon aſſigned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>over-ſpreading</hi> like a flood, of abominable impieties of the whole world: <hi>This Age</hi> is the exact picture of it;<note place="margin">Rev. xviii. 14.</note> when <hi>Babylon</hi> falls, and all her fine and goodly things for which her ſoul luſted, are no more to be found.</p>
            <p>The only number remaining is that of the 1290 days,<note place="margin">Dan. xii. 11.</note> in the laſt chapter.<note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This number extends 30 days above the 1260 of <hi>St. John:</hi> And it is to be explained

            </p>
            <p>Theſe muſt be divided in a double portion for jubilees, and a third for centuries, the aera of the <hi>Gentile</hi> church.</p>
            <p>860 jubilees make 43,000 years: The firſt 7000, or one <hi>week</hi> or <hi>age</hi> being added, they fill up the <hi>fifty</hi> days of <hi>Pentecoſte,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. xxiii. 15, 16.</note> and the <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth</hi> year of jubilee;<note place="margin">Levit. xxv. 8, 10.</note> the feaſt of <hi>weeks</hi> and the ſeven great <hi>ſabbaths</hi> of <hi>years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt 430 of this number reckoned by centuries of <hi>Japhet</hi> the Gentile, amount to the ſame number. If they are compounded, they make 86,000 years: But as the 14 ſabbatic years at the end of every 6000 muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as years of <hi>releaſe,</hi> by adding theſe,<note place="margin">Exod. xxi. 2.</note> the double year of 100,000 is filled up:<note place="margin">Deut. xv. 9, 12.</note> 100 years was typical <hi>Noah</hi> in building his ark,<note place="margin">Gen. vii. 13, 14.</note> for all creatures; where <hi>Ham</hi> the <hi>ſervant</hi> of <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, goes in with his brethren</hi> Shem <hi>and</hi> Japhet.<note place="margin">Rev. xiv. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The 1260 days of <hi>St. John</hi> can give only 84,000 years; and the 14 ſabbatic years will not give the two octaves,<note place="margin">Lev. xxiii. 15.</note> the eighth day to each period, which is the crown of <hi>pentecoſte,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Lev. xxv. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt remember, that this <hi>firſt</hi> great <hi>week,</hi> or <hi>firſt age</hi> will be ſhortened: It will not run ſo many ſabbatic years, nor years of jubilee, nor centuries, as the propheſies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding <hi>time</hi> declare, in many places <hi>produced</hi> and explained.</p>

The propheſy of Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ought not here to be omitted, as it is not his own. I have not ſeen a word of his, or the calculations of any one.</p>
            <p>Let us give the account of this propheſy in his own expreſſions.</p>
            <p>"The propheſy which <hi>Jehoram</hi> copied off, and tranſlated out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language as it is written on <hi>Seth</hi>'s pillar in <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> Which pillar is ſaid to have ſtood ſince before the flood, and was built by <hi>Seth, Adam</hi>'s ſon, and written by <hi>Enoch,</hi> the <hi>prophet;</hi> as likewiſe the holy precepts whereby the patriarchs walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the <hi>law</hi> was given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was alſo engraven on the ſaid pillar, whereof many <hi>Jews</hi> have copies in their own language, written on parchment, and engraven on braſs and copper: But the alteration of the date makes them to ſtagger at it, not knowing that the dates were to be altered by the birth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Firſt, this propheſy is intitled, a <hi>ſhort work</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s in the <hi>latter age</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi>

            <p>"Great wars in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>America</hi> 1757.</p>
            <p>"The deſtruction of popery, or <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall, in the year 1758.</p>
            <p>"The anger of GOD againſt the wicked in the year 1759.</p>

"GOD will be known by many in the year 1760. And this will produce a great man.</p>
            <p>"The ſtars will wander, and the moon turn as blood in 1761.</p>

            <p>We will now draw all the numbers into a ſhort view.</p>
            <p>The 70 years of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in chap. xxv. 12. xxix. 20. were underſtood by <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. ix. 21.</note> and they appear to be the 70 weeks of years which <hi>Gabriel</hi> informs him of at the 24th verſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe 70 weeks make 490 days; and theſe days allowing a century or double jubilee for each day, which is the end of time with the church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> they will make 49,000 years. This number will anſwer to the <hi>ſeven</hi> weeks of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſte,</hi> and to the <hi>ſeven</hi> times ſeven years up to the jubilee. Thus are filled up the ſeven Ages of the goſpel, before the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall have finiſhed his glorious conqueſt over <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper <hi>theocracy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was thrown off by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a king about the year 427:<note place="margin">1 Sam. viii. 7, 8, 9.</note> The theocracy of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> under the goſpel was departing about this time: The famous number of <hi>Daniel</hi> of 1335 days in chap. xii. 12. meaſured from this year of the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of God, runs down to 1762.</p>
            <p>Within four years of this period we meet with the pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the third, or third ſixth: by adding theſe we ſhall come to 1766.</p>
            <p>The typical temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was taken by the typical <hi>Babylonians</hi> in 430, but the ſiege of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:008320_0023_10347A3E245AF220"/>began in 428 years after the building of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Under the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the <hi>prince</hi> of peace, and <hi>Lord</hi> of the true temple, ſpiritual interpretation ceaſed about this time. If we meaſure this period by 1335 days of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they will expire in 1763, or 1765.</p>
            <p>The number of <hi>St. John</hi> of 666 and 1260 days for the prophets in <hi>ſackcloth</hi> added together,<note place="margin">Rev. xi. 3.</note> make 1926 years. Meaſure this period from <hi>Antiochus</hi> who defiled the temple under <hi>Moſes,</hi> 167 or 168 years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to his antitype of the goſpel, or the power of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:</hi> This will lead us to the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1758, or 1759.</p>
            <p>Again. Let us compute the period of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Thalmud</hi> proclaimed after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the year 500, or 505: reckon 1260 days or years, before <hi>Meſes</hi> and the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xi.</note> 
               <hi>two witneſſes of God</hi> riſe and come forth: and this will reach to the year 1760, or 1765.</p>
            <p>If we reckon the number of <hi>Daniel</hi> in chap. viii. 12, 13. of 2300 days appointed for the cleanſing of the <hi>ſanctuary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. v.</note> from <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s impious feaſt, and the taking of the typical <hi>Babylon</hi> 538 years before <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this will conclude in 1762 of our time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>cutting ſhort</hi> of this firſt <hi>age</hi> of the goſpel has been fully explained: So that the only number of <hi>Daniel</hi> remaining is the 1290 days from the taking away the <hi>daily oblation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. xii. 11.</note>

            <p>Theſe appear to be days of jubilees and centuries, whoſe meaning I have opened in page 18 and 19; according to my light, and the gift of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
