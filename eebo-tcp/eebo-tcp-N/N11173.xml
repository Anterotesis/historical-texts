            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have had twenty different accounts of your arrival at Boſton, which have been regularly contradicted the next morning; but as I now find it certain that you are arrived, I ſhall not delay a ſingle inſtant addreſſing myſelf to you. It is a duty I owe to the friendſhip I have long and ſincerely profeſſed for you; a friendſhip to which you have the ſtrongeſt claims from the firſt moments of our acquaintance. There is no man from whom I have received ſo many teſtimonies of eſteem and affection, there is no man whoſe eſteem and affection, could, in my opinion have done me greater honour. I entreat and conjure you therefore, my dear Sir, to impute theſe lines not to a petulant itch of ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, but to the moſt unfeigned ſolicitude for the future tranquility of your mind, and for your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I ſincerely lament the infatuation of the times, when men of ſuch a ſtamp as Mr. Burgoyne and Mr. Howe can be ſeduced into ſo impious and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious a ſervice by the artifice of a wicked and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous court and cabinet. You, Sir, muſt be ſenſible that theſe epithets are not unjuſtly ſevere. You have yourſelf experienced the wickedneſs and treachery of this court and cabinet. You cannot but recollect their manoeuvres in your own ſelect committee, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014148_0003_0F935453E7A61DB0"/>
the treatment yourſelf as Preſident received from theſe abandoned men. You cannot but recollect the black buſineſs of St. Vincents, by an oppoſition to which you acquired the higheſt and moſt deſerved honour. I ſhall not trouble you with my opinion of the right of taxing America without her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as I am afraid, from what I have ſeen of your ſpeeches, that you have already formed your creed upon this article; but I will boldly affirm, had this right been eſtabliſhed by a thouſand ſtatutes, had America admitted it from time immemorial, it would be the duty of every good Engliſhman to exert his utmoſt to diveſt Parliament of this right, as it muſt inevitably work the ſubverſion of the whole empire. The malady under which the ſtate labours is indiſputably derived from the inadequate repreſentation of the ſubject, and the vaſt pecuniary influence of the crown. To add to this pecuniary influence and incompetency of repreſentation, is to inſure and precipitate our deſtruction. To wiſh any addition can ſcarcely enter the heart of a citizen who has the leaſt ſpark of public virtue, and who is at the ſame time capable of ſeeing conſequences the moſt immediate. I appeal, Sir, to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to your experience and knowledge of our court and parliament; and I requeſt you to lay your hand upon your heart, and then anſwer with your uſual integrity and frankneſs, whether, on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition America ſhould be abject enough to ſubmit to the terms impoſed, you think a ſingle Guinea raiſed upon her would be applied to the purpoſe (as it is oſtentatiouſly held out to deceive the people at home) of eaſing the mother country? Or whether
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014148_0004_0F9354549AB72068"/>
you are not convinced that the whole they could extract would be applied ſolely to heap up ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the enormous fund for corruption which the crown already poſſeſſes, and of which a moſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical uſe is made. On theſe principles I ſay, Sir, every good Engliſhman, abſtracted of all regard for America, muſt oppoſe her being taxed by the Britiſh parliament; for my own part I am convinced that no argument (not totally abhorrent from the ſpirit of liberty and the Britiſh conſtitution) can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in ſupport of this right. But it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to trouble you upon a ſubject which has been ſo amply, and in my opinion ſo fully diſcuſſed. I find by a ſpeech given as your's in the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that it was by the King's poſitive command you embarked in this ſervice. I am ſomewhat pleaſed that it is not an office of your own ſeeking, tho', at the ſame time, I muſt confeſs that it is very a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rming to every virtuous citizen, when he ſees men of ſenſe and integrity, (becauſe of a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) lay it down as a rule implicitly to obey the mandates of a court be they ever ſo flagitious. It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, in my opinion, the beſt arguments for the total reduction of the army. But I am running into a tedious eſſay, whereas I ought to confine myſelf to the main deſign and purpoſe of this letter, which is to guard you and your colleagues from thoſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices which the ſame miſcreants, who have infatuated General Gage, and ſtill ſurround him, will labour to inſtil into you againſt a brave, loyal, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving people. The avenues of truth will be ſhut up to you. I aſſert, Sir, that even General Gage will deceive you as he has deceived himſelf; I do not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014148_0005_0F93545566075DE8"/>
ſay he will do it deſignedly. I do not think him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; but his mind is ſo totally poiſoned, and his underſtanding ſo totally blinded by the ſociety of fools and knaves, that he no longer is capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning facts as manifeſt as the noon day ſun. I aſſert Sir, that he is ignorant, that he has from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning been conſumately ignorant of the principles, temper diſpoſition, and force of the colonies. I aſſert, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his letters to the miniſtry, at leaſt ſuch as the public have ſeen, are one continued tiſſue of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, injuſtice, and tortured inferences from misſtated facts. I affirm, Sir, that he has taken no pains to inform himſelf of the truth; that he has never converſed with a man who has had the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or honeſty to tell him the truth.</p>
            <p>I am apprehenſive that you and your colleagues may fall into the ſame trap, and it is the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that you may be inconſiderately hurried by the vigour and activity you poſſeſs, into meaſures which may be fatal to many innocent individuals, may hereafter wound your own feelings, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſerve the cauſe of thoſe who ſent you, that has prompted me to addreſs theſe lines to you. I moſt devoutly wiſh, that your induſtry, valour and military talents, may be reſeved for a more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and virtuous ſervice againſt the natural enemies of your country, (to whom our Court are ſo baſely complacent) and not be waſted in ineffectual attempts to reduce to the wretchedeſt ſtate of ſervitude, the moſt meritorious part of your fellow-ſubjects. I ſay Sir, that any attempts to accompliſh this purpoſe muſt be ineffectual. You cannot poſſibly ſucceed. No man is better acquainted with the ſtate of this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014148_0006_0F93545620812EA8"/>
continent than myſelf. I have ran through almoſt the whole Colonies, from the North to the South, and from the South to the North. I have converſed with all orders of men, from the firſt eſtated gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to the loweſt planters and farmers, and can aſſure you, that the ſame ſpirit animates the whole. Not leſs than an hundred and fifty thouſand gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yeomen, and farmers, are now in arms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to preſerve their liberties or periſh As to the idea that the Americans are deficient in courage, it is too ridiculous and glaringly falſe to deſerve a ſerious refutation. I never could conceive upon what this notion was founded. I ſerved ſeveral campaigns in America laſt war, and cannot recollect a ſingle inſtance of ill behaviour in the Provincials, where the Regulars acquitted themſelves well. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we well remember ſome inſtances of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, particularly where the late Colonel Grant, (he who lately pledged himſelf for the general cowardice of America) ran away with a large body of his own regiment, and was ſaved from deſtruction by the valour of a few Virginians. Such prepoſterous arguments are only proper for the Rigby's and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich's, from whoſe mouths never iſſued, and to whoſe breaſts truth and decency are utter ſtrangers. You will much oblige me in communicating this letter to General Howe, to whom I could wiſh it ſhould in ſome meaſure addreſſed, as well as to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mr. Howe is a man for whom I have ever had the higeſt love and reverence. I have honoured him for his own connections, but above all for his admirable talents and good qualities. I have courted his acquaintance and friendſhip, not only as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014148_0007_0F935456E65AD518"/>
but as an ornament; I flattered myſelf that I had obtained it Gracious God! is it poſſible that Mr. Howe ſhould be prevailed upon to accept of ſuch an office! The brother of him, to whoſe memory the much injured people of Boſton erected a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be employed as one of the inſtruments of their deſtruction! But the faſhion of the times it ſeems is ſuch, as renders it impoſſible that he ſhould avoid it. The commands of our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, are to cancel all moral obligations, to ſanctify every action, even thoſe that the Satrap of an Eaſtern Deſpot would ſtart at. I ſhall now beg leave to ſay a few words with reſpect to myſelf and the part I act. I was bred up from my infancy in the higheſt veneration for the liberties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general. What I have ſeen of Courts and Princes convinces me, that power cannot be lodged in worſe hands than in theirs; and of all Courts I am perſuaded that ours is the moſt corrupt and hoſtile to the rights of humanity. I am convinced that a regular plan has been laid (indeed every act ſince the preſent acceſſion, evinces it) to aboliſh even the ſhadow of liberty from amongſt us. It was not the demolition of the tea, it was not any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act of the Boſtonians, or of the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which conſtituted their crimes. But it is the noble ſpirit of liberty manifeſtly pervading the whole continent, which has rendered them the objects of miniſterial and royal vengeance. Had they been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly of another diſpoſition, had they been <hi>homines ad ſervitudinem paratos,</hi> they might have made as free with the property of the Eaſt-India company as the felonious North himſelf with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014148_0008_0F935457AFD679A8"/>
But the Lords of St. James's and their mercenaries of St. Stephen's well know, that as long as the free ſpirit of this great continent remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued, the progreſs they can make in their ſcheme of univerſal deſpotiſm, will be but trifling. Hence it is that they wage inexpiable war againſt America. In ſhort, this is the laſt aſylum of perſecuted liberty. Here ſhould the machinations and fury of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies prevail, that bright Goddeſs muſt fly off from the face of the earth, and leave not a trace behind. Theſe, Sir, are my principles; this is my perſuaſion, and conſequentially I am determined to act. I have now, Sir, only to entreat that whatever meaſures you purſue, whether thoſe which your real friends (myſelf amongſt them) would wiſh, or unfortunately thoſe which our accurſed miſrulers ſhall dictate, you will ſtill believe me to be perſonally, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſincerity and affection,</p>
