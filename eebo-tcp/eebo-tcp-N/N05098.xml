            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there are <hi>two</hi> Sorts of <hi>Creatures</hi> in <hi>this visible World</hi> in general, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) <hi>Material,</hi> as the Elements &amp;c. (2) <hi>Moral,</hi> as the Race of Men, who are capable of forming some Conception of the Being, Perfections, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Works, Designs and Will of God; so there must needs be a <hi>twofold Government</hi> of their Creator over them, agreable to their different Natures, viz. (1) <hi>Physical</hi> or <hi>Natural,</hi> and (2) <hi>Moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Physical</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Government of God is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in his continual ordering all material Substances and whatever is formed of them, in the main, according to those particular Methods which he sees most proper for the Accomplishment of all those wise Designs for which He at first created them. Thus he continually causes the Sun and fixed Stars to send forth their Rays, the Moon and other Planets to reflect them, or the Rays themselves to fly; the Revolutions of Day and Night, and the several Seasons of the Year; with various Sorts of Attractions, Cohaerences, Repulsions, Ascentions and Descentions, and

other Operations among the Elements; the wondrous Formations, Growings and Fruitfulness of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Variety of Plants and Animals; the more wondrous Unions of spiritual Substances to material Bodies, with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Faculties, Powers and mutual Influences; the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Increase and Decay of those Powers, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and Dissolution of those Unions &amp;c: and all these for a vast Variety of extensive and wise Designs in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Succession as long as he sees proper.</p>
            <p>In such Things as these does the <hi>Physical</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Government of God consist. And as every Action and Effect of his have their most fitting Place in his universal System, and he is every where equally always present; It seems most likely that in every Action and Effect He always has a perfect View to every other Action &amp; Effect, both past, present and to come, thro'out the Universe.</p>
            <p>But his <hi>moral</hi> Government in <hi>this lower World,</hi> is his accommodating all his Operations even among material Substances, to the <hi>moral</hi> Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> the principal Creature he has produced therein; and for whose immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Use he has chiefly made the Earth itself, with all the Elements, Plants, brutal Animals and other Creatures; given and continues to them their various Natures, Forms and Virtues: And for the Sake of <hi>Man,</hi> immediately and chiefly, next to his own Glory, it is, that he therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises even his <hi>natural</hi> Government above described.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>moral</hi> Government, I would say, He acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>moral</hi> Nature, Faculties and Powers of <hi>Men</hi>; whom he has made to be moral Agents, capable of some Knowlege of Him, of his Being, Perfections, Works, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, Will and Government; are therefore under indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible Obligations of paying Him a suitable Respect, and must therefore be accountable to Him; must be wicked, guilty and exposed to Punishment when they do not yield Him that Respect they owe Him: and when they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves before Him, thro' the Mediation of His SON and his boundless Grace, may hope to see, sooner or later, the Tokens of his undeserved Mercy &amp; Benignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006408_0007_1028B62739E190E0"/>And both this <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Government of God is abundantly observed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> in this Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> especially, and in particular in the <hi>Words before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.] His <hi>natural</hi> Government; in <hi>two</hi> contrary Kinds of providential Operations, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In bringing grievous Droughts on a Land. Ver. 33, 34 <hi>He turneth Rivers into a Wilderness, and the Water-Springs into dry Ground, a fruitful Land into Barrenness.</hi> i. e. By drying up the Brooks and <hi>Rivers,</hi> He turns the Channels where they slowed, into silent, solitary &amp; empty Spaces, like <hi>a Wilderness:</hi> By exhausting the <hi>Springs of Water,</hi> He turns their Places into <hi>Ground</hi> intirely <hi>dry</hi>; and by such a Drought he turns <hi>a fruitful Land</hi> into a State of <hi>Barrenness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In changing his providential Operation to quite the contrary, by giving plenteous &amp; reviving Rains. Ver. 35. <hi>He turneth the Wilderness into a standing Water, and dry Ground into Water-Springs.</hi> i. e. By bringing on abundant Showers, and therewith filling every vacant Place and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the lower Grounds, He turns a great Part of the Land which was like a parched <hi>Wilderness</hi> into the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Pools of Water</hi>; and the <hi>Ground</hi> which was intirely <hi>dry,</hi> he fills again with rising and overflowing <hi>Springs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.] We have then his <hi>moral</hi> Government in the <hi>former afflictive Dispensation</hi> to a Land or People, signified by this Expression in Ver. 34. — <hi>for the Wickedness of them that dwell therein.</hi> i. e. As he continually exercises a <hi>natural</hi> Government among the Elements, and wisely <hi>brings a great Drought on a Land,</hi> and knows this Drought is very grievous; so he brings it <hi>for the Wickedness of the People that dwell therein</hi>; and this he would have them know by such an afflictive and corrective Work of his, and so be excited to humble themselves before him, repent of their Offences, return in their Submission to Him, and implore his Mercy; especially seek him to forgive them, to change the Course of his Dispensations, and to grant them needful and sufficient Showers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4"
                   facs="unknown:006408_0008_1028B628C0121100"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>And tho' in the following Verse, we have mentioned only the contrary Instance of his meer <hi>natural</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>turning the Wilderness into a standing Water, and dry Ground into Water-Springs</hi>; yet I think we must needs suppose that this Change of Dispensation was an Instance of his <hi>moral</hi> Government also, as well as the other: i. e. as he had brought on them an <hi>afflictive Drought</hi> for their Sins against him; so thereby he brought them to some Confession of their Sins, some Humiliation for them, with solemn Prayers for Deliverance and Rain: and then as a Token of his approving their Confessions, Humiliations &amp; Prayers, or that just Homage they therein had paid him; He changes the Course of his providential Operations, and gives them <hi>Showers</hi> in <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Plenty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there seems to be the same Reason why in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent probationary State He should exercise a <hi>moral</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one Case as in the other.—i. e. When he had sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his Displeasure by bringing on them a distressing Drought for their Sins against Him, which would have a Tendency to lead them to Humiliations and Prayers; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when they humble themselves and cry for Mercy, He should equally signify the Removal or Abatement of his Displeasure, at least in such a Degree as to change the Course of his Dispensation, take off his chastizing Hand and give them the implored Mercy. And this seems therefore to be implied also, tho' not expressed in the Text before us.</p>
            <p>But for further Illustration, I shall endeavour as the Hour allows, to consider briefly these two general Heads:

I am going to treat on a noble Subject of <hi>Divinity</hi>; viz. on the wise, mighty and constant <hi>Operations</hi> of GOD — to rescue some of you from that Branch of Atheism we are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inclined to by Nature, in limitting our Views to the <hi>meer Operation</hi> of <hi>created Instruments</hi>—and lead you to see the glorious GOD Himself acting in them; that you may be moved to some becoming Adorations of him, and to yield him his due Returns of Glory. Yea as all Things were made both by and for the SON <hi>of</hi> GOD, consist in Him, and are governed by Him, I would have you raise your Views to him as <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in these various Actions and Dispensations.</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] In bringing <hi>grievous Droughts</hi> on a Land.</p>

            <p n="1">1.] The <hi>principal Instruments</hi> He uses.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Descent</hi> of the <hi>Waters</hi> into the <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the want of <hi>Water</hi> is the main immediate Cause of <hi>Droughts,</hi> it may be convenient to observe; that the Creator of all Things did at first from nothing bring into Being a great Variety of <hi>material Substances</hi> for various Ends and Uses in this lower World. Some are <hi>fixed</hi>; as all Sorts of earthy Substances, Metals, Minerals, Stones, Salts &amp;c: Others <hi>fluid</hi>; as Quicksilver, <hi>Water,</hi> Oil, <hi>Air,</hi> &amp;c: And 'tis likely, that by various Pressures, Fractures, Divisions, or Coalitions, every Kind of material Thing may seemingly at least be changed into any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Water</hi> is a great Part of the material Substance GOD has made for various Uses in this lower World. And this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006408_0010_1028B62B9B686F08"/>

               </note> By these Properties &amp; the various Operations of the GOD of Nature in and by them, He has most wisely fitted them to roll along and carry all other Sorts of material Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thro' the Channels He forms in Plants and Animals to their proper Parts, both to increase their Bulk, supply the Places of those that fly off continually, and form their various Sorts of Fruit and Seed; yea to make up a Part of their Consistency, and keep them moist &amp; soft, or by the Beams of the Sun and their Perspirations only they would soon grow dry, and either hard or firm, or brittle and turn to Powder.</p>
            <p>Without this Sort of Substance therefore there could be no such Thing as Growth or Fruit either in Plants or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, nor Continuance neither: but were they ever so well formed in the present State of Nature here below, they would soon waste away, dissolve, and loose all their Form and Usefulness; yea no living Creature could subsist, and 'twould not be wise to make them.</p>
            <p>But upon every Shower of Rain we see a great Part of the Water hastily descending to the lower Grounds, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Brooks, running into Rivers and pouring into the Sea. And tho' a considerable Part soaks into the Earth, and partly penetrates into the Roots of Vegetables, and rises in their Stocks and Branches to promote their Nourishment; and another Part appears to ascend in Vapours; yet it chiefly sinks into various Layers, Canals
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006408_0011_1028B62D53015370"/>
and Fountains, and thence breaks out in Springs or runs thro' other Passages into the Sea, which swallows all. And by this Descent the Ground grows drier every Day: and unless recruited with a fresh Supply of Rain, the Surface of the Earth would soon lose its Moisture, the very Springs and Rivers fail, and every Herb and Tree would wither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Ascent</hi> of <hi>many</hi> into the Canals of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> partly adding to their Nourishment, and partly perspiring thro' them into the Air.</p>
            <p>Every green Leaf and Spire of every Tree and Plant is composed mainly of Multitudes of little Bottles to receive a Part of the Rain and Dews: and from those little Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles are Canals dispersed into various Parts of the Plant, to convey a quick Refreshment: while a Part of the Rain descending abroad and sinking to the Fibres of the Roots, it enters them, and then ascends in innumerable Vesicles and Tubes thro' every Part of the Plant, to give a further Nourishment; and having done its Office, the Rest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires into the Air and dissipates: and without a fresh Supply in the Summer, the Plant grows drier &amp; drier, till it fades and dies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The active, swift, piercing, ratifying <hi>Beams</hi> &amp; <hi>Atoms</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Beams</hi> of the Sun are exceeding subtil, active, piercing; they proceed with wondrous Swiftness, of above <hi>ten Million Miles</hi> in a Minute: they fly perpetually and penetrate the Plants and Surface of the Earth: they are ever making powerful Impressions on every Particle, and giving additional Powers and Motions to every Atom of every Fluid they come to. They carry a wondrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive Power with them, <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Isaac Newton</hi> observing the Rays of Light reflecting and bending when they come near the Surface of Bodies without touching them, supposes an invisible, <hi>extremely fine active</hi> and <hi>universal Fluid</hi> as the Cause of this <hi>Repulsion.</hi> But with the utmost Submission to so superior a Judgment, I would humbly suggest whether it be not as probable that <hi>every Atom</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> if not of <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>other Substances,</hi> may have an <hi>elastical Atmosphere</hi> about it, charged with a repulsive Power; and whether this elastical Atmosphere may not be the main Source &amp; Instrument of Thunder, Lightning, the Aurora Bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis, Electricity, and some other Phaenomena in Nature?</note> and are of greater Force

            <p n="4">4. and lastly, The <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Winds</hi> carrying the watery Vapours from us.</p>
            <p>For tho' the solar Rays and Atoms are continually rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vast Quantities of Vapours from the Seas into the Air, sufficient to supply the Earth, with all the Vegetables, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Springs and Rivers thereon with Water; yet the Winds are needful to bring them over the Land, in order to their forming into Clouds above it, and shedding down in Rain upon it: or they would chiefly form in Clouds above the Surface whence they rise and fall down to the Seas again. The repulsive and expansive Powers among them may be indeed sufficient to bring so many over the neighbouring Shoars in the Day as to come down in Dews at Night: But if the Winds either blow them not over us, or blow them quite beyond us before they collect in Drops, and much more blow the Vapours rising from our Land to the airy Regions over other Places; no Supply of Rain will follow here, and the Drought among us will increase continually; 'till, as the Scriptures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it, <hi>the Heavens over us become as Brass, the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

            <p>This is done by what is called by some the Power of <hi>Gravity,</hi> by some the Power of <hi>Attraction,</hi> but by others, and I think more properly the Power of <hi>Pressure,</hi> from some internal and invisible Agent; whereby all Sorts of material Substances in this <hi>Planetary System</hi> within the Sphere of <hi>Saturn,</hi> above <hi>fifteen Hundred Million</hi> Miles Diameter, <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> computes the <hi>Diameter</hi> above <hi>fifteen Hundred and fifty Millions</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Gregory</hi> above <hi>eighteen Hundred and ninety Millions:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> intends the <hi>mean</hi> Diameter, and Dr. <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>longest.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006408_0014_1028B63897A982A8"/>'Tis by this powerful <hi>Impetus,</hi> that all the Waters in the Earth above the Level of the Sea descend into it. But this Power can be no other than even the actual Power of GOD <hi>Himself</hi> moving them along to that great Fountain he has prepared for them. For <hi>material</hi> Substances are plainly unintelligent, unvoluntary, unconscious, un-self-active, un-self-moving Things, and are only subject to be moved by some other Kind of Agent: and it appears most clearly to every careful Inquirer, that this Power which moves them is both every where always present thro' out this vast planetary System, always acting on every Particle therein, perfectly intelligent, wise and regular in all its Actions, without the least Mistake or Intermission: and such a universal, powerful, all-knowing, wise and constant Agent, can be none but GOD. Thus, as in Psal. civ.10. <hi>He sendeth the Springs into the Valleys, which run among the Hills</hi>; Ver. 6,—8. <hi>The Waters go down by the Valleys unto the Place which Thou hast founded for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Ascent</hi> of <hi>many Waters</hi> into <hi>Plants</hi>—</p>
            <p>This is a Motion looking contrary to the former Power of <hi>Gravitation:</hi> and seems to be owing partly to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous <hi>Forms</hi> of the several Fibres, Tubes and other Parts of Vegetables; partly to the <hi>Attraction</hi> between the Juices and the Sides and upper Parts of their containing Vessels; partly to the <hi>elastical Air</hi> within them ever contracting and dilating; and partly to the piercing and rarifying <hi>Heat</hi> of the Sun, which putting their Juices into a State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion and altering the elastical Consistence of the Air among them or in their neighbouring Vessels, forces the watery Particles upwards in their Vesicles and Tubes to every Part &amp; thro' their Extremities into the Atmosphere.</p>
            <p>But so curiously and wisely formed is every <hi>Vegetable</hi> for this and other Designs, that none who nicely examines them can think that any other than a wise and universal Agent ever a working all over the Earth can be their Former, which is none but GOD.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Air's Elasticity</hi>; it is that Sort of Power whereby it is capable of being compressed &amp; dilated, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006408_0015_1028B63CA49E4480"/>
when forcibly compressed, as the Pressure ceases, the Air will ever immediately return to its natural Expansion, till it comes at least to a Ballance with the Power of <hi>Gravitation:</hi> and this expansive Power is so wonderful as to be dilatea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to above <hi>fifty Thousand</hi> times greater Extent of Space at some Times than at others. <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> found <hi>fifty Thousand</hi> times: Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> computes <hi>one Hundred and eighty Thousand</hi> times: But Mr. <hi>B. Martin</hi> says, that by the bare Power of its Spring it will dilate into <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Thousand</hi> times greater <hi>Space than it possesses on the Surface of the Globe,</hi> &amp; yet may be compressed by Force into <hi>sixty</hi> times <hi>less</hi> Space than <hi>this:</hi> So that the Air may dilate itself to <hi>seven Hundred and eighty Thousand</hi> times greater Extent than it may be compressed to.</note> But tho' the Author of Nature, for various Uses permits us to compress it to a great Degree, and in some Degree compresses it Himself by his Power of Gravity; yet in this he ever bounds <hi>our</hi> Power, as no Power of Man can so compress it as to make its Particles touch or unite into a compact Body. And as this irresistible Power on the one Hand, and this expansive Power on the other is universally existing and continually and most regularly and wisely acting; it is as evidently the acting Power of GOD, tho' acting in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Manner, as is that of <hi>Gravitation.</hi> By such Means as these the inspired Poet sings, in Psal. civ.16. <hi>The Trees of the Lord are full of Sap, the Cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted</hi>: And Ver. 14. <hi>He causeth the Grass and Herb to grow.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. As to the active, swift, piercing, rarifying <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Atoms</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> —</p>
            <p>Of these there are many wondrous Properties: and every one displays the universal Presence, Wisdom, Power and Agency of GOD. But I would now only consider their surprizing <hi>Force</hi> &amp; <hi>Swiftness.</hi> And as from the Creation they have been constantly and directly flying from that great central Source of Light &amp; Heat to its whole System of Planets and Satellits, above a <hi>Million</hi> times faster than

a Ball out of a Cannon in its greatest Celerity; <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> computes above a <hi>Million,</hi> &amp; <hi>B. Martin</hi> since—above <hi>fifteen Hundred Thousand</hi> times faster.</note> Who can imagine they could do so without a perpetual Source and Exertion of Almighty Energy? And who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine these Millions of Millions of Millions of Rays continually and most regularly and wisely emitted and carried along directly, without a divine Presence, Knowlege Wisdom and Power in perpetual Concert &amp; Operation?</p>
            <p>For such a Being must be perpetually present &amp; active not only with these innumerable Millions of <hi>Rays,</hi> but even with every one of the innumerable Millions of <hi>Atoms</hi> in every <hi>Ray</hi>; giving this amazing Force to every <hi>Atom</hi> as it leaves the Sun, forcing it up from this vast Body which has above <hi>two Hundred Thousand Times</hi> more attractive Matter than our <hi>Earth,</hi> in Opposition to this other Power of <hi>Gravitation,</hi> perpetually moving and guiding them in so quick and exact a Manner that not a Ray or Atom should slide astray; and in so vast a Multitude &amp; Progress as continually to fill the <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> all round about the <hi>Sun,</hi> above <hi>fifteen</hi> or <hi>eighteen Hundred Million</hi> Miles Diameter, as we observed before: Yea were the <hi>whole concave Surface</hi> of this <hi>vast Sphere</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> as solid as the Surface of that Planet; by the constant flying of the Sun-Beams to it and reflecting from it to us, <hi>the whole concave Surface</hi> of that mighty Sphere all around us would continually shine as bright as he. But how many Millions of Miles the Sun-Beams are continually fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further, even as far as some of the <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> which appear also to be other Suns at immeasurable Distances, is yet undiscovered, and beyond Description. <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> &amp; other Astronomers compute the mean Distance of the <hi>Sun</hi> from <hi>us</hi> to be <hi>eighty one Million</hi> Miles; and Dr. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the farthest Distance—above <hi>ninety four Million:</hi> And from Mr <hi>Bradley</hi>'s wonderful Discovery of the Parrallax of the bright Star in the Head of Draco; Dr. <hi>Desaguliers</hi> computes, that this <hi>fixed Star</hi> shines so brightly to us above <hi>four Hundred Thousand</hi> times farther than from the <hi>Sun</hi> to <hi>us.</hi>
               </note> But they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006408_0017_1028B64146EDA2C8"/>
all demonstrate the constant Agency of GOD Himself in these innumerable, mighty &amp; unceasing Actions. Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this we read in Psal. lxxiv.16 <hi>Thou hast prepared the Light and the Sun</hi>: Mat v.45. <hi>He maketh his Sun to rise</hi>: Isai. xlv.7. <hi>I form the Light</hi>: And Job xxv.3. <hi>Upon whom doth not his Light arise</hi>?</p>
            <p n="4">4. and lastly. As to the <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Winds</hi> carrying the watery Vapours from us—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Winds</hi> are only Air in Motion and directed in a sensible Current from one Part of the Atmosphere towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And their instrumental Causes seem to be in general, partly the <hi>solar Beams and Atoms</hi> either direct or reflex, or dispersed, or all, making unequal <hi>Rarefactions,</hi> and partly <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Cold,</hi> making unequal <hi>Condensations</hi> in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere; whereby either a greater expansive Force or a greater Power of Gravitation in one Part than another, bares on the neighbouring Part where there is the least Resistance, and drives the Air before it, till the bearing and resisting Forces come to a Ballance, and then ensues a <hi>Calm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all those Actions both of Radiation, Gravitation and Expansion we have shown already to be the Exertion of the Power of GOD in those Ways and Instruments. And the same may be said of <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Cold</hi> and their powerful Condensations. For tho' <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> are only contrary Sensations in us; yet as some Sort of <hi>Atoms</hi> which may be called <hi>Sulphureous,</hi> seem to be peculiarly fitted to <hi>rarify</hi> and give us the Sensation of <hi>Heat,</hi> so some other Sort of <hi>Particles</hi> which may be called <hi>nitrous</hi> seem to be fitted to <hi>condense</hi> and give us the Sensation of <hi>Cold.</hi> But they being <hi>alike material,</hi> must needs derive their Force from GOD: and in all their Actions it must be his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Power exerted in them. So that all the Rise, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Directions, Forces &amp; Effects of the Winds are justly to be ascribed to Him.</p>
            <p>But tho' he may <hi>commonly</hi> operate in those various Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances according to the <hi>particular Methods</hi> he has seen fit to appoint for his <hi>usual Action</hi> in them; yet for certain
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006408_0018_1028B642D4211B50"/>
Reasons I cannot but apprehend, that the Case of <hi>Winds</hi> is one of those Cases wherein he does not always confine Himself to those usual Methods, but has <hi>wisely reserved</hi> his <hi>Liberty</hi> of varying from them, and often improves it when he sees proper: <note n="(k)" place="bottom">See something further of <hi>these reserved Cases</hi> at the End of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> general Head.</note> So that unknown to us, He raises, moves, directs, increases and abates the Winds, both where and when, and in what Degree he pleases, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his wise Designs.</p>
            <p>Agreable to this, Inspiration tells us, that '<hi>He who createth the Wind—the Lord God of Hosts is his Name,</hi> Amos iv.13: that <hi>He commandeth and raiseth the stormy Wind,</hi> Psal. cvii 25: that <hi>He bringeth the Wind out of his Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> Psal. cxxxv.7: that <hi>he causeth his Wind to blow,</hi> Psal. cxlvii.18: that <hi>he maketh the Clouds his Chariot, &amp; walketh upon the Wings of the Wind,</hi> Psal. civ.3: and that <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, stormy Wind</hi> are <hi>fulfilling his Word,</hi> Psal. cxlviii.8.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seen something of the <hi>natural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Agency</hi> of GOD in bringing <hi>Droughts</hi> on a Land. And by such Means as these he puts forth his Power, and we may say as <hi>Job,</hi> in Chap xii.15. <hi>Behold be with-holdeth the Waters, and they dry up:</hi> As <hi>Asaph,</hi> Psal. lxxiv.15. <hi>Thou driest up mighty Rivers</hi>: or as the Prophet, Nah. 1.4, 5. <hi>He drieth up all the Rivers; Bashan languisheth, &amp; Carmel, and the Flower of Lebanon languisheth; the Earth is burnt at his Presence, yea the World and all that dwell therein.</hi>

            <p>And here we may observe, that as the <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> in giving <hi>Rains</hi> are chiefly the same he uses in producing <hi>Droughts,</hi> tho' some he employs in a different Way; we may be therefore briefer in treating on them.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the great Reservatories and perpetual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from whence the Rain is drawn: The watery Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in their Surface, being first divided from the Salts adhering to it, then raised into the Atmosphere, expanded, carried about by Winds, formed into Clouds, joined in Drops, distilled in Showers; some infused and rising into Plants and perspiring in the Air, the rest running into Springs and Rivers, then by constant Circulations returning to the <hi>Seas</hi> again; and from thence employed on the same Kinds of Circuits and Designs, in perpetual Revolutions. So <hi>Solomon</hi> observed above <hi>twenty seven Hundred Years</hi> ago, Eccles. i.4. <hi>All the Rivers run into the Sea; yet the Sea is not full; unto the Place from whence the Rivers come, thither they return again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Springs and Rivers run into the <hi>Seas,</hi> and without a fresh Supply from thence wou'd quickly fail, the Earth grow dry, and every Herb and Tree wou'd wither; the arduous Question is — How shall the <hi>Water</hi> which is 800 Times heavier than <hi>Air</hi> in Winter, 850 in the Spring and Fall, and 900 in Summer,<note n="(l)" place="bottom">So Dr. <hi>Desaguliers</hi> in the <hi>Transactions of the Royal Society.</hi>
               </note> rise up against all the Laws and Power of <hi>Gravity,</hi> into this vastly lighter Medium, and form in Clouds, and there for a Time sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and float aloft on this thinner Element, till it unites

in Drops and falls in Showers? And especially how can these Waters rise, when every <hi>square Foot</hi> Column of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> is found to press with a Weight of above <hi>two Thousand Pounds</hi> on every <hi>Foot square</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> in the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Seas and Earth? <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> found the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> to press on a <hi>square Foot</hi> with a Weight of <hi>twenty one Hundred and sixty eight</hi> Pounds Averdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise, or <hi>twenty six Hundred and ten</hi> Pounds Troy.</note> One wou'd be apt to think that here they wou'd be bound down for ever.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The primary Means of their rising seem to be, the exceeding active, swift, peircing, separating, rarifying <hi>Rays</hi> and <hi>Atoms</hi> from the Sun.</p>
            <p>How they operate we have considered before: And shall here only observe, that as the <hi>Sun</hi> is computed about <hi>eighty one Millions</hi> of Miles from the Earth, they fly this Distance in about <hi>eight Minutes</hi>; and in a hot Summer's Day, they divide and raise a <hi>tenth</hi> Part of an <hi>Inch</hi> from the Surface of <hi>Water</hi>; which from every <hi>four Foot square</hi> will make a <hi>Gallon,</hi> and from every <hi>square Mile</hi> above <hi>six Thousand Tons.</hi> 
               <note n="(n)" place="bottom">So Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> in the <hi>Transactions of the Royal Society.</hi>
               </note> And as these divided <hi>Globlues</hi> rise, they are by the repulsive and reflecting Atoms of Heat, so rarified or driven so far asunder from each other, as to extend to <hi>two Thousand</hi> Times greater Space than they did as they lay in the compact Form of Water; till the <hi>rarifying Force</hi> diminishes and comes to a Ballance with the other <hi>Power of Gravitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The mutually <hi>attractive Powers</hi> between the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> above, and our <hi>Atmosphere</hi> and <hi>Waters</hi> below.</p>
            <p>For, to speak in the usual Style, as <hi>those great Bodies</hi> every Day pass over the <hi>Seas,</hi> the Waters nearly under them rise up towards them: And tho' the <hi>Moon</hi> be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly less than the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet she is so much nearer to us, being but about <hi>two Hundred and forty Thousand Miles,</hi> that our <hi>Seas</hi> rise <hi>five</hi> Times higher towards <hi>Her,</hi> than
<pb n="17"
                   facs="unknown:006408_0021_1028B64DE17984E0"

towards the <hi>other</hi>; <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Isaac Newton</hi> in his <hi>Principia</hi> says, when the <hi>Sea</hi> rises to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sun,</hi> one Foot eleven Inches and an Eighth of an Inch, it rises towards the <hi>Moon</hi> eight Feet and eight Inches: which is a little above <hi>four &amp; an half</hi> Times more towards the <hi>Moon</hi> than towards the <hi>Sun:</hi> But Mr. <hi>B. Martin</hi> says, Mr. <hi>Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> has since found it to be <hi>five</hi> times more to the <hi>Moon</hi> than <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </note> and this higher Rise is called the <hi>Tides.</hi> And tho' the <hi>Attraction</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly are insufficient to divide a single Globule of Water from the <hi>Sea</hi>; yet as they either jointly or separately go over it, the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Attraction</hi> in the <hi>Waters</hi> towards the <hi>Earth</hi> must in Proportion be abated, and therefore more easily and plenteously raised by the solar Atoms; and the <hi>watery Globules</hi> being once divided, rarified and raised into the Air, the less is their <hi>Attraction</hi> towards the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the greater in Proportion towards <hi>those heavenly Bodies.</hi> And as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are every Day passing round our Globe; even the whole <hi>Atmosphere</hi> nearly under them, unless prevented by other Powers, successively rises to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, increases its Extension, and helps the Vapours upward. Tho' after all, the superiour Power of the <hi>Earth</hi>'s Attraction, being so near these Vapours, as long as it continues, will hinder every Atom of <hi>Air &amp; Water,</hi> tho' not of <hi>Light,</hi> from flying away.</p>
            <p>Thus we in some Measure see how the <hi>Waters</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> are raised into the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> in great Abundance, and thereby Preparations made for plenteous Showers. But how shall they come over us and rain down upon us? To this I answer,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Winds</hi> are a principal Instrument in bringing both the raised <hi>Vapours</hi> and condensing <hi>Cold</hi> or <hi>Nitre</hi> over us.</p>
            <p>For tho' the rarifying Powers we mentioned before have a Tendency to spread the Vapours raised from the Sea into the Atmosphere over the Shoars and Countries round about; yet as some particular Winds may either hinder their coming over us in plenty, or carry them away before
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006408_0022_1028B650AB91F610"/>
they contract in Clouds and Drops, and thereby continue and increase a Drought among us; so other Winds may both bring and make them meet and croud above us in great Abundance, and both drive the Atoms of Heat away, which kept up their Rarifaction and hindered their Condensation, and may also bring a nitrous, cold or less warm Air, which helps to condense the rarified Vapours into Clouds and Drops.</p>
            <p n="5">5 and lastly,— The <hi>uniting</hi> them in <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Drops</hi> by the Powers of <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Attraction,</hi> and their <hi>Descent</hi> in <hi>Rain</hi> by the <hi>latter</hi> of these two Powers.</p>
            <p>Whether the Particles causing <hi>Cold</hi> be a peculiar Kind of Substance, or are only without that Motion which causes Heat; it is enough that what we call the Particles of <hi>Cold,</hi> help to contract the watery Vapours, or bring them so near together as sensibly to intercept so great a Number of Rays of Light, that we cannot see the Skie, and then they appear in the Form of <hi>Clouds.</hi> 
               <note n="(p)" place="bottom">The <hi>Particles of Cold</hi> seem to be unequally dispersed thro' the <hi>Atmosphere:</hi> And as there seems to be a peculiar <hi>Repulsion</hi> between them and the <hi>solar</hi> or <hi>sulphureous</hi> Atoms on the one Hand, so a peculiar <hi>Attraction</hi> between them and the <hi>watery</hi> Globules on the other. And as <hi>Heat</hi> may be more or less, either according to the Number or Degree of Activity of the <hi>sulphureous</hi> Atoms, so may <hi>Cold</hi> be more or less, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Number or Degree of Activity of the <hi>nitrous</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. When the <hi>solar</hi> or <hi>sulphureous</hi> Atoms therefore become in any Part of the Atmosphere either fewer in Number, or weaker in Action; the less are the <hi>nitrous</hi> Particles interrupted in their Action, and the more freely &amp; fully do they exert their Power. In their <hi>smaller</hi> Numbers or Degrees of Action, they seem only to <hi>condense</hi> the watery Globules, or draw them nearer to each other, and so form them into <hi>Clouds:</hi> but in <hi>greater</hi> Numbers or Degrees of Action, <hi>freeze</hi> them: and in freezing act so powerfully as not only to fix the purest &amp; most fluent Globlues of Water into <hi>Snow, Hail</hi> and <hi>Ice,</hi> but even to break the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> of an <hi>Iron Gun</hi> enclosing them; and in a strong <hi>brass Cylinder</hi> of two or three Inches Diameter, to force up a Weight of <hi>two Hundred</hi> &amp; <hi>fifty four Pounds</hi> against all the Pressure of the incumbent Atmosphere: as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> observed.</note> And the like
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006408_0023_1028B6522F445B68"/>
no doubt is also the Effect of the <hi>Attractive Power</hi> of these watery Vapours, when it is not hindered by the contrary <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Repulsion</hi> or <hi>Expansion</hi> from the more powerful Atoms of Light and Heat.</p>
            <p>Yea 'tis highly probable, that by the <hi>interchangeable Predominance</hi> of all those Powers, occasioned by the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Day and Night, and the different Seasons of the Year and other instrumental Causes — the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> round the Globe, is continually in every Part, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding above or contracting within it's <hi>Ballance</hi> of Gravitation, and that this is a main, continual Source of our Varieties of Winds and Weather. While by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> it is expanding over us or kept above the Ballance, we have <hi>droughty</hi> Weather: And when by the contrary <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Gravitation</hi> it contracts and comes below the Ballance, the watery Vapours draw nearer to each other till they Form in <hi>Clouds</hi>; and as their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Power predominates, they join in <hi>Drops</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend in <hi>Showers.</hi>

            <p>But here we must also observe, that when he has raised <hi>so many Millions of Tons of Water</hi> into the <hi>Air</hi> and hangs them over us like heavy Mountains; then he by the same merciful Power restrains them, holds them up, &amp; permits them not to run into <hi>mighty Lakes</hi> or <hi>Cataracts</hi> at once, and overwhelm and drown us; but joins the watery Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules only into Drops one after another, and so distills them, sometimes for several Days together, as the Trees Herbs and Corn can bear them. So <hi>Job</hi> observed with grateful Wonder, Chap. xxvi.8. <hi>He bindeth up the Waters in his thick Clouds, and the Cloud is not rent under them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Part of the <hi>Agency of</hi> GOD in giving Plenty of <hi>Rains.</hi> And thus the Prophet even repeatedly assures us, Amos v.8. and ix 6 <hi>He calleth for the Waters of the Sea, and poureth them out on the Face of the Earth.</hi> So the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poet in Psal. cxlvii.8. <hi>Who covereth the Heavens with Clouds, who prepareth Rain for the Earth.</hi> And then, as <hi>Elibu</hi> describes it in Job xxxvi.27, 28. <hi>He maketh small the Drops of Water: they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof: which the Clouds do drop and distil upon Man abundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have we briefly considered the <hi>natural Agency</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of GOD both in bringing grievous <hi>Droughts</hi> and plenteous <hi>Rains</hi> on a Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006408_0029_1028B662025EA0E0"/>And yet after all our Searchings, his Ways of acting in these Matters are not fully discovered to us. So <hi>Eliphaz</hi> seems to intimate, when he speaks of GOD in such Terms as these, Job v.9, 10. <hi>Which doth great Things and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable, marvellous Things without Number; Who giveth Rain upon the Earth &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as we observed under the Head of <hi>Winds</hi>— In <hi>these and other Cases,</hi> we should not dare to apprehend that the Sovereign GOD in governing this lower World intirely confines Himself to act according to his common Course of Nature; but most wisely and justly <hi>reserves the Liberty of acting otherwise</hi> on all Occasions when he sees most fitting.</p>
            <p>Such like <hi>reserved Cases</hi> seem to be Earthquakes, Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes &amp; Tempests; Storms of Wind, Rain, Thunder, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Snow &amp; Hail, with the raging of the Seas; &amp; indeed all Kinds of Weather, hot &amp; dry, cold &amp; wet; the Rising of nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Vapours out of the Earth, the Corruption of the Air, the Multiplication of Insects and Animalcula, infectious and epidemical Diseases; Multitudes of Alterations in human Bodies; personal Distempers and Mortalities; Lotteries and Accidents; as also innumerable Changes of Ideas and Propensities both in brutal and human Creatures. In all which He rules this lower World and brings about his wise Designs: making all Kinds of Substances indeed, his fitting Instruments and using them; but whenever he sees Occasion, <hi>giving additional Degrees of Powers and different Directions,</hi> or <hi>abating their Degrees of Power</hi> in other Ways than in his common Course of Nature, which is only his usual Way of Operation in them.</p>
            <p>In this Manner he may in the most proper Seasons send both Droughts &amp; Rains, and Sicknesses and Health, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Places</hi>; He may point his Lightnings to particular <hi>Persons</hi>; He may raise a Storm to disperse a <hi>Fleet,</hi> and give additional Powers to a Gust of Wind to overset a <hi>Vessel,</hi> or to the Waves to break her; He may direct <hi>Physicians</hi> to a sufficient Knowlege of the Cases of their Patients, and the suitable Means of their Cure, and give additional Forces and Directions to the <hi>Medicines</hi> in their
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006408_0030_1028B664E0B6E890"/>
inward Operations, or otherwise. And so in Multitudes of other Cases: Or there would be no more need to pray to GOD for a safe Voyage, or a prosperous War, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from Drought, or Plagues or Enemies, or to save in any Sicknesses or Dangers; than to pray in an extream hot Day, that he would make the Sun to go down at the usual Time; or in a dark and cold Night, to rise again; or that he would make the Tide to ebb or flow: which would exceedingly, if not intirely prevent that Reverence of him, which in the present State of human Nature is highly if not absolutely needful, to keep the Race of Men in any tolerable Order, and excite them to pay him their suitable Acknowlegements, both for his own just Glory and their Advantage.</p>
            <p>In short, the Wisdom &amp; Goodness of GOD seem to require a <hi>twofold Kind</hi> of <hi>natural Operation</hi> among his Creatures in our terrestial World, answerable at least to the present Condition of Men therein: — the one Kind more <hi>stated,</hi> as the constant Revolution of Night and Day, and the Seasons of the Year, the Action of Gravitation, the Ebb and Flow of Tides, the shining of the Sun  that so we may not be at all Uncertainties in ordering our Affairs, but may have these universal Necessaries to depend on. But as we need powerful Restraints from gratifying our evil Appetites, and Excitations to all Kinds of Duties, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to GOD our Maker, Owner, Sovereign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Upholder and Benefactor; it seems both <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> that He should also in Multitudes of Cases keep us in Uncertainty, and <hi>occasionally</hi> operate in all Sorts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; that we may constantly see our Dependance on Him, and Need of his gracious Interposals for us, may fear to offend Him, and when he chastens us, may be moved to humble our selves and implore his Mercy in the Change of his Dispensations.</p>
            <p>And such a <hi>wise Scheme</hi> of divine Government as this, the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> clearly give us, as I might easily shew in the abovementioned Cases. In particular, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

taught us, as to <hi>his ordering our Atmosphere,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> xxxvi. and xxxvii. <q>Remember that thou magnify his Work which Men behold! Every Man may see it, Man may behold it afar off. Behold GOD is great, and we know not. For can any understand the Spreadings of the Clouds, or the Noise of his Tabernacle? Behold He spreadeth his Light upon it, and covereth the Bottom of the Sea. For by them judgeth He the People, He giveth Meat in Abundance. With Clouds He covereth the Light, and commandeth it not to shine by the Cloud that cometh betwixt. — Hear attentively the Noise of his Voice, and the Sound that goeth out of his Mouth: He directeth it under the whole Heaven, and his Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings unto the Ends of the Earth:—He thundereth with the Voice of his Excellency—GOD thundreth marvellously with his Voice: Great Things doth He which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend. For he saith to the Snow, Be thou on the Earth; likewise to the small Rain, and to the great Rain of his Strength: He sealeth up the Hand of every Man, that all Men may know his Work: Out of the South cometh the Whirlwind, and Cold out of the North: By the Breath of GOD, Frost is given, and the Breadth of the Waters is straitned. Also by watering he wearieth the thick Cloud: He scattereth his bright Cloud; and it is turned round about by his Counsel; that they may do whatsoever He commandeth them upon the Face of the World in the Earth: He causeth it to come, whether for Correction, or for his Land, or for Mercy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this brings us to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. His <hi>moral</hi> Government, or his <hi>moral Ends</hi> in these various Providential Operations.</p>
            <p>And here we may (1) take a View of his <hi>moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>general</hi>; and then (2) in <hi>causing Droughts</hi> and <hi>Rains</hi> in <hi>particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1] As to his <hi>moral Government</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>general</hi>—</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are so clear and full in this, that whoever believes them wrote by Inspiration, cannot doubt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:006408_0032_1028B66D16A11F10"/>
shall therefore offer something to confirm our Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from <hi>other Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that He always exercises such a <hi>moral</hi> Government over his <hi>moral Creatures,</hi> such as <hi>Man,</hi> must needs arise from his own moral Nature and theirs, and from his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Relation to them.</p>
            <p>For as to HIMSELF—His necessary and eternal <hi>Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> must needs be owing to the most absolute Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Essence; an Essence so supreamly &amp; absolutely perfect, that it cannot but eternally exist. And this Essence must be so absolutely perfect, as to comprehend every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Excellence therein: their being an equal absolute Necessity of one as well as another, and so of all as well as any: of absolute <hi>Spirituality, Ubiquity, Understanding, Power</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which are commonly called his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Excellencies; as also of absolute <hi>Wisdom, Justice, Goodness, Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> which are commonly called his <hi>moral,</hi> as well as <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as his <hi>natural</hi> Excellencies plainly include his <hi>moral</hi>; so the Exercise of his <hi>natural</hi> Excellencies in any Action equally includes the Exercise of his <hi>moral</hi> in the very same Action also. As they are all essentially undivided &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely harmonious in Him, they must forever act in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Concert &amp; Harmony. In Particular; being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>spiritual,</hi> always <hi>every where</hi> present, and always ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>understanding, knowing</hi> &amp; <hi>powerful</hi>; He must be always absolutely <hi>wise:</hi> and being always absolutely wise, he must always have the <hi>wisest Ends</hi> in every Exertion of his <hi>Power,</hi> both in <hi>creating, upholding</hi> &amp; <hi>ordering</hi> every Creature, and in every Act of his Power contained therein.</p>
            <p>And as He has created <hi>Men</hi> with all their Faculties and Powers, and continually upholds them, continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves them from innumerable Evils, and even such as would be most afflicting and fatal, and is continually obliging them with innumerable undeserved Kindnesses of the greatest Moment, according to his sovereign Pleasure; as they absolutely depend on Him, and he has an absolute Propriety in them, is infinitely full of the highest &amp; most
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006408_0033_1028B66E9980E670"/>
venerable and amiable Excellencies, and has given them Power of knowing all This; they must needs in Justice owe him the highest <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Love &amp; Reverence</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> with the most absolute <hi>Devotion, Service &amp; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> And all this he must needs know; and both his own Perfections require of them, and also engage Him to treat them in a Way agreable to the very Nature of that most absolute <hi>Knowledge, Wisdom, Goodness, Truth</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> which are essential in Him.</p>
            <p>And here I might easily show, that a <hi>moral Government</hi> of GOD <hi>is most righteous,</hi> and therefore he must in Justice exercise it: that it is the <hi>best</hi> Government both for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his moral Creatures; and therefore his absoute Goodness will effectually move Him to it: That it is the <hi>wisest</hi> and <hi>most fitting,</hi> &amp; therefore his absolute Wisdom will lead him to approve and chuse it: and that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly sees all This, with his own absolute All-sufficiency for this most perfect Government; and all this in the most united Harmony will engage Him to undertake and manage it in the most perfect Manner. But the Time would fail me.</p>
            <p>And I would only now remonstrate — How <hi>extreamly absurd</hi> would it be to assert, that <hi>such a Man</hi> is <hi>the most excellent Father,</hi> who only in general provides Things needful and convenient for the <hi>natural Supply</hi> of <hi>his Children</hi>; but takes no Care of their <hi>moral Good,</hi> neither to give them any Intimations that Wisdom, Kindness, Justice, Truth, Hatred, and avoiding of all moral Evil, or Love and Doing of all moral Good, are accceptable to him; but wholly lets them alone to do as they list, to revile him and spoil his Works, and lye and cheat, and gratify every inordinate Appetite, and hate, injure and destroy each other; and yet <hi>never</hi> corrects them, or shows any Displeasure at their horrid Crimes, <hi>nor ever</hi> helps those who repent, nor even those who honour him, when in Distress they cry to him for Mercy! And as it would be extremely absurd to assert that <hi>such a Man</hi> is the <hi>most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Father,</hi> and as GOD is infinitely more excellent than
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006408_0034_1028B671A2EFE0D0"/>
               <hi>Man</hi> can be; it must be infinitely more absurd to imagine that GOD can in such a Manner govern the Children of Men, who are much more the Children of his own Production.</p>
            <p>Only we must here observe; that considering the moral Nature of GOD and <hi>Man</hi> and our Condition in <hi>this Life</hi>; it is evidently inconsistent with absolute Justice, Benignity and Wisdom, to limit our Existence to the <hi>present State</hi>: And as the <hi>present</hi> State must needs be designed chiefly to be a State preparatory or <hi>precedaneous</hi> to a <hi>Future</hi>; it is not <hi>a Thousandth</hi> Part of his absolutely perfect Scheme of moral Government which is exercised here, and that we now can see: <note n="(w)" place="bottom">Herein I speak much <hi>within Bounds</hi>; his <hi>absolutely perfect Scheme</hi> reaching to <hi>endless Successions</hi> in <hi>Eternity:</hi> Tho' for the Satisfaction at least of the Blessed, that they mayn't be ever kept in intire Suspence, it seems to be requisite, that in this eternal Scheme, there must be such <hi>successive Periods</hi> so complete, as to give the Saints &amp; Angels a clear View of the perfect Harmony of the divine Perfections in them: and then go into <hi>new ones,</hi> for their further Wonder and Delight, and so successively for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:006408_0035_1028B674814B11E8"/>And as not an Atom of Light or Heat, or Particle of Air, Cold or Nitre, or Globule of Water, in his Course of Nature moves but by his active <hi>Power</hi>; wherever He exerts this Power, especially in causing <hi>Droughts &amp; Rains,</hi> He therefore always acts in perfect <hi>Wisdom,</hi> for the <hi>wisest Ends</hi>; tho' to us in their very Nature inscrutably various and extensive, in their numberless Connections Branches and Trains of Consequences: and these <hi>wise Ends</hi> must needs be <hi>moral</hi> as well as <hi>natural</hi> with Respect to <hi>Men</hi>; for whom they are chiefly made, who are chiefly affected with them, and in whose <hi>Affliction</hi> or <hi>Advantage,</hi> under GOD, they supreamly terminate.</p>
            <p>But tho' I said <hi>Affliction</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi>— as these two Ends more clearly seem to be different in a <hi>natural</hi> Sense; yet in a <hi>moral</hi> Sense, in our present depraved &amp; mixed State, which is a State of Probation, and so of needful Discipline for our greater Benefit, all Afflictions may be advantagious, even eternally advantagious, excepting those that hinder any in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>As to the <hi>natural End</hi> of God in <hi>Droughts</hi> it must in general therefore be as He in his Course of Nature makes them terminate, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>afflicting</hi> us. And as to <hi>Rains</hi>— When they are unseasonable or immoderate, his <hi>natural End</hi> must be to <hi>afflict</hi> us also: But when seasonable and moderate, it must be by reviving and increasing the Fruits of the Earth, and the Cattle, to promote our <hi>Benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then those <hi>natural</hi> Ends with respect to <hi>us,</hi> must needs in Wisdom be subservient to his <hi>moral.</hi> And as to <hi>these</hi> we may observe in general— That as his <hi>natural</hi> End in <hi>Droughts</hi> and unseasonable and excessive Rains, must be to <hi>afflict</hi> us, his <hi>moral</hi> End must be by this Affliction to <hi>correct</hi> us: That as his <hi>natural</hi> End in seasonable and reviving <hi>Showers,</hi> is our <hi>Advantage,</hi> his <hi>moral</hi> End must be thereby to <hi>oblige</hi> us:—And as in his constituting Nature He designed and made the <hi>former</hi> Kind of Dispensation

So we should see him acting in the falling of every Drop and Atom, in the boiling of every Spring, in the running of every Course of Water, in the moving of every Wave, in the growing of every Spire of Grass: We should perceive him in every Breeze of Air, as well as in every Pulse of Life: And we shou'd hear him in every Rill and Wind, as well as in the Roaring of the Sea and the Voice of Thunder.</p>
            <p>But we shou'd especially see his natural Operations in <hi>Droughts</hi> and <hi>Rains,</hi> and in all the conspiring Actions of their instrumental Causes, as we have before described; and view them with religious Wonder, Delight and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us endeavour also to see his <hi>moral Government</hi> and <hi>Excellence,</hi> in particular his Wisdom, Goodness, Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Truth, and Holiness, with his <hi>moral Ends</hi> in these Dispensations.</p>
            <p>In afflictive <hi>Droughts</hi> we should see his <hi>Holiness</hi> or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin in those natural Signs of his Displeasure — his <hi>Justice</hi> in Chastizing us— and as we live in the Light of Inspiration, his <hi>Truth</hi> in answering those Intimations he has given in Scripture of executing this particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for acting and pesisting in Contrariety to him; it
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006408_0039_1028B6816A21D7C8"/>
being by Inspiration only that the <hi>Truth</hi> of GOD can be displayed. Yea in correcting with this Kind of Discipline he shows and we should see his <hi>Goodness,</hi> as 'tis useful to convince us of our Dependance on him, that none but he can help us, and so reduce and bring us to implore his Mercy; but much more still in answering our worthless Prayers, and giving needful <hi>Showers</hi> in our Extremity— And in all his <hi>Wisdom</hi> in displaying and glorifying both his Excellencies and his Government both natural &amp; moral, promoting our Conviction and Veneration of them, with our present and everlasting Interest, and accomplishing a Multitude of other wise Designs among his Creatures.</p>
            <p>And as He has a great Variety of <hi>Ends</hi> both natural and moral in the very same Actions; so in his <hi>with hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rains,</hi> we should see Him making the Vegetables wither and fail in Fruitfulness, the Beasts decline in Flesh and Strength, and so less fit for Food or Labour; and all to terminate both in <hi>afflicting</hi> and <hi>correcting</hi> Us, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>awakening</hi> us to suitable Convictions of his Being, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Providence, our Relation, Obligations &amp; Duties to Him, Sins against Him, his Displeasure with us, our Interest to return and seek to be reconciled to Him, and implore his Mercy; and <hi>exciting</hi> us to a becoming Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Adoration of Him, and to all these Duties. And in his <hi>giving seasonable Showers,</hi> we should see Him reviving the Vegetables and Animals, promoting their Growth and Fruitfulness, and all to terminate both in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obliging</hi> Us, and thereby <hi>exciting</hi> our religious Gratitude, Esteem, Love and Praise, and every just and grateful Duty to Him.</p>
            <p>These <hi>moral Ends</hi> of his we should therefore also have in View continually in these Dealings with us, and labour after an intire, just and wise Compliance with them: Or we behave unnaturally; i.e. directly contrary to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature, Obligations, Interest and Reason; as well as the apparent Tokens of the wise, good, just &amp; holy Will of our Sovereign RULER, Chastizer and Benefactor.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When the Vapours rise and gather in thick Clouds, and the Lightning flashes with irresistible Power: let us then lift up our believing Eyes and see GOD in them: Let us hear him speak with Majesty and Terror, as in Isai.

            <p>Never were those affecting Passages in <hi>Joel</hi> i. and <hi>Jer.</hi> xiv, more pertinent to us than in that distressing Season.</p>
            <p>And all the while we were languishing under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Affliction, GOD was raising up <hi>as great a Quantity of Waters</hi> out of <hi>the Sea</hi> into the Air as usual: even in <hi>ten Miles</hi> of the <hi>Light-House,</hi> on <hi>every Day</hi> above <hi>nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thousand Tuns</hi>; and in a <hi>Hundred Miles,</hi> on <hi>every Day</hi> above <hi>ninety Millions</hi>; <note n="(x)" place="bottom">To keep within Bounds, I take but <hi>half the Circles</hi> of 10 and of 10 Miles <hi>Radius</hi>: and whereas Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> found the Sun exhales in a square Mile every warm Day 6914 Tuns; I here take no more than 6000 in every square Mile.
