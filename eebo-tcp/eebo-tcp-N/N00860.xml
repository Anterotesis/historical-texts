            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>Geneſis V. 24.</bibl>
                  <p>And <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS <hi>Chapter</hi> contains the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the Lives of the <hi>Antidiluvian Patriarchs,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi>: of whom little elſe is mentioned, but their names, ſucceſſion, long lives and death: only concerning <hi>Enoch,</hi> we have his ſhort life, eminent piety, and wonderful Tranſlation here recorded, <hi>verſe</hi> 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet it is to be ſuppoſed that theſe, being Chriſts Predeceſſors, through whom his Humanity was derived, and thoſe heads of Families by whom the true Religion was preſerved in the world, were all of them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. There muſt therefore be ſomething ſingular in <hi>Enoch,</hi> on account whereof God gave him this record, by which he teſtified how well be was pleaſed with him, as we are informed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Before his tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God</hi>;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001036_0003_0FAEE9CE720C64A8"/>
which muſt needs refer to the words of our <hi>Text.</hi> That which is now to be inſiſted on, is <hi>the eminency of his piety,</hi> to which a witneſs is here born, to his perpetual honour; and doubtleſs, <hi>whatſoever is written in the Word of God is for our admonition.</hi> Scripture Exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple are our Monitors, either to warn us a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, or to animate us unto Holineſs. The thing that is here aſſerted concerning <hi>Enoch</hi>; is, <hi>that he walked with God</hi>: in which few words we have a moſt excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given of him; and they contain in them a large Hiſtory of his Life, by which we are given to underſtand, not only that he was a Godly man, and ſeparated from the corruptions of the times; but he was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and had out ſtript other holy ones that had gone before him, or that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with him It is obſervable, that his Walk with God is twice aſſerted in the <hi>Context</hi>; and the Spirit of God doth not uſe vain repetitions: it is therefore to ſtir up our attention to it, as to a thing of ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark In he former it is mentioned to ſet forth his conſtancy in it, that he held on this courſe perſeveringly for <hi>three hundred years</hi>: and in what capacity, <hi>viz</hi> in an <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical,</hi> or in a Family relation, and did not turn <hi>Anchorite</hi> for it: in the latter it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to introduce the great recompence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001036_0004_0FAEE9CED9C5AFD0"/>
that God gave him, by a glorious. Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The purport of the expreſſion here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will be enquired after in the ſequel: The words themſelves will offer us this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> Walking with God is the Chriſtians both Duty and Glory in this Life, and the way to Eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine takes it for granted, that there is ſuch a <hi>Walk</hi> to be enjoyed here, as well as <hi>Sitting down with him in his Kingdom</hi> hereafter; and is exemplified in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides <hi>Enoch.</hi> That it is every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Duty</hi> to imitate him in this is evident, becauſe this is recorded of him for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to do likewiſe; and that it is our <hi>Glory</hi> here, appears in that this was it which procured for him his renown above others, becauſe he excelled in this; and the ſingular Providence of God in <hi>tranſlating</hi> him to Heaven, <hi>not to ſee death,</hi> ſhews how ſerviceable it is to our <hi>Eternal well Being.</hi> Nor doth his ſhort abode here any whit contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the truth of this, inaſmuch as life is but a Journey to Eternity &amp; when the work of our Generation is done, it is our happineſs to go home. That to which I ſhall confine the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001036_0005_0FAEE9CF905CFAE8"/>
diſcourſe ſhall be an enquiry into, and reſolution of this great <hi>Caſe, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a Child of God ſo order his life, as to maintain a continued Walk with God to the end of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> This <hi>Caſe</hi> being of greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and for the regulation of our daily practice, it will require the more diſtinct conſideration: but that it may be the more portable, I ſhall endeavour to contract it ſo far as the nature of the ſubject will permit. And here, to prepare the way for the <hi>Rules</hi> of direction about it, it is requiſite that we make ſome brief enquiry into the nature of the Duty, or <hi>What it is to Walk with God</hi>? And we may obſerve that there are three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made uſe of in the Scriptures on this account, <hi>viz. to walk with God, to walk before him, and to walk after him.</hi> Which Commentators do ſuppoſe to aim at one and the ſame thing: and doubtleſs each of them doth comprehend the other two under it, though there may be ſomething ſpecially pointed to in each of them. <hi>Walking after God</hi> may intend a following of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which is the <hi>Rule of Life: Walking before him</hi> may intimate a ſetting our ſelves as in his preſence always, to awe our hearts into a careful endeavour to obey him: and,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001036_0006_0FAEE9D0662F7F58"/>
               <hi>Walking with him</hi> may ſignifie our maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with him in our whole Life; and hence it includes in it, a living in the practice of all thoſe things by which that Communion may be upheld, and avoiding of whatſoever may interrupt it. The word is <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and ſerves to give light to the thing aimed at <hi>Walking</hi> is properly the progreſſive motion of a living creature, by which, from an inward principle or power, it carries it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from one place to another; and is oppoſed to ſitting down, or ſtanding ſtill: and is therefore uſed for that courſe of life which men do lead, which is called the <hi>way</hi> they walk in; for walking ever ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a way. It alſo ſuppoſeth the motion to be <hi>ſpontaneous,</hi> in oppoſition to that which is <hi>violent</hi> or compulſive; and ſo in voluntary agents, it points to that courſe of life which they follow upon choice; and it tells us, <hi>that a Chriſtian is not to ſtand ſtill, but to purſue his way with freedom of ſpirit, if ever he hopes to obtain his great end.</hi> To walk with another is uſed for our converſing with him, and uſing of his familiarity, ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 13 20. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe.</hi> It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſeth friendſhip and intimacy, and a likeneſs of manners in the perſons ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſociating; and on this account, <hi>Walking with God intends, a ſo ordering of our Converſation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001036_0007_0FAEE9D10D7D4EE0"/>
as is according to his will</hi>; or, a ſo living as to have fellowſhip with him in all that we do; on this account it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with God the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Or, an endeavouring ſo to live that we may pleaſe him, and enjoy his favourable preſence with us: for, it is not his Eſſential preſence which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, but the preſence of his love, and his acceptance of us. The Apoſtle therefore in the fore cited <hi>Heb</hi> 11.5. interprets his <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God,</hi> by his <hi>pleaſing of God.</hi> Now, we then pleaſe God, when we always do the things that pleaſe him; and he walks with us, when he ſignifies to and in us, that he takes delight in us; hence that of Chriſt, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.29. <hi>The Father hath not left me alone, for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> Hence this is ſet forth in other terms in Scripture, all of which are but Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on this. Sometimes to <hi>walk in the ways of God. Iſa</hi> 3.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> in thoſe ways which he hath commanded us, and wherein we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his will: to <hi>walk in his law, Pſal.</hi> 119 1. <hi>i. e.</hi> to follow that law which he hath revealed to us for the ordering of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by; to <hi>walk in good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10 <hi>i e.</hi> to exerciſe our ſelves in ſuch works as God approves of; to <hi>walk in our integrity, Pſal.</hi> 26.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> in the practice of ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001036_0008_0FAEE9D1CC93BA00"/>
to God; and many expreſſions of like import. So that in ſumme, we are then properly ſaid to walk with God, when we conſtantly nouriſh true piety in our hearts, and purſue it in our whole lives. This then is the matter about which we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring; and for our help and direction in which, the following <hi>Rules</hi> are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That we may walk with God, we muſt take care that he and we are reconciled.</hi> Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together ſignifies, and preſuppoſeth friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and agreement; hence that, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> If therefore there hath been a diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them before, it preſumes that there hath been a making up of the breach, and bringing of them together again: and ſo it is in the caſe before us. Here then let us obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſtate of nature is a ſtate of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God.</hi> Not that mans primitive ſtate was ſuch, for <hi>God made man upright, Eccl.</hi> 7.29. There was a Covenant of amity between God and man at firſt; but mans Apoſtaſy hath violated that Covenant, and ſo hath procured a great diſtance between them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59 2. <hi>Your ſins have ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and your God.</hi> And at this diſtance
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001036_0009_0FAEE9D42250B2D0"/>
is every natural man born, as he comes out of the loins of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hence that is univerſally a truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Were Children of wrath by nature.</hi> On this account Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men are ſaid to be <hi>far off from God, Pſal.</hi> 73.27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. In this regard alſo ungodly men have the ſtile of <hi>Enemies</hi> put upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Whiles we were yet enemies,</hi> &amp;c. And good reaſon, for man is by his ſin revolted from God, hath broken his Allegiance, which hath both filled him with enmity againſt him, for ſuch is the frame of <hi>them that are carnally minded, Rom.</hi> 8 7. and incenſed the juſt indignation of God againſt them, for we are told in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſo long as this alienation abides, there can be no Communion between God and Sinners.</hi> Communion between perſon ever ſuppoſeth an union going before, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it: and where there hath been an ancecedent ſeparation, it requires an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, in order to which that which made the difference muſt be removed. God and Sinners go two ways, they <hi>walk contrary one to another,</hi> and God requires that they do acknowledge that it hath been ſo, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. How then ſhould they go together? Whiles then things remain in this poſture, the diſtance muſt needs abide; yea it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001036_0010_0FAEE9D52F1B5B50"/>
for ſinful man is not only naturally afar off, but he is continually going further: hence the way that they are in is called <hi>a departing from the Living God, Heb.</hi> 3.12. and a <hi>forſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of the fountain of living waters.</hi> Jer. 2.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That this Reconciliation muſt be mutual.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the alienation was ſo; <hi>Zech</hi> 11.8. <hi>My Soul loathed them, and their Soul alſo abhorred me.</hi> Gods anger is kindled againſt the Sinner, and how ſhould he come at him, whiles this abide? as long as that fire burneth againſt him, there is no approaching to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 <hi>ult. Our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> The Pſalmiſt intimates how dangerous a thing it is, <hi>Pſal</hi> 76.7. <hi>Who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry?</hi> The Sinner alſo is full of prejudices at God, hath taken up falſe opinions of him, and ſo long as theſe abide, he will not come unto him, but hide out of his ſight, as our firſt Parents did as ſoon as they had violated his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. God therefore muſt be at peace with the Sinner, and the Sinner at peace with him, if ever the breach be made up between them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Chriſt having reconciled the Juſtice of God by his Obedience, invites Sinners by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to be reconciled to God</hi> Mans ſin had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the revenging Juſtice of God againſt him, which was engaged to deſtroy him;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001036_0011_0FAEE9D6B1F20E78"/>
till this was ſatisfied, there was no hope of agreement: this therefore was firſt done by Chriſt as our Surety, who ſtanding in our room, anſwered all the demands of the Law for us, and now God is ready to receive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into favour upon terms; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fleſh, through death.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19 <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> Now Juſtice and Mercy can meet together and agree: But this did not compleat the affair, but upon the former, Chriſt, in purſuit of his Mediatorſhip, opens a treaty of peace and by the Goſpel he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth it to Sinners and Rebels, offering the atonement, and ſolliciting them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; for which he hath delegated his Ambaſſadours, whom he hath Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto, and we are told what is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their Embaſſy, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are Ambaſſadours for Christ, as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The terms on which this Reconciliation is to be made, are offered in the New Covenant.</hi> God doth not only offer Sinners to be at peace with them, but maketh propoſals of agreement, on which he is ready to lay aſide all differences, and receive them into favour,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001036_0012_0FAEE9D718BFCCD8"/>
and intimate fellowſhip. He treats with men in a Covenant way, in which the peace is to be ratified between them; and there are the <hi>Articles</hi> of it, which muſt be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal it ever they unite. The Goſpel promiſes are therefore propoſed Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and a threatning in caſe of failure, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned</hi>; and <hi>Rom</hi> 8.13 <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence by our cordial cloſing with theſe terms, we are again made nigh unto God.</hi> It is the blood of Chriſt which is the procuring cauſe of this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 13 <hi>Ye who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt</hi>; but the actual accompliſhment of it is brought about by our entertaining of the offered Grace, according to the tenour of the Goſpel Covenant. We therefore no ſooner repent and believe, but we are at peace with God, <hi>his anger is turned away,</hi> and he receives us into favour. We are by this faith united to Chriſt, and ſo become the Children of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: And now he carries it as a father to us and we may with a Child-like boldneſs approach near unto him, and maintain fellowſhip with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001036_0013_0FAEE9D84B6FFA80"/>
him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence, through the faith of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That we may thus embrace theſe terms, we muſt wait upon God for his Grace and Spirit, to work this Faith and Repentance in us.</hi> As we could do nothing for the reconciling of God to us, &amp; if Chriſt had not done it for us, it had never been; ſo neither can we reconcile our ſelves to him, or comply with the propoſals of the New Covenant, of our ſelves: We have neither ability nor inclination hereunto; hence that in, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8 <hi>By Grace are ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins</hi> It is therefore the Spirits work to make application of that Grace to us, by which we may be wrought up to a compliance with the calls of the Goſpel; and it is our duty to renounce truſt in our ſelves, and ſeek for his help, waiting on him in all the ways of his appointment, for his coming and doing of this great thing for us: and when once this is effectually wrought in us, we are then fitted for communion with him.</p>
            <p n="2">II <hi>If we would walk with God, we must carefully avoid all thoſe things that tend to make a distance between him and us.</hi> It is true, that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001036_0014_0FAEE9D8DA4C48D8"/>
when once we are reconciled to God by the Blood of Chriſt, and the powerful virtue of the Spirit in us, bringing us over to a cordial compliance with the terms of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there ſhall never be a total breach made between him and us, his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency will keep us from it, 1 Pet. 1 5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God through ſaith unto ſalvation.</hi> However, there may be diſtances procured, and uncomfortable breaches made, the Communion be interrupted, and we thereupon loſe our ſight of him; and though there be the Soveraign withdrawings of his light and comfort from his own, when they are watchful over themſelves; yet there are the things which provoke him to hide away, and carry himſelf to them as an Enemy: and if we would prevent this, we muſt be watchful againſt all thoſe carriages which will procure it. And to this end,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us carefully avoid every ſin; and more peculiarly every bold tranſgreſſion.</hi> As it was ſin that at firſt made the breach between God and man, ſo it hath always a tendency in it to produce this effect, becauſe it is a thing ſo contrary to his Holineſs, according as is declared, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1 13. <hi>Thou art of parer eyes than to beheld evil, and canſt not look on ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> And although God hath a <hi>fathers pity</hi> to extend to all thoſe <hi>his Children which ſerve
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001036_0015_0FAEE9D962DF42E8"/>
him,</hi> and accordingly hath a regard to their <hi>frames,</hi> as <hi>Pſal</hi> 103.13, 14. And therefore will accept of their integrity, and bear witneſs to it, notwithſtanding the deficiency which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends upon their beſt, yet if at any time they allow themſelves in any preſumptuous ſin, it will incenſe his righteous diſpleaſure at them, and procure for them ſome remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſertion: we read in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. The thing which David did diſpleaſed the Lord.</hi> And what awful Diſpenſations in his Providence followed upon it, is recorded in the Hiſtory: what care then ought we to uſe on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, leſt we be drawn into any iniquity?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us purſue the mortification of every fleſhly lust.</hi> Though the Dominion of ſin is ſubverted in every Regenerate one, yet there are the remains of it in the beſt in this life; &amp; it is very active, and hath too much of the nature of a Law in them, as he confeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> The beſt way for a Chriſtian to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, is to endeavour the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe luſts which are the branches of Original Concupiſcence in him, by the motions and force whereof he is hurried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actual ſins. That is on this account made the Duty of all the People of God in, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortify your members which are upon the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001036_0016_0FAEE9DA176E2370"/>
earth, fornication, &amp;c.</hi> And for this we ſhould make uſe of the Croſs of Chriſt, where we ſhould Crucify them, thus did <hi>Paul, Gal</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us maintain a ſpecial warfare againſt our boſome ſin.</hi> Although there is every luſt remaining in every believer, againſt which the ſpiritual warfare is to be upheld and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued: yet there is uſually one more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable luſt, which either our natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the occaſions offered in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, or the affairs that we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, do ſtimulate us to; and we are more eaſily won to hold correſpondence with it, and find it hardeſt to withſtand the motions of it, when it calls for being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gratified. Now one ſin if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by us, and we can hold familiar cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with it, though it be never ſo ſecretly, is enough to procure a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, and make us to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his diſpleaſure. How carefully then ought we to obſerve the ſtirrings of it in us, and reſiſt it with greateſt reſolution? <hi>David</hi> therefore tells us on this account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us Crucify our over eager affections to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001036_0017_0FAEE9DAD51A4478"/>
the world.</hi> There is a love to the Creature which it is lawful for Gods people to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: but then there is a love of theſe things which is very dangerous, againſt which we are warned, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world neither the things which are in the world. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man love the world, the love of the father is not in him.</hi> If we let our hearts out over ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly after theſe things, they will draw them off from God: and our Saviour hath cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned us in, <hi>Mat</hi> 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters, &amp;c.</hi> And there is nothing that more obſtructs our walking with God, than the prevalency of <hi>Ambition, Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs</hi> in us: And becauſe theſe things are ſo adapted to our ſenſes, and gratifie the cravings of the outward man, we have the more need to be dayly crucifying of them, and praying as he, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.37. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity</hi>; we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly adviſed in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleſhly luſts, which war against the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let us carefully abſtain from evil company.</hi> Ungodly men are Gods enemies, and we ſhould in that regard look upon them as ours, <hi>Pſal</hi> 139.21. <hi>Do I not hate them, Oh Lord, that hate thee?</hi> And God is therefore angry, when we make choice of ſuch to be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001036_0018_0FAEE9DB908556F0"/>
and enter into alliances with them. How was <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> rebuked and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for this? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Shouldſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord.</hi> And if we will aſſociate our ſelves with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>we ſhall learn of their ways,</hi> and walk with them; and then we ſhall not walk with God, becauſe his ways and theirs are contrary; and doubtleſs the little regard that men have to the choice of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is none of the leaſt reaſons why Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at this day make ſo little progreſs in their Chriſtian Walk, and that there is ſo great an <hi>Apostaſy</hi> among them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Let us manfully reſiſt all the Temptations of Satan and his inſtruments.</hi> If we reſolve to walk with God, we muſt expect to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in our way: they that are his enemies will be ours too; and if all their policy and induſtry can draw us off, they will not be wanting. We are told of Satan, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Your adverſary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walks about ſeeking whom he may devour</hi>; and of his agents in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>If it were poſſible they would deceive the very Elect.</hi> And there is no way for us to eſcape them, but by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Whom withſtand ſtedfaſtly in the faith.</hi> There is need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of courage and conſtancy, in all thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001036_0019_0FAEE9DC5B943610"/>
that would hold on their way, and not be turned out of it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Let us beware of Hypocriſy.</hi> And indeed there is nothing more dangerous. The <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi> pretends to walk with God, but doth not; he ſeems to look one way, but indeed goes another: he hath a way of his own which he cloſely proſecutes, whiles he holds the world in hand that he is running in the way of Gods precepts; and in nothing is God more provoked than by ſuch an <hi>Atheiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical</hi> carriage as this is; as if he could as eaſily blind the all ſeeing eye, as impoſe upon the credulity of ſhort ſighted men. We are therefore given to underſtand the doom of ſuch, <hi>Jeb.</hi> 8 13. <hi>The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh,</hi> and 13 16. <hi>An Hypocrite ſhall not come before him.</hi> Take heed then, for it is only the upright in heart, whoſe way pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>If we would walk with God, we muſt live the exerciſe of the Graces of his holy Spirit.</hi> As one that is without Grace cannot ſo do, ſo he who hath it habitually, doth no further keep cloſe with God, then he is in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it. And here obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the graces of Sanctification are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, to furniſh us for new Obedience.</hi> It is by new &amp; Evangelical Obedience that we keep in Gods way, &amp; ſo walk with him, which we
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001036_0020_0FAEE9DD2B3270F0"/>
are altogether unable to do, whiles we abide in our natural ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God</hi> The Apoſtaſy had rendred us altogether <hi>unprofitable,</hi> and <hi>without ſtrength</hi> to do any acceptable Service to God. Man, by the loſs of Gods Image, in which he was at firſt created, loſt his own power which he before was furniſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. It is therefore by reſtoring and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Image, that he is recovered to it again; hence that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 23, 24 <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi> So that it conſiſts in the ſanctifying Graces, which are infuſed into the Soul, by the Spirit of God, that we are renovated; &amp; that is by being put into Chriſt by Regeneration, according to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature; old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new</hi> And what is this for, but that we may obey God, and do the things that pleaſe him? for we are told, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 10. <hi>That we are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Hence no actions of ours, but what are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by theſe Graces, are to be accounted ſteps in this walk.</hi> It is not enough that we are renewed, for us hence to conclude that all that we do will be right, and that now we cannot decline from the way which we are
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001036_0021_0FAEE9DF8F4AFE48"/>
put into, as if now we might confide in the promiſe, without taking heed to our ſelves. We have corruption as well as grace in us; there is the <hi>Fleſh</hi> as well as the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and theſe are ever drawing us contrary wayes, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, &amp; the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh; and theſe two are contrary</hi>; and that which is the product of either of theſe two principles will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it, as, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> God doth not only look at the actions which we do, but alſo at the ſpirit with which we do them; hence that, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.2. <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence we ought very carefully to take heed by what principle we act.</hi> Many profeſſors think themſelves no farther concerned in the duties they do, then to ſee to the things ſo done, that in the matter of them they be things warranted or commanded in the Word of God; &amp; if therein they are conformable, they think all is well: but ſo may an ungodly man do, without any root of grace or piety in him, meerly by the inſtigation of a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſcience</hi> in him, and the force of <hi>moral principles,</hi> and yet ſuch duties are far from finding acceptance with God. Nay we have that character put upon them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. <hi>The
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001036_0022_0FAEE9E054442FC8"/>
plowing of the wicked is ſin.</hi> 28.9. <hi>His prayer ſhall be an abomination.</hi> God indeed requires the outward act, but he calls for the heart too, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My Son, give me thine heart</hi>; and that is done only by the exerting of the Graces of Sanctification in the duties that we do.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>And that we may thus exerciſe our Grace, we muſt wait upon the Spirit of God for his help in exciting and actuating of it.</hi> It is true, we muſt have Grace before we can uſe it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. <hi>If you live in the ſpirit, walk in the ſpirit.</hi> But it is equally certain that the exerciſe hereof depends upon his influence, nor can we put it forth in any thing farther than he affords us his aſſiſtance. The Apoſtle refers not the will only but alſo the deed hither <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> And they were Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones to whom our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the believers encouragement, that he may have this aid afforded him upon his right asking for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Your heavenly Father ſhall give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him.</hi> It then concerns us to ſeek this of him, how elſe ſhall we walk with him?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>If we would walk with God, we muſt maintain the life of faith.</hi> We are told in, <hi>Heb.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001036_0023_0FAEE9E147E7A6B0"/>
10.38. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Where, by living is not only intended, the enjoyment of the title to Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, which is ſecured by promiſe to faith in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believes in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlasting Life</hi>; but alſo the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a life of Holineſs, in which alone it is that we can be ſaid to walk with God, and becauſe this is an eſſential point, let us conſider it in the following obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no walking with God, but in the way of new Obedience.</hi> There was an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which God required of man in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, in the performance of which, if he had kept his integrity, he ſhould have upheld entire Communion with God; and that was in an exact conformity to the Law of that Covenant. But fallen man cannot maintain this; <hi>he is fallen ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> and can no more conform to the Law: We are therefore told. <hi>Gal</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curſe.</hi> There is therefore a new Covenant opened, in which, as there is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God required of us, ſo it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another tenour, in which ſincerity is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at our hands by God, and all our ſhort comings are over looked: and it is for that reaſon called new, becauſe there was nothing of it in the Old Covenant which
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001036_0024_0FAEE9E1C3707A58"/>
pronounced a Curſe upon the leaſt defect. Of this is that bleſſing pronounced, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and for this he prays in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.22. <hi>Let integrity and uprightneſs preſerve me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no performing of ſincere Obedience but by the help of Chriſt.</hi> He muſt work our works in us, if ever we do them as we ought. As all the operation of ſecond Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings depends on the Co operation of the firſt, even in things natural; ſo the Gracious Actions of the Children of God muſt have their ſupply from Chriſt, through whom all ſaving benefits derive to his people: he is the <hi>Vine</hi> and they are the <hi>branches, Joh</hi> 15. <hi>begin.</hi> And all the Sap which they have that muſt render them fruitful comes from him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>From me is thy fruit found. Paul</hi> therefore dares not to preſume any further for his doing of any duty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is by Faith that we muſt derive all this vertue and help from him.</hi> As all our help is fountained in him, ſo there is a way in which we are to fetch it in from him, and that is by the exerciſe of faith on him: and for this reaſon, <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpeaks of his life of Holineſs in which he walked with God, refers it hither, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001036_0025_0FAEE9E263BA9370"/>
I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> The Obedience of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is on this account called the <hi>work of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. And all the glorious exploits which are mentioned to have been done by the Worthies of old, are aſcribed to their faith in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. For it is by faith that we go to Chriſt, and embracing the promiſe, in which all the help that we need is laid up, we fetch in that aſſiſtance from him, by which we are enabled to walk with him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The beſt of our Obedience labours of ſinful infirmities, and imperfections.</hi> It is by <hi>the law that we have the knowledge of ſin</hi>; accordingly we are to reckon that whatſoever comes ſhort, in any reſpect, of what that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, whether in matter or manner, or end, is ſo far ſinful. Now the people of God, when they have exerciſed their Grace with the moſt ſincere endeavour, come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in this reſpect, and ſo dare not to put themſelves upon a law tryal, but confeſs as, <hi>Pſal</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Oh Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deprecate it as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> Sinleſs perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is that which none can with any truth pretend unto, for we are told, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001036_0026_0FAEE9E3210C8688"/>
we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This imperfect Obedience, when ſincere, is rendred acceptable to God through Chriſt.</hi> God, out of Chriſt, is a ſevere Judge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns men for the leaſt defect in what they do: whereas believers have hope of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, notwithſtanding they find ſo much of a body of death mixing with their duties: and whence is this? not becauſe God likes ſin in his own, when he cannot endure it in others; his Holineſs forbids that: But it is, becauſe he looks upon them in Chriſt, and having covered them under the robe of his Righteouſneſs, he will not ſee, ſo as to judge them for their frailties, according to, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He hath ſeen no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſeneſs in Iſrael</hi>; but we have <hi>all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance in the beloved, Eph.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>It is only by faith that we apply this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by which we are thus accepted</hi> Hence that title is put upon it, <hi>Phil</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> If we confide in our own works, and expect to be accepted for the worthineſs of them, God will deſpiſe us, and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſervices as things which he can take no delight in: but when we utterly renounce our affiance in them, and reſolve our whole hope, after all, into Chriſt, and him alone,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001036_0027_0FAEE9E3CE7E3C50"/>
we then pleaſe God. We thus comply with the New-Covenant way, in which the Grace of God is every way exalted, and our whole acknowledgment is paid to it: and when we thus do, we <hi>Walk by faith,</hi> and ſo <hi>Walk with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>If we would Walk with God, we muſt endeavour to conform our whole Converſation to his revealed will.</hi> We before obſerved, that walking intends the courſe of life which we follow, every action whereof incompared to one ſtep that we take. Walking with God then, is a living according to his will, ſo it is expreſt in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. <hi>That he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</hi> Now there is a double-conſideration of the Will of God, <hi>viz</hi> as it is ſecret, or as it is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by the former of which God diſpoſeth of all the affairs of his Creatures, according to his infinite wiſdom, and good pleaſure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Who worketh all things after the counſel of his will.</hi> And by the latter he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to us our Duty, and how we ought to carry towards him in all things. And here we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath given us a Rule to direct us in the way wherein we may walk with him.</hi> He hath not only enjoyned it upon us as a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001036_0028_0FAEE9E4B51B65E0"/>
duty ſo to walk, but hath alſo ſhewn us the way in which we may ſo do; elſe we had been left at an utter loſs. Nor did he only do ſo to man when he firſt created him, by the Covenant of Works, for compliance wherewithal fallen man is left altogether <hi>without ſtrength</hi>: but he hath alſo thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed under the New Covenant, which is therefore called <hi>the law of Christ, Gal.</hi> 6 2. For the Goſpel doth not diſcharge man from obedience to God, and ſo open to him a door of licentiouſneſs; and they are grievouſly miſtaken who reckon this for the Grace of the Goſpel: but it preſcribes unto them a new way, in which <hi>they may live and pleaſe God:</hi> which is called <hi>the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.2. &amp; <hi>the way of peace, Luk</hi> 1.69 <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>the way of Salvation, Acts</hi> 17.16. Nor hath he left it a thing indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go in this way or no; but hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Sanctions</hi> to the Command.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Rule extends to the whole man.</hi> For this reaſon, the Sanctification, which is to furniſh us with ability to conform to this Rule, extends to the whole, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 5.23 <hi>The very God of peace ſanctify you wholly, and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body be kept blameleſs.</hi> Man conſiſts of a ſoul and a body; and both of theſe are to be regulated by it: It therefore giveth precepts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001036_0029_0FAEE9E5502890F0"/>
the inward as well as the outward man; and we are obliged to glorify God with both, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glorify God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> There is a way of the heart as well as of the hand and foot, which we muſt take heed to, if we would walk with God; and indeed God firſtly and mainly regards the heart in all; and our outward actions, let them be otherwiſe never ſo regular, are no further accepted with him, than our heart is right in them. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires this in the firſt place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My ſon, give me thine heart</hi> And this is a remark that is made on the ſpecious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation attempted by <hi>Iſrael, Pſal</hi> 78.37. <hi>Their heart was not right with him</hi>; and if our feet move one way, and our heart goes another, God is not honoured, but deſpiſed by us; ſo he upbraids them <hi>Iſa</hi> 29.13 <hi>This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Hence it gives laws to all ſorts of actions.</hi> As the whole man is under the command of it, ſo all the motions of it, in all reſpects, are to be regulated by it; and we no farther walk with God than we ſincerely conform to it. Actions are diſtinguiſhed from the next ſubject by which they are exerted, into <hi>thoughts, words and deeds. Thoughts</hi> are the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001036_0030_0FAEE9E82CBDE738"/>
next and immediate acts of the heart, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and are performed in us, by the Soul it ſelf: others are ſtrangers to them, but this Rule extends to them, and is a Judge of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men</hi>; and that is one prerogative attributed to the Word of God, <hi>Heb</hi> 4.12. <hi>Is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> The <hi>words</hi> are the acts of the tongue; and men are deceived if they think <hi>their tongues are their own, and have no lord over them,</hi> as they vainly boaſted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. for of theſe alſo there is a reckoning ere long to be made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>I ſay unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in the day of Judgment.</hi> And <hi>deeds</hi> comprehend under them, all elſe that is performed by the outward man, as it is the organ of the Rational Soul in the exerting of its imperate acts; every whereof he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo accountable for, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12 14 <hi>God will bring every work into judgment.</hi> The right ordering of theſe therefore belongs to our walking with God: to every of which the Scripture precepts are adapted.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>And it preſcribes to all the Relations that we are ſet in.</hi> There are a great many rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God hath placed between men, whiles they are in this world; in every of which they owe an obedience to God, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001036_0031_0FAEE9E9AFA94F28"/>
for their direction whereunto, he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the duties which he requires of them in each, in the diſcharge whereof they are to ſerve him; and they can no farther walk with him in them, then as they comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal. Theſe <hi>Relations</hi> are enumerated in the Holy Scriptures, where alſo the precepts which God hath given concerning each of them are recorded: and they are <hi>Natural, Oeconomical, Civil, and Eccleſiastical.</hi> There is the Relation of Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Subjects, Miniſters and Churches, Teachers and Scholars, aged, and younger perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In our diſcharge of all of theſe we ought to yield obedience to the command of God relating to them, and when we do ſo, we therein walk with him: and thus did <hi>Enoch, verſe</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It alſo directs to all the callings which God providentially placeth men in.</hi> The moſt of theſe Callings might have been reduced to the former head of Relations; being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, or reſuking from them. But let me here add, that there is a <hi>General</hi> Calling, which all perſons of what relation ſoever, are obliged to the purſuit and practice of, <hi>viz</hi> the Religious Worſhip of God in all the ways of his appointment; and that both in the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted</hi>: and the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001036_0032_0FAEE9EB3967A5F0"/>
&amp; faithful Chriſtians are in their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon thoſe duties, the more cloſely do they walk with God. There are alſo the <hi>Particular</hi> Callings which God hath diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among men, which nextly refer to the concerns of this life, &amp; the publick, as well as private &amp; perſonal benefit of mankind, which are alſo ſubordinated to Religion: &amp; in theſe alſo God expects that we ſhould maintain fellowſhip with him; &amp; we do in vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to walk with him in acts of Worſhip, if we regard him not in theſe. I ſhould be endleſs in going about to preſcribe particular <hi>Rules</hi> of walking with God in all the fore ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted caſes, for which the Word of God plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully furniſheth us with advice. Let then two or three general hints ſuffice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt uſe all endeavours to get a diſtinct acquaintance with the Rules of holy walking.</hi> Though knowledge alone be not ſufficient for us, for we may know our duty, and yet live in the neglect of it, which will but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our guilt, yet <hi>without knowledge the mind of man cannot be good</hi>; nor his actions regular; thoſe therefore are put together, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13 17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> And for this end,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt be diligent in reading the Word of God.</hi> That is the compleat Rule of our walking with him, and without our
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001036_0033_0FAEE9EB4EFD5378"/>
getting acquaintance with it, we muſt needs err; for, if God had not there ſhewn us what is good, we muſt have wandered in a labyrinth of miſtakes: <hi>David</hi> reſolves upon this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 16 <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word.</hi> And he tells us what uſe he makes of it, <hi>v</hi> 105. <hi>Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, and a light unto my path.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt be frequent in meditation on the Word of God.</hi> It is not enough for us curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to read it, and ſet our ſelves a ſtint of ſo doing, but we muſt do it with underſtanding &amp; conſideration; how elſe ſhould it be our guide in the paths of peace? <hi>David</hi> reſolveth on this. <hi>Pſal</hi> 119 15. <hi>I will meditate in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and have reſpect unto thy ways</hi>; and he tells us for what end he did it, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee</hi>; and to what a degree of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with it he arrived by this courſe, he tells us, <hi>verſe</hi> 99. <hi>I have more underſtanding than all my teachers, for thy teſtimonies are my meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt be careful in attending on the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</hi> God hath appointed the Goſpel Miniſtry for this end, that they may be helpful in acquainting us with his mind; &amp; when he beſtows ſuch upon us, it is a great bleſſing; he therefore promiſed that in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001036_0034_0FAEE9EC1804C9D8"/>
times, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will give you Paſtors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding</hi>; and he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made it our duty to afford all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent &amp; ponderous attention upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, that we may thereby get acquaintance with his mind; &amp; he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared all ſuch to be bleſſed ones who do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully comply therewithal, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We muſt joyn to all prayer for the Spirit of Illumination to be afforded us.</hi> We do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand in need of the Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to inform us about the will of God, tho' the matter of the knowledge of it is therein contained <hi>Doctrinally</hi>; but of the Spirit too, to give us a right diſcerning: for we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally blind in ſpiritual things, and ſo need not only light to be ſet before us, but our eyes to be reſtored that we may perceive it. And though there is a remainder of the light of nature in us, which can apprehend the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of many <hi>moral Duties,</hi> yet we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtrangers to the way of <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> by which alone we can walk with God: this therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prays for on their behalf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 17, 18. <hi>That the Father may give to them the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001036_0035_0FAEE9ECDF555CC0"/>
being enlightned, &amp;c.</hi> And good reaſon; for he tells us in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 14 <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned.</hi> Surely then we ſhould pray for it in reſpect of our ſelves, in the words of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119 18 <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>We muſt corroborate our love to the Rule.</hi> It is not enough to have a Theoretical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, for it is certain that we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto it no farther than we love it: The natural man is offended at the <hi>Rule</hi> of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience given us by God; his heart riſeth up againſt it, he hath entertained prejudices at it, yea is a meer lump of ermity, as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> And ſo much as there is of the law of ſin remaining in the beſt; ſo far is their love defective &amp; ſtands in need of fortifying. And here obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all ſincere Obedience is the exerciſe of love.</hi> Faith indeed regulates our Obedience, but it is love that acts it, according to <hi>Gal</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith that worketh by love.</hi> We walk with God in no duty any farther than we do it in love, for we are told in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 10. <hi>Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law</hi> And for this reaſon all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is called by the name of love, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001036_0036_0FAEE9ED9321EB30"/>
put diſtributively with faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 13. <hi>Faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> ſo argues, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Love is of God, &amp; every one that loveth is born of God, &amp; knoweth God; he that loveth not, knoweth not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence we no farther pleaſe God, than we are acted by this love in our Duties.</hi> We may be very circumſpect in the matter of them, and critical to the very tithing of mint, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe and cummin, and take a great deal of pains in the performance of it; but ſtill, if this principle doth not influence them, God will not take the leaſt content therein; and good reaſon, for love is the very life of the precept, and obedience thereto is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 38 <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp; with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; this is the firſt and great Commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That we may ſo do, we must get perſwaded of the excellency of the Rule, and the felicity of them that delight themſelves in it.</hi> It is the lovelineſs of the object that attracts our love to it; and we muſt diſcern that in it which renders it ſo, in order to our union with it. We have <hi>David</hi> profeſſing of his inexpreſſible love to this Rule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh, how I love thy law!</hi> And no wonder that he was thus raiſed in his mind, for he could
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001036_0037_0FAEE9EE51F64440"/>
give that incomparable encomium of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, <hi>&amp;c. The law of God is perfect, &amp;c. More to be deſired than gold, yea than much fine gold, ſweeter alſo than the honey, and the honey comb.</hi> And that we may keep up this value, we muſt look upon it as the great medium of Communion with God in this life; and if we love that above all things, we ſhall prize this for that reaſon proportionably.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>We muſt be very accurate in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſee that they comport with the precept.</hi> The Word of God is a Rule of life, and no farther profiteth us than as we order our Converſation according to it: and for this we ought to take great heed to its counſels, and accordingly lay out all our actions by it: to do nothing but by the direction of it, and to bring all that we have done to the trial of it; &amp; this is that accurate walking which is commended to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. <hi>See that you walk circumſpectly</hi>; for if we depart from this Rule, we therein depart from God. And there are two things eſpecially that we are to be curious about in this affair.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>About the matter of them.</hi> God hath told us what we ſhould do, and what we are to avoid, if we would pleaſe him in our Converſation; and there is much of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be uſed by us in this, if we would not miſs in our endeavours. For though we may
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001036_0038_0FAEE9EF127D5660"/>
do the matter of duty very plauſibly and without blame from men, or our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in that regard, and yet ſin, for want of all other requiſites to render it conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the precept; yet if we neglect or tranſgreſs that, we ſin unavoidably. We are forbidden to add or diminiſh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12 32. <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it; thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> And we are limited hither, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8 20 <hi>To the law, and to the teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the ſincere aim of them.</hi> We then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep with God in our actions, when we purſue the ſame end in them for which he preſcribes them: And though no pretence of a good end, and aiming at the glory of God in it, or the benefit of others, will gain the Divine approbation for any thing which is in it ſelf a Tranſgreſſion; yet a ſiniſter end in the doing of it, will ſpoil that which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a Duty. God always obſerves, not only what we do, but what we do it for; and if we fail in that point, he will make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon it, <hi>Zech</hi> 7.5 <hi>When ye faſted and mourned, &amp;c. did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?</hi> It ſpoileth prayers &amp; alms when they are done to <hi>be ſeen of men, Mat</hi> 6. <hi>beg.</hi> That then is to be fixed in our hearts in all our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001036_0039_0FAEE9F2891E1370"/>
of all ſorts, if we would keep with God in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>If we would walk with God, we must be much in theſe duties wherein cloſe communion with him is to be upheld.</hi> Although we are to follow him in all duties, yet there are ſome in which we ſeparate our ſelves for ſpecial intimacy with him, in which he is wont more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to manifeſt himſelf to his people, when they carefully ſeek him in them. And the more ſpecial of theſe are;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Secret Prayer.</hi> Prayer is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called <hi>a drawing nigh to God,</hi> becauſe in it we preſent our ſelves before him, and put up our petitions to him. Praying is an act of Divine Worſhip, and that in all the kinds of it; and God hath made it to be a medium of participation in his favour; and therefore when he had made large promiſes of bleſſings to his people, he tells them how they may come by them, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36 37. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> And of all prayers there are none in which a Child of God hath more of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and intimacy with him, than in thoſe that are performed in ſecret. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed to and about this ſort of prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 6. Here we may pour out our hearts
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001036_0040_0FAEE9F454098C10"/>
before him; here we may open all our caſes with the greateſt freedom, whiles there's none that ſtands by to upbraid or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us; and the more we are ſincerely engaged in this Duty, the oftner ſhall we be in the Mount where God is, and have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate converſe with him; &amp; if we have not a great deal of ſuch private buſineſs with God every day, it is an ill ſign that we do not walk with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Diligent attendance on the Ordinances of his houſe.</hi> If we would walk with God, we muſt repair thither where his goings are: and we are told, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 24. <hi>They have ſeen thy goings Oh God, in the Sanctuary.</hi> And 77.13. <hi>Thy way, O God is in the Sanctuary.</hi> Here it is that he makes peculiar manifeſtations of his grace and love to his people; here he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the bleſſing, &amp; hath therefore promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his preſence to be with ſuch for this end, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20.24. <hi>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee</hi> This was the reaſon why the Pſalmiſt deſired it as a peculiar priviledge to <hi>dwell all his days in the houſe of God, Pſal.</hi> 27 4. <hi>To behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord</hi>; and in his exile he envies <hi>Swallows</hi> and <hi>Sparrows</hi> their liberty of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the <hi>Altar, Pſal.</hi> 84 3. And why? but becauſe he counted them to be happy men who were ſo priviledged, <hi>verſe</hi> 4 <hi>Bleſſed
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001036_0041_0FAEE9F59DD84240"/>
are they that dwell in thine houſe.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might have a refreſhing ſight of God that his Soul ſo <hi>longed</hi> and <hi>thirſted, Pſal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in thy Sanctuary.</hi> Only if we would enjoy this benefit when we come there, we muſt be ſure that we make this our buſineſs; that it be our very errand to his houſe, to get into his company and fellowſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual Communion with ſuch as walk with him.</hi> We before obſerved, that if we make ungodly men our companions, it will be the readieſt way to loſe Gods company: and we may here further take notice, that to be much with thoſe that fear him, is the way to be near him. If we take heed that our frequent and intimate fellowſhip be with them whoſe fellowſhip is with God, we are then of that ſociety in which he delights; for we are told, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him</hi>; and this is the argument uſed by the Apoſtle to invite thoſe whom he writes to, into the fellowſhip of the Saints, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with God the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Only obſerve, that it is not enough to aſſociate our ſelves with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; meer civil friendſhip will not advance this, but it muſt be ſpiritual; for by that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is that they do mutually edify one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001036_0042_0FAEE9F5D69DAC40"/>
When we chuſe ſuch as are gracious for our ſociety, and make it our endeavour to ſtir up each others graces, and confer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the <hi>Matters of the Kingdom,</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to warm each others hearts with holy &amp; heavenly diſcourſes, we ſhall then have Chriſt to come and make one in the Company, as he did to thoſe <hi>two Diſciples,</hi> who walked together, and talked of the affairs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Chriſt; Luk.</hi> 24 14, 15. And were this Duty revived, which ſo much languiſheth, and is ſo little purſued, there would be a great deal more of cloſe walking with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, than there is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Self examination, accompanied with renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repentance.</hi> And indeed it is requiſite that theſe two be in conjunction; for there will be no kindly Repentance, but upon ſelf reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſerious calling of our ſelves to an account daily, will promove the exerciſe of Repentance in us There is a great deal of folly breaking forth in our Converſation, when we take never ſo much heed to our ſelves, and much more when we are remiſs in our watch, which we are too often guilty of; in all of which we get ſo far out of the way wherein God and we ſhould go together &amp; till by Repentance we turn into it again, we keep at a diſtance from him: whiles then we take no heed to reckon with our ſelves, this
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001036_0043_0FAEE9F69934A300"/>
ſeparation will abide, whereas they that are often calling of themſelves to a ſtrict account, enquiring where they are, what they have been doing, &amp; bring themſelves to the Rules of Tryal upon that account, are moſt likely to go the leaſt away from God, and to make the ſpeedieſt returns to him. This was a practice which the Pſalmiſt accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, if thoſe that are negligent in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting themſelves very often with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do ſo frequently ſtraggle away, and many times are a great while before they can recover their former communion with God.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>If we would walk with God, we muſt endeavour to ſubordinate all our outward concerns to his guidance and government.</hi> We have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this Duty extends to all that we have to do withal in this life. <hi>Enoch walked with God in his Oeconomical capacity</hi>; and it is certain, that a Chriſtian would be a great ſufferer by being obliged to the duties of his particular calling, which take up the bigger part of his time in this life, if his attendance thereupon would neceſſarily interrupt his Communion with God, but it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: and though it ſo fails out too often, that through the prevalency of our concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001036_0044_0FAEE9F78DAD4050"/>
&amp; our over eager letting out our ſelves upon theſe things, we are drawn away, and loſe our ſelves here, for which reaſon we have duties of Worſhip enjoyned us by God, to be frequently engaging our ſelves in as helps to recover and eſtabliſh us; yet it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us, and God expects it of us, that we order theſe affairs, and our ſelves in them, with that care and caution, that they may not hinder, but promove our Communion with him. And to that end;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt ſeek God, and not our ſelves, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately in theſe things.</hi> The things of this life are given to us for our ſupport in the world, &amp; the comfortable ſupply of our outward man; theſe being, by the Divine appointment, the things, on which we have our dependance for our bodily life and livelihood whiles we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here, in the ordinary courſe of Gods Providence; and hence it follows, that the next and immediate deſign of our contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labouring for theſe things, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral vocations that God placeth us in, is for the body, and the ſuitable ſupport of it. But we muſt not center here, and look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; much leſs are we to ſeek to gratify our fleſhly luſts with them, which is the fartheſt reach of unregenerate men, and is born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that ye may conſume it upon
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001036_0045_0FAEE9F80F942CA8"/>
your luſts.</hi> But as we are to devote our whole lives to the Service and glory of God; ſo we ought to deſire, endeavour and pray for the ſupplies and comforts of it, with this great purpoſe, that therewith we may the better honour him and be encouraged therewithal in our faithful obedience: that therefore is a precept enjoyned us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3 9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance</hi>; and we are told that God gave Iſrael all thoſe things for this end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105 44, 45. <hi>And gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labour of the people; that they might obſerve his statutes, and keep his laws</hi>; &amp; the neglect of this is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly threatned, in <hi>Deu</hi> 28.47, 48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord with joyfulneſs &amp; gladneſs of heart, for the abundance of all things, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Take heed that we be not put by our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Duties for worldly affairs.</hi> Theſe are our principal buſineſs <hi>Mat</hi> 6 33. <hi>Seek firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi> God hath not made the duties which he requires of us to interfere, but they may very ſuitably joyn and go hand in hand, if it be not our own fault; and we may and ought to allot to each their ſeaſon: we ought to be diligent in our callings, but we are to worſhip God too Our being good husbands muſt not hinder our being good Chriſtians, but pay a due deference to it, elſe we ſhall be guilty of the worſt husbandry that can
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001036_0046_0FAEE9F8D33C9750"/>
be: we muſt not follow the world ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as either to thruſt out Religious duties, or tire our ſelves to an unfitneſs to attend them; all our ſucceſs depends on the bleſſing of God, <hi>Prov</hi> 10 22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord, it maketh rich</hi>; &amp; all our endeavours, all our prudence and induſtry without it is of no value. If we think the time loſt from the world, that we ſpend in daily religious exerciſes, we run away from God, and practically deny his ſuperintendency over all humane affairs, nor can we have ground to expect to enjoy him with us in our employments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us ſubmit the iſſue of theſe things to the Providence of God.</hi> Diligence and diſcretion is our Duty, and we muſt ask that of God too, for it is his gift; but after all our care and wiſdom, he governs the event as he will; and the wiſe man obſerves in, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 9 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, nor yet bread to the wiſe nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor favour to men of skill</hi>; and he tells us that we ought to do our Duty under the ignorance of what ſhall be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withold not thine hand; for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, &amp;c.</hi> that therefore is the advice given us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.15 <hi>Ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that</hi>; and for this end we are to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001036_0047_0FAEE9F9B994AD48"/>
commit every thing that we are concerned in, to him by faith and prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord.</hi> And when we have ſo done, it behooves us to be quiet, and not to perplex our ſelves with anxious cares about it, but to wait patiently till we ſee the end of it, believing that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, and as he hath all things at his diſpoſe, ſo he will certainly bring them about in ſuch a way, as ſhall be moſt for his glory, and our beſt good; and in this we ſhould with greateſt ſatisfaction wait upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in well doing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us carry it ſuitably towards God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition of this life.</hi> There are many changes that we are liable to in regard of the affairs of this world, and there is an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deportment required of us, if we would ſerve God aright in them; we are therefore adviſed in, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.14 <hi>In the day of proſperity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, in the day of adverſity conſider.</hi> If God ſmiles upon our ſecular concerns, and we proſper in our way, it becomes us to give him the praiſe of it, and not <hi>to ſacrifice to our own net, and burn incenſe to our own drag</hi>; as they, <hi>Hab</hi> 1 16 And to ſtudy how we may ſerve him in and with it; and take heed to our ſelves, that it do not become a ſnare to hinder us in our faithful obedience to him: &amp; if he defeat our moſt likely undertakings,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001036_0048_0FAEE9FA50079F58"/>
and bring us low in the world, we ought to adore his Soveraignty, and ſtudy what is the language of it, ſo as to improve it to lower our eſteem of mutable things, and fix us the more in our earneſt purſuit after <hi>a mere endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>If we would maintain our walking with God, we muſt uſe all means to eſtabliſh our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</hi> A Chriſtians walk is not only for a turn or two, but it is to continue all his life. It is mentioned as the reproach of thoſe Diſciples, who ſometimes had followed Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. <hi>From that time many of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> And Chriſt declares how ill he reſents ſuch a thing, <hi>Luk</hi> 9.62. <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now the Children of God meet with a great many temptations, which offer to draw them off, to prejudice them at the good ways of God, to allure them after the vanities of this world, and make them to be weary and faint in their Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; whereas the promiſe runs to ſuch <hi>as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end, Mat</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001036_0049_0FAEE9FDEBC5CF80"/>
Children of God in this world, and that it conſiſts in this, that they live with God, and have the advantage of converſing with him. This is the reaſon why <hi>David</hi> declares them to be <hi>bleſſed who hear the joyful ſound, Pſal.</hi> 89.15. <hi>They ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy Countenance.</hi> Reckon every diſtance from him to be ſo far an unhappineſs but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be ſufficient to carry you above all fear in the darkeſt condition that you can be in; as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4 <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us keep our eye firmly fixed upon the unſeen and eternal things.</hi> There are the things of time that the people of God do here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter withal, which have ſuch an aſpect on them, as if they look no farther, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and make them to faint under the difficulty of them. We read of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground profeſſors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>When tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended.</hi> Now ſuch trials as theſe are to be expected; it is an Evangelical Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>That we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; and if we do look no farther, we ſhall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tire and give in; for we are told, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt we are of all men moſt miſerable</hi>; but if <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

look forward by an eye of faith, we ſhall have a proſpect which will ſwallow up all this, take off the diſcouragement of the way we are walking in, and give us freſh vigour in our purſuit of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 18 <hi>For which cauſe we faint not; whiles we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us get an heart more and more weaned from all the objects of ſenſe.</hi> There is Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence remaining in the beſt of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here; and ſenſible objects have anattra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs in them, to draw away our fleſhly appetite after them; and that will certainly diſturb our Perſeverance, and thereby impede our Communion with God, and make us to drive heavily in our courſe of Chriſtianity. We muſt therefore be very careful to get our hearts looſned more and more every day from theſe things, if we would hold on unmoveably in our way. Let us take that advice, and be quickned by the argument with which it is ſtrengthened, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And to that end let us get more practical experience of the emptineſs and vanity of theſe things, and the very great hindrance that an over eager affection to them gives to the great
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001036_0051_0FAEEA00B7F58FC0"/>
concerns of our Souls; which he that hath any intimate acquaintance with himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not but ſubſcribe unto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us contemn all the flatteries and frowns of the world.</hi> The great endeavour of the world is to draw us off from our Walking with God, which it proſecutes with utmoſt intenſeneſs; and there are theſe two ways in which it attempts it, <hi>viz.</hi> either by faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inſinuations wherewith it endeavours to ſteal our hearts away after, and by falſe repreſentations of things, as if accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give us the beſt ſatisfaction, to draw away our love to it, and if it prevails, we ſhall go off from God; or elſe by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and affronts to terrify us, and make us afraid of following our way, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things with a diſcouraging aſpect: but we muſt entertain both of theſe with an holy ſcorn, and when they are preſſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hard upon us, to ſay to the one, as <hi>Peter</hi> once to <hi>Magus, Acts</hi> 8.20. <hi>Thy money periſh with thee</hi>; and to reſolve of the other, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth with reſpect to thoſe <hi>bonds and afflictions that did abide him, Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>None of theſe things move me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let us be content to go alone.</hi> It is true, we cannot be alone, if we have God with us; however, as to men it may be ſo. It is obſervable that this is the encomium that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001036_0052_0FAEEA01221CE518"/>
God gave to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 7 1. <hi>Thee have I ſeen righteous before me in this generation:</hi> And it is certain, that there are but a few who go in this Walk. Gods Company, that have fellowſhip with him, is but a little compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: the multitude go in the other way, which leads from him. There is an holy ſingularity which all they muſt be contented withal, that would hold communion with God in this life; nor muſt it prejudice them if they ſee, not only the greateſt number, but alſo the wiſeſt men in the worlds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, going in another road.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>We must be content to follow God in the dark.</hi> It is true, God is ſometimes pleaſed to lead his Children in the <hi>light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> and that is a very comfortable thing, and <hi>they can rejoyce all the day in his name</hi>; according to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.15, 16. But he very often calls them into a dark vale; there are clouds that encompaſs them, and they cannot clearly ſee their way before them; and if it be ſo with us, we muſt not baulk that, but reſolve ſtill to go on, that we may keep with him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 23.4. Nay, if he hide his face from us, and we are environed with darkneſs, trouble and fear, yet we muſt after him, and not deſert him, and ſay as he, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, I will truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:001036_0053_0FAEEA0206DF56A0"/>7. <hi>We muſt ever interpret dark Providences by the Promiſe.</hi> Sometimes there are very hard chapters in the Providence of God, which we are at a loſs about the meaning of, and now Temptations offer to draw us to deſpond, and ſit ſtill; but for us ſo to do will diſhonour God, whoſe Service we have engaged our ſelves in, and bring us more into the dark; and though we cannot ſee the particular meaning of ſuch Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at preſent, yet we have a clue, which if we follow, it will never deceive us, and that is the promiſe, unto which all Providences are accommodated, and ſhall iſſue in the accompliſhment of; and if there were no more, that one would be ſufficient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28 <hi>We know that all things work together, for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Maintain a believing reſolve, that all they are happy that walk with God.</hi> Could we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways firmly build on his concluſion without wavering, how ſteadily would it help us to walk? Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Believe that your nearneſs to God now is your preſent ſafety and ſecurity.</hi> Satan, and the corrupt part in us, would perſwade us to count it our danger, and thereby fright us from it, and could the adverſaries of our Souls have their will, they would make it ſo;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001036_0054_0FAEEA02AD343848"/>
but God hath aſſured us that it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: <hi>David</hi> gives this reaſon why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to dwell ſo near to God, Pſal. 27 5. <hi>For in the time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his pavilion.</hi> And this is the argument of encouragement which God uſeth to fortify the hearts of his people againſt fear, <hi>Iſa</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee, be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: I will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee; yea, I will help thee, yea, I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee by the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Believe that all that walk with him here, ſhall reſt with him for ever.</hi> The way in which all ſuch as theſe go, is the way of peace; it is the way to eternal life; and all that follow it to the end of it, ſhall without fail arrive at laſt in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Kingdom. They that walk with God, have him for their <hi>Guide</hi>; and <hi>David</hi> could preſume upon this, <hi>Pſal</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to Glory.</hi> And let the way be in it ſelf never ſo difficult, and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, yet this is your conſolation, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of ſuch a Guide there is no fear of miſcarrying.</p>
