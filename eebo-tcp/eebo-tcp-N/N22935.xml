            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAVING frequently obſerved that ſome <hi>Jews</hi> attended my preaching, I was led to reflect on the <hi>preſent ſtate</hi> of that dear neglected people. The more attentively I conſidered the matter, the more ſenſibly was my compaſſion excited, and the more powerfully were my affections drawn out towards them. At length my heart diſſolved in pity; and I determined to preach to them on a ſubject, in which, I conceive, they are deeply intereſted. This I did: and multitudes of them, knowing my intention, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured me with a candid hearing. The diſcourſe itſelf I now publiſh; in compliance with the earneſt ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral who heard it; in vindication of myſelf from the errors and abſurdities ſome <hi>mercenary printers and bookſellers</hi> would father upon me in their <hi>ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious editions;</hi> and in hopes that the profits, ariſing from the ſale of it among the Gentiles, will enable me to diſtribute the copies <hi>gratis</hi> to the Jews.</p>

            <p>☞ On peruſing the following Diſcourſe, the reader will be naturally led to inquire, "Is it known whether this Sermon had any particular effect upon the Jews?" To ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this inquiry, the following extracts are ſubjoined.—</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>PIERCE,</hi> of Birmingham, in a letter of the 20th of November laſt, to a Miniſter in Boſton, thus writes—."It will give you pleaſure to be informed that many Jews in London have lately attended on the Goſpel—that a Society for their inſtruction is formed—that the ſecond Sermon preached to them under its patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was delivered laſt night—and that they expreſs gratitude for the reſpect ſhewn them by theſe appropriate ſorvices."</p>
            <p>In another letter from the Rev. Mr. <hi>MANTLE,</hi> of Weſtbury, in England, to a Clergyman in Newbury-Port, dated February ult. is the following—"The clouds of darkneſs which have long hung over God's ancient people the Jews begin to diſſipate, and the glorious purpoſes of Heaven beam forth in their progreſs to perfect day. The Batavian Aſſembly has diſſolved the unnatural alliance of Church and State, and reſtored to the privileges of citizens, the Jews who are diſtributed throughout their provinces in vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. In London, thouſands of the Jews attend under the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of Mr. <hi>COOPER,</hi> in Sion-Chapel. Vaſt numbers of his firſt Sermon [the one here followin have been publiſhed and diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted gratis among them, and conſiderable efforts are making to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the knowledge of Chriſtianity among that long neglected people."</p>

            <head>The PRAYER.</head>
            <p>O THOU God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob! behold the company of poor ſinners, Jews and Gentiles this day in thy great preſence. O Lord God! bow down, and bleſs with thy ſmiles, this numerous congregation; be in the midſt of this people as thou waſt in the midſt of the camp of Iſrael of old, and let that glory which went before them, be ſhown unto us. O Lord God Almighty! behold the children of Iſrael; and ſtretch forth, for their deliverance, thy hand, which is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave; and let thine ear, which is not heavy, be inclined to our petitions. We deſire to praiſe thy name for all the wonders that are recorded in thy bleſſed word. Thou didſt take thy ſervant Abraham of old out of the land where he was; thou didſt call him into a land where he had never been; and thou didſt, contrary to nature, give him a ſon, from whom thou didſt promiſe a ſeed ſhould come, in which all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. Thou didſt, by wonderful mercies—thou didſt by wonderful providences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them and their children, when they ſtood in need of thy protection. Thine arm was ſtretched forth for their help. Thou didſt call them to go, and it was of thy wiſdom that they did go, into a land where they were in captivity for an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time. There, Lord, thou didſt bleſs them. Thou waſt not forgetful of thy promiſe; but, notwithſtanding their rebellion, thou cauſedſt them to multiply into an exceeding great nation; and when the time appointed was come, in the very hour which thou hadſt appointed, notwithſtanding their frequent rebellion againſt thee, thou waſt regardful of thy promiſe, and didſt deliver them. Thou didſt bring them out of Egypt with a mighty hand; thou didſt divide the Red Sea, that thine Iſrael might paſs through. Their enemies, purſuing them, were overwhelmed in the deep, while they paſſed through dry ſhod, ſinging thy praiſes. Again they rebelled againſt thee, and thou didſt lead them about in a waſte, howling wilderneſs; nevertheleſs, thou didſt carry them like an eagle, and keep them as the apple of thine eye. Though thou didſt bring down thy judgments upon them, yet juſtice was always tempered with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030279_0006_0FE59DB895D50128"/>mercy; and thou didſt never puniſh them as their ſins deſerved. Athougth, after forty years, thou didſt bring them into the land which thou hadſt prepared for them; their enemies, though mighty, falling before them: there they worſhipped thee, and there they enjoyed thy preſence; till at length thou didſt take thy preſence for a little time from them, and ſufferedſt them to fall before their enemies. Nevertheleſs, at the appointed time thou didſt reſtore them. They offended again and again; and were again and again captivated, and again delivered. They were under captivity, according to thy prophecies, ſeventy years: but thou waſt faithful, O God! and at the expiration of the appointed time, thou didſt ſend thy ſervants of old to be their leaders; and, according to thy promiſe, didſt bring them again to their land; and thy temple was again reſtored to them. They continued there, in different ſtates and conditions, for many years; till at length the Romans, the people whom thou hadſt permitted to come, overpowered them, and the ſceptre depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Judah, and the lawgiver from between his feet. O Lord God! thou didſt ſay in thy word, that there ſhould then appear a wonderful man upon earth: Lord, teach us what we ſhould think of that man. Thou ſcatteredſt them abroad; at this day they have no prieſt, no ſacrifice, no temple, nor can they worſhip thee according to thy law. But thou haſt promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Iſrael ſhall be ſaved in the Lord with an everlaſting ſalvation. Let this day, O God! be the beginning of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Now, O God of gods, Light of lights, ſhine down into our hearts, chaſe away the clouds of unbelief and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and give us ſaith in thee, as Abraham thy ſervant had. Thou didſt ſay to Abraham, "In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed." Many have ariſen who have pretended to be this promiſed ſeed, and have proved otherwiſe; but there was a man who, when the ſceptre was about to depart, did great miracles, and the Jews themſelves bore witneſs of them. Teach us, O Lord! what we ſhould think of that man. If he be the Meſſiah O God! let us believe in him. Lead us into all truth, teach us to underſtand thy word, and thine ſhall be the glory. O Lord! as this is my birth-day, let it be the birth-day of thouſands, and let thy preſence be ſhewn to Iſrael in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030279_0007_0FE59840DB8902E0"/>manner to-day. Hear us, O God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob! and do more and better for us, poor unworthy Gentiles, but more eſpecially for thine ancient Iſrael, thy dear people, the Jews, than we can aſk or think.</p>

            <p>BLESSED be the God of Abraham for the glorious ſight which I now behold! Thouſands of divers nations, Jews and Gentiles, are aſſembled beneath this roof to hear the word of God! O may the Spirit of the Almighty enable me to preach it faithfully, and may your hearts be opened cordially to receive it.</p>
            <p>Gentile ſinners, you are this day highly honoured with the preſence of a noble nation. Behold the ancient Iſrael of God; and, conſcious of your own inferiority, reverence them as your ſuperiors.</p>
            <p>Ye ancient Iſrael of God, we view you with rapturous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and veneration; nor are we aſhamed to acknowledge your great ſuperiority. Our forefathers, forgetting your high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, may have inſulted you, but we diſclaim their baſe actions, and would atone for their faults by double humiliation. You are the lineal deſcendants of God's ancient choſen people; we are the children of idolatrous and execrable Gentiles. To you were committed the lively oracles of God, while our fathers groped in ignorance, and periſhed for lack of knowledge. Yet your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prayed for us; and we, prompted by gratitude, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate their conduct, and ſeek to do you good. Actuated by this motive, I, an unworthy worm, preſume this day to preach unto you the word of the Lord. Not that I am wiſer than you. No; I am only a poor child, completing this day my twentieth year; but convinced of my own inability to inſtruct grey hairs, I earneſtly pray the Lord to be unto me a mouth and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>As I am ſtanding before a company of Jews, among whom are many learned men, it might be expected by ſome that I ſhould addreſs them in a learned manner. This, however, I cannot do; for I candidly confeſs, in the preſence of you all,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030279_0009_0FE59DBC52FC7558"/>that I underſtand no language but the Engliſh. Craving, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, indulgence, if, in pronouncing Hebrew names, my accent ſhould be improper, and entreating the moſt candid attention whilſt I reaſon on the doctrines of this book with all poſſible perſpicuity and plainneſs—I enter on the great work before me with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>There is little occaſion, I preſume, for acquainting this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with the remarkable occurrence which ſeems to be a prelude to the gracions promiſe in my text. For the ſake, however, of thoſe who are uninformed, ſhould any ſuch be here preſent, a brief recital may be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>God having called Abraham from his native land into a ſtrange country, gave him the promiſe of a ſon, from whom a numerous progeny ſhould deſcend; tho' at that time, Abraham was an hundred years old, and Sarah, according to the courſe of nature, paſt child-bearing. Abraham believed in God; but ſo far was Sarah from thinking ſuch an event poſſible, that when the promiſe was given, ſhe laughèd, ſaying with an air of incredulity, "Shall I bear a ſon?" Nevertheleſs, Sarah did conceive, and bear a ſon to Abraham, in his old age, at the ſet time of which God had ſpoken to him (Gen. xxi. 2:) and from him, thus miraculouſly conceived, when the ſprings of nature were dried up, the Meſſiah himſelf was to deſcend, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as impoſſible in the eye of ſenſe, as a root could ſpring up out of dry ground.</p>
            <p>For the further trial of Abraham's faith, God ſaith to him, when Iſaac was grown up, "Take now thy ſon, thy only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering, upon one of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which I will tell thee of." The good man roſe early in the morning, and taking his ſon, and the things needful for the ſacrifice, began his journey. On the third day, O! painful ſight! he lift up his eyes, and beheld the place afar off where his lamb muſt bleed. O! aſtoniſhing faith! that enabled him to proceed at the divine command, while nature's perſuaſive voice, like the tempting ſerpent, urges him to diſobey. But nature, already bleeding, receives another wound; for, as they went on both of them together, Iſaac ſaid, "My father; and he replied, Here am I, my ſon. And he ſaid, Behold the fire
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030279_0010_0FE59DC0D5D61298"/>and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" And Abraham ſaid, "My ſon, God will provide himſelf a lamb for a burnt-offering." At ſuch a queſtion what muſt he feel! how difficult to ſuppreſs the tears that were ready to burſt from his eyes! "Ah! dear child, little doſt thou think what I am about to do. Thou art the lamb. My hand muſt ſix in thy beloved breaſt the deadly ſteel." He ſtruggles againſt the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought, and perſeveres. At length they reach the place. There Abraham builds the altar, and on the altar he lays the wood in order. He binds his ſon, and lays him on the wood. Taking the fatal knife, he ſtretches forth his hand, and ſtands prepared to ſlay his ſon. O Abraham, forbear. If thy faith be deaf to nature's voice, liſten one moment to what reaſon has to ſay. "Art thou not to be the father of many nations? Is it not ſaid, "In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called?" How can the divine prediction be fulfilled if Iſaac dies without a child? Drop, therefore, the knife, and let thy darling live." But no; the man of God obeys the voice of Heaven; and now, behold the ſon of promiſe ready to receive the mortal wound. Juſt at that inſtant the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do you any thing unto him; for now I know thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou has not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me. And Abraham looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns; and he went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the ſtead of his ſon. And the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven a ſecond time, and ſaid, By myſelf have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord, for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon, that in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of the heaven and as the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore; and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the gate of his enemies. And," then follows the GRAND PROMISE, "In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed."</p>
            <p>This promiſe is made to Abraham, that illuſtrious character, whom Jews and Gentiles reverence, and whom God himſelf delighted to honour. His name was Ab-ram, mighty-father, but God changed it to Abraham, the father of multitudes, or nations, as it is ſaid, Gen. xvii. 5. "the father of many nations
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030279_0011_0FE59DC2DD3FF210"/>have I made thee." This could not be ſpoken of him in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his progeny after the fleſh, for he was the father of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el only, a ſingle nation; it muſt, therefore, deſign that ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual race that ſhould ſpring from this SEED, in whom all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth are to be bleſſed. We join with you in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominating Abraham, by way of eminence, "the father of the faithful." How juſtly he deſerves this title, may be inferred from what hath been ſaid. Not becauſe he is either the author of faith, or the object of it, but becauſe his faith was, of all men's the greateſt and moſt conſpicuous: and as you are his children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, I pray God you may be imitators of his faithfulneſs.</p>
            <p>He is likewiſe called "the friend of God;" the moſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied appellation that ever was conferred on a mortal man. In conſequence of his friendſhip, he was admitted to the greateſt confidence and familiarity, inſomuch that God would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the cities of the plain without firſt acquainting him with his deſign. "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" I grant that in the Canticles he calls his people collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, friends; ſaying, "Eat, O friends! and drink abundantly, O beloved!" but he never ſpake to any individual of them but Abraham, in terms of intimacy like theſe.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh nation, being the natural poſterity of this faithful Abraham, this friend of God, and bearing in their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the marks of their high deſcent, derive no ſmall honour from this very circumſtance. The meaneſt Jew has, in this reſpect, more dignity than the greateſt Princes; for kingly deſcent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be traced ſo high, nor can the proudeſt monarch upon earth boaſt of ſuch noble progenitors. What warrior can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with David, or who, for wiſdom and riches, can vie with Solomon? Yet theſe, Oye Jews! were your anceſtors, and ſo alſo were many prophets and kings, whoſe names God himſelf has recorded with the higheſt honour, that they may be held in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting remembrance. If we Gentile ſinners do not, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, honour you as kings, and account ourſelves your ſervants, we diſgrace our profeſſion. Your nation was once the glow and terror of the world, and though that glory is now no more, it would be ſhameful in us to deſpiſe you; for the chiefeſt glory of your nation yet remains, that <hi>ſeed</hi> of Abraham <hi>in whom all the nations of the earth are to be bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030279_0012_0FE59DC46EE6F158"/>
The word <hi>ſeed</hi> confines the promiſe to one family, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to one perſon, that is the Meſſiah; but the bleſſing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, and upon all them that believe. Call us Gentile dogs, if you pleaſe; we are ſo, and the moſt contemptible name is not too bad for us. Yet do not wiſh to exclude us from the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings comprehended in this promiſe. We alſo hope for eternal happineſs through the <hi>ſeed</hi> of Abraham, the MESSIAH; who we conceive is already come, and we ought not to look for anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This you doubt. This I ſirmly believe. If I am wrong, may God convince me to day! O! convince me before this multitude, and let thy Iſrael, if they are wrong, bow to the ſceptre of truth, that we may no longer be at variance, but all conſeſs the glory of God in the promiſed ſeed.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, candidly inquire into theſe three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: firſt, Whether the Meſſiah be actually come; ſecondly, If he be, who this Meſſiah is; and thirdly, What bleſſings all nations derive from him?</p>
            <p>Firſt, is the Meſſiah come? It appears to me that he is. In ſupport of this I ſhall adduce, though I am but a child in knowledge, four Scriptures, which I think are concluſive; wiſer men, I dart ſay, could bring a thouſand.</p>
            <p>The firſt paſſage to which I ſhall refer, you will find in the forty-ninth chapter of Geneſis, where Jacob, bleſſing his ſons, pronounces the following on Judah: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe; thy hand ſhall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children ſhall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my ſon, thou art gone up; he ſtooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who ſhall rouſe him up? The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</p>
            <p>Setting aſide all the needleſs objections of your nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tranſlation of theſe words, let us, for a moment, conſider their import; for men of wiſdom and learning, like you, know that all objections of that ſort are merely cavils. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Hebrew word, which we tranſlate <hi>ſceptre,</hi> to mean a rod, as you ſay, yet there is no doubt but it means a ſtaff or rod of power, not of affliction. This is plain from what follows in the ſame ſentence—"nor a lawgiver from between his feet;"
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030279_0013_0FE59DC6033F2570"/>for you cannot deny but the word rendered <hi>lawgiver,</hi> is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly tranſlated; ſo that if we leave out the word <hi>ſceptre,</hi> the meaning will be plain enough; namerly, that governing power ſhall not depart from Judah till Shiloh come; but Judah governs no more—the ſceptre is departed. I ſhall not attempt to prove the exact time when it did depart; you are much wiſer than I, and know much better than I can tell you. My arguments, that the ſeeptre is now departed, and all knowledge of regal, ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and tribal deſcent utterly loſt. Eighteen hundred years, nearly, hath Jeruſalem been deſtroyed, nor is there a trace of ſovereignty remaining, or the hope of it poſſible. Are theſe things ſo, or are they not? Have you a king, or have you not? Where is your lawgiver? Where is the knowledge of your tribes? I defy the moſt learned Jew to tell me which of you is of Judah, which of Levi, or to what tribe he himſelf belongs. But this you all know, that the ſceptre is departed from Judah, and a lawgiver from between his feet. Then it follows, either that the unchanging God hath fled from his promiſe, or that Shiloh is come. You alſo know that about the time when the ſceptre departed, there appeared in the world a CERTAIN MAN, who was afterwards crucified at Jeruſalem; and that about that time many of your nation expected the Meſſiah; did they not? Let hiſtory, let your own writers be witneſſes. But if you will not believe that Shiloh is come, why do you pretend to believe this promiſe, ſeeing, if he is not come, it cannot be true?</p>
            <p>The next proof I ſhall allege, is a paſſage in the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Daniel; "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and upon thy holy city, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and prophecy, and to anoint the moſt holy. Know, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to reſtore and build Jeruſalem, unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks; the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſſiah be CUT OFF, (do you hear that, O ye Jews!) MESSIAH SHALL BE CUT OFF, but not for himſelf; and the people of the prince that ſhall come ſhall deſtroy the city and the ſanctuary; and the end
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030279_0014_0FE59DCDD2909040"/>thereof ſhall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations are determined. And he ſhall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the midſt of the week he ſhall cauſe the ſacriſice and the oblation to ceaſe, and for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading of abominations he ſhall make it deſolate, even until the conſummation, and that determined ſhall be poured upon the deſolate." You pay more reſpect to your Rabbies and their ſayings, than to God and his law. One of them hath paſſed a bitter curſe on any one that dares to calculate the time of the Meſſiah's coming. He prays that his bowels may guſh out. They are conſcious that he is come, and wiſh, by imprecations like this, to deter you from ſearching for the truth; but this will not deter me. I am too young and unlearned to enter into accurate computations; but I appeal to the moſt learned Jew, whether theſe ſeventy jubilee weeks, or weeks of years, muſt not have long ſince expired, and conſequently, whether the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah muſt not have appeared, and been cut off, as hiſtory reports? Seventy weeks of years amount to four hundred and ninety years. The period cannot be aſcertained exactly when thoſe weeks commenced. Some fix one time, and ſome another. But that is immaterial. Let this ſuffice, they are long ſince paſt. The text ſays, "ſeventy weeks are determined to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, to make an end of ſins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, (and who can bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, but an everlaſting God;) to ſeal up the viſion and prophecy and to anoint the moſt holy." Moſt of you will agree that Meſſiah the Prince is here intended; and if not, you muſt confeſs he is meant when his name is mentioned in the ſubſequent verſes. "From the going forth of the commandment to reſtore and build Jeruſalem, to Meſſiah the Prince, is ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks." Your own maſters, if they would, could calculate this time more exactly than I can. However, let me aſk your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, whether about the time when theſe ſeventy weeks drew to a concluſion, there was not a remarkable perſon who gave out that he was the Meſſiah; yea, whether many of your nation did not become his followers; and whether your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not CUT OFF that perſon? as it is ſaid, "the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah ſhall be cut off, but not for himſelf." Alſo, whether he did
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030279_0015_0FE59DCFAEC9E3D8"/>not pronounce at his death, "It is finiſhed?" After this is done, "The people of the prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the city." Now you all know the city of Jeruſalem is here meant; but you will obſerve the deſtruction of it is not mentioned, till after mention is made of Meſſiah's being cut off. But who are the people of the prince that ſhall come? Are they not the Romans? Did they not deſtroy your city, and deſolate your nation? "To the end of the war deſolations are determined." Thouſands, yea, tens of thouſands of your countrymen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Joſephus, periſhed in that bloody war; the country was made a deſolation, and ſo it remains to this day. But you will obſerve, that the Meſſiah was to be cut off, before the people of the prince ſhould come and deſtroy your city. But Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is deſtroyed, therefore the Meſſiah is cut off. Why, O Jews, why will you be blinded through unbelief? Why will you ſhut your eyes againſt the clear ſhining of truth? Firſt, Meſſiah muſt be cut off; and then in conſequence of that, the Romans ſhall come, and deſtroy your city. Is Jeruſalem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or is it not? It is deſtroyed; and your people remain, to this day, ſcatteted up and down upon the face of the earth. God's promiſes can never fail. It is therefore in vain for you to ſay, your ſinfulneſs hinders their fulfilment, This is not a conditional promiſe, but it is poſitive: "Seventy weeks are DETERMINED; the Meſſiah ſhall be cut off." When Iſrael was in Egypt, and the time came when God had promiſed to deliver them, their unworthineſs did not make God unfaithful; for he brought them out the <hi>ſelf-ſame</hi> night: and ſhall the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enty weeks expire, and ſhall not the Meſſiah come?</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, "He ſhall confirm the covenant with MANY, for one week, that is, ſeven years, and in the MIDST OF THE WEEK, he ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe." That is, this Meſſiah, whoever he is, ſhall confirm the covenant of God with your fathers concerning himſelf, by many <hi>infallible</hi> miracles, as well as by his life and doctrines. "And in the midſt of the week," that is, in about three years and a half af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he begins his work of confirming his covenant, "he ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe." I ſuppoſe this means, that being cut off, not for himſelf, but as a ſacrifice for the people, he ſhall, by that one offering of himſelf, render his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030279_0016_0FE59DD14537AD98"/>work perfect, and make all thoſe ſacrifices and oblations of the ceremonial law ineffectual; for types are like ſcaffolding, which is taken down when the building is completed.</p>
            <p>I remember, concerning that remarkable perſon who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about the time theſe ſeventy weeks were expired, that he wrought many miracles, and conſtantly aſſerted that he was the Meſſiah; yea, that he was <hi>cut off</hi> in about three years and a half after he had begun preaching; that his death happened about the time of the evening ſacrifice, ſome ſuppoſing that he groaned his laſt at the very moment the ſeventy weeks of Daniel were completed, as the angel ſpake to him, about the time of the evening oblation.</p>
            <p>The third paſſage I ſhall produce, you will find written in the fifth chapter of Micah: "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." That the Meſſiah is here ſpoken of, and the place of his nativity pointed out, the Jews themſelves acknowledge; for when Herod inquired where the Meſſiah ſhould be born, the chief prieſts and ſcribes anſwered, in Bethlehern of Judah, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging this prophecy in proof. That this prophecy might be fulfilled, God cauſed Caeſar to make a decree that the whole land ſhould be regiſtered; for which purpoſe all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go to their own city. Joſeph, being of the family of David, went to Bethlehem, where Jeſus was born; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his enrollment, of what family he was, and likewiſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the words of this prophecy. Where is Bethlehem now? From thence, according to your own teachers, Meſſiah is to come. But Bethlehem is deſtroyed: therefore Meſſiah is come. Jeruſalem is no more; Bethlehem is no more; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either this prophecy <hi>cannot</hi> be fulfilled, or it is already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; for, "out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael;" he ſhall go out from me; do the work which he hath undertaken, and come to me again. "There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will he give them up, until the time that ſhe which travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren ſhall return unto the children of Iſrael." I cannot tell how you may interpret this text; but I ſuppoſe it partly means that Iſrael
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030279_0017_0FE59DD2D7D793A0"/>ſhall be given up, till the fullneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in. Then ſhall all Iſrael confeſs the Meſſiah, and be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation. When that glorious event will take place, God only knows; but I truſt it is not far off. I think it is <hi>very</hi> near: and he alone who ruleth above, knows whether this day may not be the beginning of that glorious ſeaſon; and whether the converſion of the Jews may not be the means of ſpreading the Goſpel from pole to pole.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſcripture, from which I ſhall argue the point, is contained in the third chapter of Malachi: "Behold, I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall propare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the Meſſenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſts." To this I ſhall ſubjoin a paſſage in Haggai: "And I will ſhake all nations, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all nations ſhall come; and I will fill this houſe with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than of the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: and in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of hoſts." I ſhall argue from both theſe paſſages at once. Now there is no Jew but will acknowledge that the ſecond temple, built by Zerubbabel, was ſo far inferior to that of Solomon, that there was no compariſon between them; for though Herod beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this ſecond temple, and laviſhed vaſt ſums upon it, yet it was not in Herod's power to make it like Solomon's in glory. Compared with that, it was contemptible; but God, for the comfort of his people, here promiſes that its glory ſhall exceed the glory of the former. "For the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple—even the Deſire, or deſirable Object, of ALL nations." And it is evident that the preſence of the Meſſiah, God incarnate, was, according to this promiſe, to give it that ſuperior glory.</p>
            <p>Now, O Jews! your temple is deſtroyed, and you can have no reaſonable expectation of another. How then can this prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe be fulfilled, if it is not already fulfilled? How can the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the covenant come into that temple which is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? But it is evident it was not to be deſtroyed till he had come into it. As, therefore, it is deſtroyed, the Meſſenger, the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030279_0018_0FE59DDA4D6E7618"/>Deſire of all nations, muſt have already come into it. It cannot be ſpoken of a third temple, for God confined the promiſe to the ſecond: "I will fill THIS houſe with glory." And again, "The glory of this LATTER HOUSE ſhall be greater than of the former."</p>
            <p>O Jews! do ye not now believe? Shall God promiſe, and ſhall he not perform? Is he ſlack concerning his promiſe? Will the God of truth amuſe you with falſity? By no means: all his promiſes ſhall be fulfilled, without the delay of a moment. If he ſaid the Meſſenger ſhould come to his temple, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it he is come, as the Lord hath ſaid. May God Almighty enlighten you, that you may ſee the meaning of theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It is evident, whoever the Meſſiah is, that he is come: and nothing but blindneſs and unbelief, which have happened unto Iſrael, can engage them to look for another. All their hopes, therefore, like the paſt, muſt end in confuſion, till they return unto him from whom they have ſo greatly departed. But you will argue, that becauſe of your ſinfulneſs, God hath withheld his promiſe for a time. Was God ever wont to do ſo? When he promiſed you deliverance from Egypt, did he not deliver you the ſelf-ſame night as he had promiſed? did he not bring you forth with a mighty hand—lead you through the Red Sea, and overwhelm your purſuers in the mighty deep? Did he not lead you forty years through a waſte howling wilderneſs? and, notwithſtanding your rebellion, brought you into the promiſed land? If then, God hath been faithful in leſſer matters, ſhall he not keep his word concerning the Meſſiah? Yes, he hath kept his word, and Meſſiah is come. But who is the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah? This brings me to inquire, as I propoſed,</p>
            <p>Secondly, who the Meſſiah is? And this I ſhall do by inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating in whom is verified all that the prophets had foretold concerning him. To this end, I ſhall direct your attention to many paſſages in the book of God. Look into the twenty-ſecond Pſalm, and read the firſt verſe. "My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?" Theſe words are the language of prophecy, and ſeem to look forward to ſomething remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They were ſpoken by Jeſus of Nazareth, when he was in the agonies of death, and thouſands of the Jews heard him. Read alſo the 7th and 8th verſes of the ſame Pſalm. "All they that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn: they ſhoot out the lip; they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030279_0019_0FE59DDC253E7450"/>ſhake the head, ſaying, He truſted in the Lord, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, ſeeing he delighted in him." Theſe words were alſo ſpoken by the multitude, in deriſion of that ſame perſon, while he hung on the croſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxvii. 43.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the 14th verſe it is ſaid, "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint." This ſeems to allude to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death of crucifixion, which, by the extending of the body and the ſudden jerk it ſuſtained when the croſs was put down into the hole dug for that purpoſe, muſt ſometimes diſlocate the limbs; and perhaps it was ſo with Jeſus of Nazareth; but it is very remarkable concerning him, that a bone of him was not broken. Verſe the 15th ſays, "my ſtrength is dried up like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou haſt brought me into the duſt of death." Who can the Pſalmiſt be ſpeaking of? There is ſomething very ſtriking in the words. Whoever he is ſpeaking of, ſeems to be a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief. His ſorrows ſeem like a burning heat, which hath dried up his ſtrength, and cauſed a parching thirſt. I recollect alſo another paſſage in the Pſalms, which ſays, "They gave me alſo another paſſage in the Pſalms, which ſays, "They gave me alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me vinegar to drink."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. lxix. 21.</note> Is it not very ſurpring that all this ſhould be fulfilled in Jeſus of Nazareth? for they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xxvii. 48. Mark xv. 25. John xix. 29.</note> O ye Jews! is not this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable? But let us read again, a part of the 22d Pſalm: "For dogs have compaſſed me; the aſſembly of the wicked have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed me." O my God what do I ſee?—"THEY PIERCED MY MANDS AND MY FEET." Juſt ſo was it done to Jeſus of Naz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areth; and of a truth he was the Son of God—he is the Meſſiah that was to come. Hear, O Jews! hear the Pſalmiſt ſpeak, "They pierced my hands and my feet." But who is pierced? They pierced ME, ſaith the mighty God of Jacobs.<note n="§" place="bottom">Zech. xii. 10.</note> But David proceeds in his prophecy, "They part my garments among them, and caſt lots upon my veſture." O my ſoul! who can reſiſt the power of truth? This alſo was exactly fulfilled in Jeſus of Nazareth. The Roman ſoldiers took his garments, and made four parts, to every ſoldier a part; but his coat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very curiouſly wrought, they ſaid, Let us not rent it, but
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030279_0020_0FE59DDDB74308A0"/>caſt lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be: ſo they parted his raiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and upon his veſture did they caſt lots.<note n="*" place="bottom">John xix. 23, 24.</note> And you elſewhere read of the perſon that betrayed him, "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel againſt me."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pf. xli. 9. lv. 12—14.</note> Now Judas ate with his Maſter the very night in which he betrayed him, as you all know; but from what motive did Judas betray his Maſter? Why he told him for gain; and the very ſum for which he was fold, is mentioned by one of your own prophets; as alſo what uſe ſhould be afterwards made of the money. "And I ſaid unto them, if ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear: ſo they weighed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver. And the Lord ſaid unto me, caſt it unto the porter; a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of ſilver, and caſt them to the potter in the houſe of the Lord."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Zech. xi. 12, 13.</note> When Judas had ſold his maſter for thirty pieces of ſilver, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would not ſuffer him to keep them; he came, therefore, to the chief prieſts and elders, and confeſſing he had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innocent blood, threw down the money before them IN THE TEMPLE. How exactly does this agree with the prophecy juſt quoted. "And I took the thirty pieces of ſilver, and caſt them to the potter <hi>in the houſe of the Lord,"</hi> that is, the temple: "and the chief prieſts and elders taking council, bought with them the potter's field to bury ſtrangers in."<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. xxvii. 3-7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When Jeſus of Nazareth was taken by wicked hands, his diſciples all forſook him, and fled. And this was predicted by the prophet Zechariah. "Awake, O ſword! againſt MY ſhepherd, and againſt THE MAN that is my FELLOW, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered."<note n="|" place="bottom">Zech. xiii. 7.</note> Read alſo in Iſaiah, "I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſa. l. 6.</note> Not only was the back of Jeſus ſcourged, as the Evangeliſt informs us, "but they ſpit in his face, and buffeted him, and ſmote him with the palms of their hands."<note n="**" place="bottom">Mat. xxvii. 67.</note> His death was foretold by the prophet Daniel, "Meſſiah ſhall be cut off."<note n="††" place="bottom">Dal. ix. 26.</note> And the manner of his diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030279_0021_0FE59DDFC1666218"/>was prefigured by the brazen ſerpent, which Moſes fixed on a pole.<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxi. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall beg leave to read a part of the fifty-third chapter of Iſaiah. "For he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefs; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our ſorrows; yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. But he was <hi>wounded</hi> for our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he was <hi>bruiſed</hi> for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him; and with <hi>his ſtripes</hi> we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb; ſo he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from priſon and from judgment, and who ſhall declare his generation; for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken. And he made his grave with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with the rich in his death; becauſe he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth." According to the acknowledgment of one of your own teachers, this prophecy hampers you more than any other; and ſome of you have wiſhed it had not been written, or that it were expunged from the Old Teſtament writings. It is a rule among ſome of you, that you muſt believe all your teachers. Many of them have attempted to explain this Scripture; and moſt of them have differed in their ſentiments concerning it. Some have affirmed it relates to David, ſome to Joſhua, ſome to Zechariah, and others to Zerubbabel. But, agreeably to your own rule, you muſt believe them all. Now one of them has explained it as referring to the Meſſiah. Why then do ye not believe him? And he has tranſlated the words, "ſmitten of God and afflicted." <hi>God himſelf was ſmitten and humbled.</hi> But
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030279_0022_0FE59DE519AF39D0"/>wiſe men, like you, will not be blind followers of any man's opinion. I aſk you, therefore, of whom doth the Prophet here ſpeak? You know, O Jews! that he ſpeaks of the Meſſiah, who was "cut off" for your ſins—"who made his grave with the wicked"—was crucified between two thieves, "and with the rich in his death;" for he was buried in the grave of a rich man. O Jews! through this man only, can you have hope of everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, "I will not believe in a crucified God, a God that hath been hanged." But why not? becauſe the veil is ſtill upon your hearts; and unleſs the Great God is pleaſed to remove it, I know that the fooliſhneſs of my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will never convince you. So you ſay, you will not have a crucified Saviour? What! not have him whom the Pſalmiſt perſonates, when he ſays, "They pierced my hands and my feet." What! not believe in him "who hath borne your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;" and, as the Prophet ſpeaks, "caſt your ſins into the depths of the ſea?" Will you not have this Prince to reign over you? But you ſay, "it was never deſigned that your Meſſiah ſhould be a ſufferer." You certainly know otherwiſe; for it was ſore-ordained that he ſhould be cut off—that the ſword ſhould awake, and ſmite the ſhepherd, God's equal, and that the ſheep ſhould be ſcattered, and all with a view that the ſaying might be verified, "I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me." But who is God's equal? Is the wiſeſt Prophet—is the greateſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, equal with the great God? Nay, is the higheſt arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel in heaven his equal? No.—You ſhudder to entertain ſuch an idea. But the text ſays, "againſt the MAN that is my FELLOW, my EQUAL;" and this is no other than that "<hi>Child</hi> which ſhould be born, that <hi>Son</hi> which ſhould be given, the Wonderful Counſellor, the Mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. ix. 6.</note> "The God-man, the Meſſiah, the ſeed of the woman which hath bruiſed the ſcrpent's head; and in whom all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed." But your Meſſiah is ſpoken of in Scripture as a <hi>prophet, prieſt,</hi> and <hi>king.</hi> He is a <hi>prophet.</hi> "I will raiſe them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my word in his
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030279_0023_0FE59DE7302F1928"/>mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him. And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoever will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 18.</note> This prophet is to be "raiſed up from among their brethren." Jeſus of Nazareth anſwers to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter ſo far. He was born a Jew, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the houſe of David, in Bethlehem of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah. He is, moreover, to be like Moſes in meekneſs; "he was as a lamb dumb before the ſhcarers."—In power and working miracles, the winds and the waves obey him; he diſcerned the thoughts, raiſed the dead, and healed all manner of diſeaſes; And his miracles were not merely as marvellous as thoſe which Moſes wrought, but vaſtly more aſtoniſhing. Some of you, however, will ſay, it was all deluſion, and nothing better than enchantment. But an aſſertion is not a proof. You alſo ſay, that he obtained the power of working miracles, by ſtealing the great name of JEHOVAH, out of the temple. But in ſaying this; you do in effect ſay, either that he overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and ſo ſtole the name againſt his will, or that God was careleſs about it; or that being willing he ſhould take it, ſet his ſeal to a lie, and thus ſuffered thouſands of poor ſinners to be deluded. But, I hope, you will be diſpoſed to confeſs the truth, that this is the very prophet which God had ſo long promiſed. If he had not been the anointed of the Lord, never, never would thoſe miracles have been wrought which ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince that he was the true Meſſiah. Jeſus caſt out devils; and if Satan caſt out Satan, his kingdom cannot ſtand; but evil ſpirits themſelves confeſs, "Thou art the Holy One of God;" and they aſk, "Art thou come to torment us before the time?" They had no power to enter into the ſwine till they had firſt obtained his permiſſion.</p>
            <p>The laſt proof that Jeſus is that prophet which was to ariſe, you will find in the book of Deuteronomy, "When a Proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſpeaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken."<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 22.</note> But it hath not been ſo with our Prophet. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted concerning Jeruſalem, the three-walled city, that it ſhould be deſtroyed, and that "one ſtone of the temple ſhould
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030279_0024_0FE59DE8C40E40F8"/>not be left upon another, that ſhould not be thrown down." All the efforts of wicked men to rebuild it have proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the place where it once ſtood can ſcarcely be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. He alſo foretold, that "in the latter days falſe proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets ſhould ariſe, and deceive many." That prediction is now fulfilling. He alſo foretold his own death, and various other things, which we cannot now mention, all of which have been, or will be, exactly accompliſhed. And as Moſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the people, ſo did Chriſt; and particularly in the law of love. Is it not declared, "He that will not hearken to my words, which he ſhall ſpeak, I will require it of him." There appears to be ſomething more implied than ſpoken in this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. I am ready to believe it refers to the bleeding ſorrows of your nation for rejecting the Meſſiah: and till you repent, and turn unto him, your wounds will not be healed. Come, dear Jews, come and learn of our Prophet and yours. He will teach you the meaning of all your types and ſhadows. He will ſhew you the ſpirituality of the moral law, and how you may be delivered from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>Your Meſſiah is a <hi>prieſt</hi> as well as a prophet. "The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent: thou art a prieſt forever after the order of Melchizedek."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. cx. 4.</note> He is the great, the everlaſting High Prieſt of Iſrael. Does every high prieſt offer a ſacrifice? What doth he ſay? "Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire; burnt-offering, and ſin-offering haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. xi. 6-8.</note> And he offered not the blood of bulls and goats, but his own blood. "Thou haſt made his ſoul," ſaith Iſaiah, "a ſacrifice for ſin:" and by that one offering he hath forever perfected them that believe. And now, "The Lord is gone up with a ſhout"—he is entered into the Holy of Holies—the heaven of heavens, where he now appears "making interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. liii. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Our Jeſus of Nazareth is alſo a <hi>king.</hi> "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! ſhout, O daughter of Jeruſalem! behold, thy <hi>King</hi> cometh unto thee: he is juſt, and having ſalvation; lowly, and riding upon an aſs, and upon a colt the foal of an aſs."<note n="§" place="bottom">Zech. ix. 9.</note> You expect your king to appear like a conquering Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, ſurrounded with great wordly ſplendor: but hear, O ye
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030279_0025_0FE59DEA53F4A868"/>Jews! he was to come "lowly, and riding on an aſs."<note n="*" place="bottom">Zech. ix. 9.</note> And did he not accompliſh this Scripture, when he rode to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, alternately, on an aſs and an aſs's colt? while attending thouſands, with joyful acclamations, cried, "Hoſanna to the Son of David! bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!" But it was not a great while after, that theſe very men, many of them, however, exclaimed, with the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable malice, "Crucify him! crucify him!" What! cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify your King? Yes, O Jews! and you, of the preſent gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, reject that very King. Be aſſured, notwithſtanding, that "God has ſet him upon his holy hill of Sion," and ſolemnly ſaid, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Aſk of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. ii. 6—8.</note>—"Thou ſhalt have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſ. lxxii. 8.</note>—"Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool."<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſ. cx. 1.</note>—"Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; the ſceptre of thy kingdom is a right ſceptre. Thou loveſt righteouſneſs, and hateſt wickedneſs; therefore God, thy God hath <hi>anointed thee</hi> with the oil of gladneſs above thy fellows."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſ. xlv. 6, 7.</note> If this laſt paſſage be not explained with reference to one who is both God and man, it never can be explained at all. Such a perſon is Jeſus of Nazareth, the Son of God, and King of Iſrael, who was to reign in righteouſneſs, and rule in judgment.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxii. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is one thing I might have mentioned before, but will not omit it in this place. The Scriptures not only predict the death of Chriſt, but his reſurrection alſo. Jonah's deliverance from the whale's belly was an emblem of this; and the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, in the perſon of the Meſſiah, ſays, "Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell," the place of the dead, "neither wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>thine Holy One</hi> to ſee corruption."<note n="**" place="bottom">Pſ. xvi. 10.</note> And, as though he were addreſſing him, "Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led captivity captive; thou haſt received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them."<note n="††" place="bottom">Pſ. lxviii. 18.</note> But who is aſcended? Why, "God hath gone up with a ſhout, and our Lord with the ſound of a trumpet." But
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030279_0026_0FE59DF24D3C6998"/>before he aſcends, he muſt deſcend; and you all very well know that God, as a Spirit, who fills every place, cannot be ſaid to aſcend or deſcend: it is, without doubt, therefore, the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate God who is here ſpoken of; the man who groaned on Calvary—roſe from the dead the third day, and, by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofs, manifeſted himſelf to be the riſen Saviour; and then, after forty days, in the preſence of a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</p>
            <p>But all this, O Jews! you ſtumble at. But though a "ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. viii. 14.</note> he is, nevertheleſs, the foundation, the tried ſtone, the precious corner-ſtone, which God hath laid in Sion;<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xxviii. 16.</note> nor is there ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other. Dear Jews! are you not convinced? Behold the rocks, the elements, are your inſtructors! for, at the death of Jeſus, the earth trembled—the rocks were rent—the graves were opened—many ſhrouded bodies aroſe from their ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres—the ſun withheld its wonted light, and a tenfold dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enveloped the face of day. Dionyſius, a heathen philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, beholding this dreadful fight, and knowing it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common courſe of nature, for an eclipſe of the ſun to happen at the time of the full moon, is reported to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Either the frame of nature is diſſolving, or the God of nature ſuffers." And when I tell you that this man was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a convert to Chriſtianity, it may, perhaps, give energy to the language he then uttered. Now, if the things I have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning Jeſus of Nazareth be not true, why did not ſome writers of that day, inſtead of ſtrengthening their evidence, as ſome of them have done, contradict them at the time they were firſt propagated? Joſephus, your own hiſtorian, ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying what I have been preaching, ſeems to be half a convert. Hear what he ſays upon this point. "About this time there was one Jeſus a <hi>wiſe man,</hi> if a <hi>man</hi> he may be called, who was a great worker of miracles, and a teacher of thoſe that were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and deſirous to learn the truth; and he had a <hi>great many</hi> followers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This was the Chriſt that was accuſed by the princes and great men of our nation. Pilate delivered him up to the croſs; and all this notwithſtanding, thoſe that loved him at firſt did not forſake him. He was ſeen
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030279_0027_0FE59DF3DFCEE608"/>alive again the third day after his crucifixion, as had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, with a thouſand other things, by ſeveral prophets, and there are a ſort of people who, to this day, bear the name of Chriſtians, as owning him for their head."<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſephus, book 18. ch. iii.</note> Who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch evidence? Can you, O ye Jews! No; I am firmly perſuaded that many, I had almoſt ſaid every one of you, are fully convinced that the Meſſiah is come, and that Jeſus of Nazareth is that Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the third thing propoſed, the bleſſings promiſed to be derived from him. "In thy ſeed ſhall all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth be bleſſed." I hope you will excuſe my brevity on this head, as I have preached till I have nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all my ſtrength. There is a ſweet promiſe for you, my dear Jews, in the book of Iſaiah,<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xi. 10</note> where the prophet ſpeaks of the Root of Jeſſe, which you know is the Meſſiah, as "ſtanding for an enſign of the people, and ſays, to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his reſt ſhall be glorious; and in that day the Lord ſhall ſet his hand again the ſecond time to gather you from the nations where you are diſperſed." You ſay you are not reſtored from your former captivity; but that is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. God had fixed a time to deliver you, and he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his word. He never was wont to puniſh even for the ſin of idolatry, but to the third or fourth generation. What then hath Iſrael done, that he ſhould caſt them off ſo long? O Jews! you have rejected the Meſſiah—that is the reaſon; and to this day you obſtinately reject him. But if you now believe, the curſe ſhall be removed, and you ſhall be bleſſed in him. Pray do not any longer reject him who is the only hope of Iſrael; he waits to be gracious to you, and to bleſs you; but he cannot unleſs you believe in him. It is a truth moſt certain, that the Jews are preſerved a diſtinct people for the purpoſe of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing a variety of promiſes, and that when the fulneſs of the Gentiles is brought in, <hi>all</hi> Iſrael will turn to the Lord Meſſiah; and probably their converſion will be the great means of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the univerſal ſpread of the Goſpel. I am certain, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that "God hath not caſt away his people whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew." It is evident from their preſent condition, which is nothing leſs than a ſtanding miracle, that they are preſerved
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030279_0028_0FE59DF5739041A0"/>for ſome very extraordinary event. Never did any other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſubſiſt, for a ſingle century only, wholly ſeparate from their conquerors: Never did any other people, diſperſed through ſo many nations, continue as with a wall of fire round about them, not for one age merely, but for thouſands of years. Look at a Jew, and you ſee a miracle; his nation is ſtamped on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and it is an honourable nation, Look at a Jew, and you ſee a man tenacious of the traditions of his fathers; but incapable of obeying one of the ordinances of Moſes; without a <hi>temple,</hi> without a <hi>prieſt,</hi> without a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> or a capability of offering to God an acceptable ſervice. Look at a Jew, and you are a witneſs of the accompliſhment of all the threatenings of Moſes and the prophets. Behold a Jew, and you ſee an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of the fulfilment of the Scriptures, and a monument of their veracity; for the time will come, I hope it is near, when all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved. "I will make an end of all nations, but I never will make a full end of thee." And how happy I ſhall be, if God is pleaſed to make my words the beginning of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to but one of Abraham's ſeed! that the Redeemer may come to him from Sion, and turn away ungodlineſs from Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And now, Sirs, what ſay you? Have I ſpoken to you, though in great weakneſs, yet the words of truth? If I have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, may I not ſpeak another word! But if I have diſplayed the truth of God, why, poor ſinners, will ye be ſtill blinded? I am as certain, as that this book of God is given by inſpiration, that many of your nation are convinced that our Jeſus is the promiſed ſeed; for ſome of your teachers have exhorted their friends, when on their dying-beds, to believe in the ſame Meſſiah which Chriſtians acknowledge; and yet theſe men, in public, will deny that he is the Meſſiah. What does all this prove, but that they ſtubbornly reſiſt the light, and ſtifle the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their conſcience? I am perſuaded that many of you are convinced of the truth of what I have been ſaying; but you are attached to your old religion, you are averſe to the idea of changing it, and ſo you reject the counſel of God, and the only Meſſiah. Some of you are learned men. Search the Scriptures. You think you underſtand them better than we Gentiles do; but, aſſure yourſelves, there are many poor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, Gentile Chriſtians, who can better explain the types
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030279_0029_0FE59DF7CBA7D748"/>and ſhadows of your law, than the moſt learned of the Jews. What ſay you to theſe things? If Jeſus be not the Meſſiah, why were the prophecies ſo exactly fulfilled in him? If you will not believe in Jeſus, do not believe your prophets. If you want another Saviour, ſhew us another law. If you reject Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, reject Moſes alſo; for Moſes ſpake of him.</p>
            <p>Jeſus is <hi>my</hi> Saviour; my ſoul relies on him. And though he is the ſtone which is "ſet at nought by you builders, he is, nevertheleſs, the head-ſtone of the corner. Neither is there ſalvation in any other." If you reject him, you reject ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; you are condemned by your own law, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of worſhipping God as that law requires; you have not the benediction pronounced upon you, for none was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to pronounce it but the high prieſt. But in Jeſus all nations ſhall be bleſſed, Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles, among whom you dwell, believe in Jeſus, and are bleſſed in him; and ſhould you aſk, I am ſure they would tell you, that they never knew what true joy and happineſs meant, till they believed in him. But, perhaps, you are aſhamed to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge him. Why ſo? You will not be alone; others have done it before you. There was Xeres the Jew, whoſe book I now hold up; he is a witneſs againſt you. He was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Chriſtian faith in 1710, and has tranſlated many paſſages of your Hebrew Bible, and proved, from your own books, that Jeſus is the true Meſſiah. O may the Spirit of God diſpoſe you to follow his example! And then ſhall you be completely bleſſed in time, and to eternity.</p>
            <p>The God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, look down upon you with complacency, and enlighen your dark underſtandings; and may you become witneſſes with me, that Jeſus of Nazareth is the true Meſſiah!</p>

            <p>A HAND-BILL of Brothers's Prophecies having been juſt given to me by a Jew, I beg for a moment your farther attention.</p>
            <p>MEN OF ISRAEL—Many of you object to the embracing Chriſtianity, becauſe there are amongſt us ſo many ſects and parties. But, let me candidly aſk you, were there not many parties and ſects among yourſelves in ancient days? Were there not Phariſees, Sadducees, Herodians, and many others which I cannot enumerate? A perſon has put into my hand a paper reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prophecies of Brothers; but I give no ſort of credit to the whims of ſuch a madman. I conſider him, nevertheleſs, as a ſtriking proof of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the New Teſtament; which has expreſsly foretold that, "in the latter days, many falſe prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall <hi>deceive many.</hi>" If any thing be predicted, and it comes to paſs, agreeably to the time foretold, you may have ſome reaſon to believe it; but when a man has the confidence to propheſy what is never accompliſhed, you are in duty bound to reject him as an impoſtor. The prophecies of this enthuſiaſt are not fulfilled, nor ever will be. He is, undoubtedly, one of thoſe falſe prophets the Scriptures ſpeak of; and as <hi>he</hi> hath ariſen, be not ſurpriſed if you hear of many more. Their pretenſions do but concur, though without deſign, to evince the authenticity of that Goſpel, which was preached by the apoſtles of Jeſus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p>The Lord God of Abraham bleſs you all.</p>

            <head>PRAYER after Sermon.</head>
            <p>O LORD God of Abraham! do thou be pleaſed to command thy bleſſing. Do thou now unſeal the dark things of prophecy, and give us a ſaving acquaintance with all the truths of thy holy word. None can underſtand them aright, but as thou art pleaſed to teach them. Lord, do thou ſhew to this people that Jeſus of Nazareth is the Meſſiah; ſhew them that he is the King that reigns in Zion, and that he ſhall reign till all his enemies are under his feet. Do thou take the veil from all our hearts, thou dear Lamb of God, who was crucified for our ſins. At thy death the ſun was darkened, the rocks were ſhaken, the graves were opened, and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. O! rend thou the veil from the hearts of thy dear Iſrael now before thee; let them be no longer deluded, but ſave them with an everlaſting ſalvation. O Lord! diſmiſs them and us with thy divine bleſſing, for the alone ſake of Meſſiah, who was cut off for our ſins, who was raiſed from the dead for our juſtification, and who ever liveth to make interceſſion for us. Amen.</p>
            <p>May the peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, come down from heaven into all your hearts! May the Holy Spirit, by his ſacred illuminations, lead you into all truth; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to you the myſterious words of prophecy, and cauſe you to believe in that Saviour whom your fathers crucified! Then may you join with us Gentiles, in aſcribing to him, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, everlaſting praiſes. Amen.</p>
