            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Attempt to ſhew, That <hi>the Ancients</hi> muſt have the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>the Weſtern World,</hi> or <hi>America.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is well known, that, in the Year of our Lord 1492, <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> diſcovered the Iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cuba</hi> and <hi>Jamaica;</hi> and that <hi>Americus Veſputius</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> under the Direction and Encouragement of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the Year 1497, diſcovered the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> which has been ſo called from that Time after his Name.</p>
            <p>Now many have imagined, and even ſome of the Learned among them, that this <hi>Weſtern World</hi> was never known before theſe Diſcoveries of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> Commanders.—Thus the learned <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciroll</hi> in particular ſees fit to reckon the <hi>New World,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> among the Things, which were <hi>unknown to</hi> the Ancients. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Parcirollus, De Novo Orbe. Lib. 2. Tit. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Americus Veſputius</hi> too, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Renatus,</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barre,</hi> writes, as follows, <hi>We believe, that, as our Anceſtors make no mention of the Iſlands and firm Lands of</hi> America; <hi>ſo the</hi> Ancients themſelves <hi>had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them.</hi>—And the Publiſher of this Epiſtle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Number of Tracts wrote by ancient
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012861_0005_0F8B94423AC618C8"/>
Voyagers, <hi>Sebaſtian Munſter,</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> and <hi>Albericus</hi> [for ſo he writes it] <hi>Veſputius</hi> were the firſt of Mortals, who found out <hi>America,</hi> and other unknown Lands.</p>
            <p>However, the learned <hi>Keckerman,</hi> having well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether <hi>America</hi> was known to the Ancients or no, and weighed the moſt probable Arguments on both Sides of this Queſtion, has plainly given his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Favour of <hi>it's being known to</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But, if this Matter be examined with Judgment, and with proper Care and Accuracy, we ſhall find Reaſon to believe, that this <hi>large Part of the World was really known to</hi> the Ancients; and perhaps we ſhall ſee much more Reaſon to believe it, than moſt Men imagine, and even many of the Learned themſelves can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in oppoſition to it.</p>
            <p>We ſhall take Leave to relate here; though we ſhall not lay any great Streſs on the Relation, as it may be called a too modern one; That, in the Reign of <hi>Henry the Second,</hi> and in the Year 1170, which was 300 Years before <hi>Columbus,</hi> One <hi>Madoc ap Owen Gwineth,</hi> not only diſcovered <hi>South America,</hi> but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in ſome Part of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and left Monuments <hi>there</hi> both of <hi>the Britiſh Language and Britiſh Uſages:</hi> Of which <hi>the Spaniards</hi> have taken Notice; and ſeveral <hi>Welſh</hi> Writers, and other <hi>Britiſh</hi> Authors beſides, have credited and confirmed the Relation.—How this honeſt <hi>Madoc</hi> came to take it into his Head to viſit <hi>South America,</hi> we know not. However we think it not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to ſuppoſe, that, previouſly to his going <hi>there,</hi> he might have had ſome Account of the Country, and the Way of getting at it.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another ſtill more modern Account, than that of honeſt <hi>Madoc</hi>'s, concerning the Diſcovery of <hi>America;</hi> which, although it be a little more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012861_0006_0F8B944360411098"/>
it may not be amiſs to offer. This may be found in <hi>Ortelius</hi>'s <hi>Theatre,</hi> as follows: <hi>The Northem Part of</hi> the New World, <hi>which is eſpecially extended towards</hi> Europe, Groenland, Iſeland and Frieſland; <hi>and is named</hi> Eſtotiland <hi>by ſome Fiſhermen of the Iſland of</hi> Frieſland, <hi>who were driven by a Tempeſt to theſe Shores: This,</hi> being of old viewed and obſerved, <hi>about this Year, that is the Year of our LORD</hi> 1340, Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olas and Antony Zenus, <hi>Brethren, noble</hi> Venetians, <hi>under the Auſpices of</hi> Zichmi, <hi>called King of</hi> Frieſland, <hi>again recognized and brought to Knowledge.</hi> And <hi>John Skoluo,</hi> a Polonian, in 1456, ſailed to this Country. If any ſhould aſk, what Place this <hi>Eſtotiland</hi> is? I can only anſwer, that ſome Geographers take it to be <hi>New-foundland,</hi> or <hi>Cape Breton:</hi> But others think it to be <hi>New Britain,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Labrador.</hi> However it is agreed by all, that it was a Part of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, inſtead of taking up Time about theſe or any more modern Relations, we ſhall go back to <hi>more ancient Times and Things,</hi> which have Relation to <hi>this Weſtern World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarked by a learned Spaniſh Writer, <hi>Villal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandus,</hi> that his Fellow-Citizen of <hi>Corduba, L. Annaeus Seneca,</hi> who was Nephew to that famous <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Tutor of the Brute <hi>Nero; when the Form of the World did not yet appear to be known, yet foretold, that another World ſhould be found out:</hi>

But although <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Townſman hence affirms, that he <hi>foretold another World ſhould be found out;</hi> we need not be ſo unreaſonably credulous as to believe, that, when he wrote in this Manner, he was <hi>inſpired with the Spirit of Prophecy:</hi> No! For nothing of this Sort appears. It is much more likely, that, either from ſome faint Apprehenſion of the Structure of the <hi>Terraqueous Globe,</hi> or from ſome <hi>traditional Accounts of the Greatneſs of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>of another World</hi> beſides their old one, he might write after this <hi>ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Prophetical</hi> Manner.—But, if any think, that what he has thus written ſhould be taken only for <hi>Poetical Fiction,</hi> or fanciful Prophecy, we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: For we do not build much upon it.</p>
            <p>But there is an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Paſſage handed to us by <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> who lived in the Emperour <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>'s Time, about the Year of our Lord 93; which, as it is remarkable, is deſerving both of a particular Recital and an attentive Conſideration: It is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;—When <hi>Metellus Celer,</hi> who by the Way was called <hi>Celer</hi> for his Quickneſs in preparing to celebrate the <hi>Funeral Obſequies</hi> of his Father, was <hi>Proconſul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>the Gauls,</hi> he received as a Preſent <hi>certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>

            <p>Now, from this Hiſtorical Account, it ſeems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>theſe Indians</hi> might be carried away from the Coaſt of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> or <hi>Labrador,</hi> or ſome other Place to the Northward, by a violent Gale of Wind of long Continuance with them, until at length they

arrived on <hi>the German Coaſt,</hi> and got a Shore there.— And the coming of theſe Indians might very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and ſatisfie both the King of <hi>the Suevians</hi> with his People; and the <hi>Roman Proconſul,</hi> and from him the <hi>whole Roman Empire,</hi> that there was <hi>another World,</hi> beſides <hi>That</hi> inhabited by themſelves.</p>
            <p>There was alſo in moſt ancient Times repeated Mention made of two Iſlands called <hi>Atlantides,</hi> which were ſaid to have been about 10,000 Stadia diſtant from <hi>Libya: There</hi> were <hi>the Elyſian Fields and the Dwellings of the Bleſſed,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Homer, Horace,</hi> and other Poets.

N. B. Theſe Things ſeem to be related with Hiſtorical Truth.—And he writes further plainly and expreſly, that <hi>That Atlantic Iſland, being in Truth overwhelmed with the Waves of the Sea, altogether diſappeared:</hi> And <hi>hence that Sea is difficult to be paſſed; inaſmuch as copious Clay yet remained from the Reliques of</hi> that Iſland.—Moreover, he ſays, that—<hi>an Iſland, in the Mouth of the Sea, and in the Paſſage to thoſe Straits called the Pillars of</hi> Hercules, <hi>did exiſt; and that Iſland was greater and larger than</hi> Lybia and Aſia; <hi>from which there was an eaſy Paſſage over to other Iſlands; and from thoſe Iſlands alſo to</hi> that Continent, <hi>which is ſituated out of that Region,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Plato</hi> is not ſingular in this Narration: For both <hi>Strabo</hi>

            <p>But as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, that this <hi>greateſt Iſland of the Weſtern Ocean</hi> was loſt; it is probably conjectured, that it was ſituated between the <hi>Azores and Canaries,</hi>

appears to have been of the ſame Mind. And indeed, if this Iſland was larger than <hi>Libya and Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> has acquainted us, it looks as if it were really <hi>America,</hi> or reaching ſo far as to be cloſely connected with it.</p>
            <p>There ſeems alſo Reaſon to think, that there muſt have been in ancient Times ſome Knowlege of the <hi>American</hi> Regions: Becauſe we have credible Accounts of the Paſſages of Veſſels through <hi>the Atlantis Ocean</hi> both one Way and the other:—We ſhall not inſiſt on <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi>'s Account of one <hi>Endoxus;</hi> who ſays, <hi>in the Days of our Grandfathers,</hi> [and, as we noted before, he lived in the Time of the Emperor <hi>Claudius] when he fled from the King of Alexandria, Latyrus, he went forth from the</hi> Arabic Gulph <hi>thro' this Sea,</hi> as <hi>Nepos</hi> affirms, <hi>Gades uſque pervectus eſt,</hi> and was carried even to <hi>Cales.</hi>

            <p>But we ought to take ſome reſpectful Notice of <hi>Hanno,</hi> the famous <hi>Cathaginian,</hi> who wrote <hi>Periplum;</hi> in which we have a Relation of the Voyage proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him around the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Lands found by him in the <hi>Atlantic Ocean:</hi> This Relation was written by him in the <hi>Punic,</hi> or <hi>Phoenician,</hi> Tongue: But it was afterwards tranſlated into <hi>Greek,</hi> and it is ſtill extant, as <hi>Hoffman</hi> gives us to underſtand in his

            <p>We have thus produced <hi>Authorities,</hi> and offered <hi>Reaſons</hi> ſufficient to render it moſt highly probable, that <hi>this Weſtern World must be known to</hi> the Ancients.</p>
            <p>But here it may be demanded, if this Continent was known in ancient Times, was it inhabited in thoſe Times; and <hi>when was it firſt inhabited, and by whom?</hi> And we ſhall endeavour to give ſome ſuitable Anſwer to the proper Enquiries.</p>
            <p>Now it ought in all Reaſon to be thought, that, as <hi>America,</hi> upon the more modern Diſcoveries of it and Acquaintance with it, was found to be well peopled, and even ſtocked with Inhabitants, probably as much as <hi>Aſia, Africa and Europe;</hi> ſurely it muſt have been inhabited, not merely above <hi>five hundred</hi> years; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>one, two, three and even four thouſand years ago:</hi> And indeed it was probably inhabited not long after <hi>the Diſperſion of thoſe numerous Families,</hi> who were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in Conſequence of the unhappy Affair at Babel.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Grotius</hi> conceived, that <hi>the Americans</hi> came out of <hi>Europe,</hi> paſſing from <hi>Norway</hi> into <hi>Iceland;</hi> thence by <hi>Frieſland</hi> into <hi>Greenland;</hi> and ſo into <hi>Esto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiland,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012861_0013_0F8B944DB7D7F1B8"/>
which is probably a Part of the <hi>Western Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>

                  <hi>Grotius</hi> De Origine Gent.

            <p>But we are rather moſt inclined to think, that <hi>the primary Americans</hi> were the Deſcendants of <hi>Magog</hi> from <hi>Japhet.</hi> And, when we ſay <hi>the primary Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> we mean <hi>after the Flood:</hi> For there is Reaſon to believe, that the People, who reſided in the <hi>Weſtern World,</hi> as well as the other Continent, were ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Face of the Earth; becauſe <hi>all Fleſh had corrupted their Way.</hi> Both <hi>Joſeph Acosta</hi> and <hi>Antony Herrera</hi> acquaint us, that they found <hi>the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Flood</hi> preſerved among the Indians of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Mechoachan</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua:</hi> And <hi>Coraca</hi> tells us, that, among <hi>the Peruvians,</hi> there was a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>all their Lands were plunged and laid hid in the Waters.</hi>—And if we miſtake not, all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences <hi>in the natural World,</hi> which are commonly brought on the other Side of the Water to prove the <hi>general Inundation</hi> over that Continent, may be fairly produced to prove the general Prevalence of it over this Continent.</p>
            <p>But, as we are now treating of the <hi>primary Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of America</hi> after the Flood; ſo we ſay, that <hi>Theſe</hi> appear to have deſcended from <hi>Japhet.</hi> As GOD, or ELONIM, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, i. e. the <hi>Covenanting Ones,</hi> or <hi>the Interpoſers by Oath,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to enlarge Japhet;</hi> in which Promiſe there is a plain Alluſion to his Name, as indeed there is a like Alluſion to <hi>Names</hi> very frequently to be found in the Holy Scriptures; ſo this Promiſe was moſt remarkably fulfilled: For there fell to <hi>Japhet</hi>'s Share, not only all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo full of People, and <hi>Aſia the leſs</hi> and <hi>Media</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012861_0014_0F8B944E38B40590"/>
and Part of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Iberia</hi> and <hi>Albania;</hi> but alſo all thoſe <hi>vaſt Northern Regions,</hi> inhabited once by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who deſcended from <hi>Magog,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Japhet,</hi> as he is ſaid to be in Gen. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 2. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <hi>this Western World,</hi> and that to a conſiderable Degree, came to his Share: For it is moſt likely, that <hi>This</hi> was at firſt much peopled by the <hi>Scythians: Theſe,</hi> originally from <hi>Magog,</hi> were afterwards called <hi>Tartars;</hi> and ſo called, as ſome ſuppoſe, from the Name of the River <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Tatar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As We find that <hi>the Earth was divided in the Days of</hi> Peleg; ſo we read, in Gen. ix. 19, that as there were <hi>three Sons of</hi> Noah; ſo <hi>of</hi> or <hi>from them the whole Earth was overſpread or ſcattered.</hi> Nor is there any Reaſon to doubt, but that this Scattering was according to the direction of <hi>Noah,</hi> and from a Divine Warrant given him for this purpoſe: So then the Poſterity of <hi>Japhet,</hi> by <hi>Magog,</hi> according to the Will of Heaven, took the primary Poſſeſſion of this <hi>new World:</hi> And <hi>how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> how amazingly, was <hi>Japhet enlarged</hi> by this vaſt Acquiſition?</p>
            <p>But, after <hi>this firſt diſperſion</hi> to the <hi>Weſtern World,</hi> we readily grant, that there might be <hi>various Removals</hi> to it from various Nations: For after the <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Tartars,</hi> were ſettled here; the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> might come; and ſo might ſome of the <hi>Sinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> from the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps may ſay here, <hi>And how came they to this ſeparate World?</hi> To which we anſwer, that there was no need at all of <hi>any Navigation</hi> for it: For it is apprehended by many, that the <hi>northern Part of</hi> Aſia <hi>may be joined to</hi> America; or if they be divided at all, it muſt be by a very narrow Channel, which may be paſſed over eaſily in Boats or Canoes; or perhaps, as it is frozen over for a great Part of the Year, they might have a Paſſage acroſs on Foot. <hi>Laet</hi> judged it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012861_0015_0F8B945243F559F8"/>
moſt probable, that it was by the <hi>Straits of</hi> Anian, that <hi>the Tartars</hi> in ancient Times paſſed out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>America.</hi> But it is beyond all doubt, that, from the <hi>northern Parts of</hi> Europe, there might be an eaſy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to America for at leaſt three Quarters of a Year on a Bridge of ſubſtantial Ice.</p>
            <p>Thus it looks as if the <hi>Northern Parts</hi> of America were <hi>first</hi> of all occupied and improved; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Theſe</hi> might probably remove both to the <hi>Westward</hi> and to the <hi>Southward,</hi> as Occaſion required.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Some have thought and ſuggeſted, but we think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly, as <hi>John Lerius</hi> and others, that the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> were originally <hi>Canaanites,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Ham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> and the Deſcendants of thoſe, whom <hi>Joſhua</hi> drove from their Seats in <hi>Canaan;</hi> who, being conſtrained to ſeek out new Regions, at length came and ſat down on this Continent.</p>
            <p>Here we ſhall readily allow, that the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who were originally <hi>Canaanites,</hi> in the Days not much later than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, did ſail into <hi>Spain:</hi> And as Part of theſe diſpoſſeſſed <hi>Canaanites</hi> fled thither, ſo a Part of them went into <hi>Baeotia,</hi> and another Part into <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica:</hi> And <hi>Procopius</hi> informs us of the Pillar to be ſeen about <hi>Tangier,</hi> which had inſcribed on it, that they were <hi>of the Poſterity of thoſe, who fled from the Face of</hi> Joſhua the Son of Nun, <hi>the Robber.</hi> And it is not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012861_0017_0F8B945377431458"/>
at all improbable, that, as theſe <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> might mingle with <hi>Japhet</hi>'s Poſterity in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo ſome of them might in Proceſs of Time come to <hi>America</hi> by the Way of the Sea and ſettle here: For they were mightily for <hi>Navigation and Trade and Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome may aſk; <hi>Where learned They the Art of Navigation?</hi> And how came they to underſtand <hi>the Uſe and Application of the Magnet?—Panormitan</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would have it, that <hi>Amalphis</hi> firſt diſcovered the <hi>Uſe of the Loadſtone</hi> to Mariners: And there is a Latin Line made to record the Diſcoverer, <hi>Prima dedit Nautis uſum Magnetis</hi> Amalphis:—By which we are to underſtand an <hi>Italian City,</hi> where one <hi>John Goa,</hi> it is ſaid, found out the Uſe of <hi>the Mariner's Compaſs,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year of our Lord 1302.—But the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were generally thought to be <hi>the Inventers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner's Art;</hi> and, from <hi>Theſe,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> received it; and, of <hi>theſe,</hi> the <hi>Cretans</hi> firſt of all, as <hi>Pliny</hi> acquaints us. But as the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> firſt tried the Seas among the Nations at Hand, and then afar off; ſo <hi>Thucydides</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were the firſt among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who performed Voyages:—</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Primique per aequora vecti</l>
               <l>Luſtravere Salum; primum docuere, Carinis</l>
               <l>Ferre cavis, orbis Commercia.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Voyage of <hi>Hanno,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> round the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> has already been mention'd: And ſurely <hi>This</hi> muſt diſcover <hi>no ſmall Skill</hi> in Navigation. Nor have we any Doubt, that many of <hi>the Phoenicians</hi> were well ſkilled in <hi>the Mariner's Art:</hi> Nor yet is it any unreaſonable Suppoſition, that they might ſail to <hi>America,</hi> and make Settlements here.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears with ſufficient Probability, that <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> not very long after the Flood was ſettled; and that, after the firſt Settlement of it, there were ſucceſſive
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012861_0018_0F8B9454550F9230"/>
Removals to it, eſpecially from the <hi>Northern Parts of Europe and Aſia:</hi> And then, after ſome Ages had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> might arrive and trade and ſettle here. And, by theſe various Ways, <hi>America</hi> became very well ſettled; and vaſt Numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were found in this <hi>Weſtern World,</hi> when <hi>Columbus, Americus and</hi> ſucceeding Voyagers came to it: And perhaps the Inhabitants here might, for their Numbers, vie with thoſe of the other Continent.</p>
            <p>But ſome may be ready to enquire, <hi>Whether we have any Proofs from the</hi> ſacred Writings, <hi>that this Weſtern World was known to</hi> the Ancients? And <hi>what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences can be offered from them,</hi> to ſhew that it was ſo?</p>
            <p>Now we do not preſume to declare, that there is <hi>a clear, full and expreſs Diſcovery of this Weſtern Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> in the holy Writings.—But we may ſafely venture to affirm, that there are various Paſſages to be found in them, from which attentive and conſiderate Minds might form a Judgment, that <hi>there were Regions and great ones</hi> beyond thoſe, that were known to them in <hi>Aſia, Africa and Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to mention again the ancient Prophecy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Enlargement of</hi> Japhet; nor to recite the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in his Seed,</hi> the Meſſiah, <hi>all the Nations of the Earth,</hi> and hence the moſt remote Poſterity of <hi>Magog, ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> nor the poſitive and peremptory Engagement to the Meſſiah Himſelf, in Pſal. xi. 8. that <hi>the uttermoſt Parts;</hi> or, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, the Ends of the Earth, ſhould be his Poſſeſſion;</hi>—It is abſolutely promiſed to the Meſſiah, that, after his Humiliation, as in Pſal. xxii. 27, <hi>All the Ends of the World ſhall remember and turn to the Lord! and all the Kindreds of the Nations ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before Thee;</hi> or, as we may give the Verſe more exactly according to the <hi>Hebrew, All the Ends of the Earth ſhall remember and be converted to</hi> Jehovah;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012861_0019_0F8B945690910EF0"/>
               <hi>and all the Families of the Nations ſhall incline,</hi> or bow down, <hi>themſelves to</hi> thy Face, i. e. <hi>to the Meſſiah,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Face of Jehovah.—Should any one here ſuggeſt, that <hi>This</hi> may mean, that not only the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but <hi>the Nations</hi> around them, <hi>ſhould believe and turn to the Lord and worſhip Him</hi> in and by the Meſſiah: We reply, that, although <hi>This</hi> may be Part of the Prophetical Meaning; yet the Senſe of the Prophecy ſeems to be much more extenſive:—<hi>All the Ends of the World and all the Families of the Nations:</hi>—Theſe Expreſſions muſt certainly ſignifie the human Race wherever diſperſed, and even to <hi>the remoteſt Parts of the Terraqueous Globe:</hi> And, to <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſenſible and devout Minds might well ſtretched; when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was read by them with religious Care, Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſideration.—And it is engaged, in Pſalm lxvii. 2.5.7. <hi>To know thy Way in the Earth and thy Salvation, or</hi> thy Jeſus, <hi>in all Nations;</hi> i. e. not only known, but unknown.—<hi>Let the People,</hi> or the People ſhall, <hi>confeſs to Thee,</hi> Elohim; <hi>to Thee let,</hi> or ſhall, <hi>all the People themſelves confeſs — And all the Ends of the Earth ſhall fear Him</hi> —Surely neither <hi>the utmoſt Extent of Judea,</hi> nor <hi>the Extremities of the three</hi> great Diviſions of the old World, <hi>and the People</hi> thereon will comprehend in them <hi>all the People</hi> of the World, <hi>and all the Ends of the Earth.</hi>—It is foretold, as if it were already accompliſhed, in Pſalm xcviii. 3. <hi>All the Ends of the Earth have ſeen the Salvation,</hi> or thy Jeſus, <hi>our Elobi.</hi>—So it is predicted, in Pſalm cxiii. 3. <hi>From the Riſing of the Sun to the</hi> going down <hi>of the ſame the LORD's Name is to be praiſed.</hi>—Again, there is a Prophetical Call, in Iſa. xlii. 10. <hi>To ſing a new Song to</hi> Jehovah; <hi>his Praiſe from the Extremity of the Earth; ye, that go down to</hi> to the Sea and all that is therein; the Iſles and the Inhabitants thereof:—And it is the Call or Prophecy, in Iſa. xlv. 22. <hi>Look ye to me, and be ſaved,</hi> all the Ends of the Earth, &amp;c.—So it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, at the <hi>forſaking and puniſhing</hi> the Jews for their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012861_0020_0F8B94573B4E8690"/>
Iniquities, in Iſa. lix. 19. <hi>They ſhall fear</hi> from the Weſt <hi>the Name Jehovah, and</hi> from the Eaſt of the Sun <hi>his Glory:</hi>—Which is a Prophecy, that not only from <hi>the extremeſt Part of the Eaſt,</hi> but <hi>from the Weſtern World,</hi> Jehovah, or the Meſſiah, ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged and glorified in a religious Manner.—But, that we may not be too tedious; we ſhall only add further the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi;</hi> in which, after <hi>the GOD of Iſrael</hi> had ſhewed his Diſlike of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for their irreligious and profane Conduct, and his Purpoſe to caſt them off for another and larger Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; He ſays, as in Malach. i. 11. <hi>For, from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun even to his ſetting, great ſhall be my Name among the Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Could any of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>jewiſh Proſelytes,</hi> who lived, or converſed for a Seaſon, on the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Borders of <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>ſaw the ſetting Sun,</hi> help imagining, from this Prophecy, that there were <hi>at the ſetting Sun, Nations</hi> to be brought to right Worſhip and Religion; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that lived vaſtly beyond the old World, of which they were the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole; If theſe Paſſages, as well as many others amounting to the ſame Purpoſe, be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will in ſome Meaſure appear, that the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, People and Families of this Weſtern World</hi> are concerned in them.—But, if any think otherwiſe, it ſhall be owned as a Favour, if they will tell us, <hi>in what more full and expreſſive Words the Spirit of Prophecy could well diſcover</hi> the divine Intention and Purpoſe, <hi>that theſe Weſtern Regions of the Earth,</hi> as well as the other Parts of the World, <hi>ſhould be brought to the Knowlege, Worſhip and Service</hi> of the true GOD, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting Himſelf in and by the Meſſiah.—And we have no Doubt, that the more penetrating and judicious, if not among <hi>the Jews,</hi> who were of more narrow and contracted Minds, yet among the <hi>jewiſh Proſelytes,</hi> underſtood the Meaning of theſe Prophecies to <hi>reach
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012861_0021_0F8B945B7A2642D0"/>
beyond the old World,</hi> which they inhabited, <hi>to the World then not generally known,</hi> and the Nations and People inhabiting the ſame.</p>
            <p>But at length the <hi>great Light of the World came to viſit it; to give Light to them, that ſit <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>It is very difficult for us, at this Time, to ſhew <hi>the Progreſs of the Apoſtles.</hi> But there is Reaſon to think, that, according to the Mind and Will of their Lord made known to them, they agreed among themſelves, <hi>to which Parts of the Earth each of them ſhould go;</hi> and how they ſhould each of then, <hi>employ themſelves within the Line,</hi> that was laid out for them.</p>
            <p>Some have told us, that <hi>Philip</hi> went away to the <hi>upper Aſia,</hi> and even to <hi>Scythia:</hi> And <hi>Nicephores</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that the Apoſtle <hi>Andrew</hi> is believed by ſome to have been ſent to <hi>Coppadocia, Galatia, Bithynia, and the Weſtern Parts.</hi> 
               <note n="(u)" place="bottom">Nicephor. Hiſt. Lib. 8. Cap. 6.</note> But we place but very little Dependance on any ſuch Accounts as theſe:—Although we a low, that there are ſome Evidences, that <hi>Thomas</hi> carried the Goſpel to <hi>Eastern-India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the ancient Fathers appear to be full and ſtrong in Favour of it, that <hi>the Goſpel was carried throughout the World</hi> by the Apoſtles of our bleſſed

               </hi> ſhews us his Opinion, that <hi>the Doctrine of Salvation was by the divine Power and Co-operation carried into all the World. Julius Firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Maturnus, who lived above</hi> 1400 <hi>Years ago,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, had <hi>there was no Nation under Heaven,</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, North or South, <hi>unto whom the Sun of the Goſpel had not ſhined.</hi> And <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> ſays, that the Goſpel <hi>had been ſpread not only in the whole Continent, but in every Iſland alſo.</hi> And, in later Times, ſeveral Writers have aſſerted to the ſame Purpoſe. Thus <hi>Oſiander,</hi> writing of <hi>Vilagagno,</hi> and his planting at <hi>Braſil,</hi> writes poſitively and confidently, <hi>without Doubt theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple received the Goſpel of CHRIST by the Preaching of the Apostles</hi> 1500 <hi>Years ſince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, when we have better Proofs than merely human ones, it muſt certainly be fit and right to give <hi>Theſe</hi> the Preference.</p>
            <p>Now the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> informs us, in Chap. xvi. 20. that <hi>They,</hi> the Apoſtles, <hi>went forth and preached</hi> every where, <hi>the LORD working with</hi> them, &amp;c. i. e. They went, and performed, according to the Divine Direction. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, in Coloſ. i. 23. <hi>The Goſpel ye have heard, which was preached to</hi> every Creature, which is under Heaven, &amp;c. And as He lets us know, in Rom. i. 8. that <hi>the Faith of the</hi> Romans <hi>was publiſhed in</hi> all the World; ſo He tells <hi>the Coloſſians</hi> moſt plainly and expreſly, as in Col. i. 6. that <hi>the Word of Truth, the Goſpel, was come not only to them, but</hi> in all the World, <hi>and bringeth forth Fruit,</hi> &amp;c. And our Apoſtle tells us, in Rom. x. 18. that, according to the ancient Prophecy of them, i. e. the Apoſtles, <hi>their Sound went into</hi> all the Earth, <hi>and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012861_0023_0F8B945C7ABEB240"/>
their Words to</hi> the Ends of the World. And indeed, if one Apoſtle <hi>from</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and round about even to</hi> Illyricum, <hi>fully preached the Goſpel of CHRIST,</hi> or <hi>filled up the Goſpel of CHRIST;</hi> ſo that all the Places between <hi>Jeruſalem and Illyricum,</hi> and round about them, were <hi>fully goſpelized by Him,</hi> as in Rom. xv. 19; we may reaſonably think, that <hi>the rest of the Apoſtles</hi> with the <hi>Seventy Diſciples, being alike induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and faithful</hi> in the Work of the Lord, muſt <hi>fully preach the Goſpel</hi> even throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p>But, if we think further with <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that, beſides the <hi>Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Diſciples; there were more Apostles and Diſciples:</hi> Which he gathers from that Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 Corinth. xv. 6. <hi>After that, he was ſeen of</hi> above five hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Brethren <hi>at once; of whom</hi> the greater Part <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unto this preſent; but ſome are fallen aſleep:</hi> 
               <note n="(w)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Eccleſ. Hiſt. Lib. 1. Cap. 13.</note>
Then there muſt be above <hi>two hundred and fifty Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> beſides the <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> and <hi>the Seventy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> who had <hi>ſeen CHRIST,</hi> and could atteſt to the <hi>Truth and Certainty of his Reſurrection,</hi> and ſo to the Divinity of his Religion: And a conſiderable Number of <hi>theſe</hi> might come to our <hi>Western World.</hi> And ſo <hi>America</hi> muſt have been filled up with the Goſpel, according to our Apoſtle's Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Some indeed have inſiſted on it, that the Paſſages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Goſpel's coming in all the World, and going into all the Earth,</hi> and the like, only intend and mean the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> But if they will wreſt <hi>theſe Paſſages</hi> to this Senſe; it ſeems hard to force that Paſſage in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> above-cited, to that Meaning that <hi>the Goſpel was preached to every Creature,</hi> that is, to every Man <hi>under Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not now therefore concern ourſelves ſo much <hi>Who were the bringers of the Goſpel to this</hi> American
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012861_0024_0F8B945DAB49E4D8"/>
World: But we think, that there is Reaſon to affirm from Divine Authority, that it <hi>was brought here by</hi> one or more of the Apoſtles and Diſciples and many Brethren, <hi>and produced Fruit.</hi> And therefore this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent muſt be certainly known to theſe <hi>first Preachers of the Goſpel</hi> in it: And from them, without Doubt the Faith of the <hi>Americans</hi> was publiſhed in all the other World.</p>
            <p>There is then, alas! too much Reaſon to believe, that this <hi>Western World</hi> ſinned away the Goſpel: And why ſhould this be thought ſtrange and incredible with us; when <hi>Africa,</hi> which for ſeveral Hundreds of Years after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Time, was enlightned with the Goſpel and filled with Chriſtian Societies, is now involved gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally in Mahometan Glooms or Pagan Darkneſſes.</p>
            <p>But however we have good Grounds for hoping, that <hi>the Goſpel and Religion of Jeſus</hi> will recover their loſt Poſſeſſion, and gain a more wide and extenſive Spreading, than has yet been known in the later Ages and Generations: For it is foretold by the Spirit of Prophecy, in Habak. ii. 14. which we thus read ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Original Hebrew, The Earth ſhall be filled to know the Glory, JEHOVAH, as the Waters ſhall cover upon the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY grant, that <hi>this whole Continent,</hi> as well as the <hi>Old World,</hi> may find the fulleſt and moſt perfect Accompliſhment of this <hi>good Word, on which He</hi> cauſes the Hearts of his People <hi>to hope</hi> and reſt: And may <hi>all the People</hi> of the World unite in ſaying, AMEN.</p>

            <p>IT may be proper and adviſeable to add a few Things here, by Way of <hi>Appendix,</hi> which could not be ſo properly and conveniently introduced in the foregoing <hi>Eſſay.</hi> And indeed, as <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> without my ſeeking for it, has furniſhed an <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> for mentioning ſome fit and right Things, with regard to theſe <hi>American Colonies, and ſome late Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions</hi> to their Diſadvantage and Wrong; I cannot but think it my Duty to <hi>improve it;</hi> hoping, that none will be troubled or offended with me for ſo doing.

            </p>
            <p>Some have noted, and it is worthy of Obſervation, That <hi>Colonies,</hi> from the Beginning of Things, after the Flood, to this Day, have been almoſt conſtantly led

forth <hi>from the East to the West,</hi> and not in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Direction. And the mentioning of <hi>This</hi> brings to Memory a Remark, that was made by the worthy Mr. <hi>Jeremy White</hi> but a little while before he made his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it out of the World. When he was aſked, <hi>What he thought of theſe</hi> American Regions? After a little Pauſe he aſked the Enquirer, <hi>Whence the wiſe Men came, who repaired to</hi> Judea, <hi>in order to ſhew their Reſpect and pay their Homage to</hi> the glorious King of the World? To which Queſtion it was anſwered by the Gentleman, at whoſe Houſe he then was, <hi>Why, Sir, from the Eaſt:</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>White</hi> remarked, <hi>And let me tell You, Sir, They have been travelling</hi> Weſtward <hi>ever ſince:</hi> And then he went on and gave it as his Judgment, that this Part of the World <hi>ſeemed to him to be reſerved in Providence for the</hi> great Seat of Empire and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Theatre of conſiderable Events before the End of the World.</p>
            <p>In the publiſhed Account, concerning <hi>the Life</hi> of this learned and pious Gentleman, it is related, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he lived to be near 80 Years of Age, <hi>He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurvived his Reaſon, his Chearfulneſs, his Memory, nor his Honour:</hi> And we may fitly add here, that the Remark above-mentioned, made by him towards the Cloſe of his Life, ſhewed not only <hi>the Penetration of his Mind,</hi> but <hi>the Soundneſs of his Judgment alſo:</hi> And, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>Dies—Naturae Judicia confirmat;</hi> which we may render, <hi>Time confirms the Judgments of Nature,</hi> or the Judgments formed from the Obſervation of Nature.</p>
            <p>And now Things are tending apace towards the Completion of Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Sentiments and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and, as we apprehend, to the Fulfilment of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Predictions in <hi>the more ſure Word of Prophecy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Prevalence of the Redeemer's Kingdom <hi>in the West and to the Goings down of the Sun,</hi> and <hi>the filling of the Whole Earth with his Glory.</hi>

to be ſo much <hi>Malevolence and Enmity</hi> manifeſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>natural and constitutional Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>Americans,</hi> as cannot well admit of any juſt Apology, or fair Excuſe.</p>
            <p>We have no Inclination to concern ourſelves ſo far as to treat largely concerning <hi>the Legiſlative Authority of</hi> Great Britain. Let This be called <hi>Supreme</hi> by its Favourers; and let it be magnified in all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards and to the uttermoſt Degree by them, if they pleaſe: But, with their Leave, <hi>it is not extended, nor can it</hi> conſtitutionally <hi>be,</hi> to the Affair of <hi>Taxation,</hi> as all <hi>Britons</hi> know, or might know if they would: For <hi>the Commons</hi> of Great Britain have <hi>the ſole Right of taxing the People,</hi> whom they repreſent: <hi>This Right</hi> was recovered upon the <hi>Revolution:</hi> And, ever ſince that Time, <hi>the Commons</hi> have ſteadily exerciſed it. It is allowed, that, as <hi>Tax Bills</hi> are ſent up to <hi>the Lords and Crown, They accept of them,</hi> juſt as they are brought to them, according to the Formality of Law: For otherwiſe the Monies granted cannot be had, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the public Uſe and Service.—But, after all, <hi>the Taxation itſelf, and the Gift of the Monies,</hi> is by <hi>the Commons,</hi> in the Name and Behalf of the People of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>the Americans,</hi> and <hi>their Commons,</hi> as Judge <hi>Blackſtone</hi> calls our <hi>General Aſſemblies,</hi> cannot ſee, <hi>what Right the</hi> Commons <hi>of</hi> Britain <hi>have to take their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> from them, and apply them to ſuch Uſes as they judge proper. Nay they have over and over again unanſwerably proved, that they <hi>have not the Right to</hi> do ſo: For indeed, if they have it, certainly we poor <hi>Americans</hi> muſt be <hi>deſtitute of the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of</hi> Engliſhmen, to which we are fully entitled: And, if <hi>This</hi> be our Caſe, it muſt be diſreputable and ignominious both <hi>to them and their American Brethren: To them,</hi> that they deprive us of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties juſtly belonging to us; and to their <hi>American Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012861_0029_0F8B9465980DB318"/>
who have dearly purchaſed them, and never have yet forfeited them; but have rather deſerved an Addition to them by our Exertions.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>the Majority</hi> of a certain great Aſſembly have peremptorily reſolved, that <hi>They have Authority to make Laws binding on the Colonies</hi> in all Caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: So then They thus aſſert their Authority, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, <hi>to tax us when, and how, and as often and as much as they pleaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which, if it ſhould be enquired, <hi>By what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they</hi> thus <hi>reſolved? And who gave them that Authority?</hi> It is probable, that they could give no ſufficient and ſatisfactory Anſwer. Certainly the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> never gave them ſuch Authority; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Britain</hi> never could give them ſuch Authority: For they never had it to give.</p>
            <p>But it deſerves ſome particular Notice here, that they were ſo cautious and reſerved as not to ſay, that <hi>they had the Right,</hi> or <hi>rightful Authority, to make ſuch Laws:</hi> And hence it may very fitly be preſumed, that they <hi>knew in their own Souls, that they had no ſuch Right, or rightful Authority;</hi> and therefore they would not declare, that it belonged to them.</p>
            <p>Many judicious Perſons here are of the Mind, and have often expreſſed it, that it would have been better if the Majority had not boaſted of their <hi>abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor indeed reſolved any Thing at all about</hi> it: For, in Truth, <hi>the Saying and Reſolving,</hi> that <hi>they have ſuch Authority, is no Proof at all</hi> of their being in the rightful Poſſeſſion of it.—And <hi>the Methods,</hi> which have been taken for ſupporting their <hi>aſſerted Authority,</hi> have no Tendency to produce <hi>any Approbation of it, or real Regard to it.</hi> But, as <hi>the Claim</hi> of ſuch an Authority by a <hi>Britiſh Senate</hi> muſt be deemed abſurd and wrong by the moſt underſtanding <hi>Britons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012861_0030_0F8B94665E9187F0"/>
ſo <hi>the rough Managements</hi> to ſupport and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh <hi>it</hi> are judged, by <hi>the Americans</hi> in general, to be contrary to Reaſon, Right and Equity.—And <hi>all the Military Force,</hi> which can be ſent for its Support, will only ſerve to confirm and eſtabliſh theſe Colonies in their real Apprehenſions, that <hi>wrong and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as well <hi>as weak and fooliſh, Meaſures</hi> are uſed with them; and <hi>Theſe,</hi> as they think, from ſuch <hi>illiberal Motives,</hi> as wiſe Men will find it very difficult to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, or even to palliate.</p>
            <p>Although it has been readily and cheerfully granted, that <hi>the Britiſh Houſe of Commons have the undoubted Right and ſole Power and Authority of</hi> taxing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their Brethren, at Home; yet we conceive it to be a moſt <hi>unreaſonable and unrighteous Stretch of the Authority,</hi> which is claimed by them, <hi>to exerciſe it in taxing the People of</hi> America:—For it is moſt ſure and certain, that <hi>the Americans</hi> have never <hi>choſen</hi> them for their Repreſentatives; and it is reaſonable to think, that they <hi>never will chuſe</hi> them as ſuch: Becauſe they cannot well be accountable to them for their public Conduct and Managements; nor can they well be treated by them according to their good or evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings from them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> conſider it as <hi>very diſingenuous</hi> to treat them in ſuch an unfit and ſevere Manner, by <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous Laws and rigorous Executions</hi> of them; when They, eſpecially of <hi>New England,</hi> have at their own Expence ſettled <hi>a great Continent,</hi> ſo much to the Advantage of <hi>Britain,</hi> and to our Loſs, in the Way of <hi>Trade and Commerce;</hi> and by means of which <hi>Great Britain</hi> is made ſo wealthy at Home, and ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and eſteemed by her ſorrounding Neighbours.— Nor have they only <hi>ſettled</hi> this vaſt Continent to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Degree; but, by the Expence of <hi>much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and much Blood,</hi> they have maintained the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to the Emolument of <hi>Britons:</hi> And why? It
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012861_0031_0F8B946A839995C8"/>
was all for the ſake of <hi>enjoying thoſe Rights and Privileges,</hi> which are now ſcandalouſly begrutched to them, and inſidiouſly and wrongfully wreſted from them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coloniſts</hi> alſo think, that the Managements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them are <hi>impolitic and imprudent,</hi> as well as <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous and unfair:</hi> For, it <hi>New England alone,</hi> by Divine Providence favouring their Expedition againſt <hi>Louiſburgh</hi> in the Year 1745, <hi>gave Protection to</hi> Great Britain <hi>and Peace to</hi> Europe; is it not highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>they,</hi> with the <hi>other Colonies,</hi> both may and will be greatly ſerviceable in future to their <hi>Mother Country,</hi> unleſs they be diſcouraged and hindred from being ſo by unkind and injurious Treatment? And muſt it not therefore be for <hi>the Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> to lighten them of the heavy Burdens put upon them, and not to leave ſo much as one on them?— Certainly then it muſt be <hi>their Wiſdom</hi> to do this for them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, The <hi>Americans</hi> ſincerely think, that <hi>the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Continuance of ſuch Burdens</hi> on them is a direct and continued <hi>Breach of the public Faith:</hi> For the <hi>Americans,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>the Charter Governments, were ſolemnly promiſed, that they and their Poſterity forever ſhould enjoy all the Rights and Privileges of Engliſhmen;</hi> upon Condition, that, at their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they would ſettle and improve ſuch and ſuch Territories, as ſhould be purchaſed by them in <hi>America.</hi> Now it is beyond all Diſpute, that the <hi>Americans</hi> have fulfilled their Part of the Contract: And therefore <hi>the depriving of them</hi> of the ſtipulated Rights and Liberties, and even the <hi>Abridgment of theſe,</hi> ſhould not be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, and much leſs reſolved on and executed, <hi>by Chriſtianized Britons:</hi> For even <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> would be aſhamed to perpetrate ſuch a ſhameful <hi>Breach of public Faith:</hi> And therefore it may be well and reaſonably expected, that, wherein there has been <hi>any
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012861_0032_0F8B946B363E5658"/>
ſuch Thing,</hi> or <hi>an Appearance of it,</hi> there ſhould be an honeſt and manly Reſolution not to abide by it: For ſuch a Reſolution, inſtead of diſhonouring any Body of Men, would render them more amiable, excellent and illuſtrious in the Eſtimation of the whole World.</p>
            <p>Moreover; The Coloniſts judge, that <hi>the Britiſh Commons</hi> have dealt with them, in their modern Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements, not according to the <hi>golden Rule of Equity:</hi> For certainly <hi>the Britiſh Commons,</hi> were <hi>They in</hi> our <hi>Situation and Circumſtances,</hi> and We in theirs, <hi>would not think it juſt and right for themſelves to receive ſuch Treatment</hi> from us, as they judge proper to give unto us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> therefore, upon ſuch Conſiderations as have been mentioned, are ready to exclaim with regard to the unfit, unkind and injurious Dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them by their Brethren: <hi>Oh! the Times! Oh! the Manners!</hi> For they think it wrong, that any Men ſhould exert, if they have it, ſuch an undue Influence as <hi>to remove the ancient Landmarks</hi> of Engliſh Freedom, as well as of Truth and Righteouſneſs: And they look on it as unaccountable and aſtoniſhing, that any ſuch Things ſhould be <hi>acted,</hi> or <hi>tamely ſuffered,</hi> by <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Yea the <hi>Coloniſts</hi> ſcruple not to ſpeak out the Language of the <hi>Tragic Poet</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Hero:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>O! Is it not, that <hi>Tyranny prevails,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And the true <hi>End of Government</hi> is loſt!</l>
               <l>That thoſe, who ſhould defend each in his Right,</l>
               <l>Betray their Truſt, and ſeize upon the Whole!</l>
               <l>This, this is to rebel againſt that Power,</l>
               <l>By which Kings reign; and turns the Arms of Heaven</l>
               <l>Againſt itſelf.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus a few Things, of no ſmall Importance, have been offered by Way of <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>the Americans:</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:012861_0033_0F8B946BC228CF88"/>
And where is the Hurt, or Impropriety, of my offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this Apology</hi> for their Rights and Liberties; any more than in <hi>Juſtin Marty</hi>'s, <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>'s, and other Writers in the primitive Church, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>their Apologies</hi> for their Chriſtian Brethren to the <hi>Roman Emperors and Senates?</hi> And, if <hi>this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> in Conjunction with thoſe of <hi>others,</hi> ſhould meet with Acceptance; and my Country, with the other Colonies, ſhould fare in any Meaſure the better for it, it will be a great Comfort to me at the <hi>Setting of my Life,</hi> and cauſe me to quit the Stage with more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and Satisfaction; becauſe <hi>due Freedom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to</hi> America, <hi>and there is a comfortable Proſpect of its deſcending</hi> to our lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>But, if notwithſtanding all, that has been ſo clearly and fully, ſo rationally and judiciouſly argued againſt the late Innovations, by <hi>particular Perſons</hi> of various Orders, and by ſuch reſpectable Bodies of Men as <hi>Councils and Repreſentatives, Might</hi> muſt be ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed for ſubverting and <hi>overpowering American Right;</hi> We think, and are fully perſuaded, that the generous and brave <hi>Americans</hi> will be <hi>diſpoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend</hi> themſelves and their Rights, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> in the beſt Manner they can for doing ſo: And, if Things, from unadviſed and raſh Meaſures ſtill uſed, muſt be brought to a deſperate Criſis, the <hi>Coloniſts</hi> will make their Appeal to HIM, who is <hi>higher than the Higheſt,</hi> or ſupremeſt, on the Earth; who, as He <hi>always judges righteouſly,</hi> always <hi>loveth Righteouſneſs and hateth Oppreſſion</hi> and all Manner of Iniquity: And they will <hi>hope and trust in HIM, as their Cauſe is juſt and right, to own and ſucceed it: For JUST &amp; RIGHT is HE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while may an <hi>Engliſh American,</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his Profeſſion and public Buſineſs, be allowed to call upon all his <hi>American Brethren,</hi> while endeavouring <hi>to do their Duty to their GOD and their King,</hi> as well
