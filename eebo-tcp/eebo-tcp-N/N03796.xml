            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To all the Ignorant, Carnal, and Ungodly, who are Lovers of Pleaſure more than God, and ſeek this World more than the Life Everlaſting, and live after the Fleſh, and not after the Spirit.

            <p>THere is that <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in every <hi>True Believer,</hi> but eſpecially in every <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter</hi> of CHRIST, which engageth them to long and labour for your Salvation. <hi>Life</hi> is communicative and active. It maketh us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Faith is not a Fantaſy, nor true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stage-Play, nor our Hopes of our eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs a Dream. And as we deſire nothing more for ourſelves, than to have more of the Holy Life which we have, alas! in ſo ſmall a Meaſure; ſo what is it that we ſhould more deſire for others? With the Eye of an infallible (tho' too weak) Faith, <hi>we ſee</hi> the Heaven which you neglect, and the bleſſed Souls in Glory with Chriſt, whoſe Companions you might be forever: We ſee the multitude of Souls in Hell, who came thither by the ſame Way that you are going in. Who are ſhut out of the glorious Preſence of God, and are now among thoſe Devils that deceived them, remembering that they had their good Things here, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. And how they ſpent the Day of their Viſitation, and how light they once ſet by God, by Chriſt, by Heaven, by Mercy, whilſt Mercy was an earneſt Solicitor for their Hearts: And with our bodily Eyes we ſee at the ſame time, abundance of poor Sinners living about us, as if there were no God, no Chriſt, no Heaven, no Hell, no Judgment; nor no Death to be expected;
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004663_0003_100DE88416055C10"/>
as if a Man were but a Maſter-beaſt, to rule the reſt, and feed upon them, and periſh with them. And if it were here our own Caſe, to ſee what Souls do in Heaven and Hell, and at once to ſee how unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, careleſly and ſenſeſly moſt Men live on earth, as if there were no ſuch difference in another world: Would it not ſeem a pitiful ſight to you? If you had once ſeen the five Brethren of <hi>Dives</hi> on Earth, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking laughing and merry, cloathed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring daily with the beſt, and at the ſame time ſeen their Brother's Soul in Hell, begging in vain for a little Eaſe, and wiſhing in vain that one from the dead might go warn his Brethren, that they come not to the Place of Torment; would it not ſeem to you a pitiful Sight? Would not Pity have made you think, [<hi>Is there no way to open theſe Gentlemen's Eyes? No way to acquaint them what is become of their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and where</hi> Lazarus <hi>is, and whither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are going? No one driveth or forceth them to Hell, and will they go thither of themſelves? And is there no way to ſtop them or keep them back?</hi>] Did you but ſee yourſelves, what we ſee by Faith (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God) and at once beheld the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the loſt deſpairing Souls in Hell, and the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſenſual Sinners on Earth, that yet they will lay none of this to Heart, ſure it would make you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the ſtupidity of Mankind. Would you not ſay, O what a Deceiver is the Devil, that can thus lead on Souls to their own Damnation? O what a Cheater is this tranſitory World, that can <hi>make</hi> Man <hi>ſo forget the World</hi> where they muſt live forever? O what an Enemy is this Fleſh, that thus draweth down Men's Souls from God? O what a beſotting thing is Sin, that turneth a reaſonable Soul into worſe than a Beaſt? What a Bedlam is this wicked World, when Thouſands are ſo buſily labouring to undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, and gratifying the Devil, againſt the GOD and Saviour who would give them an everlaſting bleſſed Life!</p>
            <p>And as we have ſuch a Sight as this by Faith to make us pity you, ſo have we ſo much Taſte of the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004663_0004_100DE886B59D20D0"/>
               <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, the Sweetneſs of his Ways, and the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Believers, as muſt needs make us wiſh, that you had but once tried the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which would turn the Pleaſures of ſin into deteſtation. God knoweth that we deſire nothing more for <hi>ourſelves,</hi> than the Perfection and <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of this <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> which we <hi>believe and taſte.</hi> And ſhould we not deſire the ſame for you?</p>
            <p>And being thus moved with neceſſary Pity, we ask of God what he would have us to do for your Salvation; and he hath told us in Scripture, that the Preaching of his Goſpel, to acquaint you plainly with the Truth, and earneſtly and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to turn from the Fleſh and World to God by Jeſus Chriſt, is the Means with which his Grace is ready to concur for your Salvation; when obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reſiſtance cauſeth the Holy Spirit to forſake the Sinner, and leave him to himſelf, to follow his own Counſels, Luſts and Wills.</p>
            <p>In this Hope we undertook the ſacred Miniſtry, and gave up ourſelves to this great and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Work, in the great Senſe of our Unwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thineſs, but yet in the ſenſe of your Souls Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We were not ſuch Fools at our firſt ſetting out, as not to know it muſt be a Life of Labour, Self-denial and Patience, and the Devil would do his worſt to hinder us, and that all ſorts of his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be ready to ſerve him againſt our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and againſt your Souls. <hi>Chriſt</hi> your <hi>Captain</hi> ſaved by <hi>Patient Conqueſt,</hi> and ſo muſt we ſave <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and you;</hi> And ſo muſt <hi>you ſave yourſelves</hi> under Chriſt, if ever you be ſaved. It was not ſtrange to <hi>Paul,</hi> that Bonds and Afflictions did eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where abide him; nor did he account his Life dear, that he might finiſh his Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry committed to him by the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 23, 24. It was no ſtrange thing to him, to be <hi>forbidden to preach to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved,</hi> by ſuch as were <hi>filling up the meaſure of their Sins,</hi> and where, under God's <hi>uttermoſt Wrath</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:004663_0005_100DE8884F0E08D0"/>
on Earth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15, 16 Devils and Phariſees, and moſt where they came, both high and low, were againſt the Apoſtles preaching of the Goſpel, and yet they would not ſacrilegiouſly and cruelly break their Covenant with Chriſt, and perfidiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Souls of Men, even as their Lord, for the love of Souls did call <hi>Peter Satan,</hi> that would have tempted him to ſave his Life and Fleſh, inſtead of making it a Sacrifice for our Sins.</p>
            <p>What think you ſhould move us to undertake a calling ſo contrary to our fleſhly eaſe and intereſts? Do we not know the the way of Eaſe and Honour? of Wealth and Pleaſures, as well as others? And have we not Fleſh as well as others? Could we not be content that the Cup of Reproach, and Scorn and Slander, and Poverty and Labours, might paſs from us, if it were not for the Will of God and your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? why ſhould we love to be the loweſt, and troden down by malignant Pride, and counted as the filth of the World, and the Off-ſcouring of all things, repreſented to Rulers whom we honour, as Schiſmaticks, diſobedient, turbulent, unruly, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church-Uſurper, whom we refuſe to make a God of; why give you not over this Preaching of the Goſpel, at the will of Satan, that is, for the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſuffering of your Souls,</hi> under the pretence of <hi>making us ſuffer?</hi> Is not all this that you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaved? If we be herein beſides ourſelves, it is for you. Could the words of the Ignorant or Proud, have perſwaded us that either your wants or dangers are ſo inconſiderable, or your other Supplies and Helps ſufficient, that our Labours had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to you, God knoweth we ſhould have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obeyed <hi>the ſilencing ſort of Paſtors,</hi> and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken us to ſome other land, where our Service had been more neceſſary. Let ſhame be the Hypocrites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who take not the ſaving of Souls, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, for a ſufficient reward, without Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Dignities, Preferments, or worldly Wealth.</p>
            <p>I have told you our Motives, I have told you our Buſineſs, and the Terms of our Undertaking
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004663_0006_100DE889FA61BD60"/>
It is God, and you <hi>Sinners,</hi> that next muſt tell us what our Entertainment and Succeſs ſhall be. Shall it ſtill be Neglect and unthankful Contempt, and turning away your Ear and Heart, and ſaying, we have ſomewhat elſe to mind? Will you ſtill be cheated by this deceiving World? And ſpend all your Days in pampering your Guts, and providing for your Fleſh, that muſt lie rotting very ſhortly in a Grave? Were you made for no better Work than this? May not we bring you to ſome ſober thoughts of your Condition, nor one awakened look into the World where you muſt be forever? Nor one Heart-raiſing Thought of the everlaſting Glory? Not one Heart-piercing Thought of all your Saviour's Love? Not one Tear for all your ſinful Lives? O God forbid! Let not our Labour be ſo deſpiſed: Let not your God, your Saviour, and your Souls be ſet ſo light by. O let there be no profane Perſon among you like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who, for <hi>one morſel, ſold</hi> his Birth-right.</p>
            <p>Poor Sinners! we talk not to you as on a Stage in cuſtomary words, and becauſe that talking thus was our Trade; we are in as good earneſt with you as if we ſaw you all Murdering yourſelves, and we are perſuading you to ſave your Lives. Can any Man be in a Jeſt with you who believeth God? Who by Faith foreſeeth whither you are going, and what you loſe, and where the Game of Sin will end? It is little better to jeſt now in Pulpit or in private, than to ſtand jeſting over your departing Souls, when at Death <hi>you</hi> are Breathing <hi>out your</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>Alas! with Shame and Grief we do confeſs that we never ſpeak to you of theſe things as their truth and weight deſerve, nor with the Skill and Wiſdom, the Affection and Fervency which beſeemeth one engaged in the ſaving of poor Souls. But yet you may perceive that we are in good Sadneſs with you (for God is ſo) what elſe do we ſtudy for, labour for, ſuffer for, live for? Why elſe do we ſo much trouble ourſelves, and trouble you with all this ado, and anger them that would have had us ſilent? For my own Part, I will make my free confeſſion to you
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:004663_0007_100DE88E09EDF248"/>
to my ſhame: That I never grew cold and dull, and pitileſs to the Souls of others, till I firſt grew too cold and careleſs of my own (unleſs when weakneſs or ſpeculative ſtudies cool me, which I muſt confeſs they often do.) We never ceaſe pitying you, till we are growing too like you, and ſo have need of Pity ourſelves.</p>
            <p>When, through the Mercy of my Lord, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the World of Souls which I am going to, hath any powerful Operation on myſelf; O then, I could ſpend and be ſpent for others. No Words are too earneſt, no Labour too great, no Coſt too dear, the Frowns and Wrath of malignant Oppoſers of the preaching of Chriſt's Goſpel are nothing to me. But when the World of Spirits diſappears, or my Soul is clouded, and receiveth not the vital illuminating Influences of Heaven, <hi>I grow cold,</hi> firſt to <hi>myſelf,</hi> then to others.</p>
            <p>Come then poor Sinners, and help us who are willing at any rate to be your Helpers. As we firſt crave God's Help, ſo we next crave yours. Help us, for we cannot ſave you againſt your Wills, nor ſave you without your Conſent and Help. God himſelf will not ſave you without you, and how ſhould we? We know that the Devil is againſt us, &amp; will do his worſt to hinder us, and ſo will all his Miniſters by what Names or Titles ſoever dignified or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. But all this is nothing, if you will but take our parts yourſelves; I mean, if you will take Chriſt's part, and your own, and will not be againſt yourſelves. Men and Devils cannot either help or hinder us in ſaving you, as you may do yourſelves. If God and you be for us, who ſhall be againſt us?</p>
            <p>And <hi>will you help us?</hi> Give over ſtriving againſt God, and Conſcience, give over fighting againſt Chriſt and his Spirit: Take part no more with the World and the Fleſh, which in your Baptiſm you renounced. Set your Hearts to the Meſſage which we bring you. Allow it your <hi>Man-like ſober Thoughts,</hi> ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee whether the things which we ſpeak be ſo or no. We offer you
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:004663_0008_100DE88F8E602148"/>
nothing but what we have reſolvedly choſen our ſelves, and that after the moſt ſerious deliberation that we can make. We have looked round about us, to know what is the Happineſs of Man: And had we found better for <hi>ourſelves,</hi> we had offered better to you. If this World would have ſerved our turns, it ſhould have ſerved yours alſo, and we would not have troubled you with the talk of <hi>another World;</hi> but it will not; I am ſure it will never ſerve your turns, to make you happy, nor ſhall you long make that ſorry, ſelf-deceiving ſhift with it, as now you do.</p>
            <p>But if you will not think of theſe things, if you will not uſe the Reaſon of Men, alas what can we do to ſave your Souls? O pity them, Lord, that they may pity themſelves. Have Mercy on them, that they may have ſome more Mercy on themſelves and us. Help them, that they may help themſelves. If you ſtill refuſe, will not your loſs be more than ours? If we loſe our Labour, (which to ourſelves we ſhall not) if we loſe our hopes of your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what is this to your everlaſting Loſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf? and what are our Sufferings for your ſakes, in compariſon of your endleſs Sufferings?</p>
            <p>But O, this is what breaketh our Hearts, that we leave you under more guilt than we found you; and when we have laid our Life and Labour to ſave you, the impenitent Souls muſt have their Pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed for the refuſing of theſe Calls. And that it will be Part of your Hell to think forever how madly you refuſed our Counſel; and what Pains and Coſt, and Patience were uſed to have ſaved you, and all in vain. It will be ſo, it muſt needs be ſo: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be eaſier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the Day of Judgment,</hi> than for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of his Goſpel-calls. The Nature of the <hi>thing,</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Juſtice</hi> certainly tell you, that it muſt be ſo</p>
            <p>O turn not our Complaints to God againſt you; Turn us not from beſeeching you to be reconciled to God, to tell him you will not be reconciled.

Force us not to ſay, That we earneſtly invited you to the Heavenly Feaſt, and you would not come.

But it was they themſelves that broke our Hearts, that loſt our Labour, that made us Preach and intreat in vain: It was eaſier to Preach without Maintenance than without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.

            <p>I know poor Sinner that Fleſh is brutiſh, and Luſt and Appetite have no Reaſon.

I know that thou liveſt in a tempting and a wicked World, where Things or Perſons will be daily hindring this.

If it be a Communion of Saints, make it not a Communion of Swine, and make not Saints and their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeem odious either for their Infirmities or their Croſſneſs to your Carnal Intereſts or Conceits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 18 Ask them whether there be a Heaven and a Hell or not? If not, why are they pretended Chriſtians? If there be, will God ſend one Man to Heaven and another to Hell, to ſo vaſt, ſo amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a difference of States, if there be no great difference betwixt them here! If holineſs no more differenced Chriſtians from others, than ſaying a Sermon, or ſaying over a Prayer, doth difference one from an Infidel, where were the Juſtice of God, in ſaying ſome and damning of others?

               <hi>Q.</hi> 19. Ask them whether Kings and all Men make not a great difference between Man and Man: the Loyal and Perfidious, the Obedient and the Diſobedient? And whether they difference not themſelves between a Friend and a Foe, one that loveth them, and one that robbeth or would kill them?

            <p>Having thus contributed my Endeavour in this Preface, to the furtherance of the deſign of this excellent Book; I muſt tell thee, Reader, that I take it for an Honour to commend ſo maſculine a Birth unto the world. The Midwife of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> need not be aſhamed of her Office. Who the Author of this Treatiſe was, how he preached, how he lived, how ſuffered, (and for what) and how he died, his Life and Letters lately printed fully tell you. And I earneſtly commend the Reading of them to all, eſpecially to Miniſters, not to tell them what Men have been here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to preach Chriſt's Goſpel, and for what, nor what Men they are that ſo many Years have done it, or to tell you what Men Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould be. But ſay not, he killed himſelf with exceſſive Labour, and therefore I will take warning, and take my eaſe, For, 1. He lived in perfect Health all his days, notwithſtanding all his Labours, till after his hard and long Impriſonment. 2. It was not the greateſt Labours of his Times of Liberty that hurt him, but his preaching ſix or ſeven or eight Times in a week, after that he was ſilenced, becauſe he could not ſpeak to all his People at

               </gap>ay not like <hi>Judas, what need this waſte!</hi> His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, his Life, his Sufferings, his Death, were not in vain. The Ages to come that read his Life, and read this little popular Treatiſe, and his <hi>Call to Archippus,</hi> ſhall ſay, They were not in vain. And tho' he was cut off in the midſt of his Age, and his longer Labours, and more elaborate Writings thus prevented, take thankfully this ſmall but metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical warm and ſerious Tractate. Read it ſeriouſly, and it cannot be but it muſt do thee good.</p>
            <p>I am one that have lookt into Books and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Speculations of many ſorts, and ſeriouſly tell thee as a dying Man, that after all my Searches and Experiences, I have found that Philoſophical Enquiries into the Divine Artifices, and the Nature of Things, hath among a great Number of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, a great many Pretty Probabilities which a holy Soul can make good Uſe of in admiring GOD, and may find us a lawful kind of Sport; but in the Moralities which <hi>Atheiſts</hi> count Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Knowlege of GOD, and our Hopes, the Doctrine and Practice of Holineſs, Temperance, and Charity, and Juſtice, and the diligent ſeeking, and joyful hopes of Life Everlaſting, is all the true Wiſdom, Goodneſs, the Reſt and Comfort of a Soul; whatever be our Plea, this is the ſatisfying certainty, thy Buſineſs, and the beautifying Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I have done when I have ſought to remove a little Scandal, which I foreſaw, that I ſhould my ſelf write the Preface to his Life, where himſelf and two of his Friends make ſuch a mention of my Name, which I cannot own; which will ſeem a praiſing him for praiſing me. I confeſs it looketh ill-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouredly in me: But I had not the Power of other Mens Writings, and durſt not therefore forbear that which was his due. Had I directed their Pens, they ſhould have gone a middle way and only eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a very unworthy Servant of Chriſt, (who yet
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:004663_0021_100DE8AF365397C0"/>
longs to ſee the Peace and Proſperity of his Church) and ſhould have forborn their undeſerved Praiſe, as other Men ſhould have done their ſlanderous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. But if the Reader get no harm by it, I aſſure him the uſe I made of it was, to lament that I am really ſo much the worſe then they eſteemed me, and fear leſt I ſhould prove yet worſe than I diſcern my ſelf, who ſee ſo much Sin and Weakneſs in my Betters, and much more in my ſelf, as to make it the conſtant Sentiment of my Soul, that Pride of Mens Greatneſs, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, is the firſt Part of the Devil's Image on Man's Soul, and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſecond, and Malignity the Third.</p>

now to do; what can there be ſaid to this Man that's like to bring him to good? Friend, know thy ſelf better, or thou periſheſt with out Remedy. Thou mayeſt pray, but what hope is there in thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thou mayeſt read, but what Hope is there in thy Reading? Yet read on, this little hope there is, in this Book there is <hi>Eye ſalve</hi> that may heal thee of thy Blindneſs. In this Book there is a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> that will ſhew thee thy Face. Doſt thou know thine own Face when thou ſeeſt it? Behold thy very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in thoſe Marks that are given of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Perſon. Read and conſider them, and then ſay, if thou be not the Man.</p>
            <p>Be willing to know thy ſelf, and to know the worſt of thy Caſe. Wink not at the Light; hide not thy ſelf from thine own Soul. Wilt thou never know thy Diſeaſe till it be paſt remedy?</p>
            <p>Much of our hardeſt Work would be over, if we could ſee the Sinners to whom we are ſent, to be convinced Sinners: If we could but open the blind Eyes, there were hopes we ſhould ſhortly raiſe the Dead.</p>
            <p>Sinner, of a truth thou art in evil caſe, whether thou know it or not; thou art among the dead, and there is but a ſtep betwixt thee and Hell. Thou wilt not believe it though it be told thee; yet once again let me beſeech thee, come to the Glaſs that is here preſented to thee, and narrowly obſerve whether the very Marks of the Dead be not found upon thee.</p>
            <p>If there be miſcarriage in this firſt work, if thou wilt not underſtand thy Miſery, and thy danger, there is an end of all hopes concerning thee. Whilſt Self-ignorance abides upon thee, all the Counſels that are neceſſary for a Man in thy caſe, will do thee no good, they are never like to proſper with thee, becauſe thou wilt not count them proper for thee. Who will be perſwaded to do that which he believes is already done? Who will take the Counſel of the Phyſician that does not think himſelf ſick? The Man of God may ſpare his pains of perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to Converſion, whilſt thou art confident
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:004663_0023_100DE8B618767B50"/>
thou art converted already: Who will be at the pains of Repentance that concludes he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented? who will bear the Labour and the Pangs of the New Birth, that is confident he is already paſſed from Death to Life.</p>
            <p>But Friend, let me a little reaſon with thee; thou art confident it is well with thee, yet why wilt thou not yield to thus much at leaſt, to put it to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Am I not miſtaken?</hi> Thou art worſe than mad, if thou thinkeſt ſuch a Queſtion may not be put. Doſt thou know that thy Heart is falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and yet becauſe it ſpeaks good conerning thee, muſt it not be queſtioned whether it ſpeaks truth or no? Be ſo wiſe as to conclude, <hi>I may be miſtaken,</hi> and thus come to the Trial whether thou art miſtaken or not.</p>
            <p>And if upon Trial by the Marks that are before thee, thou come to be undeceived, and ſee thy ſelf wrapped up in that Miſery which hitherto thou wouldeſt not ſuſpect, the next news <hi>I expect</hi> to hear from thee is, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſav'd?</hi> O were it come to that once, Then thou haſt an anſwer at hand in thoſe means thou wilt find preſcribed thee. And becauſe they are ſuch as thou wilt hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to uſe, take in the Motives that follow, and theſe will help down the means Conſider both the one and the other, and if thou doſt not find the means proper, and the motives weighty, I think I ſhall do thee no wrong, if I tell thee, thou art ſtill of a blind Mind, and an harder Heart.</p>
            <p>The matter which this little Book comes to treat with thee about, is of the higheſt Importance; 'Tis a matter of Life or Death. If thou ſayeſt the Terms upon which Life is offered, are hard; conſider, is it not harder to die? He is worthy to die who will loſe his Soul to ſave his Labour. If thou could ſtep down into the deep, and take a turn or two with thoſe damned Souls who are drenched with Fire and Brimſtone, and bound in everlaſting chains of vengeance, and ſhould ask them now what do you think of the Terms upon which Life was offered?
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:004663_0024_100DE8B876970D48"/>
Now, what think you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Repentance, of that Obedience, of that Circumſpection, Self denial, and the greateſt Severity, which by the Goſpel were impoſed upon you? If you might once again have the ſame terms granted you for your Redemption from this place of torment, would you yet ſay hard terms! Let me rather die this death for ever, than live ſuch a Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let me broil in this furnace, rather then eſcape with ſuch difficulty. Shouldeſt thou ask them thus that have felt what it is to be damned, what anſwer doſt thou think they would make? <hi>O Friend, never again groan under the difficulties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion till thou believe them to be worſe than Hell.</hi> But I will not further anticipate my worthy Author.</p>
            <p>Nor is there much need I ſhould commend either himſelf or his Work; for the Author himſelf thou mayeſt at a ſmall charge get acquaintance with him in that Hiſtory of his Life and Death, which is extant, concerning which I ſhall only ſay,

               <p>Well, in this you ſee all are agreed, that be it more or leſs that is received in Baptiſm, if (when Men come to years) they are evidently unſanctified, they muſt be renewed again by a thorough and powerful change, or elſe they cannot eſcape the damnation of Hell. Friends and Brethren, be not deceived, God is not mocked, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. whether it be your Baptiſm, or whatever elſe that you pretend, I tell you from the living God, that if any of you be prayerleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. or unclean, or malicious, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, or riotous, or a Scoffer, or a lover of evil Company, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. In a word, if you are not holy, ſtrict and ſelf-denying Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. you cannot be ſaved, except you be transformed by a further Work upon you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again by Repentance.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004663_0034_100DE8D1C141EA28"/>Thus I have ſhewed, that it is not enough to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a Man to be regenerate, that he hath been baptized, effectual grace not neceſſarily accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptiſm, as ſome have vainly aſſerted. But I muſt anſwer one Objection before I paſs.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, it is not the end of Baptiſm, to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, 1. Becauſe then there would be no Reaſon, why it ſhould be confined only to the ſeed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for both the Law of God and the Nature of Charity, requires us to uſe the Means of Converſion for all, as far as we can have Opportunity. Were this true, no ſuch Charity as to catch the Children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and baptize them, and diſpatch them to Heaven out of hand, like the bloody wretches that made the poor Proteſtants (to ſave their Lives) to ſwear they would come to Maſs, and that they would never depart from it, and then put them forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to Death, ſaying, <hi>They would hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2. Becauſe it preſuppoſeth Regeneration, and therefore cannot be intended to confer it. In all the expreſs Inſtances in Scripture, we find that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth ſuppoſe their repenting, believing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8 37. &amp; 2.38. and 10.37. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. And to imagine, that Baptiſm was inſtituted for an end of which not one of the firſt Subjects was capable (for they were all adult Perſons, and ſuppoſed to have Faith and Repentance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they profeſſed, and their Children were not baptized till after them, in their Right) were no little abſurdity. Were this Doctrine true, Baptiſm would make Diſciples; but we find it doth beſpeak them ſuch before hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.3.

               <p>More particularly this Change of converſion paſſes throughout the whole Subject.

Converſion is no repairing of the old Building, but it takes all down, and erects a new Structure: It is not the putting in a patch, or ſowing on a Liſt of Holineſs: but with the true Convert, Holineſs is woven into all his Powers, Principles, and Practice.

               </p>
               <p>Thus the poor Soul doth venture on Chriſt, and reſolvedly adhere to him. Before Converſion, the Man made light of Chriſt, minded the Farm, Friends, Merchandiſe, more than Chriſt, <hi>Matth</hi> 22 5. Now Chriſt is to him as his neceſſary Food, his Daily-bread, the Life of his Heart, the Staff of his Life, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3 9: His great deſign is, that Chriſt may be magnified in him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.20. His Heart once ſaid, as they to the Spouſe, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another?</hi> Cant. 5.9. He found more ſweetneſs in his merry Company, wicked Games, earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, than in Chriſt. He took Religion for a Fancy, and the Talk of great Enjoyments for an idle Dream. But now, to him to live is Chriſt. He ſets light by all that he accounted precious, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of <hi>CHRIST, Phil.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>All of Chriſt is accepted by the <hi>Sincere Convert.</hi> He loves not only the wages but work of <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 7.12. not only the Benefits, but the <hi>burden of Chriſt:</hi> He is willing not only to tread out the Corn, but to draw under the Yoke: He takes up the Commands of Chriſt, yea, and Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Matth</hi> 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24.</p>
               <p>The unſound cloſeth by the halves with Chriſt: He is all for the Salvation of Chriſt, but he is not for Sanctification: He is for the Privileges, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretrates not the Perſon of Chriſt: He divides the Offices and Benefits of Chriſt. This is an Error in the Foundation: Whoſo loveth Life let him beware here; 'tis an undoing miſtake, of which you have been often warned, and yet none more common. Jeſus is a ſweet name, but Men love not the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity, <hi>Eph</hi> 6.24. They will not have him as God offers, <hi>To be a Prince, and a Saviour,</hi>

Acts 5, 31. They divide what God hath joyned, the King and the Prieſt; Yea, they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Salvation of Chriſt, as he intends it; they divide it here. Every Man's Vote is for Salvation from Suffering, but they deſire not to be ſaved from ſinning; they would have their Lives ſaved, but withall, they would have their Luſts. Yea, many divide her again; they would be content to have ſome of their Sins deſtroyed, but they cannot leave the Lap of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> or divorce the beloved <hi>Herodias.</hi> They cannot be cruel to the Right-eye, or Right-hand; the Lord muſt pardon them in this thing, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.18. Oh! be infinitely tender here; your Souls lye upon it. The ſound Convert takes a whole Chriſt, and takes him for all intents and purpoſes: without exceptions, without limitations, without reſerves. He is willing to have <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon his terms upon any terms. He is willing of the Dominion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But I ſhall more particularly ſhew the Neceſſity of Converſion in Five Things; for without this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy Being is in vain:</hi> Is it not Pity thou ſhouldeſt be good for nothing, an unprofitable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Earth, a wart or wen in the Body of the Univerſe? Thus thou art, whilſt unconverted; for thou canſt not anſwer the End of thy Being: Is it not for the divine Pleaſure thou art and wert crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. Did he not make thee for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. Art thou a Man, and haſt thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Why then bethink thyſelf, why and whence thy Being is. Behold God's Workmanſhip in thy Body, and ask thyſelf, To what end did God rear this Fabrick? Conſider the noble Faculties of thy Heaven-born Soul: To what end did God beſtow theſe Excellencies: To no other, than that thou ſhouldeſt pleaſe thyſelf and gratify thy Senſes? Did God ſend Men, like the Swallows, into the World, only to gather a few ſticks and dirt, and build their Neſts, and breed up their young, and then away! The very <hi>Heathens</hi> could ſee farther than this. Art thou ſo fearfully and wonderfully made, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139. 14. and doſt thou not yet think with thyſelf, ſurely it was for ſome noble and raiſed end!</p>
               <p>O Man! ſet thy Reaſon a little in the Chair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it not pity ſuch a goodly Fabrick ſhould be raiſed in vain! Verily, thou art in vain, except thou art for God; better thou hadſt no being, than not to be for him. Would thou ſerve thy End? Thou muſt repent, and be converted; without this, thou art <hi>to us Purpoſe;</hi> yea, <hi>to had Purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, To no purpoſe:</hi> Man unconverted, is like a choice Inſtrument, that hath every String broke, or out of Tune; the Spirit of the living God muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and tune it by the Grace of Regeneration, and ſweetly move it by the power of actuating Grace, or

               <p>An Unſanctified Man cannot work the Work of God. 1. <hi>He hath no Skill in it.</hi> He is altogether as unskilful in the Work, as in the Word of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13. There are great Myſteries, as well in the Practices, as Principles of Godlineſs; now the Unregenerate knows not the Myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13: 11.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. You may as well expect him that never learned the Alphabet, to read; or look for goodly Muſick of the Lute, from one that never ſet his Hand to an Inſtrument, as that a natural Man ſhould do the Lord any pleaſing Service: He muſt firſt be taught of God, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. taught to pray, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1. taught to profit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 17. taught to go, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.3. or elſe he will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly at a Loſs. 2. <hi>He hath no Strength for it,</hi> How weak is his Heart? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.30. He is preſently tired. The Sabbath, what a wearineſs is it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1 13. He is without ſtrength, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. yea, ſtark dead in Sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 3. <hi>He hath no Mind to it.</hi> He deſires not the Knowledge of God's ways, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. He doth not know them, and he doth not eare to know them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82 5. He knows not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he underſtand. 4 <hi>He hath neither due In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, nor Materials for it.</hi> A Man may as well hew the Marble without Tools, or limn without Colours or Inſtruments, or build without Materials, as perform any acceptable Service without the Graces of the Spirit, which are both the Materials and Inſtruments in the Work. Alms-giving is not a Service of God, but of Vain-glory, unleſs dealt forth by the Hand of divine Love. What is the Prayer of the Lips without Grace in the Heart, but the Carcaſe without the Life? What are all our Confeſſions, unleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

What our Praiſes and Thankſgivings, unleſs from the Love of God, and a holy Gratitude, and Senſe of God's Mercies in the Heart? So that a Man may as well expect that Trees ſhould ſpeak, or look for Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick from the Brutes, or Motion from the Dead, as for any Service holy and acceptable to God from the Unconverted. When the Tree is evil, how can the Fruit be good? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.18.</p>

Then there is an end for ever of his <hi>Hope.</hi> Indeed, the Hope of the Righteous hath an end; but then 'tis not a deſtructive, but a perfective end; his hope ends in fruition, others in fruſtration, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 28.

Wicked Men are ſettled in the Carnal Hope, and will not be beaten out of it: They hold it faſt, they will not let it go.

miſerable: When Death comes, it lets them out into the amazing Gulf of endleſs Deſperation. 3. <hi>There is Blaſphemy in it.</hi> To hope we ſhall be ſaved, tho' continuing unconverted, is to hope we ſhall prove God a liar.

In a Word, he hath told you, that whatever you be, or do, nothing ſhall avail you to Salvation, without you be New Creatures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. Now, to ſay God is merciful, and we hope he will ſave us nevertheleſs, is to ſay, in effect, we hope God will not do as he ſaith. We may not ſet God's Attributes at variance: God is reſolved to glorify Mercy, but not with the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Truth; as the preſumptuous Sinner will find, to his everlaſting Sorrow.</p>

               <p>This muſt be premiſed, before we proceed to the Diſcovery, That it is moſt certain Men may have a confident Perſwaſion, that their Hearts and States be good, and yet be unſound.

that have no better Proof, than barely a ſtrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that they are converted, are certainly as yet Strangers to Converſion.</p>
               <p>But to come more cloſe; as it was ſaid of the Adherents of Antichriſt, ſo here; ſome of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted carry their Mark in the Foreheads more openly; and ſome in their Hands more covertly.

and depend on my Faithfulneſs, and take my Bond for your Security? Will you be content to follow me, in Poverty, and Reproach, and Affliction here, and to ſee much going out, and little coming in, and to tarry till the next World for your Preferment? <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.21. I deal much upon Truſt: Will you be content to labour, and ſuffer, and to tarry for your Returns till the Reſurrection of the Juſt? <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. The Womb of my Promiſe will not preſently bring forth: Will you have the Patience to wait? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. Now, Beloved, What ſay you to this? Will you have this God for your God? Will you be content to live by Faith, and truſt him for an unſeen Happineſs, an unſeen Heaven, an unſeen Glory? Do your Hearts anſwer, Lord, we will venture ourſelves upon thee, we commit ourſelves to thee, we roll upon thee, we know whom we have truſted, we are willing to take thy Word, we will prefer thy Promiſes before our own Poſſeſſions, and the Hopes of Heaven before all the Enjoyments of the Earth, we will wait thy Leiſure: What thou wilt here, ſo that we may have but thy faithful Promiſe for Heaven hereafter? If you can in Truth, and upon Deliberation, thus accept of God, he will be yours. Thus there muſt be, in a right Converſion to God, a Cloſing with him ſuitable to his Excellencies. But when Men cloſe with his Mercy, but yet love Sin, hating Holineſs and Purity; or will take him for their Benefactor, but not for their Sovereign; or for their Patron, but not for their Portion; this is no thorow, and no ſound Converſion.</p>

When thou findeſt any Troubles for Sin, and Fears about thy eternal State, beg of God, that they may never leave thee, till they have wrought off thy Heart throughly from Sin, and wrought it over to Jeſus Chriſt. Say to him, <hi>Strike home, Lord; leave not the Work in the Midſt.

I am under an Inability to, Averſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs from, and Enmity againſt any Thing that is good; and am prone to all that is evil. My Heart is a very Sink of all Sin: And Oh the innumerable Hoſts and Swarms of ſinful Thoughts, Words and Actions, that have flown from thence! Oh the Lord of Guilt that is on my Soul! <hi>My Head is full, my Heartfull, my Mind and my Members, they are full of Sin.</hi> O my Sins! how do they ſtare upon me? How do they witneſs againſt me? Wo is me, my Creditors are upon me, every Commandment taketh hold upon me, for more than ten Thouſand Talents, yea, ten Thouſand times ten Thouſand. How end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs then is the Sum of all my Debts!

                  <p>O my Sins! my Sins! Behold, a Troop cometh! Multitudes, Multitudes! there is no Number of their Armies. Innumerable Evils have compaſſed me about: Mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me; they have ſet themſelves in Array againſt me. Oh! it were better to have all the Regiments of Hell come againſt me, than to have my Sins to fall upon me, to the ſpoiling of my Soul. Lord, how am I ſurrounded? how many are they that riſe up againſt me? They have beſet me behind and before: They ſwarm within me, and without me: They have poſſeſſed all my Powers, and have fortified mine unhappy Soul as a Garriſon, which this Brood of Hell doth man, and maintain againſt the God that made me.</p>
                  <p>And they are as mighty, as they are many: The Sands are many, but then they are not great: The Mountains great, but then they are not many: But wo is me! my Sins are as many as the Sands, and as mighty as the Mountains; their Weight is greater than their Number. It were better that the Rocks and the Mountains ſhould fall upon me, than the cruſhing and inſupportable Load of my own Sins. Lord, I am heavy loaden; let Mercy help, or I am gone. Unload me of this heavy Guilt, this ſinking Load, or I am cruſhed without Hope, and muſt be preſſed down to Hell. If my Grief were thorowly weighed, and all my Sins laid in the Ballances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea; therefore my Words are ſwallowed up; the would weigh down all the Rocks, and the Hills, and turn the Ballance againſt all the Iſles of the Earth O Lord, thou knoweſt my manifold Tranſgreſſions and my mighty Sins.</p>

What then? Is there no Help, no Hope? None, except I turn. Why, but is there any Remedy for ſuch woful Miſery? Any Mercy after ſuch provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity?

                  <p>Why then I thank thee upon the bended Knees of my Soul, O moſt merciful <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that thy Patience hath waited upon me hitherto: For hadſt thou took me away in this Eſtate, I had periſhed for ever. And now I adore thy Grace, and accept the Offers of thy Mercy: I renounce all my Sins, and reſolve, by thy Grace, to ſet myſelf againſt them, and to follow thee, in Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, all the Days of my Life.</p>
                  <p>Who am I, Lord, that I ſhould make any Claim unto thee, or have any Part or Pottion in thee, who am not worthy to lick up the Duſt of thy Feet? Yet ſince thou holdeſt forth the golden Scepter, I am bold to come and touch. To deſpair, would be to deſparage thy Mercy; and to ſtand off when thou biddeſt me come, would be at once to undo myſelf, and rebel againſt thee, under the Pretence of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Therefore I bow my Soul to thee, and with all poſſible Thankfulneſs accept thee as mine, and give up myſelf to thee as thine. Thou ſhalt be Sovereign over me, my King, and my God: Thou ſhalt be in the Throne, and all my Powers ſhall bow to thee, they ſhall come and worſhip before thy Feet: Thou ſhalt be my Portion, O Lord, and I will reſt in thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou calleſt for my Heart: O that it were any Way fit for thine Acceptance! I am unworthy, O Lord, everlaſtingly unworthy to be thine: But ſince thou wilt have it ſo, I freely give up my Heart to thee; take it, it is thine: Oh that it were better. But, Lord, I put it into thine Hand, who alone canſt mend it: Mould it after thine own Heart; make it as thou wouldſt have it, holy, humble, heavenly, ſoft, tender, flexible; and write thy Law upon it.</p>

Never was the Hire more due to the Servant, never was the Penny more due to the Labourer, than Death and Hell, my juſt Wages, is due to me for my Sins: But I fly to thy Merits, I truſt alone to the Value and Vertue of thy Sacrifice, and Prevalency of thy Interceſſion: I ſubmit to thy Teaching, I make choice of thy Government.

Lord Jeſus, thy Yoke is eaſy, and thy Croſs is welcome, as it is the Way to thee. I lay aſide all Hopes of worldly Happineſs, I will be content to tarry till I come to thee: Let me be poor and low, little and deſpiſed here, ſo I may be but admitted to live and reign with thee hereafter.

him, perſwade him, till he ſay, Thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, for thou wert ſtronger than I. Lord, didſt thou not make me a Fiſher of Men? And have I toiled all this while, and caught nothing? Alas, that I ſhould have ſpent my Strength for nought! And now I am caſting my laſt; Lord Jeſus, ſtand thou upon the Shore, and direct how and where I ſhall ſpread my Net; and let me ſo incloſe with Arguments the Souls I ſeek for, that that may not be able to get out.</q> Now, Lord, for a Multitude of Souls! Now for a full Draught! O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and ſtrengthen me this once, O God.</p>
               <p>But I turn unto you.</p>
               <p>Men and Brethren, Heaven and Earth doth call upon you; yea, Hell itſelf doth preach the Doctrine of Repentance unto you: the Angels of the Churches travail with you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. the Angels of Heaven wait for you, for your repenting, and turning unto God. O Sinner, why ſhould the Devil make merry with thee? Why ſhould thou be a Morſel for that devouring <hi>Leviathan?</hi> Why ſhould Harpies and Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds tear thee, and make a Feaſt upon thee; and when they have got thee into the Snare, and have laſtned their Talons in thee, laugh at thy Deſtruction, and deride thy Miſery, and ſport themſelves with thy damnable Folly? This muſt be thy Caſe, except thou turn. And were it not better thou ſhouldſt be a Joy to Angels, than a Laughing-ſtock and Sport for Devils? Verily, if thou wouldſt but come in, the heavenly Hoſt would take up their Anthems, and ſing, <hi>Glory be to God in the Higheſt;</hi> the Morning-Stars would ſing together, and all the Sons of God ſhout for Joy, and celebrate this new Creation as they did the firſt. Thy Repentance would, as it were, make Holy-day in Heaven, and the glorious Spirits would rejoice in that there was a new Brother added to their Society, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. another Heir born to their Lord, and the loſt Son received ſafe and ſound.

The true Penitent's Tears, are indeed the Wine that cheareth both God and Man.</p>
               <p>If it be little, that Men and Angels would rejoice at thy Converſion, know that God himſelf would rejoice over thee, even with ſinging, and reſt in his Love, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. Never did <hi>Jacob</hi> with ſuch Joy weep over the Neck of his <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as thy heavenly Father would rejoice over thee, upon thy coming in to him. Look over the Story of the Prodigal; methinks I ſee how the aged Father lays aſide his Eſtate, and forgets his Years. Behold how he runneth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. Oh the Haſte that Mercy makes! the Sinner makes not half that Speed. Methinks I ſee how his Bowels turn, how his Compaſſions yearn. (How quick-ſighted is Love!) Mercy ſpies him a great Way off, forgets his riotous Courſes, unnatural Rebellion, horrid Unthankfulneſs, debauched Practice (not a Word of theſe) but receives him with open Arms, claſps about his Neck, forgets the Naſtineſs of his Rags, kiſſeth the Lips that deſerve to be loathed, the Lips that had been joined to Harlots, that had been Commoners with the Swine; calls for the fatted Calf, the beſt Robe, the Ring, the Shoes, the beſt Chear in Heaven's Store, the beſt Attire in Heaven's Wardrobe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.6, 9, 23. Yea, the Joy cannot be held in one Breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others muſt be called to participate; the Friends muſt meet, and make merry: Angels muſt wait, but the Prodigal muſt be ſet at the Table, under his Father's Wing: He is the Joy of the Feaſt; he is the ſweet Subject of the Father's Delight: The Friends ſympathize, but none knows the Felicity the Father takes in his new-born Son, whom he hath received from the Dead. Methinks I hear the Muſick and the Dancing at a Diſtance. Oh the Melody of the heavenly Choriſters! I cannot learn the Song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. but methinks I over-hear the Burden, at which all the Harmonious Quire with one Conſent ſtrike ſweetly in; for thus goes the Round at Heaven's Table, <hi>For this my Son was dead, and

I need further explain the Parable; God is the Father, Chriſt is the Chear, his Righteouſneſs the Robe, his Graces the Ornaments, Miniſters, Saints, Angels, the Friends and Servants, and thou that readeſt (if thou wilt but unfeignedly repent and turn) the welcome Prodigal, the happy Inſtance of this Grace, and bleſſed Subject of this Joy and Love.</p>

               <p>AND now, my Brethren, let me know your Minds: What do you intend to do? Will you go on and die? or will you ſet upon a thorough and ſpeedy Converſion, and lay hold on Eternal Life?

Is it a diſputable Caſe, whether the <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> be better than all the Streams of <hi>Eden?</hi> or whether the vile puddle of Sin be to be preferred before the Water of Life, clear as Cryſtal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb? Can the World in good earneſt, do that for you, that Chriſt can? Will it ſtand by you to Eternity? Will Pleaſures, Titles, Lands, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, deſcend with you? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 49.17. 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.7. If not, had you not need look after ſomewhat that will?

Shall I leave you at laſt no farther than <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but almoſt perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Why, you are forever loſt, if left here: As good not at all, as not altogether Chriſtians. You are half of the mind to give over your former ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent Life, and to ſet a ſtrict and holy courſe; you could wiſh you were as ſome others be, and could do as they can do: How long will you reſt in idle Wiſhes, and fruitleſs Purpoſes? When will you come to a fixed, full and firm Reſolve? Do not you ſee how Satan gulls you, by tempting you to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays? How long hath he toll'd you on the Way of Perdition? How many Years have you been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to amend? What if God ſhould have taken you off this while?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:004663_0178_100DE0FC896E3EE0"/>Well, put me not off with a dilatory Anſwer: Tell me not of hereafter, I muſt have your preſent Conſent. If you be not now reſolved, while the Lord is treating with you, and wooing of you, much leſs are you like to be hereafter, when theſe Impreſſions are worn out, and you are hardned through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin. Will you give me your Hands? Will you ſet open the Doors, and give the Lord Jeſus the full and preſent Poſſeſſion? Will you put your Names into his Covenant? Will you ſubſcribe? What do you reſolve upon? If you are ſtill upon your Delays, my labour is loſt, and all is like to come to nothing. Fain I would, that you ſhould now put in your adventures: Come caſt in your Lot, make your choice: <hi>Now is the accepted Time, now is the Day of thy Salvation: To Day if you will hear his Voice.</hi> Why ſhould not this be the Day from whence thou ſhouldſt be able to date thine Happineſs? Why ſhouldſt thou venture a day longer in this dangerous and dreadful condition? What if God ſhould this Night require thy Soul? <hi>Oh that thou mighteſt know in this thy day the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto thy peace, before they be hid from thine eyes,</hi> Luke 19.42. This is the day, and it is but the day, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. Others have had their day, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their doom; and now art thou brought upon the ſtage of this World, here to act thy part for the whole Eternity. Remember thou art now upon thy good Behaviour for everlaſting; if thou make not a wiſe Choice now, thou art undone forever. Look what thy preſent choice is, ſuch muſt thine Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition be, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24. and 16.25. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>And is it true indeed? Is Life and Death at thy choice? Yea, it is as true as Truth is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. Why then, what hinders but that thou ſhouldſt be happy? Nothing doth or can hinder, but thine own wilful neglect, or refuſal. It was the paſſage of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip, See, here is Water: What doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me to be baptized?</hi> So I may ſay to thee, See, here

is Chriſt, here is Mercy, Pardon, Life: What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but that thou ſhouldſt be pardoned and ſaved? One of the Martyrs, as he was praying at the ſtake, had his Pardon ſet by in a Box, which indeed he refuſed deſervedly, becauſe upon unworthy terms: But here the terms are moſt honourable and eaſy. O Sinner! wilt thou burn with thy Pardon by thee? Why, do but forthwith give up thy Conſent to Chriſt, to renounce thy Sins, deny thyſelf, take up the Yoke, and the Croſs, and thou carrieſt the Day, Chriſt is thine, Pardon, Peace, Life, Bleſſedneſs, all are thine: And is not this an offer worth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing? Why ſhouldſt thou heſitate, or doubtfully diſpute about the Caſe? Is it not paſt controverſy, whether God be better <hi>than Sin, and Glory better</hi> than Vanity? Why ſhouldſt thou forſake thine own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſin againſt thine own Life? When wilt thou ſhake off thy Sloth, and lay by thine Excuſes? <hi>Boaſt not thyſelf of to Morrow,</hi> thou knoweſt not where this Night may lodge thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1.</p>

Oh, for ſuch a happy Anſwer as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> gave to them, Gen. 24 57, 58. <hi>And they ſaid, We will call the Damſel and enquire at her Mouth.

Why ſhould the paſſionate Pleadings and Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mercy be turned into the horrid Aggravations of your Obſtinacy, and Additions to your Miſery?

               <p>Beloved, if you have any Pity for your periſhing Souls, cloſe with the preſent Offers of Mercy: If you

would not continue and increaſe the Pains of your travailing Miniſters, do not ſtick in the Birth. If the God that made you have any Authority with you, obey his Command and come in. If you are not the Deſpiſers of Grace, and would not ſhut up the Doors of Mercy againſt yourſelves, repent and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let not Heaven ſtand open for you in vain: Let not the Lord Jeſus open his Wares, and bid you buy without Money, and without Price, in vain: Let not his Miniſters, and his Spirit ſtrive with you in vain, and leave you now at laſt unperſuaded, leſt the Sentence go forth againſt you, <hi>The Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the Fire, the Founder melteth in vain. Reprobate Silver ſhall Men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6.29, 30.</p>
               <p>Father of Spirits, take the Heart in Hand that is too hard for my Weakneſs: Do not thou have ended tho' I have done; half a Word from thine effectual Power, will do the Work. O thou that haſt the Key of <hi>David,</hi> that openeſt when no Man ſhutteth: Open thou his Heart, as thou didſt <hi>Lydia</hi>'s and let the King of Glory enter in, and make this Soul thy Captive. Let not the Tempter harden him in Delays: Let him not ſtir from this Place, nor take his Eyes from theſe Lines, till he be reſolved to forgo his Sins, and to accept of Life upon thy ſelf-denying Terms: In thy Name, O Lord God, did I go forth to theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: In thy Name do I ſhut them up: Let not all the Time they have coſt, be but loſt Hours: Let not all the Thoughts of Heart, and all the Pains that hath been about them, be but loſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Lord, put thine Hand into the Heart of this Reader, and ſend thy Spirit, as once thou didſt <hi>Philip,</hi> to join himſelf to the Chariot of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> while he was reading the Word: And tho' I ſhould never know it it while I live, yet I beſeech thee, Lord God, let it be found at the laſt Day, that ſome Souls are converted by theſe Labours: And let ſome be able to ſtand forth, and ſay, That by theſe

I beſeech you, ſtudy Perſonal-God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Family-Godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſonal-Godlineſs. Let it be your firſt Care to ſet up Chriſt in your Hearts: See that you make all your worldly Intereſts to ſtoop to him, that you be intirely and unreſervedly devoted unto him. If you wilfully, and deliberately, and ordinarily harbour any Sin, you are undone, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 68.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20.

Begin with your Hearts, elſe you would build without Foundation.

Let Piety be your firſt and great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: 'Tis the higheſt Point of Juſtice to give God his due. Beware that none of you be a prayerleſs Perſon; for that is a moſt certain Diſcovery of a Chriſtleſs and a Graceleſs Perſon; if one that is a very Stranger to the Fear of God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Job.</hi> 15.4.

               <p>But Piety, without Charity, is but the Half of Chriſtianity, or rather impious Hypocriſy. We may not divide the <hi>Tables:</hi> See therefore that you do juſtly and love Mercy, and let Equity and Charity run like an even Thread, throughout all your Dealings. Be you temperate in all things, and let Chaſtity and Sobriety be your undivided Companions. Let Truth and Purity, Seriouſneſs and Modeſty, Heavineſs and Gravity, be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Ornaments of your Speech. Let Patience and Humility, Simplicity and Sincerity ſhine out in all the Parts of your Converſations. See that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and forgive Wrongs, and requite them with Kindneſs, as you would be found the Children of the Moſt High. Be merciful in your Cenſures, and put the moſt favourable Conſtruction upon your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's Carriage, that their Actions will reaſonably bear. Be ſlow in promiſing, punctual in fulfilling. Let Meekneſs and Innocency, Affableneſs, Yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs and Courteſie commend your Converſations to all Men. Let none of your Reflections want that Love and Loyalty, that Reverence and Duty, that Tenderneſs, Care and Vigilancy, which their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Capacities call for. This is throughout Godlineſs. I charge you before the Moſt High God, that none of you be found a Swearer or a Lyat, or a lover of evil Company, or a Scoffer, or Malicious, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or a Drunkard, or a Glutton, unrighteous in Dealing, unclean in his Living, or a Quarreller, or a Thief, or a Backbiter, or a Railer: For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce unto you, from the Living God, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Damnation is the End of all ſuch, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21.</p>

Let every Family with you be a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. every Houſe a Houſe of Prayer: Let every Houſholder ſay, with <hi>Joſhua, I and my Houſe will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15. and reſolve with <hi>David, I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect Heart,</hi> Pſal. 101.2. Let me preſs upon you a few Duties in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let Religion be in your Families, not as a Matter by the by (to be minded at Leiſure, when the World will give you leave) but the ſtanding Buſineſs of the Houſe: Let them have your Prayers as your Meals: Is there any of your Families but have time for their taking Food? Wretched Man! Canſt thou find Time to eat in, and not find Time to pray in?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Settle it upon your Hearts, that your Souls are bound up in the Souls of your Families. They are committed unto you, and if they be loſt through your Neglect, will be required at your Hands. Sirs, if you do not, you ſhall know, that the Charge of Souls is a heavy Charge, and that the Blood of Souls is a heavy Guilt. O Man! haſt thou a Charge of Souls to anſwer for, and doſt thou not beſtir thy ſelf for them, that their Blood be not found in thy Skirts? Wilt thou do no more for immortal Souls, than thou wilt do for thy Beaſts that periſh? What doſt thou do for thy Children and Servants? Thou provideſt Meat and Drink for them, agreeable to their Natures; and doſt thou not the ſame for thy Beaſt? Thou giveſt them Medicines, and cheriſheſt them when they be ſick: And doſt thou not as much for thy Swine? More particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let the ſolemn Reading of the Word and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms, be your Family-Exerciſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.15. See Chriſt ſinging with his Family, <hi>viz.</hi> His Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6 18.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:004663_0189_100DE1174B30DE40"/>2. Let every Perſon in your Families be duly called to an Account of their profiting by the Word heard or read, as they be about doing your own Buſineſs: This is a Duty of Conſcience unſpeakable, and would be a Means to bring thoſe under your Charge, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and profit by what you receive. See Chriſt's Example in calling his Family to an Account, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.11, 13, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Often take an Account of the Souls under your Care, concerning their Spiritual Eſtates; (herein you muſt be Followers of Chriſt, <hi>Matth,</hi> 13.10, 36, 51. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.10, 11.) make Inquiry into their Conditions, inſiſt much upon the Sinfulneſs and Miſery of their natural Eſtate, and upon the Neceſſity of Regeneration and Converſion, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Salvation. Admoniſh them gravely of their Sins, encourage their Beginnings. Follow them earneſtly, and let them have no quiet for you, till you ſee them in a ſaving Change. This is a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of high Conſequence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected. Doth not Conſcience ſay, Thou art the Man?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look to the ſtrict Sanctifying of the Sabbath by all your Houſhold, <hi>Exod</hi> 20.19. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.3. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Families have little Time elſe. O improve but your Sabbath Days as diligently in labouring for Knowledge, and doing your Maſter's Work, as you do the other Days in doing your own, and I doubt not but you may come to ſome Proficiency.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let the Morning and Evening-ſacrifice of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer, be daily offered up in all your Families, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1, 2 <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.9, 10.

Family-Prayer? <hi>Eph</hi> 6.18. Say not, I have no Time What, haſt thou all thy Time, on purpoſe to ſerve God, and ſave thy Soul? and yet is this it for which thou canſt find no Time? Find but a Heart, and I will find Time. Pinch out of your Meals and Sleep, rather than want for Prayer. Say not, my Buſineſs will not give Leave. This is the greateſt Buſineſs to ſave thyſelf, and the Souls committed to thee. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, a Whet will be no Let. In a Word, the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all is to be got by Prayer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11, 12. 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 7 29. And what is thy Buſineſs without God's Bleſſing? Say not, I am not able: Uſe the one Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and God will increaſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Helps are to be had, till thou art better able. But if there be no other Remedy, thou muſt join with thine abler Neighbour, GOD, hath ſpecial Regard to joint Prayer, <hi>James</hi> 5.4. to 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5, 10, 12. 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1.11. and therefore you muſt improve Family-Advantages for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Put every one in your Familes upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayer. Obſerve whether they do perform it. Get them the Help of a Form, if they need it, till they are able to go without it. Direct them how to pray, by minding them of their Sins, Wants and Mercies, the Materials of Prayer. This was the Practice of <hi>John,</hi> and of Jeſus, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Set up Catechiſing in your Families, at the leaſt once every Week. Have you no dread of the Almighty's Charge, that you ſhould <q>teach theſe Things diligently to your Children, and talk of them as you ſit in your Houſes.</q>

put in for a Share, neither in Praiſe, nor the Promiſe? Hath Chriſt honoured Catechiſing with his Preſence, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46. and will you not own it with your Practice? Say not, they are careleſs, and will not learn: What have you your Authority for, if not to uſe it for God, and the good of their Souls? You will call them up, and force them to do your Work; and ſhould not you at leaſt be as zealous in putting them upon God's Work? Say not, they are dull, and are not capable: If they be dull, God requires of you the more Pains and Patience; but ſo dull as they are, you will make them learn how to Work; and can they not learn as well how to live? Are they capable of the Myſteries of your Trade, and are they not capable of the plain Principles of Religion? Well, if ever you would ſee the Growth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Cure of Ignorance, the Remedy of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, the Downfall of Error, fulfil you my Joy in going thorough with this Duty.</p>
               <p>Will you anſwer the Calls of divine Providence? Would you remove the incumbent, or prevent the impending Calamities? Would you plant Nurſeries for the Church of God? Would you that God ſhould build your Houſes, and bleſs your Subſtance? Would you that your Children ſhould bleſs you? O then ſet up Piety in your Families, as ever you would be bleſſed, or be a Bleſſing: Let your Hearts and your Houſes be the Temples of the living God, in which his Worſhip (according to all the ſaid mentioned Directions) may be with Conſtancy reverendly performed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his Heart, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> Oh! be wiſe in Time, that you be not miſerable to Eternity.</p>

Heartily to love them that ſlight you, and to wiſh and ſeek the good of thoſe that hate you, and ſeek to hurt you: This is the very thing urged in the Text. <hi>If you ſalute your Brethren, only, and love them that love you, do not even the</hi> Publicans <hi>the ſame?</hi> Matth. 5.46, 47. To love them that do reſpect and value us, this every one can do; but to love them truly that think meanly of us, and have Prejudices and hard Thoughts againſt us, and to ſpeak well of them that ſpeak Evil of us, (as the ſweet-ſpirited <hi>Calvin</hi>) Let <hi>Luther</hi> call me Dog or Devil, I will ſay of him nevertheleſs, he is a precious Servant of Chriſt Jeſus. This is to do more than others. Thus the Martyr <hi>Cranmer,</hi> of whom it was a Proverb (Do the Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> a Diſpleaſure, and you ſhall ever have him your Friend.) Thus that Holy Man, in his much to be admired parting Words, (I had never any greater Pleaſure in all my Life than to forget and forgive Injuries, and to ſhew Kindneſs to them that ſought Evil to me.) Study who have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and diſobliged you, and ſlighted you, and keep up good Thoughts of them (if the Caſe will bear it) and ſpeak nothing but good of them, and think what Kindneſs you may ſhew them: <hi>Pray for them, wiſh well to them, ſo ſhall ye be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.45.</p>

But to be ſingular in your good Choice and Reſolutions, with <hi>Joſhua;</hi> though all ſhould vote againſt you with one Conſent; and with <hi>Noah</hi> to be perfect in our Generation, when never ſo adulterous, and to walk with God when all Fleſh have corrupted their Way, and tread a contrary Courſe, this is to do more than others. Thus the three Children, or rather the three Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (who would not fear the Flouts of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor the Frowns of the great Ones, nor the Charge of Singularity, but when all the Princes, Governours, Captains, Counſellors, Sheriffs, and all the People, Nations and Languages fell down and worſhipped, they ſtood by themſelves, and would not ſinfully comply, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.3, 7, 18.</p>

                     <hi>Rule</hi> III. To take moſt care of that which is moſt out of Sight. A Chriſtian's Eye is moſt on the Things leaſt ſeen; firſt upon his Heart, herein he doth exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Phariſees, whoſe great Care was to keep all fair and clean that came to view, but looked no farther: Make great Conſcience of your Carriage in ſecret, and let your main Guard be upon your Hearts, and this will be more than others reach to. This was <hi>Paul's</hi> Care, to keep his Conſcience, his Inſide, clean and undefiled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. and <hi>Job's</hi> Care, that tho' all the World did reproach him, he might not put a Reproach in the Mouth of his Conſcience, <hi>Job</hi> 27.6. and <hi>David's</hi> Care that his Heart might be clean. 2. <hi>Upon his Hope.</hi> Others look to the Things <hi>ſeen,</hi> Things in Hand; but the true Believer eyes his <hi>Hopes,</hi> walks by <hi>Faith,</hi> not by <hi>Sight,</hi> and lives a quite different Life from many others in the World beſides; as living upon the Hope of Heaven doth differ from living on the Pleaſures, Profits and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the World.</p>

                     <hi>Rule</hi> IV. To be merciful to others Failings, and very ſevere to our own. The noble Roman <hi>Cato,</hi> could more eaſily forgive any than himſelf To aggravate our <hi>own Evils,</hi> and to have an Excuſe ready for our Brothers, and to cenſure ourſelves freely, and to come with the Mantle behind us to cover our Brother; this is to do more than others. The Hypocrite is a Cenſurer abroad; he is like the Eye that can ſee any thing but itſelf: He can diſcern a Mote in his Brother's Eye, but not a Beam in his own. But the Servant of God rebukes others with Meekneſs, but falls out eaſily and bitterly with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> V. <hi>To ſuffer rather than to ſin.</hi> This was <hi>Moſes's</hi> choice, but the Hypocrite is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: He chooſeth Iniquity rather than Affliction. To go ſo far with Chriſt as our Way lies together, is to do no more than an unſound Profeſſor may reach to: The Trial is when Chriſt's Intereſt and ours do croſs, and we muſt either baulk our Duty, or our Safety and Advantage. The famous Martyr under <hi>Julian,</hi> would not give one Half-penny to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Building of the Idol's Temple, tho' he was offered his Life by the Emperor on thoſe Terms: The godly high Prieſt <hi>Eleazer,</hi> when the Nobles perſuaded him to eat other Meat under Colour of Swine's Fleſh, and they would perſuade the King <hi>Antiochus</hi> that he had eaten Swine's Fleſh, would die rather than ſtain his Profeſſion with the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil. When a Man ſhall lie in outward Miſery, and have a Door of Deliverance opened, if he would but ſin, and yet he will not accept of it, as thoſe Worthies in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Martyrology: This is to do more than others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004663_0196_100DE1B2D9E40D40"/>
that we are <hi>counted worthy to ſuffer</hi> Shame for the Name of Chriſt; this is to do more than others. When the Servants of God ſhall not only <hi>patiently and triumphantly</hi> undergo the Croſſes that crack the Brains, and break the Hearts of others, and ſhall ſhake off the Viper without receiving any hurt, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſhall ſing in the Stocks, and the reſolved Martyr ſhall embrace the Faggots, and kiſs the Stake: When the valiant <hi>Philpot</hi> ſhall ſay of his Priſon (In the Judgment of the World we are in Hell, but I find in it the ſweet Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Heaven) and the Holy <hi>Bradford</hi> (My Priſon is ſweeter to me than any Parlour, than any Pleaſure I have had in all my Life.)

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004663_0199_100DE1BB70893390"/>Q. <hi>How may we know whether we be, and do more than others that are unſound?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall anſwer this Queſtion by propounding eight Queſtions to you, beſeeching you to retire to the moſt ſolemn and ſtrict Examination, and make Conſcience to give a clear Anſwer to theſe few Interrogatories, and that will reſolve the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. I. <hi>When others do pick and chooſe, have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all God's Commandments?</hi> The Hypocrite may have great reſpect to the Comforts, but he hath little to the Commands of Religion: He is much for the Privilege and Promiſes: little for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Duties: He is partial in the Law; he will take but here and there where he likes, and where God's Commands will ſerve his Intereſt, or at leaſt will not pinch too hard upon the Fleſh. The ſound Chriſtian ſets all God's Commands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; he eyes all his Copy; and heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and ſtudies a throughout Conformity: He hath no ſtarting Holes, no contrived Haunts; nor doth he halt between the Lord and <hi>Baal,</hi> nor ſerve two Maſters: He doth not fear the Lord, and ſerve other Gods, nor divides his Service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Mammon, but he is all for Uniformity and entirely devoted to God's Service, and Fear alone; he hath a good Conſcience willing in all Things to live honeſtly, and doth truly, though not perfectly forſake all his Sins, and keep all his Statutes that are known to him. Let me therefore ask you two Queſtions: (1. When others divide the Tables, do you ſweetly conjoin them in your Practice? The Hypocrite, may be, is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſquare</hi> towards Men, but follow him to his Family or Cloſet, you ſhall find but little of God: His Family is neglected, his Soul is neglected; or it may be he is a forward Firſt-Table-Man, but you ſhall find him tardy in the Second. He will make many Prayers and long Prayers, yet make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of devouring Widows Houſes. He is a great
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004663_0200_100DE1BD45890DA0"/>
Pretender to Piety, but mean while neglects Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Mercy. The Sincere join all together. He is ſo far careful of Juſtice with Men, that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while he will not neglect the firſt and great Part of <hi>Juſtice, viz</hi> To give God his Due: He doth juſtly, he loves Mercy, but withal walks humbly with God: He walketh ſoberly with reſpect to himſelf, righteouſly towards his Neighbour, and godly towards his Maker. He is not one of thoſe that are good only on their Knees, but you ſhall find him every where conſcientious: You ſhall have Temperance at his Table, Chaſtity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in his Behaviour, Grace and Truth in his Works, Charity in his Deeds, Faithfulneſs in his Truſt, Juſtice in his Dealings. He doth not only ſeem to be religious, but bridleth his Tongue; He is not only <hi>a good Chriſtian, but a good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> not only <hi>a good Man, but a good Husband, a good Maſter, a dutiful Child, a diligent and faithful Servant, a good Subject:</hi> In a Word, he makes a great Conſcience of diſcharging the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Relations among Men. (2) When others ſtick in <hi>Externals,</hi> do you look to the ſpiritual Part of every Command, and principally mind the Inwards and Virals of Religion? Do you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make Conſcience of performing Duties, but do you carefully look to the <hi>Manner</hi> of performing of them, and the Ends for which we do perform them? Do you not only make Conſcience of open, but of ſecret Sins? Do you abound above all in ſecret Duties? Do you keep a Watch upon your Hearts, and make Conſcience, not only of the groſs Acts of Sin, but even of ſinful Thoughts, Inclinations and Deſires; and are grieved even with your very Infirmities, and the corrupt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of your Natures, which you cannot help, tho' you would?</p>
                  <p>Q. II. <hi>When others have their Reſerves in Cloſing with Chriſt, do you give up all to him entirely?</hi> Have you taken Chriſt not Hand over Head, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately,

underſtandingly, ſitting down firſt, and counting the Coſt? Have you not ſecret Reſerves for your own Eaſe, Safety, Eſtates, Eſteem, on ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sin? Have you, upon ſolemn Conſideration, accepted Chriſt as the Lord your Righteouſneſs, for better, for worſe, for all Changes of Times and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to run all Hazards with him, and to take your Lot with him, fall as it will?</p>

Muſt not God ſtand by, while the World is firſt ſerved: And are not your Souls the leaſt of your Cares? And put off with ſome <hi>by Scraps</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of your time? Is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion your Trade, and your Converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Do you <hi>walk with God?</hi> Or have you only now and then a Turn with him? When you have ended your Prayers, is there an End of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion till you come to them again? Or do you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a Deſign of Religion throughout your whole Courſe? Have you only a Liſt of Religion at the out-ſide of the Piece? Or is the Woof of Religion woven into the whole Cloth, into Heart and Life, into your Diſcourſe, and Trades, and Table? Do you firſt ſeek the <hi>Kingdom of God, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof?</hi> Is it the chief Care of your Lives, that God be ſerved, and your Souls be ſaved? And is this the one Thing neceſſary with you, that you chiefly mind, and are moſt ſolicitous about? Do your very Hearts ſay with <hi>David, One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that I will ſeek after,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Q. VI. <hi>When are others are for the Wages of Religion, are you for the Work?</hi> Can you ſay with <hi>David, I have choſen thy Precepts?</hi> Do your Hearts come off freely in this Choice? Had you rather be Holy than otherwiſe, if you were at your Choice? Had you rather be God's Servants, and live at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, than at your own Luſts? Do you count the Laws of Chriſt your Heritage, or rather do you no
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004663_0202_100DE1C322B38798"/>
count them your Bondage? Do you chooſe not only the <hi>Wages</hi> of Righteouſneſs, but the <hi>Ways</hi> of Righteouſneſs? Are God's Commandments your <hi>Delight?</hi> And are the <hi>ſweeteſt Hours</hi> of your Lives the Hours ye ſpend with him? Do you never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy yourſelves ſo much as when you moſt enjoy God? Is his Service the greateſt Comfort, and is it Meat and Drink to you to do his Will, unleſs when you are not yourſelves in the time of Temptation and Deſertion? Do you make Uſe of holy Duties only as Men do of Phyſick, when they are ill at Eaſe, when Conſcience laſheth, or Affliction ſtings, as it were, to conjure down the frightful Furies? Or to pacify God, that he may not hurt you? Or elſe do you uſe them as your daily Bread, and the very Staff of your Life, and Means of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?</p>
                  <p>Q. V. <hi>When others are for the cheap and eaſy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are you for Self-Denial?</hi> When others are for the Religion that will ſerve them beſt, are you for that which will ſerve God beſt? When others are all upon the ſparing Hand, and will ſpare what may be ſpared, and ſtudy how they may beſt ſave Charges in going to Heaven, are you of princely Spirits, to reſolve not to ſerve the Lord with that which will coſt you nothing? Is your Courſe of Religion ſuch as doth put your Fleſh to it, and croſs and curb its Deſires, or do you love to give it what it craves, and ſuffer it to make its own Way? Have you no Enemy you dread ſo much as Self? Do you pamper and pleaſe it and make Proviſions for it? or do you pray and watch againſt it, and grieve for its unhappy Infirmities in your Actions? And had rather than all the World that this Enemy were under your Feet?</p>
                  <p>Q. VI. <hi>When others are for no more of Religion than needs muſt, are you for the Height of Religion?</hi> The Hypocrite (as one well) is very inquiſitive what is the loweſt Pitch that a Man may have and go to Heaven; and upon this Deſign, if he could
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004663_0203_100DE1C5B6FC3F88"/>
find but this, he would look no farther: But the ſincere Chriſtian, though ſatisfied that his State is ſafe, will reſt in no Attainments in Grace, but reaches forward and preſſes on, if it were poſſible, to attain to the Reſurrection of the Dead. He that doth not <hi>deſire, and deſign, and endeavour Perfection, never yet came up to Sincerity.</hi> A true Believer deſires <hi>Holineſs for Holineſs</hi> ſake, and therefore is ſet upon <hi>perfecting Holineſs:</hi> Others deſire it only for Heaven ſake, and therefore only for ſo much as will bear their Charges thither; others make uſe of Holineſs only as a Bridge to Heaven, and therefore are for no more than will juſt ſerve their turn. <note n="*" place="margin">And they have a falſe Notion of Heaven itſelf, elſe they might juſtly deſire it as the End of their preſent Holineſs, it being the Fruition of God in perfect Holineſs.</note> The true Believer hath a holy Nature, and therefore Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is his Element; and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Employment; and he muſt needs deſire Holineſs in its Height becauſe every Nature reaches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perfection in its Kind; the godly Man deſires not Holineſs, becauſe it is the Way to Heaven, but he he loves Heaven the better for the holy Way that leads to it, and for the perfect Holineſs which is there.</p>
                  <p>Q. VII. <hi>When others are all for the Salvation of Chriſt, are you as truly by Sanctification for Chriſt?</hi> Do you take Chriſt as God offers him, with all his Offices and Benefits, to be both a Prince and a Saviour, to give you Repentance as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins? Are you willing of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, as well as Deliverance by Chriſt? Do you cloſe with his Burden, as well as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits? Do you count his Laws your Liberty? His Government not your Bondage, but your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege? His Service your Freedom? Do you go in Chriſt's Ways, as in Goals and Fetters? Or do you run with Enlargement of Heart, Delight, or real Willingneſs?</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004663_0204_100DE1C73B17BF20"/>Q. VIII. <hi>When others do make Self their Ends do you ſet up God above all, as your higheſt End?</hi> The Hypocrite doth the ſame Duties with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with different Ends; He eats for himſelf, and faſts for himſelf, and prays with no better than Self-Ends, and therefore is rejected. Now is it your great Deſign in your whole Courſe to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God, and enjoy God: Do you count this your whole Buſineſs and Bleſſedneſs? Do you make other Buſineſs to ſtoop to this? Other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to yield to this? Do your Souls breath after this above all worldly Good, that Chriſt may be magnified in you?

Thou canſt not have Peace with God, nor he Pleaſure in thee, till this be removed; put off therefore the old Man with his Deeds.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The red Robe of his Righteouſneſs for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> The Lord will never give thee a good Look, nor a good Word but in Chriſt: He is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging, a conſuming Fire out of Chriſt, but get on his Robes, and he will be well pleaſed. <hi>Enoch</hi> had his Teſtimony that he pleaſed God; but Chriſt had much more, that God was well pleaſed with Sinners, in and for him. Away with theſe Rags, and with theſe Fig-leaves. How can the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul of God but abhor you, whilſt in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Cloths of your own Righteouſneſs? Dare not to come to God, but with Chriſt in your Arms. Approach him not but in the Garments of your elder Brother, leſt you carry away the Curſe. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>'s filthy Garments muſt be put off, and Chriſt's Raiment put on; or elſe there is no ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bright and burning Eyes of infinite Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Put on the Lord Jeſus in Believing; that is, accept of him in all his Offices, with all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, and deliver up thyſelf to him, and this will intitle thee to his Merit and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: Without this, nothing will avail.

to the Roots with Praying, if thou ſhouldſt weep an Ocean, and waſh thyſelf in thine own Brine; all could not get out one Spot; nothing can be accepted, while thou art out of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt Place apply thyſelf to him. God will accept of no Gift but off his Altar.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The white Robe of his Grace of Sanctification,</hi> Rev. 5.11. Thou that art in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that is, unrenewed, unſanctified, <hi>canſt not pleaſe GOD,</hi> Rom. 8.8. Never think to <hi>make</hi> up the Matter by a little <hi>mending and reforming</hi> particular Acts: Man, thy <hi>Heart</hi> muſt be <hi>renewed,</hi> thy State muſt be clean <hi>altered,</hi> or God cannot be pleaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17, 18. The Tree muſt be made good, the Fountain muſt be healed, or elſe the Stream will be ſalt, and the Fruit ſowre. If Chriſt be once formed in thee, that is, his Image in his Grace: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Ground of Love: Similitude and Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Nature is the Lead-ſtone of Affection. God cannot but love his own Likeneſs: Wouldſt thou have his Favour? Wouldſt thou be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? then conform to his Pleaſure, ſtudy to be like him, purify thyſelf as he is pure. The righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs; he deſireth Truth in the inward Parts, and takes infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in the Graces of his People. Theſe are the Spikenard and Saffron, the Spices, the Beds of Lillies; the ſweet Ointment that Chriſt is ſo taken up with: Theſe are the Cinnamon and the Trees of Frankincenſe; the Calamus and Camphire, the Myrrhe and the Aloes; the Chains of the Neck, and the precious Pearls, that he is ſo raviſhed withal, and doth ſo ſuperlatively commend, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9.

let me commend to you ſome ſpecial Graces which God doth manifeſt himſelf to be wonderfully plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withal. As ever you would pleaſe God, get on theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Be clothed with Humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is a Garment which muſt be put on, or elſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accepted or ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. Here is the Dreſs that you muſt come to God in: He muſt be <hi>ſerv'd in humility of Mind,</hi> Acts 20.14. You muſt humble yourſelves to walk with him, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. Humility is a plain, but yet a comely Garment: This Grace doth eminently honour God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth put a peculiar honour upon, and manifeſt a moſt ſpecial Delight in this: Of all the Men in the World, this is the Man that God will look unto; even he that is pure, and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit, that trembleth at his Word, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66.2. Though he be the high and lofty One, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is holy: From whence the trembling Soul is ready to conclude, that ſurely ſuch a fearful Majeſty cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him; ſuch ſin-hating Purity cannot but abhor him; yet he will lay, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 47.15, aſide his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and bear with Man's impurity, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to moſt familiar and conſtant Communion and Cohabitation with his poor Duſt, when contrite at his Feet, and proſtrate in Humility: If thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be accepted of God, come as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a Rope about thy Neck, and Aſhes on thy Head, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.32. think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on thy ſelf, and God will honour thee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. Put thy ſelf in the loweſt Rooms, and God will ſet thee higher: Be little in thine own Eyes, and thou ſhalt be high in his: A proud Heart and a proud Look is with God the firſt-born of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: As ever thou wouldſt have God well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thee, be throughly diſpleaſed with thyſelf. If thou doſt throughly loath thy ſelf, God doth love thee, if thou abhorreſt thyſelf, God delighteth in thee: Be angry with thy ſelf, and the Almighty
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004663_0209_100DE1D3BA2CAB70"/>
will turn away his Anger from thee: Condemn thyſelf, and God will acquit thee. In no wiſe extenuate thy Sins, nor juſtify thyſelf. Think the worſe of thyſelf and be willing that others ſhould think meanly of thee, and heartily love them that ſlight thee. This is the Frame in which God is well pleaſed: Paſs Sentence on thyſelf, and God will abſolve thee: Set thyſelf at his Foot-ſtool, and he will lift thee up into the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Labour for ſincerity.</hi> This is not a diſtinct Grace from the reſt, yet for Doctrine-ſake I ſpeak to it diſtinctly. Uprightneſs is the great thing that God looks after, and covenants for, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. It renders all our Perſons and Performances accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. Such as are upright in the Way, are God's delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11 20. To theſe are all the Promiſes of Peace, Salvation, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Preſervation, Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.10. In a Word, there is <hi>no good thing God will withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Prov. 28.10. This was <hi>Noah</hi>'s Praiſe that he was upright <hi>in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This was that which ſet off <hi>Job</hi> at ſuch a Rate, that God doth ſo extol him for, and as it were, makes his Boaſt of him: The ſingular ſincerity and integrity of his Heart. Study to be upright: that the main bent of your Hearts be to pleaſe God, and honour him; that God's intereſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt with you; that he hath the chief Share in you, and the Eye of the Soul be principally to him; for in this ſincerity doth conſiſt, as to your State. Let your great care be your Heart; here is a Chriſtian's great Work. The Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth, for Man looketh on the outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but the Lord looketh to the Heart; ſee therefore that thou look to it. Let thine Eye be chiefly there where God's Eye is. He looketh not ſo much what thou doſt, as with what a Heart go then and do likewiſe. Yet be not ſatisfied in this, that you are upright as to your State, but labour to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004663_0210_100DE1D627A2E190"/>
approve yourſelves in Uprightneſs to God in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Actions. Do common, as well as ſpiritual Actions, with holy Ends. Much of our Lives are loſt for want of this. So much is done for God; of his ſtrange Grace, he accounts himſelf our Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro. But what is done for no higher End than Self, is loſt from our Account.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Put on a Spirit of Zeal and Activity.</hi> How wonderfully is God pleaſed with <hi>Phineas</hi>'s Zeal <hi>Numb</hi> 15 11, 12, 13, What great Approbation doth he manifeſt of him? What Atteſtation doth he give to him? He is ſo greatly pleaſed with his zealous Appearance for him, that he turns away his Diſpleaſure from the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and overlooks their Crimſon Provocations againſt him: On the contrary, there is nothing that God is more diſpleaſed with, than the remiſſneſs, and lifeleſſneſs, and indifference in Religion. The Luke-warm Water is not a greater Offence to the Stomach, than the Luke-warm Profeſſor is to God: And therefore he will Spew ſuch a one out of his Mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. Chriſtians, where is your Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts? Chriſt's redeemed muſt be zealous of good Works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. not ſlothful in Buſineſs, but fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.6.7. inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Night and Day for the hope of the Promiſe. Do not only that which is right in the ſight of the Lord, but do it with all your Heart; the Lord loveth a willing Servant: Beſtir yourſelves for the Lord. Be ye followers of Chriſt, who went up and down doing good. Every Chriſtian ſhould be a common Bleſſing, a publick Good. This is to be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, who is good unto all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works. And be ſure the Father doth beſt love that Child that is moſt like him. A private narrow Spirit is a low and a baſe Spirit, unworthy of a Chriſtian. A Catholick communicative Spirit is full of great Deſires, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004663_0211_100DE1D9708CE8C8"/>
great Deſigns: A large Heart ſet upon doing good, whoſe Fire, though ever hotteſt within, will be breaking forth of his Breaſt and provoking others; whoſe Love will not be confined to a Party, but gladly and thankfully owneth Chriſt wherever he ſees him: This Catholick Spirit, I ſay, is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Religion, the Church's Bleſſing, and God's Delight.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Live by Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.38. This is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grace in God's Account, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1, 1. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.7. It giveth Glory to God, and therefore God taketh no ſmall pleaſure in it. By Faith <hi>Enoch</hi> obtains that Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.39. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10.11. If you would ſo walk as to pleaſe God, you muſt walk by Faith. Chriſtians muſt look to the things unſeen; they muſt not live at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rate. Chriſt muſt be their Life and Breath, their Prayers and their Promiſes, their daily Bread. By Faith did the Elders obtain that good Report; 'twas Faith that Chriſt was ſo greatly taken with in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> which made him to commend him for a <hi>none ſuch.</hi> This was that which won ſuch a ſingular Praiſe and Approbation from our Saviour to the Woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> even her Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. Thou haſt taken away my Heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt taken away my Heart with one of thine Eyes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. that is, with thy Faith. Live in the Power of Faith, and thou wilt pleaſe him to the Heart, give Glory to him by believing. Let the Life that thou now liveſt in the Fleſh, be by the Faith of the Son of God: Faith, as one well ſays, is the Navel of Morality.</p>
                  <p>Live by Faith in <hi>Proſperity:</hi> Tho' thou haſt the World about thee, let it not be above thee, keep it at thy Feet, uſe it as thy Servant: Be much in the views of Glory and Contemplation of Eternity: Buy as tho' thou poſſeſſeſt not, rejoice as tho' thou rejoiceſt not, love as tho' thou loveſt not, uſe this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004663_0212_100DE1DAF5C778A8"/>
World as not abuſing it. It is but a Faſhion, not a Subſtance, and that which paſſeth away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30, 31. Uſe it therefore with mortified Affections, and prove the Sincerity of your Faith by the Victory over your inordinate Content and Delight in, and Deſires after, and Cares for, the Things of this World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p>Live by Faith in <hi>Adverſity:</hi> Weep as tho' thou wept not, enduring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the Shame, as looking unto Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. accounting Chriſt's Reproaches your Riches, his Shame your Glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. Compare theſe light Afflictions with the weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. Ply your Hearts with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; count if you can get the Riches that are laid up in them; roll yourſelves upon the Lord, <hi>Pſalms</hi> 37.1. and know that your Heavenly Father hath no greater Delight, than to ſee his Children truſt him with Confidence, when all viſible Helps are out of ſight, and he ſeems to be their Enemy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.15.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Put on the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit;</hi> this is in the ſight of God of great Price: Study to be (1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.3.) like your Father, ſlow to Anger, ready to forgive, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130.1, 8. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Injuries, loving Enemies, requiting Ill-will with Kindneſs, Ill words with Courteſies, Neglects with Benefits; and if any wrong you, do him Kindneſs the ſooner; ſo ſhall you bear his Likeneſs, and be his Delight: And know ye that are of unmortified Paſſions, and unbridled Tongues, God hath an eſpecial hatred and diſpleaſure againſt a <hi>Froward Heart,</hi> and a Froward Tongue, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.32.1.20.1.12.8.12. Oh ſeek Meekneſs: How can the Holy Dove reſt in a wrathful Heart? Chriſt is a Lamb of Meekneſs, how can he take Pleaſure in an unquiet and contentious Spirit! Verily, with the Froward, he will ſhew himſelf froward, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.26. If you will nor forgive others, he will not forgive you. Art thou hard to be pleaſed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004663_0213_100DE1DC89C62AB0"/>
a froward Wife, a froward Maſter, a croſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant? Surely God will not be pleaſed with thee; he will mete to you as you Meaſure to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>Get a Spirit of Self denial.</hi> God is then pleaſed beſt, when Self is diſpleaſed moſt. When we can be content to be empty, content to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that God might be honoured, and with the Holy <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> are willing to be eclipſed by Chriſt: willing to decreaſe that he may encreaſe; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves no Loſers, whilſt his Intereſt is a Gainer, <hi>John</hi> 3.29, 30. rejoicing that we are made low for Chriſt's Advancement; this is well-pleaſing unto God; how greatly was he pleaſed with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's</hi> Self-denying Choice, and gives him his Asking, throwing in Riches, and Honour into the Bargain? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. Strange was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Self-denial. What? to ſacrifice with his own Hand, the whole Hope of his Family? the Heir of Promiſe! the Child of his Years! a Son! and only Son! wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God gives him a Teſtimony from Heaven, bleſſes him, bleſſes his Seed, bleſſes all Nations in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.15, 16, 17, 18. Wonderful was <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Self denial,</hi> but more wonderful was his Acceptation and Reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. None like <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 34.20 God preferreth him in another manner than <hi>Pharoah</hi> could. He muſt ſpeak with him Face to Face, as a Man with his Friend; his Word ſhall be as it were a Law with God. Speak for whom he will, they ſhall be ſpared, though they ſeem to be devoted to Deſtruction. But ſpeak againſt him who duiſt, he ſhall be ſure to bear his Iniquity, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.8. Forget Self: Renounce thine own Wiſdom, thine own Worthineſs, thine own Will: Bite in thy Paſſions, curb thine Appetite; bridle thy Tongue: This do, and thou ſhalt be gently accepted, and ſhall find that God's Favour will infinitely reward
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004663_0214_100DE1E07745DB48"/>
thee, for all the murmuring Oppoſitions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of thy Fleſh, which will be ready to be impatient to have the Reins held ſo hard.</p>
                  <p>VII. <hi>Maintain a Spirit of Reſolution and Conſtancy in the Ways of God,</hi> Heb. 10.38. This was the Renown of the three Worthies, <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. They feared not the Fierceneſs of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Rage, nor yet the Fire of the Furnace: All the World could not make them bow; and how gloriouſly did God own them, and miraculouſly evidence his Pleaſure in them: Stand your Ground. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to live and die by ſubſtantial Godlineſs. Cleave to the Lord with full Purpoſe of Heart. Let no Difficulties make you change your Station: Then ſhall you be an Honour and a Pleaſure to the God that made you. Well then, would you know what Frame of Heart is pleaſing to God? Why, this <hi>Humble, Sincere, Zealous Active Frame, this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, Meek, Self-denying, reſolved Frame,</hi> this is the Frame that is well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As to your Performances,</hi> more briefly that thoſe may pleaſe God, you muſt heedfully look to theſe five things.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Regard there is none that doth good and ſinneth not, and God is not, not can be pleaſed with Sin, no not in his own People, but moſt of all hates it in them, it cannot be that any Man in this Life ſhould fully come up to Chriſt's Example in this; yet may we come on ſo far towards it as that not only in our immediate Addreſſes to God, but in the general courſe of our Lives, we may come to pleaſe God. <hi>Thus</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God, i. e.</hi> in their general Courſe they walked ſo as to pleaſe God, and approve themſelves in his Sight: Thus the meaneſt of Actions, if done by us unto the Lord as the Servants of Chriſt, have a Promiſe of Acceptance and Reward, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22.23.24.</p>
               <p>Q. II <hi>How may we come in our Meaſure to be followers of Chriſt, in this, to do always thoſe things that pleaſe God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In order to this, there is ſomething ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,

with reference, 1. <hi>To our Perſons.</hi> 2. <hi>To our Principles.</hi> 3. <hi>To our Practices.</hi> 1. <hi>With Reference to our Perſons.</hi> And here it is neceſſary, 1. That there be an Alteration of our Natures by renewing Grace, for they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>wild Vines</hi> muſt needs bring forth ſower Grapes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. The Fruit that they bear (how ſpecious and fair ſoever to the Eye) is evil Fruit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7, 16. Where there is not a good Treaſure of Grace in the Heart, a Man cannot in his Actions <hi>bring forth good things,</hi> Matth. 12.36.</p>
               <p>Many enlightned Sinners think by Reading and Praying, and forſaking ſome groſs and foul Sins, to pacify God, and ſet all Right: Miſtaken Souls, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t me undeceive you; you begin at the wrong End, your firſt and greateſt Care muſt be to get your Hearts and Natures changed, and renewed by the Power of converting Grace; you labour in vain at the Streams, while the Fountain of Corruption in the Heart remains in its Strength: You muſt not think it is with you, as it is with a ruinous Houſe, where the mending of here and there a little will make up all again; but the old Building muſt be quite taken down, and the Foundation Stone laid a-new in a ſound Repentance from dead Works, and thorough Converſion unto God. Till this be done, you muſt know, that God hath no Pleaſure in you, neither will accept an Offering at your Hand, <hi>Malachy</hi> 1.10. as he doth from thoſe that are Friends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That there be the Acceptation of your Perſons through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For in him alone it is that God is well pleaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. laſt. So that <hi>without</hi> Faith intereſting us in him, <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding both theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, know that there are two Attributes of God to which you muſt bear a Conformity, or elſe you cannot pleaſe him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:004663_0218_100DE1EC78E7F670"/>1. <hi>The Holineſs of God:</hi> For he is not a God that hath pleaſure in Iniquity: He heareth no Sinner: The Fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his Sight. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the workers of Iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 9.31. God can no more take Pleaſure in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, than we in Swine or Serpents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Juſtice of God:</hi> For he will by no means clear the Guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34, 7. Could we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs in us; in our unpardoned State, yet Juſtice could not but be infinitely offended while Guilt lieth unremoved; as you may ſee in Chriſt, for tho' he were perfectly holy, yet being under the Guilt of our Sins imputed to him, the ſeverity of God's Juſtice broke out againſt him.</p>
               <p>Now, Man being naturally an Offence both to the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs upon him in order to his pleaſing God, this two fold Change.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The real change of Sanctification:</hi> I call this a real change, becauſe by this there is a real change enſuing of new Qualities and Diſpoſitions, making him of proud, humble, of carnal, ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Relative Change of Juſtification:</hi> I call this a relative Change, becauſe there is not a real Change in a Man's Nature, but in his Condition, making him to ſtand in a new Relation to the Law, with Reference to which he was before guilty and condemned, but now the Law pronounces the ſame Man clear and acquitted, and this not for any Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs infuſed into him, but for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Payment of another laid down for him; Satisfaction there muſt be, and Righteouſneſs muſt be tendered, or elſe God cannot be at Peace. We have nothing to pay, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.49. Oh Sinner, away to Chriſt for it; hide thee in the Clifts of that Rock; run to the Fountain opened for Sin and Uncleanneſs.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>With Reference to our Principles.</hi> And here it is neceſſary that ſome <hi>corrupt Principles be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi> and ſome <hi>holy Principles</hi> be <hi>received</hi> and <hi>retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some corrupt Principles muſt be unlearned.</hi> As 1. That <hi>it is enough if we ſerve God on the Lord's Day, and we may ſerve ourſelves all the reſt of the Week.</hi> Tho' God hath reſerved one Day in ſeven wholly for his immediate Service, which is therefore in a peculiar Senſe called the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> yet we muſt know that every Day is His, and that he hath not allowed us one Hour nor Inch of Time, but only for His Service. Indeed he hath Service of <hi>more ſorts than one;</hi> but we muſt know that the Buſineſs of our ordinary Affairs, if rightly done, is a <hi>Serving of the Lord Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3, 24 God is as truly ſerved by you in the <hi>working Days Labour,</hi> as the <hi>Sabbath-days reſt,</hi> if you do it in a right Manner, and to holy Ends.</p>
               <p>There is a Generation whoſe Religion is but a <hi>Sunday's Religion,</hi> which they put on and off with their <hi>Sunday's</hi> Clothes, and then they think God is fairly ſerved for the Week; altho' God knows, that little they do then is but poorly done neither. Never think God will accept it at thy Hands, when thou liveſt ſix Days to the World and thyſelf, for <hi>One</hi> that thou ſpendeſt for him. This ſhews thee to be under the mortified Power of Self-love, and not to be the Lord's, for none of us liveth to himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. You muſt remember, that you are but to learn upon the Sabbath, how to ſerve God all the Week; and not think when the Lord's Day is ended, his Work is done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That if God be ſerved Morning and Evening, it

O Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thine Heart!</hi> When once this is done, Reformation will ſoon follow in the Life: but not otherwiſe: Many are careful that all that appears to Men ſhould be beautiful, but their Hearts are neglected.

The Hypocrite is very punctual in leſſer Matters, but neglects the weightieſt Things of the Law, Judgment and Mercy, and Faith. He is for a Religion, that will coſt him little: And therefore Words being good cheap, he will be forward in talk as a mighty Zealot in Circumſtantials of Religion, and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cenſorious of others that come not up to his Mind, as Men of wide Principles and large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: But in the mean time he is very negligent in ſecret Duties, a great Stranger to Self-denial, and walking humbly with God. He ſtrains won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully at a Ceremony? But it may be he can ſwallow the Gains of Unrighteouſneſs, or the Baits of Intemperance faſt enough. It may be he will decry Superſtition, and never want a Stone to fling at a prophane Church-man: But in the mean time walks looſly in his Family, makes little Conſcience

of his Dealings, or will take up his Cups as freely as another, ſo he be not drunk. Or if he will not take a Penny of his Neighbour's Eſtate, he is moſt unmerciful to his good Name, and will take up any Report that is going. Brethren, you muſt make Conſcience of the leaſt Sin and of the leaſt Duty. But it is a fearful Sign when Men are zealous againſt leſſer Sins, and yet connive at greater, as theſe are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.24.</p>
               <p>Direct. V. <hi>Take the firſt Opportunity when God gives a fit ſeaſon for any Duty.</hi> Let not Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile you, by telling you of another or better Time. It may be thou haſt a Purpoſe to reprove thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Sin, but how long wilt thou be a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing? Now God gives thee an Opportunity, it may be thy backward Heart ſaith, <hi>[not now, but another time.]</hi> And ſo it is put off, till he or thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf are removed, or he is hardned, or at leaſt thou art guilty of the Sin that he commits in the mean while; becauſe thou haſt not done thy Duty to prevent it. It is in thine Heart to deal with thine unconverted Friend or Neighbour about his ſpiritual Eſtate, but it may be while thou art delaying, Death comes and ſnatches him away in his Sins, or takes thee off, and ſo farewell for ever to any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for doing the Soul of thy Brother any good. How often are our Cloſet Duties hindred or miſerably diſturbed, for want of Care to lay hold on the firſt Opportunity? We think another Hour in the Day may do as well, but then one thing or another unexpectedly falls in, that nothing is done, or nothing to purpoſe. Therefore beware of this Cheat. A Man ſcarce peeps into the World, but one Briar or Thorn, or another will catch him. Therefore, take Opportunity by the Fore-top. Our Saviour would take his Seaſon for Prayer before Day, when his other Work was preſſing, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35.</p>

GOD's Command: Nothing in Things civil without God's Allowance.</hi> Offer not with ſtrange Fire; In God's Worſhip you muſt ſee you be well able to anſwer that Queſtion, <hi>Who hath required theſe Things at your Hands?</hi> Here the Command muſt be obſerved, without adding or diminiſhing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32, yet underſtanding this with Two Cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Tho' Men may not ſtamp their invented Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with a moral Signification, nor impoſe, nor uſe them, tho' with good Intentions of edifying the People by deviſed Means, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.2. as if Chriſt had not ſufficiently provided for the edyfying his People without their Deviſes. And tho' nothing may be uſed as a Part of Worſhip that God hath not commanded, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. (for it is enough to make any thing rejected of the Lord of divine Worſhip, if he ſhall ſay, <hi>I commanded it not, ſpake it not, neither came it into my Mind,</hi>) Jeremiah 7.31 and 19.5. Yet nevertheleſs thoſe things that are merely circumſtantial, and are in their general kind neceſſary, and not intended as any Part or Means of Worſhip, may be determined of by humane Prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word) which muſt always be obſerved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26 42. And for want of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, many have ignorantly condemned Preaching by an Hour-glaſs, in a high Place, in Churches, by way of Doctrine and Uſe, &amp;c. running from the one Extream to another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may not think that God's Ordinanee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for ſubſtance may be forſaken, becauſe of ſome Faults of the Adminiſtrators, or in the Way of their Adminiſtration.

and Rudeneſs into the Service of God. Yet <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kannah</hi> and <hi>Hannah,</hi> with others of the Godly, did nevertheleſs attend God's Worſhip and Sanctuary, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 1.2 much Corruption was crept in, both into the Doctrine and Worſhip, and Lives of the Adminiſtrators of the Church of the Jews.<note place="margin">N.

               <p>But now, in Things civil, it is ſufficient, that you have the Allowance of the Word, though not the Commands, always provided, that the general Rules he here obſerved, <hi>to do all to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. And not to abuſe our lawful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Offence of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2.

Miſchief. 1. You loſe ſo much from your own Account. 2. You uſurp upon the great Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of God.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>God hath given you ſpecial Helps to this End. You have the Mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Corinthians 2.16. And you have the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. Indeed, <hi>they that are in the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o Duties continues in Vigour, tho' there be a languiſhing of the <hi>natural Strength,</hi> and wearineſs of the <hi>bodily Organs;</hi> this is not our Sin, but Affliction. But too commonly the <hi>Body</hi> hath ſo much Influence upon the <hi>Mind,</hi> and cauſeth a Liſtleſneſs and Sluggiſhneſs there, and makes it negligent in its Office: Yet when this doth proceed from the failing of the Spirits, tired with bodily Labour and Exerciſe, and from the Diſtempers of the Parts, our moſt pitiful Father conſiders our Frame, and remembers we are but Duſt: And our merciful High Prieſt, that is not untouched with the Senſe of our Infirmities, is ready to frame our Excuſe, <hi>That the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Where our <hi>Wearineſs</hi> in and <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> to Duties, is only <hi>gradual</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> not <hi>plenary</hi> and <hi>prevalent,</hi> it is not ſufficient to conclude our ſelves graceleſs: While the Twins are together in the Womb, and two Nations within our Bowels, there will be contrary Inclinations. The Fleſh will never ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to a good Motion as ſuch, but will be luſting againſt the Spirit, and will hang back when the Spirit puts forward, and pulls down when the Spirit bends upwards: So that while Corruption remaineth, there will be always a diſſenting Party, and continual Conflicts; from whence it is no Wonder there ſhould ariſe ſome Wearineſs: Yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the prevailing Intereſt, and tho' oft times foiled, yet hath moſtly the Maſtery in the Combat, and carries it againſt the Fleſh, though not
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004663_0245_100DE23629948800"/>
without much Reſiſtance and Reluctancy from the Rebel Opponent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When this <hi>Wearineſs</hi> is only <hi>tranſient,</hi> during the preſent Temptation or Defection, which as ſoon as the tired Soul can get out of it, returns to its former Temper and Pleaſure in Holy Duties, there is only Matter of Humiliation. But when it is the ſettled permanent and habitual Frame of the Mind, it is a Matter of queſtioning our Condition. The Holy Pſalmiſt under a Deſertion, was even almoſt perſwaded to give over with Religion; but when he is himſelf, nothing is ſo ſweet, nothing is ſo lovely and deſirable to him, as the Duties of Holineſs. But for them who have in their ordinary ſettled Courſe and Frame, no Mind of Duties, but are called to them by Conſcience, or engaged by Company, as Cuſtom or the like, their Caſe is fearful in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that Duty is unpleaſing and not loved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where this <hi>Wearineſs</hi> of and <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> to Duties is painful and grievous, as a Sore in the Eye, as a Sickneſs in the Heart, the State is good, but where it is naturally allowed, and meets with little or no Reſiſtance, it is a black Mark. For this argues there is nothing but Fleſh, that there is no contrary Principle in ſuch a Heart. For if there were, the Spirit would at leaſt make Oppoſition: This was the very Frame of thoſe unſanctified Sinners that counted the Sabbaths and Services of God an unprofitable Burden, a very Wearineſs, a Bondage not to be born, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. A gracious Heart, when under ſuch a Diſtemper, as that God's Service ſeems a <hi>Wearineſs,</hi> is even weary of himſelf, whiles this is burdenſome, he is a Burden to himſelf. He cannot enjoy himſelf while in ſuch a Frame wherein he cannot enjoy God: and if this be the Caſe, our State is good, though the Frame be bad.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where this <hi>Wearineſs</hi> and <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> is not from a rooted Diſlike of the Food, but an accidental and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ematural Indiſpoſition of the Stomach, or being diſappointed of God's Preſence in Duties, the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004663_0246_100DE2399DC37608"/>
main State is ſafe. You know under a Diſtemper, the Appetite may diſguſt, and nauſeate the Food that a Man doth love above all other Meats when he is well, and ſo it is here. Do you when you are your ſelves reliſh more Sweetneſs in God's Service than in your Meats and Drinks? Are no Sweets ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you as Fellowſhip and Communion with God, when you can attain to it in Duties? Do you come away diſcontented, becauſe you cannot meet with God? Is the Ground why your Countenances fall, and your Hearts be diſcouraged, becauſe you have <hi>(with them)</hi> toiled and ſpread the Net, and have not caught what you went for: becauſe you have no Anſwer nor Income from God? If it be thus, it is a Sign your Hearts be ſet upon God; and that you place the Happineſs and Comfort of your Lives in God; and ſo that your State is ſafe: Otherwiſe when there is a fixed Antipathy to Duties, and an habitual Diſlike of them, and Contrariety to them, the Caſe is very ſad.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where our <hi>Wearineſs</hi> and <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> is ſuch as makes us to give over our Duties, ſo as to live in the ordinary Neglect of them, it is a fearful Sign: But where notwithſtanding preſent Diſcouragements, we hold on in the Performance of our Duties, and a humble waiting upon God, for Removal of our Difficulties, till we are brought to a better Frame; this argues well The Church herſelf may be greatly deſerted, but then ſhe gives not over Duties, but ſeeks after her Beloved, and makes diligent Enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will not be at reſt until ſhe hath found him, but the Hypocrite gives up, and will not wait upon the Lord any longer. Not but that a deſerted Soul, may under the Violence of Temptations omit Duties for a time; but his Condition this while is moſt <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, reſtleſs</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> to him, and he quickly returns again, and never comes to live quiet, in the ordinary Omiſſion of known Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu</hi> 7. When our <hi>Wearineſs</hi> and <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> is ſuch as makes us fall out with the Service of Chriſt,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004663_0247_100DE23B213D9520"/>
and willing to eaſe ourſelves of his Yoke, and to throw off his Burden: This is a bad Sign: But when we fall out with ourſelves, and juſtly and approve Chriſt's Ways and Service, it is well. Thus it was with <hi>Paul:</hi> He doth not quarrel with the Law, as too ſtrict and too ſevere, nor think of breaking off his Bonds, and taking his Liberty, but he <hi>pleads</hi> for the Law, and greatly approves it, and commends it, and condemns the Backwardneſs of his own Nature, <hi>Rom,</hi> 7.12, 25. When Men are more willing to be rid of CHRIST's Burden, than of the Diſtemper that makes it grievous, and caſt about for Eaſe, by winding their Bonds, and not by bringing their Minds to them, it is a woful Diſcovery of an unſound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Sirs, be aware of your Danger, and fear, leſt a Promiſe being left of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould at laſt come ſhort of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1.

Why, thou art the Man. This Traveller is thy ſelf: This Jewel is thy Soul: This Wilderneſs, or Wood, is this World; thou art to travel through Swarms of Sins, Legions of Devils, a whole World of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

Theſe are the Robbers that lie in wait for thy Soul, and if all that theſe can do, can keep thee out of Heaven, thou ſhalt never come there. Oh, what if thy Pride or Worldlineſs, thy Delays, and Triflings in Religion, ſhould at laſt betray thy Soul into the Robbers Hands! Other Loſſes may be repaired, but thy Soul being once loſt, GOD is loſt, CHRIST is loſt, Heaven, all loſt for evermore!</p>

               <p>Coun. II. <hi>That you value no Mercy barely as it ſerves in content to your Fleſh, but as it ſtands in order to Eternity, and may ſerve to the furthering your Maker's Glory.</hi> God hath preſerved your Liberties, and hath reſtored mine: But what of all this, Unleſs we improve our Liberties for Eternity, what are we better than thoſe that are in Priſon, if this be all the Advantage we have a little more Content to our Fleſh? The Cypher put to the Figure is of great Conſideration, but put it by it ſelf, it ſignifies nothing at all. Theſe Creature Comforts ſeparated from their Reſpect to God and Eternity, are of no Value: But in order to theſe Ends they ſignify much. We have Eaſe and Fulneſs, when many others are in Pain, and in Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and we have much the Start of them, if we be

wiſe to improve our Health, in ſaying in a-pace againſt a wet Day, and preparing a pace for Eternity. And if we ſerve the Lord with the more abundant Diligence and Chearfulneſs, and Gladneſs of Heart in the Abundance of all Things But if this be all we have by it, that our Bones do lie a little ſofter, and our Palates are tickled with a little the more Delight, what Profit have we by our Health, or our Eſtates? If they that be ſick or poor do love the Lord as well, or ſerve the Lord as much as we; they have the Advantage of us, and better were it for us to be poor and ſick as they be.</p>
               <p>Coun. III. <hi>Reſt not in Probabilities for Heaven, but labour for Certainties.</hi> Beloved, Certainty may be had, elſe the Counſel of God to make our Calling and Election ſure were in vain, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10 Elſe the Experience of the Saints were but a Deluſion, who tell us they know they are paſſed from Death to Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26. Elſe the Power of Self-reflection were to no Purpoſe, and the Spirit which is in Man ſhould not know the Things of the Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. Now if a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty may be had, will you not put in for it, and turn every Stone, but you will get it? Sirs, now, if ever, you have need to put hard to it to get Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. We are at miſerable Uncertainties for all outward Enjoyments; we know not how ſoon we may be called to part with them all: Chriſtians, What do you mean? Will you be content to have nothing ſure? Will you not ſettle your everlaſting Condition, now you are ſo unſettled as to your outward Condition? What will you do in the Day of Viſitation, when Extremity comes in upon you, if you have no Aſſurance that God will receive you? It would make ones Heart tremble to think of being put upon ſuch a fearful Temptation to part withall for Chriſt, and not to be ſure of him neither? O Man! what an Advantage will the Tempter now have upon thee, when he ſhall ſuggeſt, Wilt thou be ſuch a Fool as to let go all at once? Thou ſeeſt

Heaven is not ſure, Chriſt is not ſure, therefore keep the World while thou haſt it, and hold what thou haſt ſure: Beloved, what a fearful ſlighting of God, and Contempt of Heaven, and Glory, and all the Promiſes, doth this argue, that you can be content to be at Uncertainties whether they be yours or no? How many of you be there that do not know whether you be going to Heaven or to Hell? And what deſperate Careleſsneſs doth this argue, to go on from Week to Week in ſuch a Caſe? Some Hopes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Counſ. IV. <hi>Be not ſatisfied with the Truth of Grace, but reach after the Growth.</hi> Do not think all is done, when you have attained the Evidence of Grace, but put on hard towards the Increaſe. That Perſon that doth not deſire and deſign Perfection, never came up to Sincerity. He that deſires Grace truly, deſires it not barely as a Bridge to Heaven, and ſo to ſeek no more than will juſt bear his Charges thither: But he deſires it for its own Sake; and therefore deſires the Height of it: That Perſon that deſires Grace only for Heaven's Sake, and enquires what is the loweſt Meaſure of Grace that any one may have and come to Heaven, (by which he meaneth but to be ſaved from Miſery) upon this Deſign, that if he could but come to that Pitch, he would deſire no more; that Perſon is rotten at the Heart. Chriſtians, the Lord doth expect of you, that you ſhould not be Babes and Dwarfs; He looks now, eſpecially that you ſhould make ſome Progreſs: What do you more than heretofore? What! Do you feel his Spurs in your Sides, and his Whip at your Backs; and yet never mend your Pace in Religion, not ſtir one Jot the faſter? Let me commend to you <hi>Paul</hi>'s

Study, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 12, 13, 14. It argues a baſe and unworthy Spirit to content ourſelves with little Things in Religion.</p>
               <p>Counſ V <hi>Labour that Holineſs may become your Nature, and Religion your Buſineſs.</hi> Then you are come to ſomewhat indeed in Religion, when the Work of God is become your natural and beloved Employment, your Meat and Drink, your Work and Wages When your Tongues and Hearts do as naturally run on God, as others on, and of the World: Much of that may be attained by conſtant Care and Prayer. Brethren, let God's Work be done by you, not by the Bye, but as your greateſt Buſineſs: <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 6.33. And ſo whatſoever you be, you may be able to give that Account of yourſelves, that our Saviour did when they enquired of him, <hi>that you are about your Father's Buſineſs,</hi> Luke 2.59.</p>
               <p>Counſ. VI. <hi>Confine not your Religion to your Knees, but carry on an even ſpun Thread of Holineſs through your whole Courſe</hi> Brethren, 'tis the Diſgrace of Religion, that Chriſtians are ſo unlike themſelves, unleſs it be when they are in Holy Duties. This wounds Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the Quick, when it ſhall be ſaid of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, Theſe Men indeed, will pray like Angels, but for aught we can ſee, they are as peeviſh, and as touchy, as any other Men, and they are as hard in their Dealings, and make as little Conſcience of their Words, as others do. Beloved, think not Religion lies only, or chiefly, in praying, hearing, reading: No, you muſt be throughout religious. Sirs, bring forth your Religion out of your Cloſers into your ordinary Courſe. Let there not be a Liſt of Holineſs on the Outſide of the Cloth, but let Holineſs be woven into the Whole of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Here lies the Excellency and Difficulty of Religion: When you have the Baits of Intemperance before you, then hold the Reins hard, and deny your Fleſh; and when you have Provocation before you, then to bite in your Paſſions, and bridle the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004663_0254_100DE24E8110E360"/>
unruly Members: When you have Dealings with others, then to proceed by that Golden Rule of Equity and Charity, <hi>To do to others as your Conſcience tells you, you would have them do in like Caſe to you.</hi> When you are called upon in your ſeveral Relations, then to behave yourſelves with that Tenderneſs and Love, with that Reverence and Obedience, with that Courteſy and Condeſcenſion, and Kindneſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you in your various Capacities: In this I ſay, lies the Excellency of Religion.</p>
               <p>Counſ. VII. <hi>Ever walk with your End in your Eye:</hi> It is true, according to the uſual Similitude, The Traveller thinks not of his Journey's End in every Step, nor need he; yet there is no Traveller but thinks of it at his ſetting out: Brethren, there is nothing hinders, but that with Prayer and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs you might come to this, <hi>in every ſolemn Action to mind GOD as your End:</hi> Impoſe this upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as your daily Rule to walk by, never to lye down but with theſe Thoughts, <hi>[Well, I will make uſe of my Bed as an Ordinance of God for my natural Refreſhment, that a Servant of his may he fitted for his Work.]</hi> Never to riſe up but with theſe Thoughts. <hi>[I will ſet forth this Day in the Name of the Lord, and make it my Buſineſs this Day throughout to pleaſe him.]</hi> Never to ſet about our Callings, but in the Entrance to think thus, <hi>[I will ſet about my Employment in Obedience to God, becauſe this is his Will, that I ſhould walk with him in my Place and Station.]</hi> Never to ſit down to your Tables but thinking, <hi>[I will now eat and drink not merely to feed my Fleſh, but to cheriſh a Servant of Chriſt Jeſus, that he might have Strength for his Service.]</hi> Charge this upon yourſelves, and examine in the Evening, how you have minded it, and check yourſelves wherein you come ſhort. Once learn this, and you are come to ſomething: And you ſhall have the undoubted Evidence of your Sincerity, and ſhall know the Inſide of that bleſſed Myſtery of walking with God.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In your Cloſets ſee that your Conſciences be able to bear you witneſs, that under GOD's extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providences, you do more than ever in Anſwer thereunto. It may be you prayed twice in the Day before; Why ſhould you not at ſuch a Time as this is, make one Viſit more than ordinary to Heaven, daily to repreſent before God the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his Church. This be ſure of, that ſomewhat more than heretofore muſt be done, elſe God muſt look upon himſelf as intolerably ſlighted, and upon his Church as moſt unnaturally neglected, if we do not now put to it. Be more than ever, in Self-Examination God doth look, that when he is trying of us, we ſhould be much in the Trial of ourſelves. And here let me put it to your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, How are your Rules for daily Examination looked after? Do you try yourſelves by them from Day to Day? Ah wretched Negligence! What have you given your Approbation, and paſſed your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and yet even in ſuch a Day as this, ſo much forget your Duty? God expects it of you, that now you ſee him angry, you ſhould with more jealous Fear, and tender Circumſpection, and holy Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Self-denial, walk before him, elſe you will greatly incenſe his Indignation, when he ſhall ſee that you ſlight his Anger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In your Families; Chriſtians, now the Lord calls aloud upon you, to ſet your Houſes in Order. Oh ſee what is amiſs in them, and ſtrive to caſt out that which may be a Provocation. Three Things I adviſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou in reference to your Families.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That you ſet up the ſolemn Exerciſe of Catechiſing Weekly among you:</hi> Methinks I would not queſtion. but that in every Godly Family there is a Care of the <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> But when Governors do only impoſe it in general upon their Families, and occaſionally take an Account, I find little Progreſs is made:
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004663_0256_100DE252F0BED220"/>
and therefore I beſeech you to make it a ſolemn, ſtanding, and conſtant Exerciſe, and to expect of your Children and Servants as due an Account Weekly of what they have learn'd in the Principles of Religion, as of any Buſineſs of your own. Oh the incredible Benefit that would ſpeedily come of this, if I could but perſuade, and prevail with my Hearers in ſo ſmall a Requeſt as this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That you be often enquiring into their Spiritual Eſtates:</hi> Follow them cloſe, and let them have no Quiet, till you ſee they ſeriouſly mind and ſeek ſpiritual Things. Put them upon ſecret Prayer, provide Helps for them till they are able to go without them: Shew them often the Neceſſity of Regeneration, and Converſion, and the Nature thereof. Put them in mind of the fearful Miſery of an unregenerate Eſtate. Ask them often, Whether they are converted or not? Shew them the Danger of delaying in ſuch a Caſe. Beloved, 'tis too ſadly evident, that as the Ordinances are now ſome-where managed, there is little Converſion-work like to be done. Oh you Governors of Families, do but your Duties in your ſeveral Places, and I doubt not but many Souls will nevertheleſs be born to CHRIST, even in ſuch a Day as this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Call them to an Account of their Proficiency by every Opportunity.</hi> If there be but a Sermon, or a Chapter read, let them give you ſome Account of it. Thus our Saviour, when the Diſciples (his Family) were in private, he was asking them Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did underſtand, and profit by what they heard in Publick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>Counſ. IX. <hi>Be not diſcouraged by the preſent Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Religion, but rather rejoyce in the Opportunity, to ſhew your Love and Loyalty to your Lord.</hi> Do not think that God hath dealt hardly with you, now your Religion is like to coſt you ſomething, and and preſently think of your ſhrinking and drawing back to preſerve your Safety. If you do love the Lord Jeſus, you ſhould rejoice, and be exceeding
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004663_0257_100DE255E87930D8"/>
glad in the Opportunity to ſhew it. Brethren, what hath your Religion coſt you hitherto? And for Shame ſuffer not your ſhrinking, and withdrawing to tell the World that you have not Love enough to Chriſt, to engage you to run any Hazard for him. Do you indeed love the Lord? Oh then, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and be exceeding glad, for never had you ſuch an Opportunity, in all your Lives, to ſhew your Love as now; for never were you called to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo for him, and his Service, as now you be. Now reſolve, that if Religion will make you vile, you will be yet more vile; and let your Zeal and Reſolution for God be intended and heightned by Oppoſition.</p>

Oh happy and bleſſed Meeting!

It is God's admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condeſcenſion, that he will be tied to us, and enter into Bonds with us, to bleſs us, and reward us.

               <p>
                  <hi>I will be a Phyſician to you.</hi> I will heal your Backſlidings, and cure all your Diſeaſes, fear not, never did Soul miſcarry that left itſelf in my Hands, and would but follow my Preſcription.</p>
               <p>Well, this is one of the Articles that God here ſealeth to, that he will be to you in the Place of all Relations: Silence thou quarreling Unbelief; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear thy Whiſpers, That this is too good
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004663_0260_100DE25F383DC420"/>
to be true, that it were Preſumption in us to count upon all this. What; ſhall they that muſt ſay to Corruption, that thou art my Father, be able to ſay to the incorruptible God, Thou art my Father? Shall they that muſt ſay to the Worm, thou art my Mother and my Siſter, be able to ſay to the Angels of Light, Ye are my Fellow-Servants? And to the King of Glory, Thou art my Brother, and my Kinſman? Shall Majeſty eſpouſe himſelf to Miſery? and the Worms Meat be married to Immortality and Life? How can theſe Things be?</p>
               <p>Nay, but O Heart of Infidelity, what art thou that replieſt againſt God? Doſt thou, under a ſly Pretence of Humility, queſtion with thy Maſter, and call his Veracity into Doubt? Is not this his Word, his Promiſe, his Covenant? And is not there of his Seal? Why then doſt thou doubt, O thou little Faith?</p>
               <p>Art. II. <hi>That he will intitle you to all the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Perfections,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will be a God unto thee:</hi> Mark, God gives away himſelf, and he gives his Son to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I will give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the People.</hi> This is the Church's Triumph, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Unto us a Son is given.</hi> And he gives his Spirit to you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>He ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> And Believers acknowledge the Receipt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God.</hi> Thus you ſee all the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the God-head are made over to you, and ſo are all the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the God-head; and all the Covenant runs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God,</hi> or, <hi>the All-ſufficient God, walk before me and be upright:</hi> Theſe are the Terms between God and a Believer. Be thou up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before me, and I will be All-ſufficient to thee: The All-ſufficiency of God is the Comprehenſion of all his <hi>Perfections.</hi> Truth without Power, or Power without Wiſdom, or both, without Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would not be <hi>All-ſufficiency.</hi> All-ſufficiency takes in all that is in God, (if we may ſpeak of Good moſt ſimple Eſſence according to the ſhallow reach
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004663_0261_100DE260C637F6F8"/>
of our preſent Capacity) yea, it comprehends infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more than can be ſaid or thought. Why now this is the Covenant of Grace, which God eſtabliſhes with you this Day; that he will be a God All ſufficient to you.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, rouſe up your Faith: Now appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and apply the Promiſes: Now believe ſtrongly, and ſtedfaſtly, and Believing will fill you with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. I do not wonder if your Faith be put to it in ſo high and great a Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; to draw nigh to infinite Majeſty, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and without Heſitancy to ſay, <hi>Thou art mine and all that thou haſt;</hi> this is no eaſy thing. But thou mayeſt not dare to doubt it: Canſt thou queſtion him who is the Truth? Can the Strength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lie, or in his Word deceive thee? But the Soul is ready to reply, Oh the Things are too high and too great for me to preſume to believe, and is ready with <hi>Peter</hi> aſtoniſhed, to cry out, <hi>Depart Lord, for I am a ſinful Man.</hi> But why doth thine Hand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thine Heart fail thee: And thy Feet (with <hi>Peter</hi>'s when walking on the Waters) begin to ſink? What doſt thou ſtick at? Is it at the Truth of the Promiſe? No, ſaith the trembling Soul, but ſure ſo much can never belong to one ſo ſinful. I am afraid it is not mine. Why, what ſaith the Promiſe? <hi>Only be upright.</hi> What though thou haſt an hundred Failings, yet thy Heart is upright: The Bent of thy Heart is mainly for God and Holineſs; thou makeſt Conſcience of all Sin, little as well as great, ſecret as well as open; and doſt thou deliberately allow thyſelf in any: Thou doeſt in the ſettled Frame of thy Heart prefer the Pleaſing of God, and value his Favour and Fellowſhip above all worldly Good; therefore thou art upright: Theſe Marks are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. What, doſt thou object thy Failings? Art thou under a Covenant of Works? Do you think God now ſtands upon Perfection? The Covenant is plain: God accepteth of Uprightneſs: And God hath wrought in thee that Condition that he requires
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004663_0262_100DE263994F6A78"/>
of thee. What can be more plain? Wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Devil and Unbelief to catch the Bread out of thy Hand, when God tells thee it is thine? Wilt thou be againſt thyſelf, and refuſe thine own Peace, when God is come to ſeal thee up to the Day of Redemption? This is that which the Lord here ſeals to thee, <hi>That he will be God All-ſufficient to thee.</hi> O believe and be thankful, and rejoice in thine own Bleſſedneſs! Oh happy, thrice happy Souls, whom the living God thus ſignifieth and ſealeth to, and aſſigns over all his infinite Perfections as its ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Art. III. <hi>That he will diſcharge you from all your Debts,</hi> Heb. 8.10, 12. <q>This the Covenant, I will be merciful to their Unrighteouſneſs, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.

I tell you, Sirs, theſe are not big Words, nor cunningly deviſed Fables. God Almighty is here come to certifie you of the Reality of his Promiſes. As ſure as you do now ſit on your Seats, you ſhall ſhortly ſit on your Thrones. As ſure as you are now clothed with Fleſh ſo ſurely ſhall you be clothed with Glory. Are you

ſure you are now on Earth? So ſulely ſhall you be in Heaven: The Lord intendeth you but for a very little while in this lower Region, you muſt dwell above; where Chriſt is, there you muſt be alſo. As ſure as you now ſee a crucified Chriſt, ſo ſurely ſhall you ſee a glorified Chriſt. The Lord Jeſus doth anticipate his Sentence here, and calls to you Gueſts; <hi>Come ye Bleſſed, inherit the Kingdom.</hi> Take the Writing, behold the Seals, there are the Conveyances of the Kingdom. The Donation is ſure and full, unalterable, irrevocable.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, Do you believe? If you do me-thinks you ſhould be raviſhed: Me-thinks you ſhould be filled with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory! But do you ſtagger at the Promiſe, through unbelief? Do you ſay, O it is to much, and too great? Why, how can this be? What, too great for God to make good? Thou dareſt not think ſo. But it is too great for me to think upon. Why, but Man, doſt thou not bear upon thee the <hi>Mark of the Lord Jeſus; Whoſe Image and Superſcription is this?</hi> Doth not your very Heart prize Chriſt above all the World? Haſt thou not made a deliberate Choice of him, for thy head and Husband? Haſt thou not entered into a ſolemn Contract with him, to be his in all Times and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and love, honour, and obey him, before all others to the Death? And doth not thy Heart ſtand to all his choice? Haſt not thou taken him with his Yoke, and with his Croſs? And doſt not thou in thy Praſtice firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof? And haſt not thou choſen the Way of the Kingdom? Art thou not in Love with the Holineſs? And deſireſt Grace more than Gold? Doſt not thou prefer an Holy Spiritual Life, before all the Grandeur of the World, and Pleaſure of the Fleſh? And all this not only for a Fit or Flaſh, but in the ſettled Frame and Diſpoſition of thy Heart? Surely thou muſt wrong God and thy ſelf, if thou denieſt it to be thus with thee. Why theſe are the Marks <hi>of the Lord Jeſus</hi> upon thee, the ſure Marks:

               <p>Come then, Beloved Chriſtian, be of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, why ſhouldſt thou doubt? Thou haſt the Mark of the Sheep, and therefore thy Portion ſhall be at the Right Hand, thy Sentence among the Bleſſed. Well then, receive this Holy Sacrament as the Pledge of all this. Go home and look over all theſe Bleſſed Promiſes, and count them thine. Do not read them (as too often heretofore) as if they did not concern thee. Remember what GOD hath here promiſed under Hand and Seal to thee, and let not all be left behind thee, when thou goeſt hence, but let the Remembrance, the Fruit and Sweet of this abide upon thee whilſt thou haſt a Day to live. Never forget what the Lord hath here ſpoken to thy Soul: Make more of the Promiſes than ever in thy Life before: Bleſs thy ſelf in them. Remember how the Lord <hi>delivered thee</hi> the Promiſes: How he ſealed to the ſeveral Articles, how he ſprinkled the Blood upon the Book of the Covenant, and gave it thee, and ſaid, <hi>This is the New Teſtament in my Blood:</hi> Oh live henceforth a Life of Joy and Faith, as a Man that is elevated above the World. Do not live at the old, dull and ſlothful Rate, carry it like a Believer; and in a Word, walk as one that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed take all for Truth that the Lord hath ſpoken to thee this Day. Let that of the Apoſtle be a Cloſe to all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe Promiſes, Dearly Beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit. Perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of GOD.</hi>
