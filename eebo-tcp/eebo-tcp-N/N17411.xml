            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>his</hi> the daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though with the proſpect of aſcending the throne of one of the moſt ancient, ſplendid and powerful nations of the earth. And ever after he was divinely appointed to conduct the <hi>Hebrews</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the day of this death; he manifeſted a warm and conſtant affection to that people, and an animated deſire to promote their tranquility and happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT in nothing did <hi>Moſes</hi> demonſtrate his love to his nation more, than in that wiſe ſyſtem of laws which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, ſo admirably calculated to ſubſerve their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt political intereſt and proſperity—this he admoniſhes them of in our text, the plain meaning of which is, "That religion, or a practical attention to that ſyſtem of moral and religious inſtitutions revealed from Heaven, will always promote the beſt intereſts of human ſociety, and prove the greateſt ſocial bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mankind." And it is an happy conſideration, that the religion GOD has been pleaſed to reveal to us, is not only rational, entertaining and ſublime in itſelf, and calculated to promote the tranquility of individuals, and their utmoſt ment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pleaſure—but alſo to encourage and perfect the order, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and happineſs of human ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE benign aſpect of religion upon human ſociety, and national proſperity and happineſs, being principally intended by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the text, I ſhall ſpecially inſiſt on this idea in the ſubſequent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>AND that religion is a great and ineſtimable ſocial bleſſing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022505_0005_0FB94768DD1F7D78"/>
to mankind, and admirably adapted to render a nation peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and proſperous, may be confirmed and illuſtrated, whether we conſider the nature and tendency of religion, or the holy, wiſe and juſt providence of GOD, which ſuperintends all the affairs of mankind.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE nature and tendency of religion are ſuch, as have the moſt benign and friendly aſpect upon civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>ALL thoſe virtues and graces which are recommended in our holy religion, are happily ſubſervient to the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial intereſts of civil communities.</p>
            <p>AN inviolable regard to truth and fidelity, juſtice and equity, ſo much inſiſted upon, both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> is very neceſſary to the well being of ſociety—as we ſhould preſently be convinced, by too ſad experience, were inſincerity and falſehood, injuſtice and fraud, to be ſubſtituted inſtead of thoſe virtues, and introduced into general practice.—Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and chaſte affections towards our neighbours—induſtry and diligence in our reſpective occupations—theſe are excellent virtues in communities, and tend to render ſocial life peaceful and happy.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Hebrew Lawgiver</hi> recommended a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for JEHOVAH, as the creator, preſerver and governor of the world; who is repreſented, in the religious inſtitution of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as ſuperintending, by his wiſe, holy and juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, all the affairs of mankind; he commanded chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and youth to exerciſe a filial and honorable regard to their earthly parents and ſuperiors, affability towards equals, and courteouſneſs to all; he required the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to maintain a ſacred regard to the lives and health of their neighbours—to be temperate and chaſte in their affections and whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment—not to intrude upon each other's property—to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an inviolable regard to truth in all their ſocial intercourſe, eſpecially in matters of witneſs—to permit their neighbour the unmoleſted and uncoveted poſſeſſion and enjoyment of his wiſe, his houſe, his field, his manſervant, his maidſervant, his ox, his aſs, and every part of his property.—How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well qualified were theſe <hi>Moſaic</hi> inſtitutions to render the <hi>Hebrew</hi> civil ſtate happy! to promote peace and good order,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022505_0006_0FB9476EC233DBA8"/>
union and tranquility—inſpire friendſhip and mutual confid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—and to diffuſe a ſpirit of piety towards GOD, and of juſtice and equity, truth and fidelity, benevolence and charity, through all the politic body! With great propriety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did Moſes declare that <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s attention to thoſe laws he had given them "was not a vain thing for them; becauſe it was their life:" and that "through this thing they ſhould prolong their life, or days, in the land whither they went over <hi>Jordan</hi> to poſſeſs it."</p>
            <p>RELIGION is admirably adapted to ſoothe the paſſions, calm the reſentments and animoſities, and meliorate the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mankind, and prepare the human nature to reliſh the ſweets of ſociety and friendſhip. But I wiſh to be a little more diffuſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi>—RELIGION enjoins upon Kings, Princes, and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to rule in the fear of JEHOVAH, the Supreme Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the univerſe; it teaches them that they are accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the GOD of Heaven in their political characters, though they may be called gods on earth; religion alſo renders a Magiſtrate auguſt and venerable in the eyes of the people, and therefore gives ſtrength and ſtability to his authority and laws; Many <hi>vicious</hi> Princes and Magiſtrates have indeed obtained ſuch a degree of <hi>authority</hi> over their people, as to <hi>compel</hi> them, through <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>dread,</hi> to yield a <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>hypocritical</hi> compliance with their laws and government; but how prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is that obedience and obſequiouſneſs of a people, who are allured and enticed to obey, by the ſhining examples of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, religion and patriotiſm, which they daily have preſented them by their Princes and Rulers!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>—As religion teaches Princes and Magiſtrates to rule in the fear of GOD, ſo alſo doth it inform them that the emolument and happineſs of the people form the great law of reigning, and the grand deſign of the Magiſtrate's authority. Religion, both <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> teaches civil Rulers to promote and cheriſh the ſocial worſhip of GOD—to found and endow ſchools and ſeminaries of learning—and to adopt and improve every wiſe and benevolent meaſure for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of virtue and literature among their people.—Literature
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022505_0007_0FB9477060646F48"/>
and religion have generally been eſteemed moſt worthy and important objects of the attention of civil Rulers, even among Pagans.</p>
            <p>How did the Kings and Magiſtrates of <hi>Aſſyria, Egypt, Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> endeavour to cultivate letters and theology in their reſpective kingdoms and ſtates! <hi>Belus</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Babylon, Thyoth</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Memphis,</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Jupiter</hi> King of <hi>Crete, Solon</hi> King of <hi>Athens, Numa Pompilius</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not only famous for their own learning and philoſophy, they were alſo eminent for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of literature among their ſubjects. And they were equally zealous to eſtabliſh and cultivate religion, and the public worſhip of the DEITY among their people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thyoth,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Numa,</hi> were ſo ſenſible of the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the civil ſtate derived from religion, that they formed laws for the regulation of religious public ſervices—appointed an order of men, who ſhould devote themſelves entirely to the ſtudy of theology, and the performance of the public rights and ſervices of it; and, to give the greater authority to their religious inſtitutions among their people, they pretended to have received them from the Gods. <hi>Numa</hi> in particular, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the goddeſs <hi>Egeria</hi> nightly communicated to him the ſeveral parts of that religious economy which he eſtabliſhed among the <hi>Romans.</hi> And all hiſtory aſſures us, that religion, mutilated and corrupted as it was, greatly promoted the peace and proſperity of thoſe nations where it was thus eſtabliſhed. It ſtruck the minds of the people with reverence and awe; gave them a veneration for their Kings and Prieſts—and perſuaded them to cultivate the arts of peace and order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>IT is well known that the veneration which Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have generally ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn religion and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath been improved as an objection againſt <hi>revealed religion,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>ſtate engine</hi> or <hi>mere prieſtcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF by religion's being a piece of <hi>prieſtcraft,</hi> be meant, that religion was <hi>invented</hi> by prieſts, the pretence is falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the hiſtory of religion in all nations; ſince that hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry informs us, that there were no prieſts in any nation, till a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022505_0008_0FB94771EEAD2090"/>
national religion became eſtabliſhed, and generally received. If our modern freethinkers mean, that religion was the <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>ſtateſmen</hi> and <hi>politicians,</hi> when they call it a <hi>ſtate engine,</hi> this pretence is as far from truth and fact, as the other, and as contrary to hiſtory. The moſt rational and probable conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and that which is beſt countenanced by the authentic hiſtory of religion in all nations, is, that GOD himſelf inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Antediluvians,</hi> in the principles of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which he required of them, and ſhowed them the manner of performing all its rites and ceremonies. <hi>Noah</hi> came forth of the ark with the religion of the old world, which his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren learned of him. And the <hi>Chineſe</hi> retain to this day the principles of that religion which their great prophet <hi>Fobi,</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> taught them. And that part of <hi>Noah</hi>'s family which travelled weſtward, and, by their deſcendants, ſettled <hi>Nineveh, Babylon, Greece, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. retained for many ages the religion of their progenitor. At length, however, this ancient religion was corrupted, but never entirely loſt among the nations. And therefore religion never was <hi>invented,</hi> though it was greatly <hi>corrupted</hi> both by prieſts and politicians.</p>
            <p>IF the meaning be, that Kings and Princes, Stateſmen and Politicians, have univerſally, in all ages and nations, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion as ſignally beneficial to the civil ſtate; this indeed is very true; and they have ever thought very juſtly of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion when they have thus conſidered it. But by what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement does it become an objection againſt religion, that it greatly promotes the intereſts of communities! We have too much reaſon to believe that ſuch objections againſt religion originate in the ſame manner, that objections againſt reaſon do in ſome men, according to the ſaying of Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> "That when reaſon is againſt a man, then a man will be againſt reaſon." Reaſon is againſt a man who is reſolved to think and act unreaſonably. So is religion againſt men who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to comply with its precepts: and hence the objection againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. RELIGION, if it be kindly entertained, is of ſpecial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the people, in their political capacity, as well as to Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:022505_0009_0FB9477362E92240"/>1. RELIGION injoins upon the people obedience to legal government, and conformity to wiſe and good laws: and this it does in a very humane and generous way, by teaching men the deſign of civil polity and government, its great utility, and even neceſſity, in the world; and that a wiſe and good government is the ordinance of GOD, and on <hi>that</hi> account ought to be very reſpectable among men. Religion informs of the great guilt they contract, who reſiſt a well regulated government; and the imminent danger they expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to; that, "Whoſoever reſiſteth authority, reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD;" and that "they who reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation."—Thus is religion very friendly to the civil ſtate, as it teaches due ſubjection and obedience to wiſe and good laws and government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. RELIGION tends to make men quiet and peaceable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other; as it is deſigned and adapted to eradicate thoſe corrupt paſſions and diſpoſitions of mankind, which are unfriendly to the peace and tranquility of the State.—Anger, envy, revenge, a ſeditious and diviſive ſpirit, a peeviſh, fretful, diſcontented temper, all which vices, as they are moſt unfavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the welfare and proſperity of the public, are diſcount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enanced and forbidden in our holy religion. All deceit in contract, fraud, injuſtice, extortion and rapine, are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly prohibited both in the laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Bribery, corruption and venality, a ſour, unfriendly, uncharitable, malignant temper and diſpoſition—evilſpeaking and ſlander, than which no vices are more prejudicial to the order and harmony of human ſociety, and, together with theſe, the whole black catalogue of unſocial paſſions and vices, are corrected and condemned in the laws of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the religion of our <hi>divine Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THOU ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report; put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſs. Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a cauſe, to decline after many, to wreſt judgment. Neither ſhalt thou countenance a poor man in his cauſe. If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or his aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring it back to him again, If thou ſee the aſs of him
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022505_0010_0FB94774DF0ADA88"/>
that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldeſt forbear to help him; thou ſhalt ſurely help with him. Thou ſhalt not wreſt the judgment of the poor in his cauſe. Keep thee far from a falſe matter; and the innocent and righteous ſlay thou not: for I will not juſtify the wicked." <hi>Exod.</hi> XXIII.1—7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is one great deſign, both of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, to implant in human nature all thoſe ſentiments, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and affections, which are moſt friendly to ſociety; and to engage all the members of the politic body in ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices as naturally tend to ſocial felicity. Strict juſtice and righteouſneſs, both in ſentiment and practice, in all contracts and dealings one with another, is a great command of religion.—"Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in meaſure. Juſt balances, juſt weights, a juſt ephah, and a juſt hin, ſhall ye have: I am JEHOVAH your GOD, who brought you out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>"</p>
            <p>AND how much do juſtice and righteouſneſs tend to advance the honor and welfare of a nation!—Truth and fidelity, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, love and charity, a peaceable, quiet, placa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper, and a ſincere deſire to promote the pleaſure and happineſs of our neighbour; are all of them great maxims of <hi>revealed religion</hi>; and are every where inculcated by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"AND if thou ſelleſt ought unto thy neighbour, or buyeſt ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye ſhall not oppreſs one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; thou ſhalt relieve him: yea, though he be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a ſojourner; that he may live with thee."</p>
            <p>BUT as it happened to the religion of <hi>Noah,</hi> that, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ages, it was corrupted and raviſhed of moſt of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal purity and ſimplicity among the nations; ſo likewiſe that of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhared the ſame fate, in the latter ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate, by the miſtaken gloſſes and interpretations of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> And, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was raiſed up to retrieve the character of, and add perfection to, the ancient religion of <hi>Noah</hi>; ſo JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the great prophet like unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> made it a principal part of his buſineſs on earth, to reſtore the honor of thoſe divine laws given to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022505_0011_0FB94776CC202040"/>
preſent them to mankind dreſſed in their native purity and ſimplicity, with the moſt ſpiritual and ſublime annotations upon them.</p>
            <p>HENCE we find him repeating this expreſſion, "Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time:" referring to the falſe comments of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> doctors upon the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR a ſpecimen of our SAVIOUR's method of teaching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity out of the laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> permit me to recite a part of one of his lectures.</p>
            <p>"YE have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill: and whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the judgment." It ſeems, by what follows, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> doctors extended the prohibition no farther than the outward act of murder, not comprehending therein the inward temper and diſpoſition of the heart: and therefore our SAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IOUR adds his own comment. "But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever is <hi>angry</hi> with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgment; and whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, <hi>Raca,</hi>" i.e. you beggarly fellow; "ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the council; but whoſoever ſhall ſay, <hi>thou fool,</hi> ſhall be in danger of hellfire."</p>
            <p>And inſtead of <hi>hating</hi> an <hi>enemy,</hi> which the <hi>Scribes</hi> admitted, our SAVIOUR commands, "to <hi>love</hi> our enemies, <hi>bleſs</hi> them that <hi>curſe</hi> us, do <hi>good</hi> to them that <hi>hate</hi> us, and to <hi>pray</hi> for them who <hi>deſpitefully</hi> uſe, and <hi>perſecute</hi> us."</p>
            <p>No wonder the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate declined, when they had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> however happy it might have been, if that nation had regarded them in their true intention.</p>
            <p>IF men ſhould deal juſtly and uprightly one with another, if truth and fidelity ſhould influence all their mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if all ſhould wiſh well to all, and, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective capacities and places, ſhould endeavour to promote the univerſal good—if mankind ſhould generally be compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and merciful, both to the ſouls and bodies of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men, if they ſhould refrain from all malevolent and evil ſpeaking—be very delicate and tender in their treatment of perſons and characters—if they ſhould heartily love their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022505_0012_0FB94777DEDEF440"/>
country, and be willing, not only to ſacrifice their private reſentments, but their perſonal intereſts alſo, to promote the public weal and proſperity; how happy would human ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be, and how near a reſemblance would it form to that bright world of harmony and friendſhip that is above!</p>
            <p n="3">III. IF we reflect on the wiſe, holy and juſt providence of GOD, we ſhall ſee reaſon to conſider religion as moſt friendly to the happineſs of ſocial life.</p>
            <p>FROM the partial and unequal diſtributions of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards individuals, whether virtuous or vicious, in this world, it hath been very juſtly inferred, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous governor of the univerſe deſigns ſome future time and place, when and where he will rectify all the partial adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his providence, and adequately reward the virtues, and puniſh the vices of individuals, and cauſe the rectoral honor and dignity of his moral government of mankind to appear, and be acknowledged by the aſſembled univerſe.</p>
            <p>ON this ſuppoſition, it is no objection againſt the rectitude of the moral government of the world, that virtue, in individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, ſhould ſigh and mourn, be afflicted, and obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the numberleſs ills of human life; whilſt vice is gay and ſportive, free from pain, and regaling itſelf in all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſenſe.—The proſpect of that other world, where virtue will triumph, and where vice, in its turn, will be doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to weeping and woe, and to endure the evils it hath incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here, clears up the ſcene, and vindicates the honor and juſtice of divine adminiſtration. But with civil ſociety, with kingdoms and ſtates, it is far otherwise; and a different method of reaſoning muſt be adopted. The future ſtate, which religion reveals, knows no man in a <hi>political,</hi> or <hi>national</hi> capacity; and therefore will not either reward, or puniſh mankind in the <hi>ſocial,</hi> but in the <hi>individual</hi> and <hi>perſonal</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>only.</hi> Hence it is juſt and reaſonable to inter <hi>a priori,</hi> that it hath been, and ever will be, the invariable <hi>maxim</hi> of the ſupreme moral government, to treat all nations, and political ſocieties, according to their public character, being virtuous or vicious. And, if we revolve the hiſtory of mankind, we ſhall ſurely find, that virtuous nations have ever been proſperous
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022505_0013_0FB94779649CAA58"/>
and happy, ſo long as they retained their virtue; and that vicious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, at one time or another, have been ſignally puniſhed, in the providence of almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>WHEN the prophets foretold the fall and ruin of the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Perſian, Egyptian, Greecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> empires, they inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably alledged their national corruptions and vices, as the cauſe of their national deſtruction.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Babylon</hi> was to be ſubverted, the prophet ſays, "A grievous viſion is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherouſly, and the ſpoiler ſpoileth. Go up, O <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> beſiege, O <hi>Medid.</hi>" Deceit, treachery, fraud and rapine, were the national vices of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Meeds</hi> are divinely commiſſioned to go up, beſiege and deſtroy <hi>Babylon</hi>; as they afterwards did under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Cyrus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyre</hi> was deſtroyed for her pride, preſumption and luxury, "Who hath taken this counſel againſt <hi>Tyre,</hi> the crowning ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe merchants are princes, whoſe traffickers are the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable of the earth? The Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed it, to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> empire fell by their vices, as we are abundantly informed, both by ſacred and profane hiſtory.—<hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed long, a renowned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> obſerves, that the mighty ſucceſs, and long proſperity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> were owing to their emin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent virtue, and given them of God, as a reward for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed juſtice, temperance, and other national virtues.—But when <hi>Rome</hi> became corrupt, her ancient virtue gone, and luxury, intemperance, and all kinds of vices became prevalent throughout the empire, ſhe, in her turn, fell a prey to the <hi>Huns, Goths, Vandals,</hi> and other northern nations; which gave occaſion to the ſatyre of <hi>Juvenal—Seevior armis luxuria incubuit, victumque ulc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:022505_0014_0FB9477AE2AAC568"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> told the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that, if they would adhere to thoſe moral laws and ſtatures, which he had been divinely authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enact for them, it ſhould be their life; and ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their national proſperity and happineſs in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And herein that great and good man acted, not as a wiſe and able ſtateſman <hi>only,</hi> but as a moſt affectionate patriot, and lover of his nation: preſenting <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a glorious ſcene of national dignity and importance, tranquility and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and a golden age perpetuated, upon the preſumption of their future virtue and obedience; and a dreadful reverſe of fortune, in caſe of vice and diſobedience. "And it ſhall come to paſs," ſaith he, "if thou ſhalt hearken diligently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the voice of the LORD thy GOD, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and to do all his commandments, which O command thee this day, that the LORD thy GOD will ſet thee on high above all nations of the earth. And all theſe bleſſings ſhall come on thee, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee, if thou ſhalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy GOD. The LORD ſhall cauſe thine enemies that riſe up againſt thee, to be ſmitten before thy face: they ſhalt come out againſt thee one way, and flee before thee ſeven ways. The LORD ſhall command the bleſſing upon thee in thy ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and in all that thou ſetteſt thy hand unto; and he ſhall bleſs thee in the land which the LORD thy GOD giveth thee. The LORD ſhall eſtabliſh thee an holy people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he hath ſworn unto thee, if thou ſhalt keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the LORD thy GOD, and walk in his ways. And all people of the earth ſhall ſee that thou art called by the name of JEHOVAH, and they ſhall be afraid of thee. And the LORD ſhall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD ſware to thy fathers to give thee."</p>
            <p>BUT if the <hi>Hebrews</hi> rebelled againſt JEHOVAH, and became corrupt and vicious in their national character and manners, how awfully ſhould their fortune be reverſed! "If thou wilt not obſerve to do all the words of this law, that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book, that thou mayeſt fear this glorious name, JEHOVAH thy GOD. Then the LORD will make thy plagues
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022505_0015_0FB9477C5CB5ABA0"/>
wonderful, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and ſore ſickneſſes, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. And ye ſhall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the ſtars of Heaven for multitude; becauſe thou wouldeſt not obey the voice of the LORD thy GOD. And it ſhall come to paſs, that, as JEHOVAH rejoiced over thee to do thee good, and to multiply thee; ſo JEHOVAH will rejoice over thee to deſtroy thee, and to bring thee to nought: and ye ſhall be plucked from off the land whither thou goeſt to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it. And the LORD ſhall ſcatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth, even unto the other; and there ſhalt thou ſerve other gods, which neither thou, nor thy fathers have known, even wood and ſtone." Deut. XXVIII.</p>
            <p>AND the hiſtory of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> informs, that theſe promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and threatenings of <hi>Moſes</hi> were perpetually verified in the ſtate and circumſtances of that nation.</p>
            <p>WHILST <hi>Iſrael</hi> were virtuous, and attended to the laws of JEHOVAH, they were proſperous and happy, and a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable nation; when they degenerated, and became corrupt and vicious, and diſregarded the commandments of JEHOVAH, they were diſaſtrous and wretched, a ſcorn and deriſion among the nations which dwelt around them, and a ſorry prey to their enemies.</p>
            <p>INDEED the divine adminiſtrations towards the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er derived their complexion from the moral character and conduct of that nation: and, although their ſituation was ſomewhat different from that of other nations, being made a <hi>theocracy,</hi> and placed under the more immediate inſpection of JEHOVAH, as their <hi>civil,</hi> as well as <hi>moral King</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi>; yet all <hi>other nations,</hi> as well as the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> were under the <hi>moral government</hi> of JEHOVAH; were his creatures, endued with reaſon, and indulged with many natural, civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious privileges, sufficient for all the purpoſes of virtue, and of moral inſtitution and discipline; though much inferior to thoſe which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> enjoyed. Hence the reaſon why all the nations of the earth have ever been, and ever will be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to GOD, as a <hi>moral governor,</hi> in their <hi>national capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>—And as GOD hath ever treated all the nations of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022505_0016_0FB94781AA7A7F18"/>
earth, in every age, according to their national character and conduct, and either bleſſed, or frowned upon them, as they have been generally virtuous or vicious; ſo have we the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon to believe he will invariably treat mankind in all ſucceeding ages and nations, in the ſame manner, and by the ſame rule. It is a catholic and perpetual maxim of revelation, verified by the experience of all ages and nations, that "righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exalteth a nation;" and that, "ſin is the reproach of any people."</p>
            <p>RELIGION, in its own nature and tendency, is admirably calculated to render a nation reſpectable and illuſtrious abroad, as well as proſperous and happy at home: whilſt ſin, vice, immorality and diſſoluteneſs of manners, as naturally tend to fix a public indelible ſtigma and reproach upon a nation, and to fill it with factions and diviſions, render its internal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wretched and miſerable, and bring it to an untimely death: for nations, politic bodies, ſicken, languiſh, and die, as well as natural bodies; and virtue is the health, and cauſes the longevity of nations; whilſt vice is their diſeaſe, and a ſad, though certain, preſage of a premature political death.</p>
            <p>WE have alſo ſeen that the providence of GOD, the ſupreme monarch of the univerſe, favors virtuous, whilſt it invariably frowns upon vicious, nations.</p>
            <p>FROM the nature and tendency of religion therefore, and the juſt and holy providence of GOD, we may with great truth and ſafety conclude, that all political communities will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable, as they ſhall be virtuous or vicious.</p>
            <p>I SHALL comprehend the improvement of the preceding diſcourſe in a few addreſſes, which are cuſtomary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore decent and reſpectful, on ſuch occaſions as the preſent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Chief Magiſtrate in this commonwealth claims my firſt attention.</p>
            <p>MAY it pleaſe your Excellency to indulge me a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, whilſt I make an inference or two, which may ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to the office and duty of gentlemen who fill the chief places of power and truſt in the civil State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT it is the peculiar and indeſpenſable duty of civil Magiſtrates, to be perſonally virtuous, is an inference, which,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022505_0017_0FB94786CA55B0E0"/>
I doubt that your Excellency hath already anticipated.—A wiſe magiſtrate would be virtuous, not only to eſtabliſh and adorn his own character, and to obtain the approbation of HIM, who is infinitely greater and more illuſtruous than all the Kings and Potentates of the earth; but from a rational and well regulated affection to his country. A patriotic ſpirit will excite and animate him to a virtuous and religious life.—A vicious and diſſolute Magiſtrate is a misſhapen monſtrous character! He neither loves himſelf, his country, nor his GOD! He certainly can be no true patriot, let his profeſſions be what they may: Religion the glory and ſafety of the State—an irreligious profane Magiſtrate conſulting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the welfare of the State! how contradictious and abſurd an idea!—Virtue in high life hath a commanding and ſovereign influence. The examples of the great may do much to cheriſh and promote religion; or, they may have a moſt pernicious tendency, if vicious, to patronize and ſpread the contagion of vice and evil manners: a Magiſtrate, therefore, ſhould make it his great ambition that his own character be fair and good, and that he preſent a noble and enticing pattern of virtue and religion before all the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A WISE and good Magiſtrate will improve all the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his ſtation and authority give him, to promote virtue and religion among the people.</p>
            <p>IF religion be the life and glory of a nation, and the moſt important art of prolonging the dignity and happineſs of civil ſociety; a wiſe and virtuous Magiſtrate will moſt ardently wiſh to be an inſtrument of the promotion of religion among his people; and will uſe his utmoſt prudent endeavors to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance its reputation, render it faſhionable, and cauſe it to be cheriſhed and cultivated.</p>
            <p>SUCH a Magiſtrate will be concerned to procure for the DEITY, for his holy words, his ſabbaths, ordinances and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the ſolemn attention, the profound reſpect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are indiſputably their due. He will wiſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his influence that a ſpirit of justice, fidelity, peace and charity inſpire all ranks and orders of men: and, in his exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, he will maintain a conſtant regard to theſe worthy
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022505_0018_0FB947895F02A8E0"/>
deſigns, in all the buſineſs of legiſlation, and execution of the laws in the State: indeed the honor, tranquility and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the community, in the conſtant practice of virtue and religion, and entire ſecurity in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, will coſtitute the noble deſign of the political life of a wiſe and good Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency's known character, and the general ſuffrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of your brethren, by which you have been many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the chair of ſtate, warrant my belief, that your duty to GOD and this people hath long warmed and animated your heart; and, that what is ſuggeſted concerning the obligations of a Magiſtrate, will be kindly accepted by you, Sir, though theſe things may be far better conceived in your own mind, than I am able to expreſs them.</p>
            <p>BE pleaſed, Sir, to have patience with me a little farther, whilſt I include your Excellency in an addreſs to the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able General Aſſembly convened in this houſe, at whoſe requeſt I perform this part this day.</p>
            <p>MAY it pleaſe his <hi>honor</hi> the Lieutenant governor, the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counſellors, and the venerable Repreſentatives of the State, in General Aſſembly convened, to indulge me a little; whilſt I, within the limits of my own province, ſuggeſt a few things, which may claim your attention, as the Legiſlature of a great and growing people, whom you moſt certainly wiſh to make reſpectable and happy.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE honor and worſhip of the DEITY are ſurely objects of ſuch magnitude and importance, as may well demand your firſt attention.</p>
            <p>No nation under heaven ever was politically happy, or proſpered long, without ſome practical reverence of GOD, and attention to his worſhip. The great JEHOVAH hath declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all Judges of the earth." How then can a Legiſlature of <hi>Theiſts,</hi> much leſs a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Legiſlature, diſcharge, either their duty to GOD, or the truſt repoſed in them by the community, whilſt they neglect to adore and worſhip GOD themſelves, or to improve their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he be adored and worſhipped by the people!—An
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022505_0019_0FB9478AA35FADE8"/>
oath for confirmation, and the termination of controverſy, is a ſolemn appeal to GOD: if all reverence of GOD, and ſacred regard to religion, were extinguiſhed, the ſolemnity of an oath is abſolutely gone, and, with its ſolemnity, its binding force and obligation are at once taken away; and nothing then remains to iſſue, even civil cauſes, but the ſword! and we may depend, that the ſword will not be ſufficient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe long, after all religion is gone. Indeed reaſon, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, and the experience of all ages, and of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether <hi>Pagan, Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> conſpire to dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtrate that religion is neceſſary to the very <hi>being,</hi> as well as to the <hi>wellbeing</hi> of the civil State. To encourage and promote religion and the worſhip of GOD, by wiſe and good laws, muſt therefore be the indiſpenſable duty of a <hi>Chriſtian Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAY I not, venerable Senators, addreſs you as <hi>St. Paul</hi> did King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with the neceſſary variation? <hi>Believe ye this report of religion, and of your duty concerning it? I know that ye believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As means for the encouragement of a reverential regard to GOD, and the promotion of virtue and religion, a proper reſpect to the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi> the local wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD, and a learned and judicious miniſtry, are objects which may well claim your attention. It has been the moſt generally received opinion of all ages, and of all nations, that it is the duty and intereſt of Magiſtrates to eſtabliſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public worſhip of the DEITY amongſt their people.</p>
            <p>IT would be treating you, honored Gentlemen, with unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable diſreſpect, even to ſuppoſe that you heſitated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſerious regard to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the maintenance of ſocial worſhip, were ſpecially ſerviceable to the civil intereſts of the State. You explode, worthy Senators, the too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>cant</hi> expreſſion, that the Magiſtrate, <hi>as Magiſtrate,</hi> has nothing to do with religion, or the public worſhip of the DEITY; nor do you ſuppoſe that your obligations <hi>as men,</hi> are tendered void, by your being elected into places of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> in the <hi>State—as men,</hi> every one concedes, you are bound to glorify GOD. You do not imagine that, being a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:022505_0020_0FB9478C2B5F7460"/>
liberates <hi>a man</hi> from his obligations to glorify God; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, as his exalted ſtation gives him greater advantages to glorify God, his obligations of this nature are proportionably increaſed.</p>
            <p>No man has lived forty years and not obſerved the ſalutary effects of keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and attending public worſhip, in the families, ſocieties, towns, ſtates, and kingdoms, where he hath been acquainted.</p>
            <p>ALL the wiſe nations, even of <hi>Pagan antiquity,</hi> not only framed laws and inſtitutions for the ſupport of the ſocial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Gods, but alſo appointed an order of men, who ſhould devote their time and talents to inveſtigate and teach the doctrines and precepts of theology and ethics, and perform all the public rites and ceremonies of religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtian theology</hi> and <hi>ethics</hi> are undoubtedly <hi>as</hi> beneficial to the civil intereſts of communities, as were the <hi>Pagan</hi>—I need not repeat what has already been ſaid abundantly, of the happy tendency of the laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the civil ſtate—Filling the public profeſſions, both in <hi>church</hi> and <hi>ſtate,</hi> with men of <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> is of infinite ſervice to the intereſts of both.—Meer pretenders to <hi>divinity, law,</hi> or <hi>phyſic,</hi> ought to be diſcountenanced by all, who wiſh to promote the public intereſt. We have, and it is to be much lamented, ſome weak brethren, who would be as highly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the indigeſted, incoherent harangues of an illiterate pretender in the pulpit, as with the beſt compoſed ſermons of the moſt learned and able divine!—I cannot ſay that ſuch weak infantile ſtomachs ought to be entirely deprived of <hi>milk</hi>—I wiſh they may not attempt to infringe the rights and privileges of their <hi>adult brethren,</hi> who are both capable and deſirous of eating <hi>ſtronger meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE cauſe of literature will, I doubt not, be thought worthy an eminent place in your political deliberations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thyoth,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Numa,</hi> thoſe wiſe legiſlators of <hi>Gentile antiquity,</hi> and a great number of others, who might be named, if needful, were zealous patrons of literature and of learned men—It was a maxim with the wiſe <hi>Romans—That it very much concerned the common good, that youth be well educated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022505_0021_0FB9478DA2D459F0"/>WHAT a figure, my political fathers, would <hi>America</hi> have made, in her great national character, in the late war with <hi>Britain,</hi> without men of learning and information at the head of public affairs!—<hi>American pens</hi> were almoſt as ſerviceable to our country's important cauſe, as <hi>American arms,</hi> in that glorious ſtruggle for liberty.</p>
            <p>WE, who are now actors on the theatre of life, ſhall ſoon be called off;—a new ſet of comedians will riſe and take our places:—And how will our illiterate and uninformed children fill thoſe places in church and ſtate, which the great arbiter, death, will quickly leave deſtitute! From our ſchools and ſeminaries we expect our children to receive the rudiments of that literature and information, which, when perfected by reading, ſtudy, converſation, and travelling, may prepare them to appear with dignity and uſefulneſs in the pulpit, at the bar, on the bench, or in the phyſical department.</p>
            <p>YOUR Honors are ſenſible there is a ſpecial call to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this State, to encourage the education of our youth: the population of the State moſt rapidly increaſing—towns planting, and churches forming in the wilderneſs—but few gentlemen of literature, and thorough education, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively, yet ſettled among us—a daily increaſe of employment in all the learned profeſſions, and in every branch of public buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I MOST heartily wiſh, and humbly truſt, reſpectable Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that the glory of GOD, the honor of religion, and the welfare and proſperity of this riſing republic, may influence and animate all your deliberations, and give complexion to all your laws and ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN of the Sacred Character claim my next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
            <p>MY Reverend Fathers and Brethren, you have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reflect, that the religion you preach is not only divine, as having all the credentials neceſſary to authenticate its celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial original, but that it is alſo a religion which wears a moſt favorable and benign aſpect upon human ſociety, and ſocial life:—a religion in its own nature and tendency adapted to rectify the diſorders of the human heart—to eradicate every
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022505_0022_0FB9478F91143910"/>
unfriendly and unſociable ſentiment, paſſion, and affection; and to implant and cheriſh every generous and noble ſentiment, and every kindly ſocial grace and virtue:—a religion evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſing a principal part of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s vaſt and ſtupend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſystem of moral government, which he originally deſigned, and hath ever conducted, for the perfection and happineſs of man, as a rational and ſocial being.</p>
            <p>You alſo enjoy the ſublime pleſure of the reflection that, whilſt you endeavor ſtudiouſly to inveſtigate, and faithfully to teach, the doctrines and precepts of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> you co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the ſacred <hi>Trinity,</hi> in conducting the divine deſign of infinite love and grace to man!</p>
            <p>FROM ſuch reflections you may derive divine encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fidelity, and ſufficient ſupport under all the evils and temptations incident to <hi>man,</hi> or peculiar to the <hi>clergyman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the patience of this great and very reſpectable auditory be not quite gone, I would addreſs myſelf in the laſt place to this whole aſſembly preſent.—My brethren and friends, the ſubject which we have had under conſideration preſents indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals in the civil State with many important motives and arguments to perſuade to the practice of virtue and religion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT love of his country, which every one ought to cheriſh, may be improved as a powerful motive to religion. Individuals are the conſtituent parts of communities and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the real character of individuals, therefore, will give complexion to the character of the nation, of which they are parts. A virtuous nation, compoſed of vicious individuals, is an inadmiſſible ſoleciſm in ethics. If we wiſh our dear native country happy, we muſt wiſely reſolve to become perſonally virtuous. Virtue is neceſſary to the proſperity of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and nation—national virtue is compoſed of that which the individuals of any nation practice: love to our country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore involves in it a due reſpect to virtue: hence one who indulges himſelf in the practice of vice, cannot, with truth and propriety, be called a lover of his country; becauſe he manifeſts a diſregard to that which all hiſtory, both ſacred and profane, demonſtrates to be neceſſary to its happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022505_0023_0FB947909CDC13A8"/>2. AFFECTION to our deareſt earthly connections and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, furniſhes us with another very engaging and tender motive to religion.</p>
            <p>OUR wives, our children, and other dear connections and friends, whoſe happineſs is involved in that of their country, call loudly upon us, though with the moſt alluring ſoftneſs and delicacy, to put in practice religion, which may inſure the proſperity and happineſs of our common country.</p>
            <p>How can we have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to aſſume the character of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> and <hi>generous,</hi> and yet be deaf to the voice of ſuch wiſe and ſenſible charmers!</p>
            <p>WE may alſo conſider, that, probably, many of our deareſt connections, if not in themſelves, yet in their deſcendants, muſt abide the fate of their country for ages yet to come: we hope to be perpetuated in our poſterity to the lateſt age—do we not wiſh to leave our country to thoſe dear parts of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who may ſurvive us, under the protection of Heaven, encircled by the kindeſt paternal providence, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in peace and proſperity!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> evidently did not confine his views to that generation which <hi>Joſhua</hi> introduced into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when he recommended religion to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>—"And through this thing ye ſhall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over <hi>Jordan</hi> to poſſeſs it."—If <hi>Moſes</hi> hath any reſpect to the longevity of the men of that generation, yet, no doubt, he hath a principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the proſperity and happineſs of ſucceſſive generations in that promiſed land—and he plainly informs them, that their obedience to GOD would prolong their political life: i.e. they ſhould continue a nation, and a happy nation too, ſo long as they ſhould maintain their integrity, and continue obedient to the commandments of JEHOVAH.</p>
            <p>How can we endure the thought of rendering the ſituation of our families, and of thoſe beings who have derived a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary exiſtence from us, wretched and miſerable, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which, at once, proclaims us bereſt of natural affection, and of gratitude to GOD!—And how will the reflection ſet upon our minds when we come to die, that we have entailed the curſe of Heaven upon our country, and conſequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022505_0024_0FB9479220FE4A00"/>
thoſe who may perpetuate our name for long ages yet to come! that, by our vices, we have provoked the GOD of our fathers, and ſold our country and our poſterity to foreign ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, who may burn and lay waſte this goodly land, carry our children captives, or chain them here to vaſſalage and ſlavery, far more cruel than death!—My friends, I fear we do not conſider what we are about, and what infinite and unutterable miſeries we are involving our country and our children in, whilſt we are indulging ourſelves in vice!</p>
            <p n="3">3, ONCE more—A proper regard to our own happineſs, which is moſt intimately connected with that of our country, ought to influence us to the love and practice of religion.</p>
            <p>WHO would chooſe to live in a country, in which tyranny and deſpotiſm on the one hand, or anarchy and confuſion on the other, had either enſlaved the people, or involved them in civil diſcords and diſſentions, too intollerable either to be borne, or eaſily removed!—Yet irreligion and profaneneſs tend directly to the introduction of theſe, or greater evils; for, as that man is unfit to govern others, who cannot govern himſelf—ſo that nation which is enſlaved to vice, is juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to be made a ſlave to foreign power.</p>
            <p>MAY the objects which are deareſt to us on earth—may natural and parental affection—may the tender and delicate ties of friendſhip—may love to that country in which we firſt drew our vital breath, and in which we yet live—may a prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſpect to our own peace and pleasure whilſt we live, and eſpecially a regard to that tranquility of mind and manly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, which may encourage and ſupport us in a dying hour—may any, may all theſe motives conſpiring, excite us to a timely and ſerious attention to the things of our political peace, and perſuade us to live in the practice of thoſe graces and virtues which are the honor and protection of a nation; and alſo to improve all the power and influence of our reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive ſtations and capacities, to recommend religion to our families, our neighbours, and our country; that it may uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevail, and become as a munition of rocks, and an impregnable bulwark to our nation.</p>
