            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PLYMOUTH controverſy hath made a great noiſe in the country: It hath been of long ſtanding, and very various have been the reports about it: That peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have right conceptions of the matter, I publiſhed my Eſſays. They have now met with an anſwer; whether it be full and ſufficient, muſt be left to the world to judge. What <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had in the affair, I am not able with preciſion to determine; but there are evident traces of <hi>another hand</hi> in ſeveral parts of his reply; the natural effect of his <hi>famous journey by night.</hi> But whoever was concerned, ſince he is pleaſed to <hi>father</hi> the whole, I ſhall treat it as his general offspring. It has been <hi>long</hi> a preparing; the reaſon of this delay I know not: Word was given out in mid-winter (after a certain <hi>packet</hi> was received) that it would ſoon be ready; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not upon the ſtage, till late in the ſpring. One would naturally think, that after ſo long a time it would come forth more perfect, and be a thorough anſwer to every thing that I had alledged: But this is not the caſe; ſeveral things of great
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012739_0004_0F8BEA86B9635478"/>importance are left almoſt wholly unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, and ſentences and ſcraps of ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are picked out here and there, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at a ſtrange rate, and the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations are innumerable: A method of proceedure tending to bewilder the reader, and perpetuate the controverſy: Inſtead of throwing light, it only throws darkneſs on the ſubject. It may perhaps gain the applauſe of the vulgar (for whom it ſeems eſpecially calculated) and raiſe their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt me; but men of learning and penetration will eaſily ſee, that the merits of the cauſe are not touched.</p>
            <p>The cauſe indeed, that he is pleading, looks with a good face: The purity of churches, keeping out unregenerates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſounds pleaſing and captivating to <hi>ſerious ſouls,</hi> and they will be ready to riſe in arms againſt any one whom he repreſents as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church (which is an <hi>incloſed garden</hi>) a meer common, or a cage for every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and hateful bird. By the like ſounds, the <hi>ſeparates</hi> inſnared many zealous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people in the late day, and gained great advantages againſt the eſtabliſhed churches. And will he tread in their ſteps? For my part I am as much for a <hi>godly diſcipline</hi> as he (which is much wanted;) but at the ſame time am for allowing all privileges
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012739_0005_0F8BEA87F9485E20"/>to <hi>"proper members"</hi> of the church when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſked for, if they are not guilty of <hi>cenſurable evil.</hi> And as for <hi>practice,</hi> is he more <hi>ſtrict</hi> than his brethren? BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL MEN, that Mr <hi>R.</hi> hath been, ever ſince his ſettlement, as large in his admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or in his <hi>practical charity</hi> as I could deſire or any miniſter I know, and perhaps larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſome inſtances than I ſhould have been. And <hi>even now</hi> I have reaſon to think, that he would exclude none that ſhould apply (if they would come to full communion) whom Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> would have received. At leaſt it is evident from his <hi>piece</hi> (as well as practice) that he would receive them at <hi>ſecond hand,</hi> if any ſuch ſhould remove into his pariſh, or be occaſionally preſent on communion days; and that he is even will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold communion in all other ways, with ſuch churches as are built on Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s plan; (ſee <hi>p.</hi> 63.) which is a much greater <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> than any he endeavors to faſten on me.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned <hi>diſcipline,</hi> let me drop a tear that it is ſo much neglected. It is lamentable to think, that the church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of children is looked upon as ſuch a little thing; they ſeem to be left by the church as lambs in a large paſture; little or no care is taken of them; all proper
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012739_0006_0F8BEA8897721EF8"/>reſtraint ſeems almoſt at an end. And even when ſuch are ſpoken of by others, they are treated as no part of the church; or if as really <hi>without,</hi> and communicants <hi>only</hi> were members. Hence how frequent the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, "ſuch a one was admitted into the church at ſuch a time; ſuch a one is not a member, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" when in reality they were <hi>complete members</hi> before. This <hi>by cuſtom</hi> is ſo riveted in the minds of many, that they cannot get rid of the notion; hence natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe prejudices againſt the practice we are pleading for, as if it was a proſtitution of ordinances to thoſe that <hi>do not belong to the church.</hi> But this is not the caſe in other churches at a diſtance, neither was it ſo with us from the beginning. Our fathers always treated <hi>baptized perſons</hi> as <hi>members,</hi> as I have noted in the Eſſays, and exerciſed diſcipline over them as much as over communicants. And why is it not ſo at this day? Surely, if primitive diſcipline were revived and kept up with rigor, and miniſters would duly diſcharge their duty in training up the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizati</hi> for the Lord's-table (as the two Mr. <hi>Henrys,</hi> Mr. <hi>Havel</hi> and others have done) there would ſoon be little occaſion for the preſent controverſy.</p>
            <p>It is further matter of grief and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that there are ſo few <hi>proper ſubjects</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012739_0007_0F8BEA8FB450F5A8"/>of diſcipline; I mean that there are ſuch an amazing number of <hi>unbaptized perſons</hi> among us. For (ſurprizing to tell) it is affirmed by ſome who beſt know the circumſtances of the town, that there are at leaſt <hi>two thirds,</hi> if not <hi>three quarters,</hi> of the children in this place, who remain unbaptized. And is this a <hi>proper ſeaſon</hi> to lay ſtill <hi>further reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on the ordinance of baptiſm? What ſhall we then come to (according to an ordinary courſe of providence) at laſt? In what ſituation will the next generation be? And what is as ſurprizing to tell, I never heard <hi>one whole ſermon</hi> ſince my return to the town, reproving this neglect: But it has only been touched upon two or three times in ſome tranſient expreſſions, and blended with other particulars. The moſt that he ever ſaid on this head was in thoſe ſermons he mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 2. and then he ſtood upon it but a few minutes: His ſtrength being chiefly exhauſted on the head of <hi>qualifications;</hi> and <hi>coming without gracious ſincerity,</hi> appeared in a much more awful light, than <hi>not coming at all</hi> (direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 14.) In other places, I think all over <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to compute the number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by the number of <hi>chriſtenings:</hi> From
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012739_0008_0F8BEA8FE15C8318"/>whence we may infer what their general practice is. But if ſuch computation ſhould be made in the public prints reſpecting us by the <hi>number of chriſtenings,</hi> we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a place diminutive indeed (though the firſt in <hi>New-England</hi>) and hardly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt public notice.</p>
            <p>But not to inlarge further. I ſhall cloſe this preface with obſerving a few things relative both to his and my reply.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>his</hi>—The reader cannot but take notice how he, every where, both in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and book, links in the brethern with him. He ſeems only to ſtand forth in their behalf and to plead their cauſe, and ſpeaks of himſelf as but one of many who were diſſatisfied with the practice; withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, that all the ſtrokes I had againſt him were aqually leveled againſt them. This method he takes (out of policy) to ingratiate himſelf, and to faſten them the more to him. Whereas in fact "it is he <hi>alone,</hi> that is the ſource and ſpring of all; and if he ſhould once ceaſe his oppoſition, I doubt not the reſt would do ſo too: If he ſhould tell them (as <hi>Roger Williams</hi> did his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,) "that he had miſled them, that he was now convinced that he was in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and that prayer and ſtudy had brought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012739_0009_0F8BEA90CC156A10"/>him to be of another mind." There is not a man of them, I believe, but would acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, and be intirely eaſy with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the practice. I would further notice his frequent phraſe, <hi>my ſcheme, my plan,</hi> &amp;c. as if I was ſingular in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and differed from all the world beſides. Whereas in <hi>the main</hi> I agree with my <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and brethren in the point: But we, enjoying <hi>their</hi> light and ſtanding on their ſhoulders, may poſſibly make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of things they did but juſt glance at: As Dr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> have made great improvements of ſome caſual hints thrown out by Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now in regard of the <hi>anſwer</hi> here exhibited, I have compleated it, without taking a journey by night. And I have <hi>preſumed</hi> to make it, although ſome of his chief men have given out, that his piece was "deciſive and unanſwerable;" and although he himſelf hath ſaid, "that <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> controverſy, he believed, would "be a means of baniſhing the half-way practice out of this part of the country;" as much as to ſay, that <hi>his book</hi> would produce this marvellous effect. Whether it will or no, time muſt diſcover: But there ſeems lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle proſpect of it at preſent; for I have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012739_0010_0F8BEA9140004650"/>heard it obſerved by ſeveral, that in leſs than a week after his books came up, they ſeemed to be as <hi>dead</hi> almoſt as if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a being; no exultations, no triumphs, no congratulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were heard of, and indeed but little diſcourſe about them. So that it ſeemed to ſome almoſt unneceſſary to make a reply: But upon ſeveral accounts, it appears to me (as well as to others) abſolutely neceſſary: And the reader will perhaps be of the ſame mind, before he has done.</p>
            <p>But to come to what I more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to obſerve.</p>
            <p>In regard of the <hi>general controverſy,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be remembred, that all my pleas go upon this ſuppoſition, that there will be unregenerate perſons in the church: And the ſame ſuppoſition muſt be made upon his plan, or any plan whatſoever. According to the ſtandard Chriſt gives his church, they <hi>cannot be kept out:</hi> And if they are in already, they <hi>muſt not be caſt out,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plain proofs of their unregeneracy. ſhould this be the caſe of any, they muſt be left to God and <hi>their own conſcience.</hi> In the mean time, the church ought to treat them as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members, and grant them the privileges they aſk for: And if they (or the paſtor
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012739_0011_0F8BEA921F25F020"/>alone) upon conjectures and ſuſpicions go about to exclude them, they act an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable part, ſuch privileges being their <hi>proper birth-right</hi> by <hi>divine grant,</hi> till ſuch time as an abſolute forfeiture be made, and full conviction takes place. And this I deſire may be kept in mind.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to the <hi>particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy</hi>—I am really grieved, that I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to continue it. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> might have prevented it with three or four words ſpeaking. But he was too <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>grand</hi> to make the leaſt conceſſion. And he muſt take the conſequence. I am ſure I take no delight in expoſing him: But a regard to truth, my own reputation, and even the intereſt of religion obliged me to clear myſelf of his aſperſions: I ſay, the <hi>intereſt of religion.</hi> For who will regard any thing I advance in the general controverſy, if they think me ſuch a man as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> repreſents me to be? I am aſtoniſhed, that he ſhould take the liberties he has done; that he ſhould give ſuch ſcope to miſrepreſentation and abuſe, when he could not but know how eaſily he might be detected: But I ſuppoſe he thought, that either his <hi>great name</hi> or <hi>popularity,</hi> would bear down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, or that I ſhould be uncapable of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012739_0012_0F8BEA9467DE5C20"/>anſwering the <hi>argumentative part</hi> of his book: And if ſo, that it would be an idle attempt for me ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But perhaps in both, or either, he will find himſelf diſappointed. In the following reply, I have endeavored to treat him with moderation and temper, and to avoid perſonal reflections and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations as much as poſſible: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the charges he hath brought againſt me (many of them unneceſſarily, merely to load me with obloquy and reproach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt advantage to his cauſe,) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it neceſſary for me ſometimes to touch on that ſtring, though in very gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, conſidering the occaſion. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his preface, <q>That his people judged it needful for him to vindicate himſelf from the unkind aſperſions I had caſt upon him, leaſt his character and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſhould be hurt among ſtrangers.</q> But if what I have heard be true, this was <hi>judged needful</hi> merely by a <hi>junto</hi> of them, and that the <hi>major part</hi> were rather againſt his writing, and would have been glad if he had forbore, leſt it ſhould make matters <hi>more deſparate</hi> than ever; as appears now to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012739_0013_0F8BEA95159C93D8"/>be really the caſe; for he hath managed in ſuch a manner, as to render a reply abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>needful,</hi> leaſt thoſe who are "unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with affairs in this place" be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by wrong and ungrounded accounts and miſrepreſentations. This is not only my opinion, but the opinion of many others, even of ſome that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> reckons among the number of his <hi>friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave the whole to the readers animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, begging them to weigh matters in an impartial ballance (even the ballance of the ſanctuary) and not be ſwayed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal regard either on the one ſide or the other. And may the God of truth lead us into all truth. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

The contentions about the ordinance of baptiſm have neither been ſo frequent nor long continued; I find little traces of them till ſomething above 200 years ago, when the ſect of the <hi>anabaptiſts</hi> aroſe in <hi>Germany.</hi> Since which time, the <hi>poedo-baptiſt</hi> controverſy hath ſubſiſted, and a ſmall number have ever appeared in oppoſition; but other controverſies in relation to baptiſm have been rare.

It would ſurely be happy, a thing very deſirable, if all in viſible covenant were fully diſpoſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge every duty of the covenant, if they had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch a heart in them as to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their's intirely to God, not only in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but alſo publicly, and to walk in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and or finances of the Lord blameleſs, and ſo to have all occaſion of diſpute removed out of the way. But ſince this cannot be expected in this imperfect ſtate, ſince there are ſuch different degrees of knowledge and grace, and all profeſſors do not ſee their duty in the ſame point of light, or have not equal capacity to diſcern what is duty in their preſent circumſtances, and what is not, it would not ſurely be amiſs to grant ſome indulgence to ſcrupulous tender conſciences, and to allow them to go on in the path of duty as far as their preſent light leads them, without ſtrictly obliging them to that, from which doubts and fears keep them off, hoping and praying, that God would in his own time and way ſcatter their doubts and diſſipate their fears, and give them ſuch a ſenſe of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and clearneſs of evidence, as would embolden their acceſs in full with comfort and joy. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch indulgence or connivance be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or not is the point in debate. Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> holds the negative. I the affirmative.</p>

1. I ſhall begin with OBSERVATIONS. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Thing I ſhall obſerve is, That the diſpute between us is not whether unregenerate perſons ought to be <hi>knowingly</hi> admitted, but what <hi>evidence of regeneration</hi> the church ought to act upon. Since it will be the neceſſary conſequence of any plan whatſoever, that many unregenerate will in fact be admitted not only to own the covenant, but alſo to full communion; I interſperſed a paſſage here and there to abate Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s <hi>horrors</hi> at the very thoughts of an unregenerate perſon's coming. And now inſtead of making ſuch uſe of the paſſages as I intended, he carefully culls them out to prove that I hold, the church ought knowingly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unregenerates, or that baptized perſons have a right to church-privileges, let their lives and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior be what they will. Whether <q>this be fair or manly let the world judge.</q> I ſay with him, if the church can certainly prove unregeneracy upon any (which muſt be done by the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation) let them be excluded from any privilege although baptized. But what is to be done with thoſe againſt whom no ſuch proof can be exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Of whom the church knows nothing amiſs, whoſe lives are inoffenſive. <hi>&amp;c?</hi> How muſt theſe be treated in caſe they apply for church privileges? This is the queſtion.—Here I aſſerted, that ſuch <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> evidence was ſufficient with reſpect to thoſe already in covenant; that nothing further was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of communicants; why then of other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? That if the church went further, they muſt neceſſarily run into the plan of the ſeparates, who are for purging the church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſpurns at all this; but how does he diſprove it? I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his bare affirmation. "Negative evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſays he, is no evidence at all." "Here is a negation or want of that, which is a proper ground of charity in this caſe." And again, "A baptized perſon's being free from open known ſin is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evidence that he is a <hi>ſaint;</hi> or upon which, the ſcriptures will warrant ſuch a preſumption of it, as will make it <hi>LAWFUL</hi> for us to treat him as ſuch." <hi>p.</hi> 59. But pray what right has he or any
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012739_0017_0F8BEA980D8D6FC8"/>of his party to call his fellow-members unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or to treat them as unregenerates, if they know nothing amiſs in them, if inoffenſive in their lives? Every baptized perſon has a right to be treated as a chriſtian, if their general conduct be not inconſiſtent with chriſtianity. The church ought in duty to ſuppoſe every member to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, till they prove themſelves to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; or in other words, the church have no right to ſuppoſe any of their body unconverted, till it appears by their converſation. This is a chriſtian law or rule. Dr. <hi>C. Mather</hi> ſays, <q>Many baptized in infancy, when grown up do prove by their apoſtacies that they are not real ſaints. A judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>rational charity</hi> may be left for others. And it is a rule to be kept in the proceedings of the church, <hi>I am to judge as charitably of the infant as of the parent</hi> (that the grace of God is in their ſouls) <hi>until there appear a reaſon to the contrary.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>R.</hi> indeed ſeems to have found out a reaſon to the contrary, that ſuch are guilty of <hi>"habitual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs"</hi> in not coming to the Lord's table, p. <hi>57.</hi> But yet in other places he ſays the direct reverſe. Concerning this I ſhall ſpeak elſewhere.</note> (<hi>C. M.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant bapt. <hi>p.</hi> 18)</p>
               <p>If there be any weight in this ſort of reaſoning, then ſurely baptized perſons of regular converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot juſtly be excluded from owning the covenant, and bringing their children, whenever they deſire it; they have a right to demand it as members, and none have a right to deny them.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe <hi>without,</hi> if they apply, ſomething more <hi>poſitive</hi> is neceſſary; and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures me by ſuggeſting that I hold negative evidences are ſufficient in both caſes, or that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and unbaptized perſons were to be received on equal terms (ſee <hi>p.</hi> 6.7.). Surely more ſtrictneſs is neceſſary in receiving <hi>heathens</hi> than <hi>chriſtians,</hi> or thoſe that are already members; or in other words, there is more neceſſary to intitle a perſon to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> than to a <hi>continuation</hi> of memberſhip: And I think him much out of the way in every where
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012739_0018_0F8BEA9DBB2D3B20"/>putting theſe two different ſorts upon a par, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he held that baptized perſons were no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per members."</p>
               <p>This makes way for a</p>
               <p n="2">2d. OBSERVATION, That I did not particularly treat the ſubject as a caſe of conſcience, what the candidates ought to do, but what the church's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in caſe they did apply.—The queſtion in controverſy is not ſo much, who ought to come? But if they do come, what the church ought to do, whether to exclude or receive them? If I had treated the queſtion in any other light, he might have juſtly accuſed me of "rambling." But this is a fault, that he is guilty of in a high degree. What is it but rambling to treat the affair almoſt wholly as a caſe of conſcience, and not what was the churches duty in caſe of actual application, and no ſufficient objection againſt the canditates <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Is not this running off from the point in debate with a witneſs? If he had kept cloſe to it, it would have reduced his book to a much narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
               <p>The chief that I ſaid in the other view of the queſtion was, that if candidates acted conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in what they did, if they come out of a ſenſe of the command, and if (as far as they knew their own hearts) they were ſincere in what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, though they could not ſay it was a gracious ſincerity, that was ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And muſt he not of neceſſity go upon the ſame plan, if certainty be not required? But he will object here, that I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ſubject in ſuch a manner, as will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily encorage unregenerate men (knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſuch) to apply. But how groundleſs is this? I was not directing myſelf to them, but to the church. And while I was doing ſo, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous would it have been thought, if I had made a large digreſſion, exhorting ſuch not to come in an hypocritical manner? If I had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed to a promiſcuous congregation, it would have been proper; and I ſhould in that caſe have exhorted them to come not only to that, but to <hi>all other</hi> duties with real ſincerity, if they expected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012739_0019_0F8BEAA0037B1918"/>with God. But this would have been a mere wandring, a rambling in the preſent caſe. How unjuſt therefore is he in ſaying. <hi>p.</hi> 41. "The <hi>grand point</hi> Mr. C. is aiming at is to prove, that it is <hi>lawful</hi> for baptized perſons not ſcandalous, to own the covenant, and have baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" How could he ſay, that this was my <hi>grand point,</hi> when I meddle little with it? All I had to prove was, that it is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but the church's <hi>duty</hi> to admit unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable candidates whenever they applied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I never held, that it was <hi>lawful</hi> for any perſon whatſoever, regenerate or unregenerate, to do any duty in an <hi>unlawful</hi> (i. e. hypocritical) <hi>manner;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſeems to do it in ſeveral places.<note n="*" place="bottom">He in effect grants, that a perſon may pray, read, hear in an hypocritical manner. For he ſays, an unregenerate man cannot poſſibly perform a duty in any other manner. p. <hi>10, 11.</hi> And yet they muſt do their duty. p. <hi>11, 12.</hi> They muſt not omit it in any wiſe: Yea, they may <hi>lawfully</hi> do it. p. <hi>44.</hi> Thus he gives open toleration to hypocriſy in one duty, while he bears ſo hard againſt it in another.</note> And with equal injuſtice he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 29. "Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that it is lawful for graceleſs perſons <hi>as ſuch</hi> to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I utterly deny it; I never, directly, or by implication aſſerted, any ſuch thing. They come as <hi>members,</hi> and not as <hi>ſinners;</hi> and as <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>while ſuch</hi> are quite different things: And does not he himſelf ſuppoſe it <hi>lawful,</hi> yea their duty to come, if they have <hi>"prevailing hopes?"</hi> or "if they <hi>do not know,</hi> that they are unregenerate?" <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3d. I obſerve, That it is neceſſary to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction reſpecting perſons right in the ſight of GOD. This right is to be taken in a two-fold ſenſe. 1ſt. A right to outward privileges. 2d. A right to ſaving bleſſings. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> denies the right of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons in the ſight of God in any ſenſe. And ſays, I contradict myſelf in implicitly intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have. But in this I think he goes too far. As to ſaving bleſſings we certainly agree; but with reſpect to outward privileges, I ſee no abſurdity or contradiction in aſſerting, that they have ſome right to them in the ſight of God; I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012739_0020_0F8BEAA1021080E0"/>mean a right ſo far at leaſt, that he would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his church, if they ſhould exclude them without full evidence of their unregeneracy. The caſe is plain with reſpect to infants; God knows that many of them are not regenerate, yet if children of the faithful, they muſt be baptized upon pain of his diſpleaſure. And even in regard of the children of unregenerates, God calls them <hi>my children, the children that were born unto me.</hi> Ezek. xvi. 20, 21. which implies ſome right in the ſight of God to viſible privileges, if the parents were in viſible covenant and not regularly cut off. This ſuggeſts to me a thought of weighty conſideration. What one inſtance of reproof do we find from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> to <hi>Malachi</hi> to any individual for <hi>bringing</hi> their children to circumciſion, even in their moſt lapſed and degenerate ſtate? And does not this prove to a demonſtration, that all viſible members had a right in God' ſight to circumciſe their children, or that he approved of their adminiſtring the rite to them, though at the ſame time he diſapproved of their formality and wrong ends in this and other duties? Further, may we not juſtly aſk, Had not <hi>Judas</hi> a right to outward privileges in the ſight of Chriſt, as well as <hi>Peter?</hi> Would he have otherwiſe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the paſſover, and it is thought by moſt divines to the Lords ſupper too? And would he have been offended with the other apoſtles, if upon ſuſpicion they had endeavored to exclude him till by ſome overt act he had plainly diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or till full proof appeared againſt him? And would God himſelf have <hi>baptized</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old <hi>in the cloud and in the ſea,</hi> if they had not ſome right to the <hi>viſible mark,</hi> as being a people whom he had taken into covenant with himſelf? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. Yea and does not Mr. <hi>R.</hi> himſelf aſſert in his ſurpriſing comment on <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 14. That God treats the church of the <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>viſible ſaints,</hi> becauſe of their covenant relation to him, (when in fact there was ſcarce a <hi>real ſaint</hi> among them?) <hi>p.</hi> 55. And would he have done ſo, if they had not ſome right in his ſight to viſible privileges and favors? Mr. <hi>R.</hi> then muſt have recourſe to this diſtinction of a two-fold
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012739_0021_0F8BEAA1C5964858"/>right, or he cannot ſolve his own conceſſion here; though he every where elſe heedleſsly confounds and blends theſe two rights together. And the like not attending to this diſtinction by others, has been the ſource of bitter contentions. But if men would but duely conſider, I think none will be ſo abſurd as to aſſert, that they have no right in the ſight of God to that which is given them by the church in direct conſequence of his commands. The <hi>ſowing of tares</hi> in the <hi>goſpel kingdom</hi> is indeed ſaid to <hi>be done by an enemy, i. e.</hi> the devil. <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii 28. But this cannot he applied to thoſe that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in infancy, of whom I am ſpecially treating, becauſe they were not <hi>planted</hi> or <hi>ſowed</hi> in the church by the devil, but by God's ſpecial appointment, as being children of the faithful. And I hope they will not charge laxneſs on their maker. This makes way for a notable obſervation, that if thoſe even of the <hi>devil's ſowing,</hi> viz. Thoſe that come at adult age merely for ſecular and carnal ends; I ſay, if theſe muſt <hi>not be gathered or plucked up</hi> (without full proof appear againſt them.) v. 29. How much leſs muſt they be ſo, who are of <hi>God's own planting,</hi> and were admitted by his direct order? And if they muſt be continued ſtill in the church, then church-privileges muſt neceſſarily be their's too; and it will be right in the ſight of God and man to put them in poſſeſſion of them, whenever aſked for. Their right indeed in the view of the church goes further than this, and is more extenſive than their right before God; for in the latter caſe, their right is confined merely to things outward and viſible; but in regard of the church, they have not only a right to outward privileges, but to ſaving bleſſings (in the judgment of rational chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.) Here I apprehend lies the proper difference between their right in the ſight of God and the church, or in <hi>ſoro eccleſiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if they have ſuch a right in the ſight of God, does not this militate with what is ſaid under the laſt head? I anſwer no, becauſe though they have a right to come as members, yet they have no right to come in a <hi>wrong manner:</hi> And as far as they are
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012739_0022_0F8BEAA278E1D038"/>deſtitute of goſpel principles and ends, ſo far they offend God in this or any other duty. But then it muſt be remembred, that this offence is no ſo great as a total neglect, if a man acts conſcienciouſly in the affair. <hi>Jehu</hi> was commiſſioned, yea commanded by God to <hi>root out Ahab</hi>'s <hi>vile race;</hi> I <hi>Kings</hi> xiii. And he did right in doing it; yet he had no right to do it in a wrong manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a murderous heart; and therefore while he is rewarded for the <hi>act,</hi> he is puniſhed for his <hi>evil intent, Hoſ</hi> i, 4. But it is evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent his ſin would have been greater if he had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forborn to act. This may ſerve as an illuſtration in the preſent caſe. My</p>
               <p n="4">4th. OBSERVATION or remark is, That ſeveral material things in the Eſſays remain untouched. I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That his ſcheme was incumbred with the ſame difficulty as mine. He had propoſed this expedient, namely, to admit candidates under ſcruple to full communion, and then to diſpenſe with their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate attendance at the Lord's table, till their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were removed. This I ſaid was a half-way prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, a dividing the ſeals, a tolerating perſons in liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the neglect of the holy ſupper, as much as the other practice. And if the one was unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſcripture, the other was equally ſo. And what does he ſay to obviate the difficulty? Why nothing, or worſe than nothing. "Let us wait on them, ſays he, as members in covenant, and not as half mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers." <hi>p.</hi> 74. A moſt ſurprizing ſpeech! as if there were ſome members not in covenant, or that being members and being in covenant, were not ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous terms. What is the plain import of his words (ſaving the nonſenſe) but this? "Let us wait on them as perjured perſons, that having covenanted or promiſed to come imediately, yet ſtay away; and not as perſons that have made no ſuch promiſe." A notable ſolution truly! I leave it to the readers animadverſion, with adding, that it appears to me impoſſible, a man ſhould conſcienciouſly ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the preſent practice, and yet come into Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s expedient. There is no real difference between the one and the other; all the difference lies
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012739_0023_0F8BEAA339D7A1E8"/>in names and forms only, not in eſſentials. This leads me to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="2">2d. That all my arguments againſt his diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcheme, are not taken the leaſt notice of, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one ſentence in one of them, which is quoted only to be wreſted) ſo that they all yet ſtand in full force.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. Another thing left unnoticed is, That <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi> covenanting in baptized perſons is a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial of the church, and not abſolutely neceſſary by divine inſtitution.<note n="*" place="bottom">I would obſerve here, the queſtion between us is, not whether all profeſſion whatſoever is needleſs with reſpect to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons; but whether ſuch an open, explicit or large and ample profeſſion, as is required, be neceſſary by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrant: Whether we ought to be altogether as ſtrict with them as with a new converted <hi>heathen,</hi> &amp;c. And that it is eſſential, that they paſs through all the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are required of the worſt of <hi>pagans</hi> or <hi>jews.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> churches thought a confeſſion of faith ſufficient. See <hi>Quick's</hi> ſynodicon.</note> Here I expected, that he would have attempted to prove that it is neceſſary, but I find nothing of this. And yet all he ſays, is founded upon the ſuppoſition of ſuch neceſſity; and if the ſuppoſition be not ſupported, all his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure muſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll. The chief he ſays here is, "That the <hi>Synod</hi> makes it neceſſary." <hi>p.</hi> 6. But this is a mere human authority, which in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he rejects with contempt. Yea, he in effect grants, that explicit covenanting is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: For in one place he ſeems to diſlike any thing, that "looks like a double admiſſion into the church of Chriſt." And in another tells us, "that when perſons are admitted into the church of Chriſt, they are admitted once for all:" Which if it be the caſe, what need they be admitted over again, after they have been actually received into the church in their infancy? <hi>Urſin,</hi> one of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Mr. <hi>R.</hi> quotes, ſays, <hi>To be born in the church, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the infants in ſtead of their profeſſion</hi> p. 414. and again, <hi>To be born in the church is to infants inſtead, and in place of profeſſion.</hi> p. 420.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:012739_0024_0F8BEAA40A29AF40"/>
Mr. <hi>R.</hi> indeed ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 17. "That the <hi>Iſarelites</hi> were required to make a public explicit profeſſion, or to renew covenant in a public manner every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years: So that none could have children to circumciſe, who had before made a public profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religion." But he ſays this without proof. The whole law (and not merely the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he inſinuates) was indeed to be read every ſeven years in the audience of all the people. <hi>Duet.</hi> xxxi. 9—12.<note n="*" place="bottom">If hearing the law read be covenanting, then his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation covenant every ſabbath; for the law or ſcriptures are read to them each day. How can he endure this? How does it conſiſt with his principles to ſuffer ſuch abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive covenanting, as it muſt be on the part of many? This of conſequence muſt exclude the ſcriptures from being read in the public aſſemblies, if his poſition be true: Which is the beſt argument againſt the public reading of the ſcriptures, that ever I heard of.</note> But nothing is ſaid about their <hi>covenanting:</hi> And if there was any thing of that nature, it was merely implicit. As is the caſe, when we hear the word read in our public congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Suppoſe Chriſt had commanded, that all the new-teſtament (or the four evangeliſts) ſhould be read at once every ſeven years in his church, that his people might better know and underſtand their duty, could it be inferred from hence, that he inſtituted a public renewal of covenant every ſeven years? It would be a very ſtrained inference indeed, and "unworthy a <hi>Logician.</hi>"</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing ſuch a public explicit covenanting was required of the <hi>jews</hi> every ſeven years, what does it prove? Not that individuals ſhould renew covenant alone or ſingly, as they happen to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of their gracious ſtate; but that the whole church (conſiſting of all baptized perſons) ſhould renew the covenant in a body every few years. Thus it was in the days of king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and thus our fathers did; and this we have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012739_0025_0F8BEAA4B71A79D0"/>But this it ſeems will not go down with him, neither is it conſiſtent with his plan. Such general covenanting according to them being ſtark naught, unleſs, every individual be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perſuaded of their regenerate ſtate; which never was, nor ever will be the caſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides this general covenanting of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (if there was any ſuch thing) was not previous to their firſt receiving the paſſover, as is the caſe with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the goſpel-paſſover or Lords ſupper. For all the members of the <hi>jewiſh</hi> church, were admitted to the paſſover from their infancy; and ſo owning the covenant was not neceſſary, in order to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I obſerved</p>
               <p n="4">4th. That relations were abſolutely neceſſary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſcheme. "The original plan of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es," which he ſpeaks ſo often of and urges in other inſtances, renders them eſſential to communion, ſo eſſential, that none in any caſe were to be admitted without. And they are alike eſſential on his ſcheme; I do not ſee how it can otherwiſe be ſupported, as I have frequently noted heretofore. And yet inſtead of pleading and proving the neceſſity, he in eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct gives them up, granting that they are not neceſſary to "the right or regular conſtitution of a church." <hi>p.</hi> 63. And if that be the caſe, what evidences of regeneration has he more than others? or what is he contending about!</p>
               <p n="5">5th. I obſerved, that renewing or owning the covenant did not make them members or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their memberſhip: that memberſhip was a thing, that could not be increaſed or diminiſhed: That a man was a member or no member, and that there could be no medium or halves in the caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That their <hi>capacities of acting</hi> might indeed be widely different, but yet no inequality in their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And for illuſtration I might add, that my young ſon of three years of age, was as much a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the town of <hi>Plymouth</hi> and of the province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> as I myſelf; yet he was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable at preſent of acting in that relation as I did; but might juſtly claim the privilege as ſoon as his capacity allowed of it. This poſition Mr. <hi>R.</hi> does not
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012739_0026_0F8BEAA65C0B9C78"/>ſo much as look in the face: He durſt not aſſert in direct terms, that there are degrees of memberſhip. That a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n might become one quarter, one half, two thirds or nine tenths of a member, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at laſt his memberſhip arrived to maturity or complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But yet in many places he ſays, that which implies <hi>degrees</hi> of memberſhip: Yea, he actually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts (though without proof) that baptized perſons, after they have renewed covenant, are but half members. But what confuſion of thought does this betray? He grants, that infants baptized are <hi>"proper members;"</hi> yet when they grow up and declare that they ſtand to their parent's act, they are but <hi>half-members:</hi> So that it ſeems by renewing covenant, they loſe <hi>half</hi> their memberſhip. A poor encorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment truely to the renewing covenant, and they had much better let it alone. Or if he ſuppoſes this half-memberſhip to commence from their infancy; how could he in any ſenſe call them "proper mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?" A half-member, is not a proper member, but a monſter. And for a church to bring forth half-members, would be as monſtrous in the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, as for a woman to bring forth a half child into the natural world. And ſuch births, I believe, would never have been heard of in the chriſtian church, had it not been for Dr. <hi>B—y</hi>'s fertile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Upon the whole, here, I think I have a a right to demand of them, either to prove that memberſhip is a <hi>gradual</hi> growing, increaſing thing, or to lay aſide this abſurd way of expreſſion of <hi>half-members,</hi> &amp;c. If they will continue it without ſuch proof, can it be any uncharitableneſs to ſay, that they do it to miſlead the vulgar, and to impoſe upon them with ſounds inſtead of ſubſtance?</p>
               <p n="6">6th. I obſerve, That infant baptiſm muſt be given up, if this way of arguing be not concluſive, <hi>They that are viſibly in covenant, have a right to the ſeal of the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant for themſelves and children.</hi> This is indeed taken notice of, but in what a ſtrange manner? <hi>p.</hi> 47. "Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſays he, ſtrenuouſly and repeatedly inſiſts, that infant baptiſm cannot be maintained on the plan he is oppoſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this he aſſerts on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that we <hi>deny</hi> infant-memberſhip." I did not
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012739_0027_0F8BEAA8A044DD40"/>aſſert it on any ſuch ſuppoſition, but intirely on the contrary ſuppoſition, namely, that they <hi>owned</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-memberſhip. The ground I went upon was ſo plain, that he that runs might read. The main argument for infant baptiſm is this, that the parents are viſibly in covenant with God, and that God grants the ſame right to their children in the <hi>grand charter, Gen.</hi> xvii. So that if the parent be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the children are ſo too, and conſequently ought to have the ſeal of the covenant. This I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the preſent controverſy; the parents in queſtion are in viſible covenant; and if ſo, the children are ſo likewiſe; and conſequently ought to have the ſeal. If the argument was concluſive in the one caſe, it was certainly ſo in the other. And therefore to deny the validity of this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was to undermine the very foundation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm. To this nothing is ſaid, neither is the baptiſm of infants accounted for, on any other footing, which he ought to have done if he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invalidate my argument. It is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged point with all <hi>paedo-baptiſts,</hi> that infants are always members together with their parents; that there is a neceſſary connection between the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of the one and the other: Therefore none can juſtly deny infants the ſeal in the preſent caſe, unleſs they deny infant-memberſhip, or the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it at adult age.</p>
               <p>Here is a proper place to remind him of Mr. <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel's</hi> argument, with which I begin my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012739_0028_0F8BE20289073FB0"/>how can he prove this <hi>habitual neglect</hi> on the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates I am pleading for?

They were calculated to prove, not only that they were proper members when firſt baptized, but that they <hi>continued</hi> ſuch when they grew up.

Why then will he not treat them as members? why will he not allow them the privileges of members? Memberſhip and privilege are inſeparable; being in covenant and the privileges of the covenant always go together, as far as the capacity of the ſubject will allow, and they ought to be granted as far as they are aſked for. There is no way to get over this but by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their memberſhip is wholly loſt; that it is forfeited ſome way or other; and that of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they are as much <hi>without,</hi> as if they had never been baptized. Indeed he ſometimes hints, that this is the caſe: but why does he not directly ſpeak out, if he be of that mind? and why does he not call the church together to diſcipline them and paſs ſentence againſt them in form, as he ought to do, if their memberſhip be wholly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited? but it ſeems he rather chooſes to act, as if they were neither <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without;</hi> he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive them nor caſt them off: but leaves them as it were, ſuſpended between heaven and hell, as if they belonged to neither; or if (as half-members) half of them belonged to God's, and half to the devil's kingdom.</p>

               <p n="4">4th. He grants, that a baptized perſon (if he lays no bar in his own way) may demand rightfully one privilege, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord's-ſupper. And why may he not as well demand another privilege, <hi>viz.</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for his children? what ground is there to make the Lord's-ſupper the <hi>only ſtandard?</hi> why muſt admiſſion to or excluſion from the reſt be wholly regulated by this? it is not coming to this feaſt, but being in covenant that gives the right.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Another thing obſervable is that his plan neceſſarily runs him into ſeveral abſurdities. Dr. <hi>I. Mather</hi> obſerves of the oppoſite party in his time, "that to maintain their ſcheme they are forced to run into ſeveral abſurdities:" from whence he juſtly infers, that it could not be of God: for "truth is always conſiſtent." The ſame I obſerve with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> I ſhall now mention two or three, leaving the reſt to be taken notice of elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That there are ſome in covenant, that have no right to the privileges of the covenant, when as they are inſeparable, as I have already noted.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012739_0032_0F8BEAAF552C1EC8"/>How abſurd would it be to ſay, that an incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed member of civil ſociety had no right to the privileges of the ſociety? ſuch right is eſſential to the very idea of memberſhip. The ſame abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they are guilty of in the preſent caſe. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them there is very little or no difference at all between a baptized and unbaptized perſon: they can claim no more privilege than the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; they muſt be as ſtrictly examined; they muſt paſs through all the ſame formalities, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be received into the church, or to <hi>enter into covenant</hi> (as their pharſe is, not <hi>renewing covenant,</hi> which way of expreſſion they carefully avoid) as the other. They have no more ground to expect or hope for divine influence (at leaſt if their parent be unregenerate) than the other. Well therefore may we put the queſtion, what advantage of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? or what privilege accrues to them by being baptized?</p>
               <p n="2">2d. Another moſt groſs, glaring abſurdity is, that the baptiſm of the children of unregenerates is "a MERE NULLITY." <hi>p.</hi> 48.—I was aſtoniſhed when I read this: it is a poſition I believe that was never before heard of in the chriſtian church, except from profeſſed <hi>anabaptiſts.</hi> What! was the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> (the children of unregerate men) a mere nullity? I know they did not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o; neither (to ſpeak with reverence) did God himſelf think ſo.</p>
               <p>If this extraordinary aſſertion be true: then 1ſt. All diſtinction between the viſible and inviſible church is diſtroyed; yea, the former is intirely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated; nothing done in it being of any real validity, as it ſtands contradiſtinguiſhed from the latter; nothing is left but a heap of <hi>nullities</hi> from the beginning to end. This confounding all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the viſible and inviſible church I formerly noted in the Eſſays. And now he is pleaſed to confirm it: and that not only in this paſſage, but in what preceeds. There he utterly denies any promiſes made to the viſible church collectively conſidered, and conſines them <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>believing</hi> part of the church. <hi>The promiſe is to you
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012739_0033_0F8BEAAFF7A98EB8"/>and to your children,</hi> the apoſtle tells us, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 39. <hi>i. e.</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>R.</hi>) "To you who are the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and have THE FAITH of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and to your children, as <hi>parts</hi> of your ſelves." <hi>p.</hi> 47. What a ſtrange and new conſtruction of the text is here? what buſineſs had he to apply theſe words to true believers, inviſible members only? was not the apoſtle preaching to <hi>unconverted jews?</hi> and did he not addreſs them merely as members of the <hi>viſible church?</hi> as ſuch he tells them, that <hi>the promiſe was to them and to their children:</hi> and in the ſame manner it belongs to the viſible church to the end of time, and not to the believing part only.

And yet Mr. <hi>R.</hi> boldly aſſerts, that "there are no promiſes in the book of God" to the viſible church, but that they all belong to the church inviſible, and to that only. "And on theſe principles, he ſays, ſome rational as well as ſcriptural account may be given of infant baptiſm." And on theſe principles I ſay, not only infant, but all baptiſm is impracticable and without foundation; it being impoſſible to tell who are members of the inviſible church, real believers, without an immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from heaven. 2d. If this aſſertion be true, what a dilemma are all baptized in infancy brought into? in what inextricable difficulties are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved? who of us can ſay, that our baptiſm was not a mere nullity, a nothing? we may indeed have c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What a mockery to plead a mere nullity? or muſt we come with an <hi>if;</hi> "if they were converted, Lord, grant us theſe bleſſings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If not, we have no more to ſay; we aſk only for <hi>uncovenanted</hi> mercies?" 3d. Upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it will follow, that the baptiſm adminiſtred by unregenerate miniſters is a mere nullity: as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012739_0034_0F8BEAB246215218"/>
                  <hi>ſpiritual fathers</hi> they have no more right to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ordinance, than the <hi>natural parents</hi> have to bring their children to it. The right on both ſides muſt be merely viſible and <hi>nominal,</hi> not <hi>real.</hi> And what a wilderneſs will this lead us into? 4th. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this principle, the baptiſm of <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> and all the other firſt reformers, received in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a mere nullity; conſequently they ought to be looked upon as unbaptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. How then can our baptiſm received from them be of any validity? for no unbaptized perſon can baptize another. Well then it is come to this at laſt, that there is no true baptiſm in the <hi>proteſtant</hi> world. Why then do we ſo earneſtly contend about <hi>nothing.</hi> 5th. If this be the caſe, baptiſm ought to be reiterated upon parents diſcovering their unregeneracy, as is often the caſe. If it be a thing of nought, a mere nullity, it muſt ſtand for nought, and re-baptization is neceſſary. Or if Mr. <hi>R.</hi> has a faculty of turning <hi>nothing</hi> into <hi>ſomething,</hi> the world would be obliged to him for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole here, if this poſition be true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm is a matter of ſuch uncertainty view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every light, that I ſhould think it beſt for every one to be re-baptized at adult age: or rather, that no infants ſhould be baptized at all. For there is no poſſible way to aſcertain it to them, that their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was not a mere nullity, <hi>i. e.</hi> a nothing, a ſhadow, a vanity—of no more real validity, than the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of <hi>bells</hi> or a piece of wood in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. His reaſoning about baptiſms alone not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling, or "not being of itſelf a ſufficient qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation," appears to me very abſurd. <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">We had much more of it in the piece he read to the church.</note> It is an old maxim of divines, <hi>baptiſm gives a right to all ordinances:</hi> No, ſays he, unleſs they have other qualifications.

This general looſe handling the point has a tendency to make common people think, that he is more for <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> than others: whereas if he had come to particulars, it would have appeared that he contended about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But what evidences are to be had in the caſe? is it profeſſion or aſſerting to the covenant? the evidence is equal on both ſides. Is it relations? theſe are caſt out by ſome leaders in his plan; and he himſelf acknowledges, that they are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the right conſtitution of a church. <hi>p</hi> 63. Though he herein departs from the original plan, upon which theſe churches were founded, which he imputes to us as a crime. But what, though rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not abſolutely neceſſary, yet they are ſtill
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012739_0036_0F8BEAB3CA253AA0"/>uſed among us; and as long as they are ſo they will be ſome help to the church in forming a judgment of charity. What always? are not theſe relations ſometimes weak and imperfect, and contain little or nothing of experimental religion? are they not at other times ſuch oſtentations things, as ſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prejudice than help forward chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? what muſt be done in this caſe? would not he be thought a ſtrange member that ſhould object merely on ſuch an account? muſt he not have ſomething to allege againſt the life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or his objection would be taken no notice of? well then it is plain that the life and converſation is the grand criterion the chief evidence after all to regulate the church's proceedings. But how much of this muſt be known before I can liſt up my hand for a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But how often is it otherwiſe in regard of others? how little is known of many candidates by the generality of the church? eſpecially in ſuch great towns as this? and muſt they not of neceſſity go upon negative evidences in many caſes? at leaſt many individuals of the church muſt neceſſarily do ſo. The moſt they can ſay is, that they never heard any thing amiſs of the candidates. And ſometimes they cannot ſay ſo much as that, having heard-ſeveral things amiſs, though for want of proof or not looking upon it as a cenſurable evil, they do not think proper to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it as a bar. I am ſure, that as to half that have been admitted into our communion, I have had nothing but negative evidence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their relation or conſenting to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And the ſame may many others ſay. And what had Mr. <hi>R</hi> but negative evidences about us when he firſt ſettled here? and yet he ventured to covenant with us <hi>i e.</hi> to receive us as chriſtians, as well as we him. Now if negative evidences be ſufficient with reſpect to communicants; why not ſufficient likewiſe for his other "proper members?" are greater evidences required of theſe minors,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012739_0037_0F8BEAB488973418"/>than of grown members? but theſe were once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon a profeſſion of grace or relation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences. What in thoſe churches, that were founded upon Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s plan? and yet he owns he will receive ſuch to communion if they be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally with us or ſhould ſettle among us. <hi>p.</hi> 63. But have not theſe perſons ſomething <hi>more</hi> than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative evidence, if that be requiſite? do not they offer to renew covenant publicly? and is not this the main evidence they build upon? is not this profeſſion the all in all with them? (See Mr. <hi>Green</hi>)</p>
               <p>But this they do not do underſtandingly, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, if they will come no further, this is all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy if they do not come in full. How dare he ſay this, when at the ſame time he grants, it may be the caſe with ſome ſincere ſouls? did he find it ſo with thoſe whom he admitted? then he is ſelf-condemned. Is it the caſe with other miniſters? they will not own it. Upon the whole here, will he, dare he ſay, "that negative evidence (that the church knows nothing amiſs of them) is no evidence at all" with reſpect to communicants: what more is neceſſary in order to the <hi>continuation</hi> of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip? and may not the ſame be ſaid of other members, that if the church knows nothing eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially amiſs of them, their memberſhip ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and they ought to be treated as members: there is no way to get rid of this way of reaſoning, but by acting upon the ſeparates plan. Or muſt we do as he propoſed at our meeting with ſome bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren laſt year, namely, "for every member to go and diſcourſe perſonally with candidates upon their being propounded, in order to obtain full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: this, he ſaid, was our expreſs duty." But I believe he will find few of his mind in the country: ſuch a laborious taſk being incompatible with our other duties, as well as abſurd in itſelf. My</p>

Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſtumbles at the very threſh-hold; even at firſt ſetting out, before he had got three pages there are three notable miſtakes, if not more. In <hi>p</hi> 1. he tells us, that he always had ſcruples about the practice; or, to uſe his own words. <q>The practice has EVER appeared to me attended with ſome difficulties, which I could not eaſily get over; however, not attending ſo thoroughly to the arguments that were uſed in ſupport of this ſcheme, as I endeavored to do ſince, and being <hi>educated</hi> in the practice, I did <hi>ſubmit</hi> to it here for a number of years after I was ordained; though ſtill not without ſome <hi>uneaſineſs,</hi> &amp;c.</q> How will the reader be aſtoniſhed when I tell him, that previous to Mr <hi>R</hi>'s ſettlement, he was diſcourſed with by a number of the brethren (and they were the more critical with him, becauſe he came from a colony where their diſcipline ſomewhat differs from ours) and he was told the conſtitution of the church ſtep by ſtep, and he appeared cordially and fully to join with us in every thing; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to this practice he expreſſed the <hi>fulleſt ſatisfaction</hi> (and if he had not done ſo, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſettled here) ſaying, "that he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as ſcriptural, that his father was in it, that he thought it intirely right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" But now it ſeems he ſcrupled it <hi>ever,</hi> and <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to it with <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> for a number of years, even from the very time of his ordination. How can theſe things be reconciled? could a man of ſincerity ſay, that he was intirely ſatisfied with a practice, when he had latent ſcruples in his mind, whether it were lawful or no? how needleſsly has he here expoſed himſelf? I am ſure it affords not the leaſt advantage to his cauſe to tell the world, that he always had doubts about it; he had much better have kept them to himſelf. But I ſuppoſe he does it to avoid the imputation of <hi>fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleneſs,</hi> or toward off the charge of <hi>arminianiſm</hi> I had brought againſt him for holding to this practice for his firſt nine years. But, <hi>incidit in ſcyllam, qui vult,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But how comes he finally to get rid of his doubts, and to be fixed in the negative ſide of the queſtion?
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012739_0039_0F8BEAB5F99B44C8"/>here is another ſtumble. He tells us, "ſuch force his ſcruples had upon him, that at length he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to ſtudy the point more cloſely, and for that end procured what authors <hi>he could</hi> on both ſides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" A good method ſurely, but how does he manage in it? he firſt manifeſted his diſlike of the practice to one of our deacons, as he tranſiently met him on the road, the ſame day with our ſacramental lecture; and appeared fully determined telling him in expreſs terms, that he would never baptize ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the old plan; and was all on high to ſtop the church after lecture, to have the practice caſt out at once. The deacon with much difficulty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him from ſuch a raſh and precipitant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. In further diſcourſe on the ſubject, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> owned it was Dr. <hi>B—y</hi>'s <hi>dialogue</hi> that had convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and withal ſaid that there was an anſwer publiſhed, but he had not yet ſeen it. He alſo owned, that he had not read the <hi>ſynod</hi>'s reſult, and indeed ſeemed to know nothing about it, when the deacon recommended it to his peruſal. And as for other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authors on the ſubject, it is manifeſt from his book and otherways, that he never read Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> which even lay in his way: and the authors on the other ſide, as <hi>I. Mather,</hi> preſident <hi>Wadſworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> &amp;c. I know he had never ſeen them, till long after the matter was brought into public. I put the two firſt of theſe authors into his hands, and deſired him to read them attentively: he took them with much ſeeming indifference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carried them home. Sometime after being at his houſe, I found, inſtead of giving Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> a diligent peruſal, he was only turning over the book, to cull out paſſages that he thought favored his ſcheme; ſo he declared himſelf. And whether he ever read the other at all, I can not ſay. Is this the man that had ſo carefully (as well as prayerfully) ſtudied the point "for many months?" he could read Mr. <hi>B—y</hi>'s <hi>dialogue</hi> in half an hour. I know he has ſince procured the <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi> writers on both ſides, but he was, it ſeems, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled before, and declared himſelf to be ſo, upon the bare peruſal of the <hi>dialogue.</hi> A book that appears to me the leaſt calculated to bring conviction, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012739_0040_0F8BEAB727734DE0"/>any that ever I read: it muſt be the outhor's name, and not his arguments that gains proſelytes. The whole piece being founded on theſe two ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<list>
                     <item>1ſt. That the candidate himſelf <hi>knows</hi> that he is not converted.</item>
                     <item>2d. That he makes <hi>open profeſſion</hi> of unregeneracy; which is equivalent to a bad life. Beſides his making his pariſhioners talk like fools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The deacon told Mr. <hi>R.</hi> he wondered how he could be convinced by ſo week a piece, which he thought he could fully anſwer himſelf.</p>
               <p>He again ſtumbles and blunders ſtrangely in <hi>p.</hi> 2. He appears very angry at me about the word <hi>ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous.</hi> How in the name of common ſenſe he could miſtake me thus, "I cannot imagine." All I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted was, that he was <hi>ſtrenuous</hi> on the negative ſide of the queſtion. (Eſſays, 1ſt leaf.) And if he was not ſo, what means his book?—What means all his management for two or three years paſt? but he turns it, contrary to all the rules of reaſon, that I charge him with being <hi>ſtrenuous to have church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> I never thought him ſo; but rather believe he either deſigned to lay aſide the practice by his ſole authority, or expected the church would give it up at a word's ſpeaking out of complaiſance to him. This perhaps he would have thought "po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite."</p>
               <p>Another blunder exactly of the ſame tenor is about the <hi>higheſt evidence,</hi> p. 59. I was ſpeaking of the higheſt ſort of evidence <hi>before the church,</hi> he turns it the higheſt ſort of evidence <hi>in a perſons own breaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A like groſs miſtake he makes about the word <hi>unſatisfied.</hi> p. 75. I ſaid, that he was as much unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the practice as ever. He turns it thus (even making a <hi>lye</hi> of it) that I ſaid he was unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the meeting's being diſſolved. How could a man in his ſenſes miſtake me thus? is he ſo barren of matter to load me with reproaches, that he will even ſtrain a point for it! I knew he was ſo far from being unſatisfied with the diſſolution of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was what he labored for with all his might; and that not only perſonally, but by his emiſſaries, whom he ſent about to put the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into a flamé in order to effect it; they infuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012739_0041_0F8BEAB7AD480698"/>into people that it was not conſcience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated us, but that all our aim in our oppoſition was to get away Mr. <hi>R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to the beginning of the book—it is certainly a miſtake, not to ſay worſe, to tell the world, that his book is but "a brief ſketch of the arguments he made uſe of in ſupport of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." <hi>p.</hi> 3. All the church know the contrary. Here is much more delivered than ever the church heard before, and drawn up in a more copious and maſterly manner. In fact, all the <hi>real</hi> arguments he brought before the church might be contained in a nutſhell; he never attempting to give a direct reply to any of my Eſſays (though he had a copy of the firſt, and the ſecond I ſent him above a week before it was read in public;) but the chief he did wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to read to us a long collection from Meſſieurs <hi>Edwards, Bellamy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>on,</hi> &amp;c. principally about quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. But to as little purpoſe almoſt, as if he had read Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> about the Lord's-ſupper ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>verbatim.</hi> If he thinks it was to the purpoſe, let him print it: I promiſe him to be a <hi>ſubſcriber,</hi> if he will make no alterations or additions.</p>
               <p>And as to his ſermons or "diſcourſes in public" mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 2. He handled the point merely in a <hi>caſaiſtical</hi> manner, and did not ſo much as touch the caſe as it was a matter of <hi>church conſideration.</hi> And even this he managed in ſuch a manner, as gave almoſt general diſſatisfaction: people then (being free from <hi>prejudice</hi>) not being ſo ready to ſwallow every thing he ſaid as goſpel.</p>
               <p>Let us now touch a little on inconſiſtencies and contradictions.</p>
               <p>And here more generally we may obſerve, that in ſome places of his book baptized perſons are proper members, in others but half members, and in others no members at all, having forfeited all their right by their <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in not coming to the Lord's-table. <hi>p.</hi> 57. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet they may be good perſons notwithſtanding, and deſerving the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es forbearance. <hi>p.</hi> 38. Sometimes they are members, but not members in covenant. <hi>p.</hi> 74. As if being members and being in covenant were not words
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012739_0042_0F8BEABF5BFC0C18"/>exactly of the ſame import. Pray what is it makes them members but their being in covenant?</p>
               <p>But to be more particular.—The gentlemen in <hi>Connecticut</hi> expreſs themſelves in ſuch a manner as this, that they are in ſome ſort members, members in a ſenſe, imperfect members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>R.</hi> who has a better talent in reconciling contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, expreſſes himſelf without boggling, that they are "proper members;" and yet denies them every privilege, that belongs to members as ſuch. But theſe have forfeited their right by their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in not coming to the Lord's-ſupper. How ſo! when they may be real good chriſtians at the ſame time, and ought to be uſed with all poſſible ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? what bitter water and ſweet does he pour forth at once? to the ſame effect we find that for 6. or 7. pages together he endeavored with all his might to prove, that it is impoſſible for a perſon to be a true chriſtian without coming to the Lord's-table. (<hi>p.</hi> 31—37.) And yet he kicks it all down at one ſtroke, even in one line, by granting, "that it was often the caſe of good chriſtians to be kept away by ſcruples." Yea, he actually canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed one of this ſort in a funeral diſcourſe, ſince his change of principles.</p>
               <p>This leads me to take notice of a cluſter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions blended or jumbled together. He ſays repeatedly, that perſons who have only owned the covenant are but half-members. We have a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch, that owned the covenant either in his or Mr. <hi>Leonard's</hi> days, who have never yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to communion. How does Mr <hi>R.</hi> treat them? as half-members? as guilty of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual continued neglect? as wilful renouncers and refuſers? as wicked perſons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No; inſtead of this, theſe are all at once turned by him (without their aſking, without the churches conſent) into <hi>members in full communion;</hi> and as ſuch he baptizes their children without boggling or ſcruple.<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſuggeſts to my mind a <hi>lucky expedient,</hi> that may perhaps reconcile all. If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> can get over the difficulty about thoſe who have <hi>already</hi> owned the covenant, by ſaying, he <hi>looks upon them as members in full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> Why can not he get over the difficulty the ſame way <hi>in futuro,</hi> by admitting perſons to own the covenant, and then ſaying <hi>they are in full communion!</hi> thus he and the church may jogg on together in harmony and peace.</note> And
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012739_0043_0F8BEAC06946F4A0"/>to render the inconſiſtence more compleat, when theſe new ſort of members in full communion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be received to the Lord's-ſupper (of which there has been two inſtances very lately) does he immediately receive them without further ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or aſk the church to do it? no; they muſt needs be received in common form; be propounded for a fortnight, bring a relation, covenant anew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is a double, treble, yea, quadruple admiſſion into the church of God. All <hi>wrong</hi> according to him: and yet he the <hi>chief actor</hi> in it. But as if all this were not enough, there muſt be another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance added, to render it compleater ſtill which is the "crowning cut of all;" and that is, Mr. <hi>R—s</hi>'s chief champion, the man of his right hand (whom he moſt employs to propagate his cauſe) is one that hath actually owned the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among us in former years, but hath never yet aſked for an admiſſion to the Lord's-table. Here is confuſion upon confuſion. Let us now attend to other inſtances.</p>
               <p>We have often obſerved, that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> calls them "proper members" that have been baptized in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; yet of late he carefully avoids the old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>renewing covenant,</hi> when ſuch apply at adult years; always uſing that of <hi>entering into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as if they were never in covenant before. See all over his book; and this is his general language in public, when any are propounded. I beg to know how they can <hi>enter</hi> upon a thing which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own conceſſion) they entered upon or were in poſſeſſion of long before. This language imports, that they were never really in covenant till now. And there are many other paſſages in his book, that import the ſame thing, or that they were never members till this entrance we are ſpeaking of. The fourth argument <hi>p.</hi> 6. goes wholly
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012739_0044_0F8BEAC099A85818"/>upon this ſuppoſition. He appears to diſlike "any thing that looks like a double admiſſion into the church of God." <hi>p.</hi> 3. He ſays, perſons "are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the family of Chriſt once for all." <hi>p.</hi> 6. How can this be till this entrance? he ſeems to fault me for calling baptized perſons <hi>real members, compleat members.</hi> p. 9. 42. He mentions theſe phraſes with a ſneer. He ſpeaks of them as <hi>not of the church. p.</hi> 74. And frequently calls their owning covenant an <hi>admiſſion,</hi> as if their memberſhip did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence till now. How can all this be, if they were proper members when firſt baptized?</p>
               <p>Again, he ſays. <hi>p.</hi> 3. "God's covenant people both under the old and new teſtament had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to make any exceptions or limitations, under any circumſtances or upon any pretence whatever." And again, <hi>p.</hi> 16. "no perſon, church or power on earth, can lawfully diſpenſe with ſuch an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance." <hi>viz.</hi> on the Lord's-ſupper. And yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make exceptions and limitations. Yea, he propoſed to the church to paſs an <hi>actual vote</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with candidates in caſe of ſcruple, if they would verbally conſent to be called members in full communion. What a direct inconſiſtency is here? yea, he further ſuppoſes, that perſons in the dark may <hi>lawfully</hi> ſtay away. And yet at the ſame time calls them renouncers, refuſers, habitual neglecters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to be tolerated, leſt we be partakers of other men's ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he ſuppoſes all over his book, that thoſe who act upon my plan, are <hi>unconverted;</hi> he taxes them with "<hi>habitual and continual diſobedience</hi> to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of Chriſt:" <hi>p.</hi> 57. and yet ſays, the command was <hi>never</hi> given to <hi>them,</hi> but to others, <hi>viz.</hi> "to true diſciples" or believers <hi>only. p.</hi> 45, 6.—Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how can perſons be taxed with diſobedience to a command, that was never given to them? is it not an eternal rule, that where there is no law there is no tranſgreſſion? thoſe indeed to whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given may be guilty of diſobedience, but thoſe to whom it is not given are no more concerned in it than if there was no command at all. How does he here relax the bonds of duty from the neck of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012739_0045_0F8BEAC2E1EBF9A8"/>ſinners? if the command indeed were given to the <hi>viſible church,</hi> then all neglecters are guilty, but if the command only reaches <hi>inviſible members,</hi> then it is they only that muſt plead guilty or not guilty, all others have nothing to do with it. He may as well ſay, that infants are guilty of the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Again, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> aſſerts, that <hi>ſaving bleſſings</hi> are no more (no not ſo much as conditionally) ſealed to the children of the faithful, if unconverted, than to <hi>jews, deiſts and mahometans:</hi> p. 43. and yet he owns that there are <hi>gracious promiſes</hi> all over the bible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>Further he ſays, "that owning the covenant is one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt ſolemn</hi> tranſactions on this ſide death," and that "coming to the Lord's table is a <hi>leſſer</hi> tranſaction:" <hi>p.</hi> 36. and yet, that perſons equally own the covenant every time they come, as much as they did at firſt. The ſame he ſays of other covenant tranſactions. <hi>p.</hi> 6. How then can there be any <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>leſſer</hi> in the caſe? or is it a leſſer tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action to own the covenant in <hi>deed</hi> than in <hi>words?</hi> would it be deemed a greater thing to <hi>accept</hi> a prince's invitation to dinner, than the <hi>actual dining</hi> with him?</p>
               <p>Again, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſays, that baptized perſons have forfeited their right, if they do not come to the Lord's-table, and that they ought to be cenſured; and yet will not ſuffer them to come, if he thinks them unqualified, let them be ever ſo inoffenſive. unhappy caſe, that they muſt neither come nor not come.</p>
               <p>Again, he durſt not defend Dr. <hi>Bellamy's</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, "that for a natural man to pretend to own the covenant, was to ſin againſt God in a more provoking manner, than if he had committed drunkenneſs, fornication, and adultry." (Eſſays, <hi>p.</hi> 68.) I ſay, he durſt not defend this in direct terms, becauſe he knew it would render him obnoxion to his own party: yet he holds the ſame thing in effect all over his book. Why will not men honeſtly ſpeak out, but conceal themſelves in a ſhade?</p>
               <p>Again, he prayed againſt me and preached againſt me for the expoſition I gave of the text; <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 14.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012739_0046_0F8BEAC385A626D8"/>and ſeems ſtill ſurprized at it: while at the ſame time he expounds the text exactly as I did, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was an addreſs to the whole viſible church collectively conſidered, without any regard to their inward gracious ſtate. <hi>p.</hi> 55. This is the very thing I aimed at, and indeed all that was neceſſary to eſtabliſh my point, though perhaps not ſo fully expreſſed as it might have been. The addreſs for certain included both regenerates and unregenerates, though very few of the former ſort among them at that time: they were generally corrupt; yet had not loſt their memberſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in infancy. This Mr. <hi>R.</hi> would not then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of, but led his people to think by his prayers and preaching, that the words were directed to true believers and to them only, and not to the whole church in general including unregenerates. But now he turns directly about, and fully joyns with me, and yet continues to fault me. How ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing is this?</p>
               <p>Further, he taxes me with leaving the original plan of the fathers; and yet diſſents from them as well as we: he pretends to honor them, yet leaves them. He differs from them in ſeveral particulars, two eſpecially.
<list>
                     <item>1ſt. In not making relations neceſſary.</item>
                     <item>2d. In implicitly bearing down the practice of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral owning the covenant, which is certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of his ſcheme.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, he taxes me with uſing paſſionate excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations to gain my point. And hath he not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exclamations all over his book! Are they not interſperſed everywhere? ſee particularly from <hi>p.</hi> 23—26. and <hi>p.</hi> 32—35.</p>
               <p>Thus I have preſented the reader "with a brief ſketch" of the blunderata and inconſiſtencies that abound in his book: "it would be endleſs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in all." May I not juſtly then conclude the head with his own words, which are much more applicable to him than to me. <hi>p.</hi> 41. <q>Truth is always conſiſtent; therefore when a perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances any ſcheme or poſition, and in his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſupport it, is inconſiſtent with himſelf,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012739_0047_0F8BEAC4356BDF70"/>it affords, at leaſt, a ſtrong preſumption that his ſcheme or poſition is not true. Whether Mr. <hi>R.</hi> has not fallen into this difficulty in attempting to ſupport his ſcheme, I do, after pointing out theſe things (with others elſewhere) leave the reader to judge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I now proceed to the</p>
               <p n="2">II. General HEAD, namely, to conſider and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer his objections, eſpecially thoſe contained in the firſt part of his reply. I would obſerve here in general, that I do not find any new objections in this place, which I had not before conſidered, but only the old expatiated and recited at greater length, but not with more clearneſs than before. His policy here is remarkable in treating the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a large declamatory diffuſive way in order to captivate the vulgar, and even uſing "paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate exclamations." But this method will not take with men of thought and penetration. Such up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the re-peruſal of my book will find the main objections fully obviated already. But yet for the ſake of others. I think it neceſſary to take ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his main pleas. His</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Objection is, "that there is no text in the whole word of God to juſtify the practice, nor any example to warrant it." <hi>p.</hi> 3. How exactly does this tally with the words of an <hi>anabaptiſt</hi> writer quoted by <hi>Urſin?</hi> 
                  <q>no opinion is to be received, whereof we have neither expreſs commandment or apparent example in the ſcripture: but there is no commandment or example extant in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for baptizing infants: wherefore the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of infants is not to be permitted in the church." To which <hi>Urſin</hi> anſwers, "God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that all be baptized of what age, ſex, condition or ſtate ſoever, which pertain to the covenant and the church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> p. 419. This is full to the point; and it coming from one of Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s authorities (though it ſeems at ſecond hand) I hope it will have the more weight with him. Can he then ſay, that there are no texts to juſtify the practice? are not thoſe ſufficient for that purpoſe, that prove the memberſhip of the perſons in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012739_0048_0F8BEAC4FAD25D68"/>for if members themſelves, their children are certainly ſo too, (according to the divine conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii.) and ſo are intitled to the ſeal. This is as ſtrong and concluſive a way of arguing as we can poſſibly have for infant baptiſm; and indeed it is the main ground. And if he rejects it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, he muſt neceſſarily become an <hi>anabaptiſt;</hi> not only joining with them in requiring an expreſs text, but in all parts of their ſcheme.</p>
               <p>Further, he ſays there is no <hi>example.</hi> I think we have a direct example in the caſe of <hi>lepers,</hi> which were (in moſt caſes) excluded the paſſover for life, were they ever ſo gracious inwardly; yet their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not excluded circumciſion. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a perſon was otherwiſe legally unclean, his attendence on the paſſover was diſpenſed with; but ſtill his children were to be circumciſed. The caſe is plain, the firſt ſeal was <hi>never</hi> to be omitted on any account whatever, where the parents were in coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; but the other ſeal was often omitted or diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with upon incidental accounts, and the two ſeals were frequently divided. An example that I do not think unlawful for us to follow. If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſhould ſay, that this <hi>legal uncleanneſs</hi> (which is excluded from the paſſover) typified <hi>moral uncleanneſs</hi> under the goſpel; which ought to exclude equally now. What would be the conſequence of ſuch an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? why, that <hi>moral uncleanneſs</hi> is a ſufficient bar from coming to the Lord's-ſupper, but not from bringing their children to baptiſm, if they are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in covenant; as <hi>legal uncleanneſs</hi> debared from the ſecond ſeal, but not from the firſt. And let them take the conſequence to themſelves, if they argue thus, (as Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> actually do) It is their's, and not mine, though I can not ſee how they can get over it.</p>
               <p>Another objection is, the <hi>indiſpenſibleneſs</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>do this, &amp;c.</hi> This is repeated over and over, and ſeems his <hi>all in all,</hi> though I cannot ſee with what face he can plead it, when he actually offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſpenſe with the command upon certain conditions. A diſpenſation is as allowable upon our ſcheme as his. And for my part I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012739_0049_0F8BEAC5D42282B0"/>that <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> precepts always appeared to me in a very different light. The latter have been often diſpenſed with, but the former never. The ſcripture abounds with inſtances of ſuch diſpenſations.<note n="*" place="bottom">Suſpending the paſſover and circumciſion in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems only a prudential of the church, upon the account of their <hi>travelling circumſtances,</hi> as divines think. If God had particularly commanded it, it would no doubt have been recorded, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets down commands for very minute things, as about fringes, the paddle, &amp;c. And if churches may upon occaſion, and as particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances occur, ſuſpend a <hi>general</hi> attendance, they may as well ſuſpend a <hi>particular</hi> one. Inſtances of ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuſpenſion of the Lord's-ſupper has been known in our days even for years, not only when a church has been without a paſtor, but alſo when in divided broken circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> And if particular perſons, through miſtakes or ſcruples, deprive themſelves of the benefit of <hi>poſitive inſtitutions,</hi> I dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them to the pit of hell upon that account. St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſaying is moſt true, <hi>not the want, but the contempt of ordinances condemneth.</hi> And that ſaying of other divines is equally true, <hi>that theſe ſpecial ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſerve not for the being, but the well being of a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> The <hi>habitual</hi> wilful <hi>neglect</hi> of them is certainly a very heinous ſin; but if perſons having a <hi>due value</hi> for ſuch inſtitutions, are kept away merely from fears that they have not the befitting and requiſite qualifications, this I look upon rather as an <hi>infirmity,</hi> than a damnable offence.</p>
               <p>Again, it is objected, "that this practice is of a very bad and dangerous tendency," and that it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, "tends to promote a careleſs ſecure ſpirit in candidates." <hi>p.</hi> 8.—QUERY, whether thoſe places where the practice is not allowed, have fewer in propotion of this ſecure careleſs ſpirit than the places where it is received? let him aſk the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and they will tell him the reverſe: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſecurity then muſt not be aſcribed to this practice. And let him aſk them further, whether they have not reaſon to think, that many whom
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012739_0050_0F8BEAC68A9B31D8"/>they have not over great charity for, have upon this very account come up in full, that otherwiſe would not, merely to get their children baptized.</p>
               <p>I obſerved in my ſecond Eſſay, <hi>p.</hi> 20. That mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters refuſing to receive them upon this plan, and yet urging them to come in full, had a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tendency to promote this ſecure ſpirit. To this he deigns not a word of anſwer. I would now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve further, that in the courſe of my miniſtry, I never found <hi>one</hi> under conviction (among the many ſcores I converſed with) whoſe conſcience pricked them merely for not owning the covenant, but it was for their neglect of the Lord's-ſupper; and to that many ſeemed earneſtly deſirous of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as an <hi>aſylum,</hi> to get eaſe to their wounded ſpirits. And if they are admitted to that, there is much more danger of their reſting there, than if they had only owned the covenant. In ſhort, this objection and what is ſaid under it, bewrays to me too much <hi>unacquaintedneſs</hi> or <hi>experience</hi> of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the human mind under conviction, and is rather matter of theory than reality.</p>
               <p>Again, he ſays, that <hi>John's</hi> baptiſm was not of ſuch latitude as we plead for; but was confined to profeſſing penitents. I anſwer, if he will be as large in adminiſtring baptiſm, as <hi>John</hi> was, there are none I believe but would be content. The text ſays, <hi>all Judea and Jeruſalem went out to him, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confeſſing their ſins. Matt.</hi> iii. 5, 6. Will Mr. <hi>R.</hi> baptize any merely on ſuch confeſſion? no, ſays he; promiſes of amendment are implied, through the aſſiſtance of divine grace. Well, let it be ſo (though the words do not directly imply it) all would be content ſtill. Would he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them or their children now? no, they muſt make a profeſſion of <hi>ſaving repentance.</hi> Well, but how can they profeſs it without they <hi>knew</hi> they had it! would he have them lye, or declare more than they know? no; it is ſufficient for them to ſay, that as far as they knew their own hearts they were ſincere in <hi>confeſſing their ſins,</hi> &amp;c. If he would receive them now, where is the difference between him and me? It appears to me, that all <hi>John</hi> holds forth when he
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012739_0051_0F8BEAC74363C088"/>
                  <hi>preached the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> was, that repentance was neceſſary in order to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>ſaving mercies</hi> of the covenant, or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>ſpiritual good</hi> held forth in baptiſm; and that it cannot be juſtly inferred from anything that is ſaid, that he thought they were all real penitents whom he baptized: yea, the direct contrary appears, for he himſelf intimates, that many of them were but <hi>cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fy profeſſors</hi> (as afterwards appeared). And therefore he exhorts them to exerciſe goſpel repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and not to reſt merely in the outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, leſt their baptiſm ſhould be of no avail. I would obſerve further, that <hi>John</hi> does not erect a new church (the goſpel church was not erected till ſome time after) but ſeems to baptize them as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers already, or as part of the ſtanding church of the <hi>jews:</hi> and it does not appear, neither is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he rejected any that came, though he gave a ſevere reproof to ſome ſorts.</p>
               <p>Further he objects, that we place too great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper. I anſwer; this, the other ſide are eſpecially guilty of, who would not allow baptized perſons any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege at all; whereas if they will but come to the Lord's-ſupper, all privileges are their's and their children's forever.</p>
               <p>A like objection is, that "I make <hi>lower qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> neceſſary for baptiſm than for the Lord's-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is quite wrong." <hi>p.</hi> 48, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ought rather to have ſaid <hi>lower dagrees</hi> of the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. And is not this reaſonable? certainly ſtronger language may be expected from <hi>grown men</hi> than from <hi>mere babes;</hi> from thoſe that have had ſome <hi>experience,</hi> than form thoſe that are juſt come to the <hi>birth.</hi> To be ſure they can give a more full and ſatisfactory evidence of their being in Chriſt after ſome experience, than when firſt born into the world of grace. And in ſome caſes their lives have been ſo notorious, that though baptiſm can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to them when they come to us, as they did to <hi>John, confeſſing their ſins;</hi> yet it would not be proper immediately to receive them to the Lord's-table. And the ſame may be ſaid reſpecting
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012739_0052_0F8BEAC7F5C52EB8"/>perſons groſly ignorant; when they come to know the fundamentals of religion, that there is a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and juſtification through him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and appear to receive it cordially, they are intitled to baptiſm: yet they ought not to be received to the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, till better and more fully inſtructed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find a plain diſtinction made between the <hi>ſpouſe</hi> and <hi>the daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi> Cant. v. and 6. though both within the pale of the church. The one were admitted to full privileges, the other not ſo—which ſeems to give a direct warrant to our practice.</p>
               <p>Further, it is ſaid, what ſignifies it to be ſo ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in the affair? what good will baptiſm do their children, if they be not good themſelves? it may be of ſome advantage indeed as to this world; it may take away their reproach. But of what advantage in the ſight of God? as they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, ſo they will be ſent away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bleſſing; the baptiſm of ſuch being a <hi>mere nullity</hi> with him, <hi>p.</hi> 48. This objection ſuggeſts a queſtion of weighty moment, what the real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a baptized child is, whoſe parent is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate let him be a communicant or otherwiſe? I have already endeavored to diſprove ſuch a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm's being a mere nullity. But of what real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it? I anſwer, much every way; if it be not a <hi>nullity</hi> it muſt be <hi>ſomething, i. e.</hi> anſwer ſome valuable end, and be of real uſe to the child. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Mr. <hi>R.</hi> were <hi>right,</hi> that the <hi>promiſes</hi> were made only to the inviſible church; yet God may fulfil them to the child for their pious grand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſake, or for the ſake of ſome other godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor (as was the caſe of king <hi>Joſiah</hi>) for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe runs to a thouſand generations. But if Mr. <hi>R.</hi> be <hi>wrong,</hi> as I think has been proved, and the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 39. reſpects the church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it may reach ſuch a child as much as if his parents were really godly; and he has as good a right to plead it, as an argument for converting grace, as the child of the beſt ſaint living. He hath been received into the church according to divine rules, and therefore hath ground to aſk for
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012739_0053_0F8BEAC8B44F8E48"/>divine bleſſings, as one of God's covenant children. Yea, I may add, that God may, and no doubt often does, bleſs the ordinance to a child, as being <hi>his own inſtitution,</hi> though not for the parent's ſake; as common means are often bleſt to ſinners that uſe them, as being means of God's appointment, though not for the ſinners ſake. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord, be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways, O houſe of Iſrael, but for my own name ſake.</hi> Ezek. xxxvi, 22, 32. <hi>i. e.</hi> He does it for his own honor, and that he may grace his own inſtitutions, without any regard to the ſinner.</p>
               <p>Again, he objects, that both ordinances are <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolemn;</hi> and aſks upon it, why fears and ſcruples do not operate as ſtrongly to keep from the one as from the other; eſpecially ſince owning the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (which is previous) is a <hi>ſolemner thing</hi> than both. <hi>p.</hi> 36. The abſurdity of the latter clauſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection has been already taken notice of. Let me anſwer to the firſt part; ſuppoſing it to be the caſe, that the two ordinances are equally ſolemn, is there not ſomething in human nature, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reluets (or is terrified) at one duty, yet not at another, though equally ſolemn? and is Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſo little acquainted with the workings of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, as not to know it? it is really as ſolemn a thing in itſelf conſidered, to approach Gord's throne in <hi>ſecret of family devotions,</hi> as at the Lord's-ſupper: And yet Mr. <hi>R.</hi> would not himſelf won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſome will venture to <hi>pray,</hi> and yet not venture to the Lord's-ſupper. An unaccountable fear, which they cannot ſhake off, may often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs the mind, and ſway it to forbear in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yet have no effect in another caſe, though nearly parallel. It is a miniſter's duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to diſpel ſuch fears (if groundleſs) in the courſe of his miniſtration in the pulpit, and not to knock them down at one blow by votes and preſcription and penalties, which certainly never yet enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened one ſoul.</p>
               <p>Again, it is objected, that if we plead the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the jewiſh church it proves <hi>too much,</hi> that <hi>ſcandalous perſons</hi> ought to be admitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012739_0054_0F8BEACB021854C8"/>we will not allow of. <hi>p.</hi> 19.—I anſwer, it does not prove <hi>too much;</hi> for ſcandalous perſons are allowed privileges now as well as then if in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that is, ſuppoſing thoſe that are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſcandal do not complain of them, and get them regularly convicted: for the church ought to look upon none of their members as ſcandalous, till ſuch conviction takes place. All are innocent in the eye of the law or goſpel, till guilt be proved upon them; and if thoſe who are witneſſes of the guilt will not appear againſt them, the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ult lies at their, and not at the church's door. The church muſt receive them ſtill and allow them privileges, whether they be communicants, or only owners of the covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This obſervation enervates ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the arguments of thoſe on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Again, he urges very ſtrenuouſly, and for many pages, that it is much better to have the <hi>greater part</hi> of the country unbaptized, yea, and brought into a ſtate of perfect <hi>heatheniſm,</hi> than to have this practice continued. <hi>p</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In anſwer to this, I would deſire him to read once more my quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Mr. <hi>Mitchell,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſays, <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5) and to do it prayerfully and with attention; and if it does not make his heartake; I would have him for the future forbear to tax his neighbors with <hi>callous conſciences</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 59.) And to what he has ſaid I would add, that we have all the reaſon in the world to think, that chriſtianity would have been long ſince intirely root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the <hi>Greek churches</hi> (which have been groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many hundred years under the <hi>mahometan</hi> yoke) had it not been for theſe <hi>external badges.</hi> But the uſe of them hath kept it alive, no doubt, to the benefit and ſalvation of many ſouls: But ſays Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (or rather Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) <hi>"we muſt not do evil, that good may come."</hi> I anſwer, neither he or Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> have yet proved it to be evil. I would alſo ſubjoin. Dr. <hi>I. Mather</hi>'s weighty words in his <hi>firſt principles of New-England,</hi> relating to this point. (<hi>pref. p.</hi> 4.) <q>Brethren, one word let me in the bowels of the Lord ſay to you, and I ſpeak it
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012739_0055_0F8BEACC3B8866F8"/>not with a deſire to grieve or offend any of you, but if my heart deceive me not, love to Chriſt and to you, and to the ſucceeding generations in <hi>New-England,</hi> cauſeth me to ſpeak it; it is only this, <hi>Oh tremble! leſt this very error of yours prove the breaking and the ruin of your poor poſterity.</hi> Truly, when I think (and I often think of it) ſeriouſly and ſadly with myſelf, that in a plantation of religion (for ſuch <hi>New-England</hi> was) the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the inhabitants ſhould be in the condition of <hi>infidels;</hi> that the poſterity of a people profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing godlineſs, yea, of the moſt eminent profeſſors in the whole world, ſhould in our age be as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> even not ſo much as within the compaſs of the viſible church, or have the livery and character belonging to chriſtians upon them, whereby ſuch are diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>infidel,</hi> and <hi>pagan world:</hi> what it has to others I know not, but to me it has a moſt formidable appearance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he lugs in the doctrine of <hi>human depravity</hi> as overthrown by this practice, and makes great uſe of it in his letter and elſewhere. This ſhews what ſhifts they are reduced to, to ſupport their ſcheme. I boldly aſſert, that it is a bare-faced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But of this, more elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Another objection or impoſition near a kin to this is, that it muſt "ſurely be a bad cauſe that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with ſuch weapons" as I uſe. <hi>p.</hi> 51. But what are theſe weapons? why <hi>Arminian</hi> ones. This is not true, (as will appear preſently:) but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it was, are not <hi>arminian</hi> weapons as good as <hi>immoral</hi> ones? is the cauſe of Chriſt to be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſcandalous advertiſments in the public prints? by malicious ſcurrilous libels poſted up at market-places or droped in the ſtreets? by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded miſrepreſentations? by all the low arts and methods of artifice that could be deviſed? and even by ranſacking the graves of the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> can (either in whole or in part) clean himſelf from theſe, can he clear ſome that he looks upon as his <hi>beſt friends</hi> and the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of his cauſe? I dare ſay the whole town are convinced from what quarter theſe muſt come.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012739_0056_0F8BEACC9FCF7690"/>And the hand-writing of one of them (however diſguiſed) can be produced againſt him. But enough of this for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, another objection of the like ſort is his outcry. <hi>p.</hi> 32. "That it was as <hi>dark a day</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to religion as almoſt ever was known in this town, when this practice was brought in," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a dark time it ſeems was the propereſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſuch a dark practice. But was it ſuch a dark day, when the <hi>Synod</hi> introduced it, moſt of the firſt fathers of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> being then alive; and when ſome of their churches were in the practice before? And as for the time he ſpeaks of, let him aſk the elderly people, and they will all tell him, that it was not near ſo dark a time in regard to religion as it is now: there was much more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal piety appearing; there was more religious conference and exemplary walking; religious meetings were frequent, the miniſter almoſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending; there was a ſtanding ſociety of religious young people: (how do all theſe fail at preſent!) family religion and government much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and immoralities did not ſo abound as at this day. And how comes it to paſs, that in theſe <hi>darkeſt</hi> of days, more <hi>light</hi> ſhould ſpring up than in the former period? or does the light all center in Mr. <hi>R</hi>—'s breaſt? for the people were generally eaſy under the practice, till his attempt to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede it. Here we ſee what mean and low methods he takes to prejudice the preſent generation againſt the cauſe, as alſo in the reſt of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, which I ſhall not tranſcribe.<note n="*" place="bottom">A report has been raiſed and propagated by ſome of them, that Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> in his "lively days" (there ſpoken of) <hi>repented</hi> that he had ever brought in the practice.

               </p>
               <p>In contraſt to this, I would ſet what Dr. <hi>I.

The ſame (ſays Dr. <hi>M.</hi>) we may ſay in this caſe, ſome who did once conſcienciouſly and humbly, according to their preſent light, diſſent from the late <hi>Synods,</hi> yet as they have grown in <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>ripeneſs</hi> for Heaven, the Lord hath given them for to ſee, that their <hi>rigidity</hi> in this particular was a failing.</q> And particularly as to himſelf, how does he intimate the ſame thing in that pathetic addreſs to other diſſenters? <q>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern (ſays he) I was once of your perſuaſion; but ſtudy and prayer and much affliction hath brought me to be of another belief than once! was.</q> (<hi>preface.</hi> p. 1.)</p>

                  </gap>al HEAD, to conſider his manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me both in relation to the general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular controverſy.</p>
               <p>IN general we may obſerve the method of his book. He firſt lays down arguments in proof of his plan; then conſiders them in objections, taking but little or no notice of me all this while, as if none of theſe objections were found in the Eſſay, but were found out by his own ſagacity. And when he comes to ſpeak of the Eſſays, it ſeems he finds nothing in them but a heap of ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>bles and inconſiſtencies, of miſrepreſenſations and unjuſt charges, ſcarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his notice. In this contemptuous manner he treats me. And with the like contempt he hath treated me in his letters and otherwiſe during this controverſy. And the ſame ſort of treatment I had much experience of, during the firſt ſeven years of his miniſtry, as the whole pariſh do know, if they would teſtify, which gave great offence in the time of it. Of theſe things more hereafter.</p>
               <p>But with reſpect to the <hi>general controverſy.</hi> Here are three ſections, which I ſhall conſider diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I begin with his 4th SECTION from <hi>p.</hi> 28, to <hi>p.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>He firſt ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 28. "I ſtated the queſtion rightly, whether the <hi>half way practice</hi> of admitting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" I never ſtated the queſtion ſo It is an abomination to me. The phraſe half practice, half members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is entirely his own, and what he imported from <hi>Connecticut.</hi> It was never known or thought of in theſe parts, till he introduced it. And the firſt coiners of the phraſe (who they were God knows) did it out of politic views: it being a common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, when any have a mind to run down a cauſe, to brand it with ſome odious <hi>nick-name.</hi> This is the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012739_0059_0F8BEAD3AE7A4CD8"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> here. The phraſe in my apprehenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves ſo much venom and malignity in it, that it is ſtrange any chriſtian ſhould uſe it.</p>
               <p>"The queſtion being thus rightly ſtated (ſays he) I quickly ramble from it, and endeavor to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh another point." But how does he prove it? not by following me argument by argument, but by culling out a paſſage here and there, without regarding what preceeded or followed. Firſt a ſhort paſſage (Eſſay 1ſt) <hi>p.</hi> 2. and then flying to <hi>p.</hi> 12. (Eſſay 2d.) I deſire the reader to look into both thoſe pages, and they will plainly ſee how he abuſes me. Theſe paſſages are, "neither does Chriſt ſo much as intimate that they were graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereby letting us know, that it is viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip gives the right." "From whence we may infer that it is not contrary to the mind of God, that the children of perſons unregenerate ſhould have this ordinance adminiſtred to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to him." What do theſe expreſſions import more than this, that God expects and requires that his church treat all thoſe that are viſibly in covenant with him as proper members of his church, whether regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or no, as long as they behave well. Does not Mr. <hi>R.</hi> hold this as well as I? and hath he not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages to the like purpoſe? for he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that we have nothing to do with the heart. This firſt paſſage then being the only ramble he accuſes me of in the 1ſt. Eſſay, and the ſecond the only one in the 2d. Eſſay, (all comprized within the compaſs of 5 lines:) ſurely all the reſt muſt be to the point. Why then does not he attempt to anſwer it? as ſurely he has not done. For my part, upon reviewing the piece, it appears to me, that inſtead of flying from the point, I ſtick cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it. And here by the way, I would obſerve how eaſy it is to anſwer any book whatſoever, if it is ſufficient to pick out a paſſage or ſcrap here and there (leaving out what preceeded or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and then rack and mangle it to ſpeak what they pleaſe. A man may go on anſwering to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at this rate.</p>

If he can prove, that the candidates <hi>neglect, i. e.</hi> ſlight and contemn the ordinance of the ſupper, let them in God's name be kept off. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve is his common phraſe, not only in his title page, but throughout his whole book, to inflame people againſt me; ſometimes the word <hi>neglect</hi> only is uſed; ſometimes <hi>habitual neglect</hi> (which is ſtronger ſtill;) ſometimes <hi>renounce, refuſe, &amp;c.</hi> Sometimes it is <hi>allowed neglect and violation,</hi> a <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neglect</hi>

So far from this, that he calls them <hi>members in full communion,</hi> baptizes their children; yea, gives them the character of <hi>exemplary</hi> chriſtians; (juſtly I truſt as to moſt of them, but inconſiſtently as to himſelf.)</note> (always the ſtrongeſt expreſſions he could invent) Yea, it comes at laſt to be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right wickedneſs. <hi>p.</hi> 57.

And yet, to our amazement, after all this group of expreſſions; and after he had further declared, "that we find no warrant for any exception in the word of God, let the plea for it be what it will," he comes at length to grant, in direct contradiction to all he had ſaid, that it is "<hi>often</hi> the caſe that real good chriſtians may be under ſuch ſcruples, under ſuch doubts and fears, as to deter them from the Lord's-ſupper, and yet ſee their way clear to offer their children to baptiſm. <hi>p.</hi> 38.

But ſuch ſcruples are not to be indulged. Why? becauſe they ariſe from <hi>wrong notions. p.</hi> 38. For my part, I think in many caſes they are juſtly grounded, if our opponent's plan be right. What can be more natural than ſuch reaſonings as theſe? "it is a plain command it is true, <hi>do this,</hi> &amp;c. But to whom is this command given? to believers, real diſciples, not to ſinners while ſuch. <hi>p.</hi> 46. Am I then a believer? it is true, I have ſome hopes; I have had ſome experience of a law and goſpel work upon my ſoul; I have ſeen ſomething of the evil of ſin, and my need of Chriſt, and my ſoul longs for an intereſt in him.

It is much better therefore for me to ſtay, till I have clearer evidences. This is certainly ſafeſt; as coming in hypocriſy (as muſt be the caſe if I be unregenerate) is worſe than not coming at all." Such reaſonings as theſe, I do not ſee how the beſt caſuiſt among them can get over, or duely ſolve, without warping and bending their plan to ſuit every caſe.</p>
               <p>As for the intimation, "that ſuch ſcruples chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe from this half-way practice." <hi>p.</hi> 38. It is intirely groundleſs. It is the natural conſequence of the plan. And it is certain, that ſuch ſcruples as much or more prevailed, when what Mr. <hi>R.</hi> calls "the <hi>original plan</hi>" was in vogue, than even at this day. For if they had not been generally
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012739_0063_0F8BEAD7C8C27E20"/>prevalent in the days of our <hi>fathers,</hi> the genera court would never have called a <hi>ſynod</hi> to conſider what was to be done in the caſe.</p>

                  </gap>fore he was born, or before he had a being. The one ſuppoſition is as natural as the other. But if he muſt be argued with, let me tell him, that text would forever ſtand as a barr. <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 38. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> accuſes me of "frequently appealing to the <hi>deciſions</hi> of men." The occaſion of it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had ſaid, "The Church hath in all ages been larger in admitting to baptiſm than to the Lord's-ſupper." I think there is ſomewhat in the obſervation, though we are not to be certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by their opinion; but muſt go to the law and to the teſtimony. But if I was to be ſwayed by human authority, I had much rather make the <hi>univerſal church</hi> my ſtandard, than either Dr. <hi>B.</hi> or Mr. <hi>R.</hi> eſpecially ſince they are ſo fluctuating in their opinions. I would obſerve here, that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> is quite as ready to fly to human authority as I, when he thinks it makes for him: the inſtances of it in his book are numerous; and even in his letter, does he not have recourſe to human authority? what a ſtreſs does he there lay on the authority of the WOMEN? It ſeems to be the chief argument in that epiſtle; "I queſtion, ſays he, whether you have 4 women in the whole church with you;" and this he "thinks matter of weighty conſideration in the affair." (Eſſays, <hi>p.</hi> 35.) I never-knew before but that the authority of <hi>men,</hi> was as <hi>deciſive</hi> as that of <hi>women,</hi> eſpecially of women the moſt part of whom had never heard or read any thing about the affair. But to leave trifting, I doubt not but that he thinks it ſomewhat in the <hi>ante-poedobaptiſt</hi> controverſy, that their opinion is novel, and was never heard of in the chriſtian church till about 200 years ago. So that even according to him, it is lawful to mention hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man authority, or "the deciſions of men" ſometimes,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012739_0064_0F8BEAD8B2DB7478"/>in way of illuſtration or collateral proof. As for the piece of hiſtory that follows, (for he muſt ſhew himſelf an hiſtorian as well as divine) I am certain he is miſtaken: in the primitive church, they were admitted as <hi>catachumens,</hi> long before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and they were for the moſt part baptized (eſpecially if <hi>gentiles</hi> before) ſometime before they were confirmed; though in ſeveral inſtances, where the candidate appeared a great proficient, as in the caſe of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and others, baptiſm and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediately followed one the other.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 38, 9. he ſays, "That I certainly intimate in many places, that the <hi>ſame eſſential</hi> qualifications were not neceſſary for the one ordinance as the other." Where this certain intimation appears, I know not: all that they can juſtly infer from my words is, that the church need not be ſo ſtrict reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting candidates for baptiſm as for the Lords-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but if there be the loweſt degree of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or but a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of their being gracious, though they have many fears about them, they ought not to be excluded, in caſe they aſk this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege for their children. The one is a ſacrament of entrance, the other of growth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The worſt of ſinners, if they appear penitent to the church, ought to be immediately baptized. But in ſome caſes it would not be ſo adviſable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him directly to the Lord's-ſupper. The moſt ignorant of <hi>heathens</hi> may be taught enough in an hours time, and he may appear to receive it ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, that he may be intitled to baptiſm; yet not have knowlege enough to be received immediately to the Lord's-ſupper.</p>
               <p>In the next page, he obſerves that "the firſt ſettlers in <hi>New-England</hi> allowed this privilege to none but the children of communicants." And in many other places he ſays, that "this practice is contrary to the <hi>original plan</hi> upon which theſe church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were ſettled." <hi>p.</hi> 1. 53. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How he durſt ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm this I know not: I am ſure with reſpect to <hi>Plymouth</hi> church he aſſerts it intirely by gueſs; for there are no church records extant but what were written after my grandfather's ſettlement in
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012739_0065_0F8BEAD9C1B5D9D8"/>1667. And no account of their practice in this particular in their early days; nor any account of their ſentiments at all except what makes againſt Mr. <hi>R.</hi> The miniſters and elders weekly cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing and inſtructing, putting queſtions, and preaching or expounding the principles of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the children of the church, and training them up for the Lords-ſupper; their dealing with them as members as much as the communicants; their admitting them to covenant more than once, in a body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all contrary to modern example, and inconſiſtent with preſent principles or practices. It is certain there is nothing in the church records, that directly militates with this practice, and we may with great propriety put the queſtion here, that has been ſo often put at this day, <hi>"who was ever denied?"</hi> can he produce an inſtance of one baptized perſon that applied, and was refuſed, either in a general or particular manner? nothing ſurely can be inferred from a church's forbearing the practice, what their real principle was about it; it might be owing to none's applying, and not to principle. I might add, that there are ſome paſſages in Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s (their firſt miniſter's) writings, that look favorably towards this practice.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt ſettlers of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> he cannot but know what were the ſentiments of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the firſt fathers in the point. I having lent him Dr. <hi>I. Mather</hi>'s book intitled, "<hi>the firſt principles of New-England,</hi> &amp;c." whether he thought it worth reading or no, I cannot tell; but if he did read it, I am amazed he ſhould talk as he does. The fact was this, the firſt comers were generally communicants, ſo there was no occaſion to diſcuſs the point: but when grand-children were born, and the country increaſed, after a due conſideration of the point, moſt of the firſt ſettlers (being then alive) fell in with the practice. But I have ſpoke enough upon this head in the Eſſays, which it ſeems he deems unworthy of the leaſt notice; except to ſpeak in direct contradiction to part of it.</p>
               <p>As to "the melancholy proſtitution of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance" by their poſterity, ſo contrary to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012739_0066_0F8BEADA1DE3D718"/>deſign of the <hi>ſynod,</hi> which he tells us of in the ſame page, whether he accuſes himſelf or others, I know not; I leave his own conſcience to judge: but I would tell him this, that I am far from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty to the charge, while I was in the miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and I do not doubt many other miniſters can ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>I now come to his fifth Section, from <hi>p.</hi> 41. to <hi>p.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>Wherein he endeavors to ſhew, that my book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains little elſe but a bundle of inconſiſtencies and contradictions, or elſe is very erroneous and weak, and betrays great confuſion of thought. "It would be <hi>endleſs,</hi> ſays he, to follow Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in all his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and inconſiſtencies." Therefore it ſeems he only ſelects a few.</p>
               <p>In his firſt entrance on this Section, <hi>p.</hi> 41. there ſeems to be as many miſrepreſentations almoſt as lines: he intirely miſtakes "<hi>the grand point</hi> I am aiming at." "It is, ſays he, to prove that it is <hi>lawful</hi> for perſons that have been baptized and are not ſcandalous, to own the covenant and have baptiſm for their children though they <hi>neglect</hi> to come up to the other ordinance; and that church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ought to admit them to the former, though they refuſe the latter." This I have already diſclaimed: I ſay with him, let all <hi>neglecters</hi> and <hi>refuſers</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if he can prove them ſuch.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance of inconſiſtence that he alleges is, that I charge him "with propoſing a popiſh diſpenſation, and yet my whole book is wrote to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh the lawfulneſs of ſuch a diſpenſation." I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the charge: I made a diſtinction between <hi>a mere ſufferance or paſſive connivance,</hi> and an <hi>actual allowance.</hi> The former I ſaid was the caſe according to the preſent mode, and the latter according to his ſcheme. There muſt be an <hi>actual vote</hi> in the caſe, after the candidate had promiſed to come immediately. He himſelf once ſaw the force of this diſtinction, when I diſcourſed with him in private, and endeavored to contrive methods to obviate the difficulty. But now the ſcale is turned, and he endeavors to involve me in the ſame difficulty. I know no way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, but by ſuppoſing his <hi>aſſiſtant</hi> wrote this
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012739_0067_0F8BEADAE8273C60"/>part, who did not ſo much conſider. But ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpenſation on both ſides were of the like tenor, all that can be ſaid upon it is, that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of mine muſt ſtand for nothing, but does not in the leaſt invalidate my other pleas againſt his expedient.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inſtance of inconſiſtence is, that I call "baptized perſons <hi>real</hi> members, <hi>compleat</hi> members, viſible chrſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in effect call t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em elſewhere a <hi>carnal generation,</hi> &amp;c." I would aſk him, whether the prophets, <hi>John</hi> the baptiſt, yea, Chriſt himſelf, have not frequently done the like? and does not he and other miniſters often do the ſame in their preaching? we may certainly expreſs our fears in a general way, that there is too great reigning car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality among profeſſors, whether communicants or others; and yet not do right in rejecting indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals when they offer themſelves againſt whom we know no juſt objection. And it is certain, if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons ſhould generally come to communion, we ſhould have a greater number of carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants than we have now. As for that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "that the church would willingly admit theſe candidates in full; but the difficulty lies in their own breaſts, not in ours." <hi>I</hi> ſpeak not here of baptized perſons in general (as he intimates) but only of thoſe who actually apply, againſt whom is no juſt exception.</p>
               <p>The next inconſiſtency (<hi>p.</hi> 42.) is already obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated under the obſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve what a captious diſpoſition it ſhews, to repeat over and over detached ſhreds and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which appear quite harmleſs and natural, as they ſtand in connection.</p>
               <p>He here ſeems to have done with inconſiſtencies for the preſent, and next muſters up a number of particulars, to make me appear ignorant and weak, or very erroneous.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 43. He taxes me with groſs error in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "that children's memberſhip is a <hi>diſtinct thing</hi> from that of their parents, though coming through their means; and that to puniſh them, becauſe their parents do not immediately approach to the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012739_0068_0F8BEADB8E468A80"/>Lord's-table, is hard and injurious." But where does the error lye? is it in the firſt part? dare he deny, that their memberſhip is diſtinct? are they not diſtinct parties in the covenant! <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. Does not their memberſhip remain, when their parents are dead, and their relation to the viſible church wholly ceaſed?<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> remarks, that ſome of the oppoſers of the <hi>ſynod</hi> were ſo abſurd, as to make a ſerious queſtion of it, <hi>whether men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>But can any man (ſays the doctor) in good earneſt think, that an hypocrite when he is dead and gone to his own place, is ſtill a member of God's church? yet his infant child is ſo: therefore the memberſhip of the child doth exiſt after the memberſhip of the parent is extinct; therefore it is really diſtinct from the parents memberſhip.</q> 
                     <hi>Subjects of bapt.</hi> p. <hi>64.</hi>
                  </note> And do not the children of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, though ever ſo young, retain their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, after their parents are excommunicated? which could not be, if their memberſhip was not diſtinct. But it is perhaps the inference that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him, "to puniſh children, becauſe their parents do not immediately come to the Lord's-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is hard and injurtous." I think ſo ſtill: for if they are in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ation, as to be <hi>real members</hi> of the church as being children of members (which way of arguing he has not yet diſproved) they ought to have the ſeal. But will it not follow from hence, "that the children of all baptized perſons however ſcand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lous, ought to have the ſeal?" I anſwer, no; if parents have actually <hi>forfeited</hi> their memberſhip, their children cannot properly be called the children of members. Or if they have not forfeited it, the church ought not to force the privilege upon them, without aſking. But if they come and aſk for it, and no proper objection made againſt their conduct, who dare deny them?</p>
               <p>He next accuſes me of great confuſion of thought in that expreſſion, "baptiſm ſeals ſaving bleſſing to the unregenerate, <hi>conditionally.</hi>" It is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. <hi>Stoddard's,</hi> and let him fight it out
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012739_0069_0F8BEADCF19E87A8"/>with him. However, I muſt tell him, that I ſee no impropriety in the expreſſion. Suppoſe there ſhould be a covenant wrote between him and me, and I ſhould ſign and ſeal it, but he by reaſon of abſence or otherwiſe ſhould not ſign and ſeal for weeks and months, it may properly be called a ſealed covenant on my part, but yet <hi>conditionally;</hi> it takes no effect till he hath ſealed it likewiſe. The ſame may be ſaid in the preſent caſe. But what advantage would it be to ſuppoſe ſuch a condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeal on God's part? what benefit does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any more to the baptized than unbaptized? I anſwer, great benefit, even according to him. For he ſays a few pages after, "there are promiſes all over the bible to the children of believers." And is it no advantage to have ſuch promiſes ſealed to them, though at preſent in a ſtate of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy? I make no doubt but <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> whom I there mentioned by name, found great benefit by this conditional ſeal. For from ſome paſſages in the old-teſtament, we may infer that he died a good man, however bad in his younger years.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of "the ſame confuſion, ſays he, appears in my idea or deſcription of a ſeal." <hi>p.</hi> 43. I had ſaid and I think fully proved, that prayer, hearing, reading, offering ſacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſeals, always ſeals of the covenant of grace, when proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed. And I would now further tell him, that the ſaying of the Lord's prayer (which is the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all true prayer) <hi>from the heart,</hi> is as much a ſolemn covenant tranſaction as if any perſon ſhould ſtand in the broad alley, and ſhould have the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in form propounded to him. True prayer is a covenant tranſaction always; there is a promiſe on God's part, and there is a ſeal on our part in pleading and laying hold of it. In anſwer to this, he ſeems readily to grant, that prayer, hearing, reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſeals, if uſed in faith. And ſurely baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper are ſeals in no other ſenſe. A <hi>conditional ſeal</hi> he hath been juſt laughing at. So that all the ordinances in this reſpect ſeem to be upon a par. Hence I argued, that if unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men may lawfully uſe ſome of the ſeals
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012739_0070_0F8BEADD1EADF548"/>(conſidered only as ſeals) he may upon the ſame ground uſe the other, yea all, and that there was nothing in the <hi>nature</hi> of a ſeal to hinder him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, their argument taken merely from the word ſeal (which they laid ſo much ſtreſs upon) was of no force. However, that there were ſome other conſiderations which rendered it not proper, that baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper ſhould be made as <hi>common</hi> as the other ordinances, though this from the nature of a ſeal was given up. Of this latter clauſe he takes no notice; and as to the other part of the argument, he ſeems not to have the leaſt idea of what I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imed at; which was not to prove (as he aſſerts) that all ſorts, good and bad, even the moſt ſcandalous, have a right to baptiſm; but that the reſtrictive uſe of this and the other ordinance could not be argued merely from the term <hi>ſeal</hi> (which was a common name for all the ordinances) but muſt be taken from other topicks. As much as to ſay, that a barrier ought indeed to be ſet round the ordinances of baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper; but that this could not be proved barely from the word <hi>ſeal</hi> (this being a common term) but muſt be taken from weightier conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely, the expreſs declarations of God in ſcripture. This gives me occaſion to caution him not to miſtake me again, as he has done above twenty-times in my book, I hope not wilfully.</p>
               <p>Next, he animadverts upon "my ſtrange notions about aſſurance," and wreſts my words in a ſtrange manner. It appears to me the unavoidable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their doctrine, that <hi>full aſſurance</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to coming to the ordinance: ſo far as they doubt of their ſtate, ſo far they muſt doubt of their right; and no man ought to come to it with a <hi>doubting conſcience,</hi> eſpecially if the ſin be greater for an unregenerate perſon to come than to ſtay away, (as ſome of them expreſsly teach.) Now if full aſſurance or an aſſurance that excludes all doubt be neceſſary, it muſt be attained before they come; and if attained, what need they come to attain what they have already? as it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012739_0071_0F8BEADDB81986C8"/>for a man regenerate to come to the means to obtain regenerating grace, which he is already poſſeſſed of. But yet in both caſes, they ought to come for other ends: the aſſured chriſtian ought to come to get his aſſurance confirmed, habituated and preſerved, which may be loſt many ways; he ought to come to have his <hi>graces</hi> increaſed and ſtrengthened, for certainly they are not come to their full ſtrength, although his <hi>evidences</hi> are; there being no <hi>higher pitch</hi> than full aſſurance attainable in this life: he ought to come to teſtify his love and reſpect to his gracious Lord and maſter, and for many other valuable ends. Theſe I thought needleſs to ſet down, becauſe not to the point in hand. How injurious then is Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, as if I held that the ordinances were inſtituted only or principally "to aſcertain to a man his own ſafe ſtate:" But it is his way to take all opportunities to repreſent me weak or wicked.</p>
               <p>As to his aſſertion, that my ſcheme neceſſarily involves me in the ſame difficulty they are under, or "that the dead weight I mention lies full as heavy upon me as on them," I ſee no juſt grounds for it. I have already noticed a two-fold diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relative to our right in the ſight of God, which I think ſufficiently clears me. And then further, Dr. <hi>B.</hi> holds. that it is a <hi>greater ſin</hi> for an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man (however ſincere or whatever his hopes are) to come than to ſtay away, (which doctrine he no where diſavows, though I rendred it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to do it, if he was of another mind) which certainly is a ſufficient bar againſt any one's coming upon uncertainties. Whereas if they incur leſs guilt by coming than by abſenting, though uncertain and even under a miſtake, they had better come than not, in hopes divine mercy will bleſs the ordinance for their ſpiritual good. This leads me to take notice of his ſurprizing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation (taken from Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> although he gives him not credit for it.) <hi>p.</hi> 46. <q>If the Lord's-ſupper were only a privilege, which I am allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take, upon certain qualifications in me;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012739_0072_0F8BEAE502C11018"/>and forbidden, if I had not thoſe qualifications; in ſuch a caſe, it would certainly be ſafeſt for me to abſtain, till I <hi>know</hi> I have the qualifications. But ſuppoſing I am ſtrictly commanded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by God, to take, if I have thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then it is EQUALLY dangerous to neglect on uncertainties as to take on uncertainties.</q> What, <hi>equally</hi> dangerous, when the ſin is <hi>greater</hi> on the ſide of coming! what, ſhall I be guilty of a greater ſin in coming than "drunkenneſs, adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" and yet had I beſt come after all, though I do not know but that I may involve myſelf in ſuch heinous guilt? ſurely ſuch ſort of reaſoning will convince no body but ſuch as believe with their <hi>wills,</hi> and not with their <hi>underſtandings.</hi> But ſuppoſing the guilt <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides, as the words in this place import, then it ſeems the ſcale is even: a man in doubt muſt neither come nor ſtay away: there is nothing to preponderate on the one ſide or the other; he may chuſe either, and not be more guilty. And yet notwithſtanding this even bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the inference is, that he ought to come. "An inference truly worthy a <hi>logician.</hi>" It would not avail them here to ſay, that a man hath <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing hopes</hi> in the caſe: for what good will theſe prevailing hopes do him, if he be <hi>really miſtaken</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all? ſuch hopes do not abate, but rather ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his guilt. So that theſe ought not to turn the ſcale in favor of coming. Nothing but abſolute certainty will do. This is ſo plain a caſe, that when one of his intimates in the miniſtry (of one ſoul with him in this diſpute) was lately preſſed with my <hi>dead weight,</hi> and when beat out of their common place ſubter-fuges (ſuch as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> uſes) he at laſt openly declared, "that he did not care if this conſequence did follow from their doctrine, it was true doctrine, and none ought to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they had <hi>aſſurance.</hi>"</p>
               <p>In the next paragraph. 46. I ſcarce know what he is after. I had ſaid, "if a man declares on oath more than he knows, he is guilty of perjury, though it happen afterwards to appear true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" Does he deny this? no, not in direct terms. But
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012739_0073_0F8BEAE74EDCF268"/>he endeavors to make it a contradiction to another paſſage of mine, namely, "that if a perſon offers his child in baptiſm he muſt ſay, that as far as he knows his own heart he is ſincerely willing to give up himſelf and his children to God." Does this man declare more than he knows? are theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>as far as he knows,</hi> and, <hi>more than he knows,</hi> ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous? what trifling is here?</p>
               <p>Further, he ſays, "that if there be any validity in my way of reaſoning here, all the forms of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting uſed all over the country muſt be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." I anſwer, it is high time they were aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they oblige men to ſay upon oath more than they know; or to declare that to be true which they do not know to be true; or in other words, to tell their maker and the church in the moſt ſolemn manner, that they <hi>have ſaving faith,</hi> when they do not know whether they have it or not. I never put any ſuch conſtruction upon the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor I believe any one elſe before this day.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 47. he taxes me with "a very great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take (not to call it worſe) in aſſerting, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied infant memberſhip." And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſpeaks more largely in his marginal note, <hi>p.</hi> 30.31. I never aſſerted, that he held baptized infants ſtood in no ſort of relation to the church: but that he denied their memberſhip in any <hi>proper ſenſe,</hi> if I can underſtand language, he did do it, and that in the plaineſt manner: and this not by a tranſient expreſſion; it was a point talked of near half an hour; and this was all we could bring him to own, after all poſſible canvaſſings and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to make him ſpeak out, <hi>that they were laid under bonds,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which one of the members ſaid, "that if this was all that was imported in infant memberſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they were only laid under bonds, but intitled to no privilege, then they were <hi>mere bond ſlaves;</hi>" which occaſioned a ſharp reproof. And preſently after, upon my mentioning that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the catechiſm, <hi>the infants of ſuch as are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible church are to be baptized,</hi> he readily granted it. Which implied that the perſons in queſtion were not members. How could we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012739_0074_0F8BEAE7810F5CC0"/>him otherwiſe than that he denied their memberſhip in any proper ſenſe? But the truth of the matter is, he hath ſhifted ſo often, when preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cloſely, and ſometimes owned and ſometimes denied, as ſuited the preſent purpoſe, that we ſcarce know how to take him. However, if we may judge by his book, comparing one paſſage with another, his <hi>preſent</hi> opinion ſeems to be this; when they are firſt baptized they are <hi>proper members,</hi> but when they grow up, their memberſhip wears off by piece-meal or they gradually loſe it, till at laſt it is quite gone, unleſs they come to the Lord's-table; and this without the churches ſetting a mark on them, or any chargeable irregularity. But if they go ſo far as actually to own the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>half</hi> of their (proper) memberſhip remains, the other half is loſt. How reaſonable this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Next he obſerves, "that this half-way practice tends to bring infant baptiſm into diſgrace, and that <hi>nothing in the world</hi> hath contributed more to prejudice many againſt infant baptiſm, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of <hi>anabaptiſts</hi> among us than this." <hi>p.</hi> 48. For this we have only his <hi>ipſe dixit.</hi> I never heard or read of any, that made this their main plea; yea, I never heard it pleaded at all by the favorers of <hi>anabaptiſm</hi> (though I have converſed with ſeveral.) And plain fact proves, that this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is not true. For let us look all around us, and we ſhall find, that the places where the <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> have moſt generally increaſed, are ſuch places where this practice is ſhut out. And indeed the very ſhutting it out, affords them a good plea, (which they do not fall to uſe:) "for here, ſay they, are ſome whom you have received as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and acknowlege as members; and yet actually treat them as no members; you will not baptize their children, nor exerciſe any diſcipline over them, but let them run as lambs in a large paſture: what is their memberſhip good for, if they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no privilege, nor any care taken of them? it were much better they had never been baptized at all." This pleaſurely carries great weight with it. The
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012739_0075_0F8BEAE888FA9580"/>only way to diſprove it, would be to treat them as members, and to revive a godly diſcipline over them (as ſtrict as that over communicants, which was practiſed in the days of our fathers) and then their prejudices would gradually vaniſh.</p>
               <p>I muſt juſt take notice of his marginal note here (<hi>p.</hi> 48.) becauſe he hath accuſed me of <hi>ſewing pillows,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dawbing,</hi> &amp;c. and would aſk, whether there is no appearance of it here? <q>I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſays he, by any thing I have ſaid to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the characters of any in <hi>this place,</hi> who have owned the covenant. It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged they are, to all appearance, perſons of good characters and <hi>exemplary converſation.</hi>
                  </q> If this be true, it is ſurely a good encouragement to proceed in the practice. But can he ſay upon his conſcience, that he never heard any thing <hi>amiſs</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of them? and yet is he careſſed. as one of the deareſt and moſt boſom friends and companions?</p>
               <p>I now come to the grand point, the <hi>proton-pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> of all. <hi>p.</hi> 49. <q>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſays he, in defending this practice (as many others have done before him) has naturally, and I think, upon his plan neceſſarily, warped off from <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and run into ſentiments reſpecting men's <hi>natural depravity,</hi> exactly agreable to <hi>arminian</hi> writers.</q> When I firſt read the charge of <hi>arminianiſm</hi> in his letter, I was aſtoniſhed, and could not imagine from whence it took it's riſe: but ſince I have had opportunity of reading ſeveral <hi>connecticut</hi> writers on the ſubject, which unfolded the myſtery. The charge it ſeems was brought by Dr <hi>B.</hi> againſt his antagoniſts on the ſame ſide of the queſtion with me in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and that perhaps not without ſome founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Mr. <hi>R.</hi> took it from him as it were <hi>by rote,</hi> and thought the charge was calculated for the <hi>meridian</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> as well as <hi>Connecticut,</hi> without <hi>being able</hi> to comprehend the different plans we went upon; and therefore in a random confuſed manner he hath exhibited it againſt me; and through me againſt all that ever were in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And having once brought the charge, he thinks himſelf obliged in honor to defend it,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:012739_0076_0F8BEAE9132E2800"/>though it would have been much more to his honor to have retracted it, and not have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly expoſed himſelf. But how does he defend it? Why, by alleging ſome paſſages in my Eſſays, which he ſays are of <hi>arminian</hi> ſound. Here I would deſire the reader to turn to his letter, and they will find that this charge is not founded on ſuch paſſages as he here produces, but on "the practice itſelf and the arguments made uſe of" (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 35.) whereas theſe paſſages are no neceſſary part of the argument, but are mere <hi>tranſient expreſſions,</hi> and might as well have been left out, and my arguments would have remained in full force. But this is a fetch that he hath thought of, or was ſuggeſted to him by ſome friend when he came to ſtudy and anſwer my piece after printing. If he had thought of theſe in the time of writing his letter, inſtead of found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge upon the general ſcheme and run of the arguments (which he is careful not to call <hi>my arguments,</hi> leſt he ſhould give me too much credit) he would have expreſſed himſelf thus that in ſuch and ſuch expreſſions I <hi>arminianized,</hi> and not that the general ſcheme was incumbered with this difficulty.</p>
               <p>But let us now look into thoſe dangerous paſſages, and ſee what he can make of them. Firſt, ſays he, "he frequently repreſents natural men as <hi>truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of</hi> avouching the Lord for their God." I flatly deny the charge; there is not the leaſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for it in my Eſſays. Next, ſays he, "he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repreſents natural men as <hi>ſincerely</hi> entring into covenant with God, and giving up themſelves and their children to him in covenant." This is as groundleſs as the other. Is there no difference between a man's <hi>prevailingly hoping</hi> he does a duty ſincerely (<hi>i. e.</hi> graciouſly) and his <hi>really</hi> doing it in that manner? thoſe that have been <hi>long under conviction</hi> muſt certainly know, that they paſs through ſuch a variety of diſpoſitions, as that they are exceeding apt to take it for ſaving grace: ſometimes mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and great relentings for ſin, it appearing to them the moſt odious thing in the world: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great pangs of affection; ſometimes great
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012739_0077_0F8BEAE9C3444DC0"/>joy at ſome imperfect diſcoveries of goſpel grace, or upon viewing goſpel encouragements; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all theſe ſtreams are dried up, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to themſelves the moſt hardened wretches in the world; and then they flow again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus it may be alternately for years. And during the continuance of ſuch operations, they may be (at times) as fully ſatisfied of their <hi>ſincerity</hi> as that they have a being (whether it be a <hi>gracious ſincerity</hi> they know not). And in ſuch a caſe, may they not juſtly ſay (ſay it without lying) "that as far as they know their own heart they are ſincerely willing to give themſelves and their children to God? Mr. <hi>R. art thou a</hi> MASTER IN ISRAEL, <hi>and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not theſe things?</hi> if not, it is high time you ſhould: and for that end, to read <hi>Mead, Allen, Guthry,</hi> and ſuch experimental writers; if it be not beneath you to read ſuch low authors as theſe. It is plain, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under ſuch religious impreſſions at <hi>Sinai,</hi> that they verily thought they ſpoke truth and acted with ſincerity, when they ſaid, <hi>all that the Lord hath commanded us, we will do,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſame is the caſe frequently with ſinners, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conviction. Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s miſtake, whenever he is ſpeaking of the unregenerate, ſeems to ariſe from his conſidering them in their <hi>mere naturals</hi> (in which nothing but hell is breathed forth) wholly deſtitute of the <hi>common</hi> influences of the ſpirit, or of thoſe divine <hi>afflatus</hi>'s which the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are capable of; ſuch as <hi>Balaam</hi> was under when he talks ſo divinely, or <hi>Saul</hi> when he had <hi>another heart</hi> (though not a <hi>new heart</hi>) given him; or the divine impreſſions the <hi>ſtony ground hearers</hi> were under, though the <hi>ſtony heart</hi> ſtill remained. In which caſe, not only <hi>outward acts</hi> of ſin are reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the <hi>inward motions</hi> of ſin are pent up; ſo that their inclination to them ſeems to be gone, and their hearts riſe within them with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt themſelves, whenever they think of their old ways. This is a common caſe. And whenever it is ſo, it is natural for men (who are unacquainted with the real operations of divine or ſanctifying grace) to think themſelves <hi>ſincere,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:012739_0078_0F8BEAEA79C68AE8"/>and that theſe impreſſions will forever remain.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a frequent obſervation of divines, there is ſuch a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> between <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, that not only the church, but the perſon himſelf may be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: and when this is the caſe, according to Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s own principles, a man ought to come.—I would query here, whether he had not as much charity for one he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, in the time of it, as for any that ever he admitted, who made a <hi>relation</hi> very particular indeed.

To which I add, if it is ſuch an eaſy thing to come to ſatisfying concluſions about a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, as Dr. <hi>B.</hi> holds, what need of ſo many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes to ſatisfy the doubting conſcience? "He muſt ſit down and count the coſt and come to a peremptory reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," ſays he. Alas! how many have done ſo in their own apprehenſion; and yet when temptations came, what wythes have they proved?</note> This obſervation I deſire the reader to carry along with him, whenever the unregerate are ſpoken of as acting with any degree of ſincerity: and not to imagine that I hold, or that it is the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my doctrine, "that there is really ſome <hi>good thing</hi> in them towards the Lord;" as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> repreſents in his letter (Eſſays. <hi>p</hi> 36.) and in his book.</p>
               <p>He next quotes that paſſage, "as for thoſe that grow up, it is a ſeal at leaſt that they ſhall not only have the offer of Chriſt, but the ſtrivings of his ſpirit, which, if not reſiſted, will prove effectual to their converſion." Does the <hi>arminianiſm</hi> lye in the firſt part of this paſſage? then Dr. <hi>C.

               <p>I now proceed to his ſixth ſection from <hi>p.</hi> 51. to <hi>p.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>Wherein he endeavors to ſhow, that I have <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehended</hi> him in ſome things, and <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> him in others. Some of the inſtances, he alleges I have either already, or ſhall hereafter conſider; and therefore ſhall paſs them here.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance is, "that I repreſent it as his opinion. that a man muſt know he is in a gracious ſtate, muſt have <hi>aſſurance</hi> before he come, <hi>&amp;c." p.</hi> 51. "This is unfair, ſays he, we never held any ſuch doctrine." To this I ſuppoſe he refers in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his letter. "You, ſir, do certainly know, that neither I nor the brethren hold ſuch things as you there advanced as being our ſentiments." (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 34.) Whether he holds it or no, I am certain it is the <hi>neceſſary</hi> conſequence of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as I have often noted. But where can we find that I directly charge him with this? he refers for proof to ſome paſſages in the Eſſays, the firſt is <hi>p.</hi> 6. "if the knowlege of a man's good eſtate (as they hold) is a neceſſary qualification for the Lord's-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>p.</hi> 7. But is there not ſuch a thing as a <hi>conjectural</hi> as well as <hi>certain</hi> knowlege.? and do not I make an evident diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between theſe two? <hi>p.</hi> 9. (which is one of the pages he refers to): and is not the <hi>latter</hi> there charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as the <hi>neceſſary conſequence</hi> of his doctrine?
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012739_0085_0F8BEAF1353012D8"/>I am ſure Dr. <hi>B.</hi> makes uſe of the word <hi>knowlege</hi> or <hi>knowing</hi> in the caſe. And Mr. <hi>R.</hi> has ſeveral times, either in his ſermon or otherwiſe uſed ſuch high expreſſions, as his hearers took to purport a <hi>certain knowlege.</hi> But yet I never directly charged him with this. His uſual phraſe I know is, that <hi>prevailing hopes</hi> are ſufficient. But is not even this carrying the matter too far? there is no <hi>eſſential</hi> difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>firſt</hi> coming to ordinances, and the <hi>after</hi>-coming (they renewing covenant as really each time); and if the firſt coming muſt be with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing hopes, then the after coming muſt be ſo too: conſequently perſons muſt never come when they are under <hi>prevailing fears.</hi> And is this right? muſt this door of conſolation be ſhut? muſt chriſtians be excluded from ordinances when they ſtand in moſt need of them.</p>
               <p>He next taxes me with treating him hardly and unjuſtly in that paſſage of the Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 26. "It hath been once and again ſaid, that the purport of the new ſcheme is to <hi>enlarge,</hi> and not to <hi>curtail and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their privileges.</hi> viz. by obliging them to come immediately into full communion." And is not this an obligation with a witneſs? and deſigned as ſuch? for how could their privileges be <hi>enlarged</hi> in any other way but by coming? if they ſtayed away, he would allow them no privilege at all.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page, he taxes me with miſtake (if not falſhood) in the account I gave of Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s introducing the practice. But which is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know the truth of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acts, whether Mr. <hi>R</hi> or I who lived upon the ſpot in the time of it, I leave the world to judge. And my account is confirmed by an ancient deacon of the church, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the meeting, and actually voted in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. But it ſeems Mr. <hi>R.</hi> will not believe any thing that comes from our quarter, if it does not ſuit him. This is not the only inſtance of his <hi>infidelity.</hi> It is certain matter of fact, that Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> had the majority with him long before the point was brought to a public deciſion. That the practice was received by a <hi>unanimous voice</hi> I never aſſerted; but that there was a <hi>general acquieſcence</hi> I have the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012739_0086_0F8BEAF760B27FA8"/>utmoſt reaſon to believe. As to ſome (<hi>i. e.</hi> two or three's) objecting, mentioned in the record, that was previous to the vote, and is no ways inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their declaring they would acquieſce, if the generality of the church were for introducing the practice; and "the <hi>calmneſs</hi>" with which the meeting was carried on and concluded, ſhows it to be the caſe. And if it had been otherwiſe, is it not ſtrange that ſome or other ſhould not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, beſides the "aged member," mentioned by Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (it being tranſacted but about 41 years ago) As to the account given by ſaid aged perſon (if I am informed right) it ſo <hi>directly militated</hi> with the record, that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (though he made uſe of it in his private viſits, to prove the deacon and me, <hi>liars,</hi> yet he) was afraid to ſet it down in full in his book. But if the record had not providentially ſtood in his way, how unmercifully would he have triumphed over us, upon this ſingle teſtimony? and indeed he can ſcarce help doing it notwithſtanding. I do not intend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to caſt any diſparagement upon this aged mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (I reckon him a <hi>worthy one</hi> as well as Mr. <hi>R.</hi>); but age and infirmity may make him forget.</p>
               <p>As for the charge of <hi>"innovation"</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 53.) I never brought it againſt him. He hath a right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an alteration, if he be conſcienciouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded. But I ſhould have been glad, if he had been as prudent in the management of it as Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> was. If Mr. <hi>Leonard,</hi> inſtead of taking the ſteps he did, had wrote two ſuch letters either to elder <hi>Faunce,</hi> or old deacon <hi>Foſter,</hi> as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> has done to me; inſtead of bringing in the practice, he would have outed himſelf (without a very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowlegement indeed), and brought ſuch a ſtain upon him as he could never have got over. And as to the "alteration's not <hi>originating</hi> from him," but that numbers of the brethren were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the practice previous to his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it, I have reaſon to think he is miſtaken. It was not ſo much the practice <hi>itſelf</hi> as the <hi>abuſe</hi> of it, that gave ground of diſſatisfaction. If only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſerious characters had applied, I believe
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012739_0087_0F8BEAF9A78CDCD8"/>none would have been uneaſy; but that ſome (whoſe real characters were better known to them than to the miniſter) ſhould ſtand up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and covenant in ſuch a ſolemn manner, this filled them with trembling: and it would have been juſt the ſame, if they had applied for full communion. This was really the caſe, as I have heard ſome of the brethren declare, whom I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>R.</hi> refers to.</p>
               <p>It makes me ſick to hear ſo much of "the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plan of this church and of all the churches in <hi>New-England.</hi>" (<hi>p.</hi> 53.) They had really no plan about it; it was a point not thought of, till the <hi>third</hi> generation came upon the ſtage. And then as ſoon as there was occaſion for it, the matter was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; and not long after the practice was almoſt ganerally received.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 55. He "takes notice of a <hi>very cruel</hi> inſtance of miſrepreſentation," as he calls it, namely, my ſetting down that expreſſion of his, <hi>what ſignifies it to have an infant ſprinkled with a little water?</hi> this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſays, or ſomething like it was brought in in the midſt of an <hi>elaborate ſpeech,</hi> which he ſets down. <hi>p.</hi> 56. But how was it poſſible for him to make ſuch a ſpeech, while I was actually reading my Eſſay? Could we both ſpeak at once? in fact, this expreſſion ſtood ſingly and alone, and was blurted out in the audience of ſome that ſtood near him in the time of my reading, and not ſpoken in the hearing of the whole aſſembly, when I had done, in a ſet anſwer to me. And indeed he never attempted a <hi>direct anſwer</hi> to any of my arguments in one of the church meetings, as I or others can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. The truth is, that when he uttered this ſentence, he was "under ſuch great perturbation of ſpirit" (of which hereafter) that I believe he ſcarce knew what he ſaid; and if he had alleged this in excuſe, it would have ſerved much better, than to have entertained his reader with a <hi>romantick ſpeech</hi> that no body ever heard before. It is certain, there is nothing contained in my <hi>thrid Eſſay,</hi> that gave proper foundation for ſuch a ſpeech. He ſays, <q>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> had then been inſiſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012739_0088_0F8BEAFAB7690730"/>of infant's baptiſm; and had carried the matter too far; even ſo far, that people would be in danger of thinking that they were <hi>actually regenerated</hi> by baptiſm; and therefore all that were not baptized muſt conſequently be loſt.</q> Where can he find one paſſage in that third Eſſay tending that way? (or indeed in any of the Eſſays?) And I did not otherwiſe utter one word about the point in controverſy during that whole meeting; but ſtudiouſly avoided it, being then very unwell. (This then is all a mere <hi>fiction</hi> of his own) Again, he ſays, "Mr. <hi>C.</hi> then inſiſted, that all baptized perſons had a right to this privilege, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or not, if they were free from <hi>hereſy</hi> or <hi>ſcandal,</hi> &amp;c." But where can he find any thing of this in that third Eſſay? is there one word in it a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout hereſy or ſcandal? or about the right of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons? his <hi>foundation</hi> and <hi>ſpeech</hi> then muſt both fall together, and paſs with the reader for a mere non-entity. I am ſorry I am obliged to ſay this; but muſt I not ſpeak the truth? does he not enforce me to it in my own defence? and will he venture to call it <hi>cruelty</hi> again?</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 58. he expreſsly aſſerts contrary to ſeveral former conceſſions, that <hi>all</hi> the baptized, who do not come to the Lord's-table, are <hi>wicked perſons.</hi> He had before muſtered up all the hard terms (or names) he could think of, calling them, <hi>neglecters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual neglecters and violaters, renouncers, refuſers,</hi> &amp;c.&amp;c. (Theſe phraſes occur above 50 times in his book.) But here is the crowning cut, it comes at laſt to be <hi>"open wickedneſs."</hi> This they "live" in, and this they are likely to dye in, for it ſeems as "the neglect is continued," and like to be ſo to the end. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo bad, they have it ſeems "juſtly forfeited the <hi>character</hi> and <hi>privileges</hi> of diſciples, or viſible chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans." What man or what woman of <hi>feeling</hi> will bear all this? and how is the <hi>bruiſed reed</hi> broken to purpoſe? did he think of this, when he preached his funeral ſermon? or did it come in mind, when he paſſes ſuch a <hi>compliment</hi> upon "the <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>habitual neglecters</hi>" (as he calls them) among us? <hi>p.</hi> 48.</p>

               <p>I come now to his laſt Section. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>In remarking upon which, I ſhall conſider his manner of treating me in relation to the <hi>particular</hi> controverſy.</p>
               <p>HERE a dark ſcene occurs, which I am ſorry he hath obliged me to bring into light. It really pains me to enter upon it; but how can I do otherwiſe, after ſuch innumerable miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? and when he hath had recourſe to ſo many evaſions to hide the truth? perhaps he thought by the <hi>number</hi> of his charges to lay me under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of writing ſo largely in order to clear my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the book would be of ſuch bulk as none would ſubſcribe for it or buy it, ſo that I muſt of neceſſity lay under the weight of them and be ſilenced forever. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut I truſt providence will order otherwiſe, and that there will be ſome way for the relief of injured innocence. Perhaps ſome may think I take delight in the ſubject, and that I muſtered up every thing I could in my firſt piece to expoſe him; but it is far from being the caſe. What I then wrote was but a ſmall ſample of his management, (which, not a principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but neceſſity did dictate:) and I ſuppreſſed a multitude of things (directly in point) that were as derogatory to his character as thoſe I mentioned, and that out of tenderneſs to him. But now by his imprudent and unguarded manner of writing, he hath neceſſitated me to enter upon a larger field, and to relate ſeveral things (though not the one half that might be told) that I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have buried in oblivion. My end in it is not to expoſe him, but to clear my own character; which I am the more ſolicitous to do, leaſt a <hi>good
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012739_0091_0F8BEAFC89FCA400"/>cauſe</hi> ſhould ſuffer for my ſake: for if I am ſo bad as repreſented, who will think my Eſſays worth reading?</p>
               <p>He firſt attacks me about <hi>publiſhing his letters,</hi> that paſſed between us; he begins with it in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, purſues it in his book, and repeats it over and over. He calls them <hi>"private letters:"</hi> but how could they be private, when all the town and country (where the public controverſy was known) had heard of the letters long before their printing? he tells us "that the publication of them was kept a profound ſecret from the ſubſcribers." The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers tell me the direct contrary; they never made a ſecret of it: but openly declared, that not <hi>"what was read,"</hi> but the <hi>whole affair</hi> ſhould be brought into public. "Some, he ſays, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſubſcribed, had they known of the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the letters." I never heard of but one that declared ſo; and he, after the book came out, and had the opportunity of peruſal, ſaid, he now ſaw the abſolute neceſſity of printing the letters. But, "what have the public to do with private letters? what concern with matters merely perſonal? or that relate to ſome difference between two perſons at <hi>Plymouth?</hi>" But how could they be called <hi>merely perſonal,</hi> unleſs they were written <hi>merely to vent his ſpleen againſt me?</hi> Did they not relate to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in debate? was it not the <hi>only</hi> anſwer he had ever given <hi>directly</hi> to my Eſſays? and was it not natural to expect to find ſomething in them edifying and inſtructing, tending to illuſtrate the controverſy, and to bring conviction both to me and others? what a reflection does he caſt upon himſelf, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be otherwiſe? by calling them <hi>merely perſonal?</hi> by intimating that they contained matter foreign to the point? and that they were really nothing to the purpoſe? why did he write them then? "But I did not aſk his leave to publiſh them." What reaſon had he to expect this, after he had abuſed me as he had done? But "I publiſhed them without his knowlege, he did not ſo much as <hi>ſuſpect</hi> it, till after they were gone to the preſs." How could this be, when he declared to one (if not more) of the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012739_0092_0F8BEAD580A58700"/>members ſeveral weeks before they were ſent to the preſs, "that he underſtood the letters were to be printed, but did not ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e upon his own account, but ſhould be ſorry for me, becauſe he thought it would hurt me?<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſeems to be a common expreſſion with him both before and after the letters went to the preſs; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was chiefly ſpoken before thoſe, who he thought would tell me of it, to diſcourage my proceeding. I heard it at ſeveral different times.</note> And how came it about, that ſome of his moſt noted intimates were up in arms about printing the letters, and took ſuch pains to prevent it near 2 months before they were ſent, <hi>viz.</hi> by poſting up at the market place, a moſt virulent libel, containing not only <hi>invectives,</hi> but <hi>threatnings</hi> in caſe I proceeded? and dropping another of the ſame import in the ſtreets? perhaps he thought theſe would make ſuch impreſſions as to prevent my going on, and ſo did not "<hi>ſuſpect,</hi> &amp;c." I know no better way to account for his peremptory denial, or to ſave his veracity. But "I myſelf was the faulty cauſe of their being made public; they were indeed ſoon in every one's mouth, yet it was not through his means, but my own." How could this be, when he read my letter openly in a neighbors houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after he received it? "But I never ſhewed them, ſays he, to <hi>four perſons</hi> in the world, till I heard he had given off <hi>copies.</hi>" This cannot be true;<note n="†" place="bottom">His ſecond letter perhaps he did not ſhow, but the other he did frequently. This I gueſs is his ſalvo, to prevent the impeachment of his veracity.</note> but ſuppoſe it was, did he not do what was worſe? the ſame week and the week after he received my letter, he viſited moſt abundantly, and in all places the letters were the ſubject of converſation; mine he repreſented in the moſt heinous light, as a mere heap of "<hi>ſcurrilities,</hi> &amp;c." reading ſcraps of it for confirmation, or reciting them <hi>memoriter;</hi> and his own he explained away to nothing,<note n="‡" place="bottom">In general, by ſaying, "that he did not mean ſo and ſo," though he could put no other meaning. Or more particularly, "that by the <hi>moſt godly,</hi> he chiefly meant <hi>women,</hi>" though he expreſsly mentions <hi>men,</hi> and though he ſpeaks of thoſe "that <hi>ſaw the bad conſequences of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (Eſſays. p. <hi>35. 39.</hi>) which the <hi>women</hi> could not do, moſt of them having never heard the arguments. Further, that "by <hi>ſeeming affectionateneſs,</hi>" he had no deſign to impeach my ſincerity. That he had no intent to tax me with <hi>arminianiſm,</hi> "though I hold <hi>exactly</hi> the ſame ſentiments with <hi>arminian</hi> writers," (p. <hi>49.</hi>) that he had no thoughts of forbidding my preaching; that by <hi>inſtructions</hi> he did not mean preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as a <hi>crowning cut,</hi> take this ſpecimen of his art. A <hi>good woman</hi> was <hi>grieving</hi> to him, that he ſhould call me an <hi>arminian,</hi> &amp;c. He told her, "it was no ſuch thing, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> was as ſound a man as any in the world; all he meant by it was, that I was in a <hi>legal frame</hi> when I wrote my peice," thus he ſuits his anſwer to the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al taſtes of his hearers.</note> endeavoring
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012739_0093_0F8BEAFE34907B60"/>to make it appear altogether harmleſs and innocent. In conſequence of this, the cry was from all quarters, how I had abuſed him, calling him <hi>ſchool-boy,</hi> &amp;c. and that without any juſt provocation. And at the ſame time his emiſſaries were indefaticable in trumpeting it about to people in town and country, and even in the ſtreets, that my letter was a moſt ſpiteful, malicious, ſcurrilous thing, and Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s a harmleſs, juſt, and handſome letter. Theſe things I had information of from day to day. In the mean time, I only read his and my letter in my own houſe to ſuch as aſked the favor, and never went about publiſhing them at all.<note n="*" place="bottom">How could I otherwiſe account for my withdraw from the ſacrament, but by reading his letter? where is the man that ſhould have received ſuch a letter from his miniſter juſt before the ſacrament but would have abſented? and upon ſuch abſence, would not every one be upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what was the ground or cauſe of it? (as was really the caſe here). And was I not neceſſitated to tell? and muſt I not read the letter to juſtify myſelf? muſt I not ſhow, that I was ineffect laid under <hi>admonition,</hi> as far as his <hi>authority</hi> reached? and ſo an effectual bar laid in the way of my coming? and indeed I was unfit for communion, if his letter was true. And beſides, how could I get witneſſes to clear me of his aſperſions, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the letters to thoſe that were at the church meeting (both of the church and congregation) who heard what I ſaid and read as well as he: and by communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to them, did not the matter become fully, a public affair?</note> "But I gave copies." No; there was no copy taken of his letter till above three weeks after it was ſent, and after he and his friends had managed as above, and the whole town wrung
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012739_0094_0F8BEB0081D45E58"/>of the affair; and that copy was taken without my knowlege, but if I had known it I ſee nothing faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it. The other letters were not copied till long after. I would here obſerve, that if Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had dealt fairly and ingenuouſly about the letters, and had read the whole every where, both in town and country, and, without commenting, had left every one to judge for themſelves about the contents, I ſhould never have had a thought of printing them. But it ſeems it would not anſwer his end, to have either his or my letter read in full; but they muſt be mangled and diſtorted in ſuch manner, as to ſet people in a rage againſt me.</p>
               <p>At length, after ſo much talk about <hi>private letters,</hi> he ſeems finally to give up all, and to grant that they were of a <hi>public nature p.</hi> 61. "What then, ſays he, does this give him a right to publiſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my conſent!" Yes, ſay I, becauſe he and his adherents endeavored "to palm it upon the world," that they were juſt, good and neceſſary, yea, even <hi>meek</hi> letters, and that mine were bad and abuſive to the laſt degree. "But what right had I to publiſh his letters any more than his ſermon without his conſent?" I anſwer, the caſe is vaſtly different; but if they were exactly parrellel, there are many caſes wherein it is neceſſary to publiſh the whole or part of miniſter's ſermons, particularly when they preach falſe doctrine, and perſiſt in it after due admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is an old ſaying <hi>that a miniſter</hi>'s <hi>ſermon</hi> is no longer his own when he hath preached it. His hearers then have a right to take notice of it when, and how they pleaſe, eſpecially if he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012739_0095_0F8BEB0183A84F50"/>any thing that is wrong, and will not confeſs it, after proper means have been uſed to bring him to confeſſion. Upon the whole here, what means all this heat about the letters? either they were <hi>juſt and good,</hi> or they were <hi>bad:</hi> if the former, who ever made ſuch an ado before about having their <hi>good deeds</hi> publiſhed to the world? ought he not rather to thank me for it? if they were <hi>bad,</hi> why did he not confeſs it, and ſo put an end to the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy? I had left the communion (though not the meeting) upon the account of the letters, and was aſperſed for it with the utmoſt diligence, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done it without ſufficient grounds; Mr. <hi>R.</hi> juſtified his conduct in every part, and endeavored to prejudice people againſt me all manner of ways; he even cried out of <hi>perſecution</hi> in the pulpit. What would I then do? what remedy had I left but to publiſh the letters, and let the church and world know how injuriouſly I was treated? I know it will ſignify nothing with thoſe that will not ſo much as read my book; but I truſt the impartial world will weigh things in an even ballance, and that they will acquit me from the heinous charges he brings againſt me as having acted "contrary to <hi>all</hi> the rules of <hi>politeneſs, humanity and chriſtianity;</hi>" and "<hi>below</hi> the character of a <hi>man of benevolence and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</hi>" Yea, muſt he not acquit me himſelf? for if "I had wronged him 30 times more by my letter than he had me (as he has declared over and over) I had expoſed myſelf 30 times more by the publication than I did him. If he <hi>believes himſelf,</hi> believes his own declarations, how can he juſtly fault me for what I have done? at leſt how can he cry out of wrong and injury, when I had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wronging myſelf? is all this concern manifeſted merely out of regard to my reputation? I think it unneceſſary to ſay any more about the publication of the letters, though I could add many other particulars, if it were needful, in my own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I would only further notice, that the deſign of this fearful outcry ſeems to be to divert people's minds from <hi>the merits of the cauſe,</hi> and to turn their attention from the abuſes I have received, that I
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012739_0096_0F913FFFC4E883F8"/>might have none to aid and aſſiſt me in ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; as a ſubtle bird will flutter and cry and run on, in order to draw people further from their neſt.</p>
               <p>Having thus chaſtiſed me for the <hi>publication</hi> of the letters, he next proceeds to conſider the <hi>contents</hi> of them. He firſt tells us, "they contained his real ſentiments, and that he had never ſeen cauſe to alter them." <hi>p.</hi> 61. Pray then what did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs at our meeting? for he would bear the world in hand, that he offered me <hi>all proper ſatisfaction:</hi> but this now appears by his own words to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Alas! what a cheat did he deſign to put upon me by a few doubtful words artfully put together? he then gives his grounds for writing. 1ſt. "That I had delivered things of VERY danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency." Let the reader look into my 3d. Eſſay, and he will ſee that this is without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2d. "That I had groſly miſrepreſented him." How? by ſaying that he "was for obliging perſons to come immediately into full communion." (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 26.) This could not be a <hi>ground</hi> of his writing, becauſe this expreſſion was never read in public, but was afterwards added, when I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Eſſays for the preſs, by way of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But however the thing is true; he is for <hi>obliging</hi> them two ways. 1ſt. By denying them any privilege, if they will not come immediately into full communion. 2d. By intimating frequently, that the church ought to call them to an account, if they do not come.</p>
               <p>He adds as another ground of his writing, "that I had charged him with <hi>ſpeaking ſlightingly of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons." p.</hi> 62. How ſhort is his memory? this paſſage was not contained in any of my Eſſays, but is only to be found in my anſwer to his letter. And how could he tell without a prophetic ſpirit what I would write before-hand? or how could that be a ground of writing his letter, which was not wrote till after I had received his letter? this ſhows in what a careleſs random manner he makes his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. Other inſtances will occur preſently. As for the other things that I charge him with, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012739_0097_0F8BE2045596CF48"/>relations, he plainly owns them to be true. <hi>p.</hi> 63. And as to the phraſe <hi>ſpeaking ſlightingly</hi> &amp;c. the chief I meant by it was, that he ſlighted <hi>the uſe</hi> of them, by holding them unneceſſary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he plainly confeſſes.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of miſrepreſentation he ſays is in <hi>p.</hi> 32. of the Eſſays, wherein I aſſert, "that the new plan ſuppoſes it neceſſary that candidates have a certain knowlege or aſſurance of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtate." My words are, "the new plan ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it neceſſary, that all candidates ſhould have clear evidence, if not aſſurance of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate" As much as to ſay, that if they do not hold <hi>aſſurance,</hi> yet at leſt they hold <hi>clear evidences</hi> to be neceſſary. And is not this the caſe? ſurely he does not hold that <hi>dark evidence</hi> is ſufficient. Again, under the ſame head, I uſe the term <hi>good evidence;</hi> and does he think, that <hi>bad evidence</hi> will do? he then goes further than I. What little ground then had he for that exclamation in his letter; "you, ſir, do <hi>certainly know,</hi> that neither I nor they hold to ſuch things as you there advanced as being our ſentiments?" which is founded upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Eſſays.</p>
               <p>Another miſrepreſentation is, "that he was for driving on with <hi>violence. p.</hi> 63. Let any one read over his letters again, and they will find <hi>violence</hi> enough. In what a jehu-like manner does he drive on? what method does he take to terrify me and others from free-ſpeaking and oppoſing him in public any more? beſides many other proofs, that might be mentioned, but I muſt not write a volume.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon of writing his letter was "the unfair methods I took, working upon people's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions inſtead of reaſon, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 63.— In his letter he repreſents <hi>the whole</hi> of my piece to be of this teno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but now it ſeems it was only two or three ſhort paſſages. The reſt then muſt be addreſſed to "their reaſon and judgment." And why would not he allow me to mix a word or two of the <hi>pathetic</hi> with this? it would be a dry piece indeed, if there was nothing ſaid to move the affections in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012739_0098_0F8BE206949AD760"/>point, no leſs than the unchurching our children. And that it was really an unchurching or <hi>excommunicating</hi> them, I think has been fully proved; ſo that I appealed to men's reaſon and judgment, as well as paſſions in the caſe. I muſt add here, if theſe baptized childred are <hi>lambs</hi> (as he ſeems to grant, <hi>p.</hi> 64.) they ought to be treated as <hi>lambs,</hi> not as <hi>dogs</hi> only to be whiped. <hi>Whipping</hi> is indeed ſometimes neceſſary for <hi>children,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> to be whiped is to treat them worſe than <hi>dogs.</hi> For he ſeems to ſuppoſe, that they are <hi>the ſubjects of diſcipline,</hi> in ſome parts of his book (though I can not find that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aſſerts it) when he laments the want of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the expreſſion <hi>"ſprung from hell"</hi> p. 65. Do not all practices that are "wrong and erroneous" ſpring from hell? And muſt not the brethren ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſay, this practice ſprung from thence, if they voted it out? muſt I then be faulted for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things as they are? or for repreſenting the truth in a ſtrong light? is he afraid of the light?</p>
               <p>The next "unfair method I uſed, was, quoting <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxvi. 5." <hi>p.</hi> 62, 5. Concerning this I think I have ſaid enough in my letter, which he takes not the leaſt notice of, but goes on to repreſent things in the worſt colors. If he will have it after all that I pronounced <hi>curſes</hi> upon him; let me tell him, the curſe ſeems <hi>already</hi> come, upon him in full weight and meaſure, and I hope and pray that he never may feel it in higher degrees: the <hi>curſe</hi> is <hi>ſhame.</hi> And is it not evident from his conduct, that he is <hi>really and greatly aſhamed of his letters,</hi> tho' he be too <hi>haughty</hi> to own it? how comes he elſe to call me "unpolite, inhuman, and unchriſtian" in publiſhing them? and why ſuch a noiſe about it for many months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? I wonder he had not brought a new charge of <hi>curſing</hi> upon my reminding him of that text, <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. 6. in my letter. (See Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 43.) He hath ſuch a knack at commenting, he might have made it appear in as hedious a light as the text under conſideration. As to my pointing at him when I read the text, I have no remembrance of it. <hi>I</hi> have a common motion of one hand when ſpeaking in
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012739_0099_0F8BE20724931150"/>public, which he might take for pointing, as I ſtood facing him. As for addreſſing the <hi>baptized in general,</hi> as he repreſents both in <hi>p.</hi> 62, and 65. it is utterly unfair to give ſuch a repreſentation to the world. I only ſpake to thoſe of <hi>"good converſation:" many</hi> of whom ſtood ready to renew their baptiſmal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he himſelf tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 65. but were prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſhutting the door againſt them. And I thought I ought to give them a word of comfort under the dark cloud that was hanging over them. And as I had then, ſo I have ſtill a ſtrong faith, that this practice will never be wholly baniſhed out of this church, though it may be ſuſpended for a while. Perhaps after I am dead and gone, theſe words may be remembered. The promiſe is ſure. <hi>Iſai.</hi> lvii. 17. 1ſt. <hi>cl.</hi>

               <p>With this text, he couples a ſentence belonging to another head "the plea or pretence is grace." But is not the word pretence or pretenſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed in a good ſenſe? but if it be taken in the worſt ſenſe, is there no grounds for it? no doubt <hi>many</hi> act ſincerely and conſcienciouſly in the affair: but can it be deemed any other than <hi>pretence</hi> in thoſe that take the moſt <hi>ungracious methods</hi> to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the cauſe? filling the whole town and country with lyes and falſe repreſentations: dropping the moſt notorious libels in the ſtreets, or poſting them up in public places; printing a moſt infamous advertiſement, to blaſt the credit of my book and the author? endeavoring to get the book ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or burnt, by carring the moſt barefaced falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods to the printer! and many other ſuch like things? but who hath done this? none I believe doubts but that ſome of the <hi>warmeſt zealots</hi> in the affair had a principal hand in the whole. And what can it be but <hi>pretence</hi> in one of the hotteſt advocates for the new ſcheme, who in former years actually owned the covenant among us, but hath not as yet come to full communion? can a man be <hi>ſincere</hi> in fighting againſt himſelf?</p>
               <p>He concludes about his letter with obſerving, "That <hi>all the while</hi> I was treating of this affair at the church-meeting, I appeared to be in as great
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012739_0100_0F8BE20C533AF940"/>heat and vehemence of temper, as ever he ſaw a man, on any ſuch occaſion in his life. And that this was the obſervation of <hi>multitudes,</hi> as well as his own." <hi>p.</hi> 65. But there was not multitudes there, how then could they obſerve it? I am ſure I never heard of ſuch an obſervation made by the ſpectators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have been informed, that the few <hi>indifferent</hi> ſpectators from other pariſhes, univerſally obſerved after the meeting, that the anger and vehemence was all on the other ſide.</note> And is not this obſervation utterly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the tenor of his letter? we hear nothing there of anger and bad temper, but only of "paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate exclamations and pathetic addreſſes, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affectionateneſs, popular harangues, and appeals to men's paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even ſuch an <hi>artful method</hi> in general, as tended to gain the populace and to fill their minds with prejudices againſt his." But now it ſeems nothing but tempeſt and hurricane, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, heat and anger appeared in me, and that thro' the whole meeting. A ſur method not to captivate and charm the hearers, but to ruin myſelf and cauſe. And with what an ill grace do <hi>angryneſs</hi> and <hi>affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> ſeem to be coupled together?<note n="†" place="bottom">If I was in ſuch a paſſion as he tells of, I think he ought to have reproved me for it in a friendly manner, either by word or writing; this would have afforded ſufficient ground for a <hi>letter of caſtigation:</hi> but not a word of this in his letter, but quite reverſe: which ſhows, that the account he now gives is but <hi>a late invention,</hi> to ſerve a preſent turn.</note> But if I was in ſuch a heat and paſſion muſt there not be ſome <hi>cauſe</hi> for it? and why does he not ſet that down? was it becauſe he overcame me in argument? no; he never pretended to give a <hi>direct</hi> anſwer to any of my arguments. Was it becauſe the church were not willing to hear me? no; many of the church puſhed me forward to ſpeak, and there ſeemed a general diſpoſition to hear me in all the meetings, except the laſt. Was it becauſe the major part of the church appeared diſpoſed to caſt out the practice? no; the contrary appeared in all our meetings; and I much queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012739_0101_0F8BE20D4A2394C0"/>he could get a vote for it even now, when he hath put the generality into a flame. Why then ſhould I manifeſt ſuch heat and anger? for my part, I am not conſcious of <hi>much</hi> anger at that meeting; (nay rather <hi>too little,</hi> conſidering my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.) I am ſure I did not read my piece in an angry tone and accent, (of this he himſelf clears me in his letter: I was ſilent the much greater part of the meeting, being not well: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at with patience to hear him read his <hi>collection</hi> (though I thought it not much to the purpoſe) which laſted about an hour and a quarter or more. And when he <hi>hiſt</hi> or <hi>piſhed</hi> at my Eſſays (which he did ſeveral times and at great length) I manifeſted not the leaſt reſentment. Although it be the <hi>higheſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that can be offered to a man in the literary world, I did not ſo much as let him know I heard him; which ſhows, that I had ſome command of my paſſions. And the only times I ſpake with heat was, when he broke in upon me and interrupted me in reading my piece, endeavoring to hinder my going on, (which he did frequently:) and I think this was a juſt ground of reſentment; eſpecially when I had patiently and without interruption heard his piece, which was more than as long again as mine. At theſe times, I claimed my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege with ſome warmth; and told him, that as a member I had a right to ſpeak, and would ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by this means I at laſt got through, though with much difficulty.</p>
               <p>If he ſhould ſay, he interrupted me, becauſe I would not give others opportunity to ſpeak, and becauſe our ſide monopolized moſt of the talk to themſelves. This could not be the caſe; for none of his ſide of the queſtion ever attempted to ſpeak to the <hi>merits of the cauſe</hi> in any of our meetings, except he himſelf: (ſo that, altho' <hi>"the moſt godly,"</hi> they did not manifeſt any <hi>ſuper-eminence of knowlege.</hi>) we ſhould have been <hi>glad</hi> to have heard them, if they had had any thing to ſay, and would readily have given way: but they ſeemed all to depend upon him, and implicitly to receive what he ſaid for truth. And as for himſelf, he argued as much and as long as he pleaſed, without interruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:012739_0102_0F8BE20DC6C857E8"/>
In ſomething the like ſort, (though not ſo groſly) he treated deacon <hi>F.</hi> The deacon in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings had ſaid but little; but was now determined to ſpeak his whole mind, and argue the point at ſome length. He began—but had ſcarce uttered a ſentence or two, before Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (who ſtood facing him) attempting to anſwer, and ſo kept doing as faſt as the deacon uttered any thing new, (though he begged not to be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that after a few minutes he was forced to deſiſt. And hath had no opportunity of declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his full ſentiments to the church to this day. Of this the deacon much complained the evening after. And another of the deacons he endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtop in the ſame manner while ſpeaking; but when that would not do, he (with a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory tone and with a ſlap of his hand on the ſeat) bad him <hi>ſit down;</hi> which the deacon readily obeyed.</p>
               <p>But was there no paſſion on Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s ſide at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? we hear not a word of that. Though as ſoon as I had mentioned that text in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he appeared all in a flame:<note n="*" place="bottom">His repeated <hi>hiſſing</hi> or <hi>piſhing</hi> was previous to this, when he appeared otherwiſe to be in a <hi>perfect calm,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while my 2d. Eſſay was in reading, which was done by one of the deacons at the beginning of the meeting, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much indiſpoſed to read both Eſſays. But the 3d. Eſſay I delivered myſelf, towards the cloſe of the meeting, when he was too angry to <hi>hiſs.</hi> I would here mention a <hi>curious anecdote</hi> about this <hi>hiſſing:</hi> when my book firſt came out, he ſaid, <hi>"that was a lye, for he did not hiſs, but only piſhed;"</hi> as if <hi>piſhing</hi> was not a ſpecies of <hi>hiſſing.</hi> But if my cars deceived me not, there was <hi>hiſſing</hi> in more ſenſes than one. This <hi>lye</hi> he hath not ſeen meet to record in his book, but ſeems to have reſerved it for the private uſe of his own auditors; It was they alone, that were to be entertained with this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and notable diſtinction.</note> and it continued all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the meeting; and the reader will eaſily ſee, that he had not got over it, 4 days after, when he wrote his lettter; yea, it is evident by his book,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012739_0103_0F8BE20E84A56460"/>that he hath not got over it to this day, although I made him ſomething of a confeſſion in my letter. (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 39.) But how did his paſſion manifeſt itſelf at the meeting? why he appeared to be in the greateſt agitation; ſometimes ſitting down, then ſuddenly ſtarting up, then ſitting and riſing again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> talking to himſelf, blurting out ſhort ſentences to thoſe that ſtood near him, ſhaking his head, ſcowling, (not to ſay <hi>grinning</hi>) ſtamping, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interrupting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, he appeared to be in as great a tempeſt of paſſion, as ever I ſaw a man in my life, (and ſo but an ill judge of other's paſſions). And his whole deportment during the two laſt meetings was unbecoming a <hi>moderator,</hi> (not to ſay more:) inſomuch that I have frequently ſaid, that if the <hi>moderator</hi> of a town-meeting, or the <hi>ſpeaker</hi> of the general aſſembly ſhould behave in ſuch manner, they would be in danger of being thrown off the bench with violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſuch reaſons as theſe, the deacons aſked the advice of an ordination council at <hi>Middleborough</hi> a few weeks after, whether it were not proper for the church to have <hi>another moderator</hi> (viz. a neighboring miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) at the next meeting. They did not indeed give a <hi>particular detail</hi> of their <hi>reaſons,</hi> out of <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> but only in general, that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> being one party and the church the other, whether it would not be adviſable upon this ground? But Mr. <hi>R.</hi> who was preſent, would not hear a word of it, though, as I am informed, the miniſters <hi>adviſed</hi> to it; which advice Mr. <hi>R.</hi> wholly denied <hi>in the face of the church,</hi> when reminded of it at the next meeting.</p>
               <p>I now come to his animadverſions on my letter. And here upon entrance I muſt note, that he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omits one thing with which he inflamed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people as much as any thing; my calling him <hi>"ſchool-boy."</hi> (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 41.) This was long in every one's mouth, but it ſeems it would not bear publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Another thing omitted is, "the glaring inconſiſtencies in my letter, which he forebore pointing out, leaſt it ſhould put me to pain." (See his 2d. letter. <hi>p.</hi> 49.) We hear not a word of this in his book. Perhaps he ſtill forebore, out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012739_0104_0F8BE20F46B03050"/>to me, leaſt he ſhould "give me ſome pain and uneaſineſs." He likewiſe omits remarking about "his provoking letters to the precinct committee." This was too tender a ſtring to touch upon. I believe they would have proved fatal to him, if they had been brought into public; but we of the committee endeavored to ſtifle them: ſo far were <hi>we</hi> from ſeeking his hurt; though we were cenſured by many for it.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he animadverts upon is, that it is intimated in the Eſſays, "he had turned away or <hi>refuſed</hi> ſome who had offered to own the covenant." <hi>p.</hi> 65. It is amazing to me, that ſuch ſtreſs is laid upon this. The queſtion I believe has been put ſcores of times, both in church-meeting and out, by himſelf and others, <hi>"who was ever denied?"</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al added, that it is time enough to complain, and to have church-meetings, when inſtances of refuſal appear, and individuals enter complaint of being debared. But is not a <hi>general denial</hi> equivalent to a thouſand particular ones? has he not denied them in his ſermons, in all his diſcourſes public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, for above two years paſt, yea, and in his book, <hi>p.</hi> 2. "I thought it my duty (ſays he there) to deſiſt the practice?" And yet he ſtill dins us with this queſtion, <hi>who was ever denied?</hi> it makes me perfectly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ick to hear ſo much of it. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 65. "<hi>many</hi> have frequently diſcourſed with him on the affair, and wiſhed that it might be peaceably ſettled, that they might bring their children." <hi>i. e.</hi> They wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would take off the bar he had laid in their way, and allow them to come. And is not this all the <hi>application,</hi> that perſons can well make under the preſent ſituation of things? but the <hi>particular perſon</hi> he refers to, went much further than this; he diſcourſed with him no leſs than 3 times on the affair, with direct deſign to have been admitted, if he would have ſuffered it; nay, he went ſo far as to tell him, that if he could not have his children baptized, he would apply to Mr. <hi>T—n,</hi> the church miniſter, though he did not indeed in terms aſk him to propound him the next ſabbath. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> would no doubt have been affronted if he had gone
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012739_0105_0F8BE1FF9155BA98"/>ſo far as this, after he had ſo fully declared his principles.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, "that I give a wrong turn to that expreſſion of his, <hi>the moſt godly</hi> among us, both men and women, are on his ſide." <hi>p.</hi> 65. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is ſo plain in itſelf, that it is incapable of a <hi>wrong turn,</hi> though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e endeavors to give it, but in vain.</p>
               <p>He then faults me "for expreſſing <hi>my fears,</hi> that he converſes too little with his flock to paſs a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are the moſt godly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" <hi>p.</hi> 66 For my part I never heard of any <hi>paſtoral viſits,</hi> except to the <hi>ſick</hi> or <hi>bereaved.</hi> But I have frequently heard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that he viſited but little, except a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. How then could he know much who "lived neareſt to God, or who enjoyed moſt of the life, power and ſweetneſs of experimental religion?" He hath indeed viſited greatly, and almoſt univerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for about fifteen months paſt. But I am apt to think that the diſcourſe hath been generally taken up with <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> beſides experiences. And I ſuppoſe the real foundation he goes upon in aſſerting, that he hath the moſt godly on his ſide, is this, the brethren with him, ſeveral of them, were received by himſelf, and ſo he had particular occaſion and opportunity to diſcourſe with them about their acquaintance with experimental religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as to the members received in Mr. <hi>Leonard's</hi> days, I believe he ſcarce knows any thing about them, except ſuch as have particularly applied to him under diſtreſs of conſcience. "I utter this with chriſtian temper," and as my real perſuaſion: perhaps he would not believe me if I added, "that I <hi>felt good natured</hi>" too, and heartily pitied him that he was <hi>left</hi> to give ſuch wrong accounts to the world.</p>
               <p>"As for his being more a <hi>favorite</hi> with the women than I am," <hi>p.</hi> 66. He himſelf acknowleges, that he could ſee nothing amiſs in the expreſſion. But ſome elbow friend hath ſuggeſted, that I had <hi>a bad deſign</hi> in it. And he ſeems ready upon it to "demand an <hi>explanation.</hi>" All the explanation I ſhall give him is, that it is <hi>his voice</hi> and nothing elſe <hi>(nihil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea)</hi> that has produced this effect. It is ſurpriſing that he ſhould take ſuch notice of this paſſage as he here does, or indeed any notice of it at all. But
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012739_0106_0F8BE21004993730"/>what opportunity does he miſs to bring an "odium" upon me among his more thoughtleſs hearers? can not one man be more favored than another, even by <hi>women,</hi> without "ſome reflection on his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter?" it would then be a dangerous thing to be a <hi>popular preacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 66. He apears "greatly ſurprized at that group of extravagant expreſſions, thundering anathema, authoritatively denounced for advancing ſuch <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, ſoul-damning deſtructive</hi> doctrines." But why this ſurprize? I appeal to the whole <hi>learned</hi> world, whether I don't give a juſt and natural paraphraſe upon the paſſages of his letters. What more or worſe could he have ſaid to <hi>Arius, Socinus, Pelagius</hi> or <hi>Arminius,</hi> if they were now living? The preamble is awful, the ſentence ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere, the grounds of it moſt ſtriking and terrible: no leſs than "the <hi>ſubverſion</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> of the <hi>grand doctrines</hi> of the goſpel. This is the <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> tendency of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The things I advanced of dangerous tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the ſouls of this people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" So that he is "<hi>conſcience-bound</hi> not to encourage my inſtructions," but to keep me out of the pulpit.<note n="*" place="bottom">He could not mean, that he would not let me read my Eſſays in the pulpit, or any thing of the like tenor, as he ſeems to intimate. This I believe no body ever thought of: but he certainly means <hi>my inſtructions</hi> in general, let them be over ſo ſounds <hi>i. e.</hi> my ever preaching for him any more. And what is this but <hi>"a thundering ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema?"</hi> an excommunication from <hi>miniſterial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with a witneſs? I appeal to every miniſter in the land, whether the term was too harſh. And this <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> he hath never yet offered to take off: ſo that if I had conſented to his propoſals of accommodation at our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt have laid under the weight of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>accurſed ſtill,</hi> though other preachers of the ſame principles are freely admitted.</note> And "ſhould be guilty of the GREATEST unfaithfulneſs to God and his people, if he did not oppoſe me with all his might, or to the UTMOST of his power." (See Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays. <hi>p.</hi> 36, 48.) How then could I expreſs theſe things in too ſtrong a light? "This is <hi>all,</hi>" ſays Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and a great ALL it appears to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:012739_0107_0F8BE210C858FE50"/>
As to "the <hi>brethren's</hi> being involved in the ſame doom," it is as evident as the light, that all that hold the ſame principles as I do (whether mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or brethren) are as guilty as I am, and muſt neceſſarily ſtand or fall with me.</p>
               <p>As for the expreſſion, "eſpecially thoſe of note." <hi>p.</hi> 66. I had grounds for putting it in, but I muſt not particularly explain myſelf. The reaſon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to a thoughtful reader</p>
               <p>He next attacks my <hi>poſt-ſcript,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 67) which he calls "a moſt peculiar one of it's kind. I miſquote him, ſays he, and pervert his meaning in almoſt every paſſage." Let the reader compare the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with his letters, and they will find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I do not indeed exactly quote his words, (that would have made my letter too long) but I endeavored to collect his <hi>evident meaning</hi> into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, uſing chiefly his own expreſſions. "But he will not own the letter in this dreſs." Why then does he not give it another dreſs, and tell us his meaning? why did he not paraphraſe his letter particularly, and ſhow that the paſſages import ſomething elſe? and not think to come off by ſaying in general, "he did not mean ſo?" How eaſy is it to get rid of the blackeſt charges, if this be ſufficient?<note n="*" place="bottom">That Mr. <hi>R.</hi> intended to carry matters as far as I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, appears from a paſſage that I have never yet parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly noticed, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe words of his letter "it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me when you come calmly to reflect upon it, it muſt excite penitential ſhame, and be matter of DEEP humiliation before God." (Eſſays. p. <hi>34.</hi>) If ſo, it muſt be a DEEP crime that I was guilty off! a crime of a moſt aggravated nature, (of a ſcarlet color and crimſon dye:) for there muſt be a <hi>proportion</hi> between the crime and penitence. <hi>Deep contrition</hi> pre-ſuppoſes <hi>deep guilt.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but what was the effect of my "dreſſing up his letter in a garb of my own manufacture?" How did it's "ugly hue" or appearence operate upon me? why it ſeems it ſets me <hi>"a raving." p.</hi> 61. "It puts me out of all patience, ſo that unable to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012739_0108_0F8BE211CABFD4C0"/>contain, I cry out, <hi>thundering anathema, ſoul-damning doctrines,</hi> &amp;c." There is not ſuch a word in all my poſt-ſcript. They were contained in the body of the letter, and relate to another matter. "But what was the occaſion of all this vehemence? why, becauſe he had ſaid, "my doctrines were of an <hi>arminian</hi> tendency, and that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage my inſtructions." <hi>p.</hi> 68. I think ſuch a repreſentation is "enough to put one out of all patience." I was not ſpeaking of <hi>doctrines</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, but of his charge of <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>crafty management,</hi> which he that runs may read, in the firſt part of his letter. And my account of this I think is juſt. (See Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 45, 6.) And what will the reader think of a man, that will thus in open light endeavor to impoſe upon him, when he may be ſo eaſily convicted? and what ſtreſs can be laid upon his repreſentations in other matters? certainly he takes his readers to be as careleſs and inadvertent as himſelf. He here indeed deſigned to be <hi>witty,</hi> but his <hi>wit</hi> comes at the expence of <hi>truth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 67. He ſays, "I charge him with <hi>breaking open</hi> a letter." How careleſsly does he write? I charge him with no ſuch thing. I ſuppoſed at the time, that the letter came to him incloſed and unſealed. But what I taxed him with, was, <hi>eraſing part of a letter.</hi> This he acknowleges, but endeavors to excuſe it. But this I obſerve, that nothing appears, even from his own account, that his <hi>father</hi> commiſſioned him <hi>to expunge any paſſage of the letter;</hi> but only left it to him, either to ſend or not to ſend it, as he thought beſt. He hath told what the eraſed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages were, and I believe told me right. And I cannot help obſerving upon it, his haughty mind could not brook any thing, that looked like <hi>intreaty.</hi> He ſcorned to have thought, that either he or his friends had any apprehenſion of it's being in <hi>my power</hi> to do him the leaſt hurt. I would add, that it was theſe very eraſures, that made me miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his father's intent.</p>
               <p>He appears next to be mightily offended at the intimation, "that he had been obliged to <hi>retract</hi>

By being obliged, I meant obliged in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and from conviction. And that he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I had reaſon to think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had none of theſe doctrines in his firſt years, but immediately after the publication of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s books. The doctrines were ſuch as theſe, "that men are regenerated <hi>without</hi> the word of truth; that they love God, love his law, and repent of ſin, <hi>before</hi> they have any true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or diſcovery of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the mediator, or of God in Chriſt as reconcilable to ſinners; before union to Chriſt, faith in the atonement and juſtification in the ſight of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" Theſe and the like doctrines were preached for years, and inculcated with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, which cauſed almoſt <hi>a general uneaſineſs:</hi> inſomuch that ſome have told me, "they wondered how I could ſit with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hear him, and not immediately riſe up and oppoſe him." But a reverend and worthy gentleman coming from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> on a viſit, he preached a ſabbath in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s doctrines. With which Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was gratified; and he told me himſelf the ſame week, "that Mr. <hi>H—t's</hi> ſermon and diſcourſe after meeting, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a new train of ideas, and things appeared to him in quite a different light from what they did before." And ſince that, his preaching has been generally in quite another ſtrain and tenor; and people I believe have univerſally thought, that he was come off from his former notions. But now it ſeems, "he hath never retracted or ſeen cauſe to retract any ſentiments in divinity, which he formerly held, but ſtill thinks them agreable to the word of God." Hear this, O people and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſtill holds the ſame principles (he tells you ſo himſelf) which in former years filled you with grief and uneaſineſs, and cauſed many tears. And may you not expect they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived upon you in full weight and meaſure, as ſoon as the times will bear it? we had a ſpecimen of it ſome little time after he received my letter; which I took to be occaſioned by this very paſſage
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012739_0110_0F8BE218CAE84450"/>of the letter, to let me know that he ſtill held Meſſieurs <hi>B</hi>'s and <hi>H—n</hi>'s doctrines as much as ever. He preached from <hi>Luke</hi> xv. 24. and advanced, that the begetting ſpiritual life or regeneration was an immediate act of the ſpirit <hi>without the word.</hi> And that faith, repentance, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the <hi>fruits</hi> and effects of regeneration, and no eſſential parts of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, "that he had omitted many heads of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his preaching," I am really ſorry for his ſake that I ſat it down.

                  </gap> it is too true. He confines himſelf chiefly to <hi>affectionate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and neglects explaining doctrines, and the nature of ordinances too much. (Which I have heard obſerved and lamented by others as well as myſelf.<note n="*⁎*" place="bottom">Behold the man, that cries out of the publiſhing private letters!</note>) So that I fear <hi>ignorance</hi> will greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012739_0112_0F8BEA4ADE634818"/>in the next generation: and indeed ſome have occaſionally obſerved to me, that it does ſo too much already; more than ever was known before in this town: (one proof of it is <hi>their readineſs,</hi> yea, <hi>even fondneſs to be unchurched or excommunicated,</hi> upon Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s bare word, without exhibiting any valid evidence; as ſure there was none before his book came out, whatever there is now.) On this head of <hi>preaching</hi> I could ſay much more, but my heart recoils at the thought. I would gladly have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this and ſeveral other paragraphs in <hi>printing</hi> the letters out of regard to him; but I knew what a fearful outcry (worſe than "cants") would have been raiſed, that I had <hi>altered</hi> the letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that I ſat down every <hi>iota.</hi> I ſhould have freely told him my thoughts upon this and ſeveral other heads "in a friendly manner," if he had given op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by frequent viſits and an unreſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy; but it ſeems he thought it beſt to keep at a diſtance (except in his diſtreſſing hours.) And if I had gone to his houſe to have talked of ſuch things, ſuch is his temper, that he would have been apt to have conſtrued it <hi>inſult,</hi> and I might have expected to have heard it proclaimed (as he is little capable of keeping ſecrets, to my diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I have had experience of ſomething of this kind, and ſo have others. Upon the whole here, if inſtead of taking offence, and turning it into a jeſt, he had reformed and enlarged his plan of preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would have been much better. But I am informed, he ſtill goes on in the old track, chiefly, if not wholly, confining himſelf to <hi>affectionate ſubjects</hi> and herein even abounding more and more, which ſeems calculated to retain the affections of his hearers. And further to captivate, he preaches of late much <hi>without notes,</hi> by reaſon of which much <hi>crude matter</hi> (I hear) is poured forth as well as repetitions, the ſame thing recurring over and over.</p>
               <p>Having done with the letters, he comes to what he calls "my catalogue of charges." <hi>p.</hi> 69. The reader will obſerve, that they are <hi>bare facts,</hi> ſet down without the leaſt comment. How far is this
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012739_0113_0F8BEA4B80F719D0"/>from his treatment of me? ill-natured comments, and the worſt conſtructions occurring every where. Theſe charges were, it ſeems "a potion as bitter" as aloes. Yet have they not had "ſalutary effects?" Have they not in a great meaſure prevented irretat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things being brought into the pulpit, which were ſo frequent before? but being pent up there, he gives himſelf the more vent in his book, and in his abundant viſits. But how does he clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from theſe charges? ſome are not mentioned, therefore ſtand confeſſed, as that of <hi>hiſſing,</hi> &amp;c. "Pointed pſalms" he denies; and ſays, "the <hi>pſalms</hi> were ſung in courſe." But did he ſing the 12th pſalm in courſe? this was ſung the ſabbath before the laſt church-meeting; and it would have come in courſe in about 3 weeks or a month: but it ſeems he ſkipt over 4 or 5 pſalms to come at it: and then returned back. When this <hi>pſalm</hi> was read, thoſe that were in the <hi>ſecret</hi> of that meeting were variouſly affected, ſeveral were upon the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one man was obſerved to bow down his head, and thruſt his handkerchief in his mouth, that he might not be ſeen to laugh. This was in the forenoon. In the afternoon, the <hi>pſalms</hi> are not ſung in courſe; ſo that he is at liberty to ſuit all occaſions. And whether he had not theſe debates ſometimes in mind, the reader may judge by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſtanza, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xviii. 17. when he came to it in courſe, wherein are theſe words, <hi>"the weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that I could make." (Tate</hi> and <hi>Brady.</hi>) Which might be paſſed leaſt <hi>profane wits</hi> ſhould <hi>burleſque</hi> and <hi>ſcoff.</hi> Sometimes ſome of his ſtrong adherents have obſerved after meeting, that he ſuited the <hi>pſalm</hi> to the times, or "that there was a <hi>pſalm</hi> for us."</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>ſermon of triumph,</hi> he tells us, "It was made above a month before the church-meeting, and therefore he could not poſſibly know, or even <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> what would then be done." I never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor I believe any one elſe of his making a ſtock of ſermons before-hand. How comes he then ſo often to preach old ſermons? But to let that paſs. How various have been the reports about this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012739_0114_0F8BE2034589B598"/>Sometimes it was ſaid, that it was made a fortnight, ſometimes 3 weeks before the meeting, ſometimes that he had only begun it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But be that as it will, how can he ſay "that he did not <hi>even ſuſpect</hi> what would be done at that meeting, when it was determined in the <hi>conclave</hi> what ſhould be done? for one of his <hi>privy council</hi> told about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, near <hi>two months</hi> before the meeting, "that they deſigned to have no more debates on the affair, but that the meeting ſhould be diſſolved." And an agent or agents were accordingly ſecretly ſent about to get the major part of the members to ſign for a diſſolution; ſo that the ſermon might be made in proſpect of ſuch an event; which I doubt not they deemed as certain. Here I would obſerve, that he preached 4 ſermons from that text <hi>Iſai.</hi> liv. 17. So that it was not a ſingle ſermon we controvert about. The firſt ſabbath he carried the matter ſo far, that he ſeemed to make us all open enemies and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the church, ſeeking it's deſtruction by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting falſe profeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this making a great noiſe, and producing ſevere reflections, even from ſome of his own ſide, he found, no doubt, that he had carried the matter too far; ſo that when the text came next under conſideration, a fortnight after, he ſeemed to make a ſort of retraction, re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the firſt head (which to appearance he had finiſhed) and ſhewed how even <hi>good men</hi> might, thro' <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>miſtake,</hi> do that which was prejudicial to the church's welfare, and were ſo far enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we may add, that the firſt ſabbath he preached from the text, the congregation ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all alive, and ſuch whiſperings there was after the concluſion of the ſervices, as I ſcarce ever ſaw before; or ſuch diſcourſings on both ſides, after people had got out of the meeting-houſe; ſome ſaying, "they hoped deacon <hi>F.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> &amp;c. had got their belly full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" And will he after all bear the world in hand, that he had "no deſign" in thoſe ſermons, "and that the thing was too low and ridiculous to mention, being founded on nothing but ſurmize and jealouſy," and that "he always ſtudiouſly avoided every thing that might be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012739_0115_0F8BEA4C81F841D8"/>upon as pointed, or tending to irritate?" Upon the whole, whether theſe ſermons were "ſermons of triumph" or not, whether they had a retroſpect, and looked backward or forward, or whether they are rightfully or wrongfully named in the Eſſays, theſe things are not material. It is certain the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the times gave birth to them, they were <hi>deſignedly</hi> and <hi>evidently pointed,</hi> and of this we complain.</p>
               <p>As for the phraſe "my friends and my enemies," the town can better judge of the truth of it than thoſe that live at a diſtance (except the miniſters of his acquaintance) and to them I leave it.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>cruelleſt</hi> part of his whole reply, it is filled with untrue ſuggeſtions and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, calculated to repreſent me as one of the worſt of men, having a heart fraught with malice and revenge, and bearing old grudges from year to year, and wanting nothing but an opportunity to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and vent itſelf, and all without the leaſt grounds, and even in ſuch degree as he could not have thought poſſible before. <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71. "But pray let us get away from the noiſe of a torrent, and calmly enquire what it is that occaſioned all this vehemence." Why, it ſeems chiefly founded upon a <hi>letter</hi> I ſent him many years ago. But this he will not publiſh, being of a <hi>private nature,</hi> leaſt he ſhould follow my <hi>bad example.</hi> But did he not publiſh it in the time of it all over the pariſh, and even carry it to the aſſociation? and does he not <hi>worſe</hi> than publiſh it now, giving hints that it contains ſomething very bad, even ſo bad that it would not bear the light? and all this he hath done, without ever anſwering the letter, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing one word with me about it from the time it was wrote to this day. I have had frequent intimations coming directly from him, that he deſigned to publiſh this letter at full length in his reply, but it ſeems ſome friend hath diſſuaded him from it, leſt it ſhould expoſe him after his great outcry of publiſhing private letters. But he hath taken a method ten-fold more injurious. But what dreadful things were contained in that letter? the caſe was this; he hath diſcovered a diſpoſition for

                  <hi>novelty,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary management</hi> ever ſince he came to the town: the inſtances are numerous; among other things he propounded <hi>a baptized perſon</hi> for full communion, that lay ſick of a deep conſumption, and was never like to go abroad again: this he did in the uſual form, but <hi>without bringing a relation,</hi> or the leaſt intimation that he deſigned to bring one; and propoſed, that after the uſual term of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding was up, a number of the church ſhould go with him to the houſe and actually receive her. I was diſſatisfied with <hi>the thing itſelf,</hi> and <hi>the manner</hi> of his uſhering it in; having heard more than once before, that he was grown weary of relations, and wanted them laid aſide; and I really thought he took this opportunity of feeling the pulſe of the church, how they ſtood affected to relations; and if they bore this well, we ſhould hear no more of them, but he would lay them aſide by his <hi>own authority.</hi> Upon this I wrote as follows.</p>

Even my very acts of kindneſs turn to my reproach: theſe it ſeems all come from a cankered invenomed heart. Alas! this is the effect of doing kindneſſes for the UNGRATEFUL! "How diſcouraging to be always expoſed to ſuch CANTS!"</note> And I
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012739_0118_0F8BEA5277756EF8"/>might well ſay, "we hold a <hi>good correſpondence</hi>" (which expreſſion he mentions with a ſneer and "with inverted <hi>commas.</hi>") I am ſure it was ſo <hi>on my part.</hi> And if any <hi>"root of prejudice"</hi> remained, it muſt be on his ſide: and it appears too plainly that there was, by his raking up this letter at this day: and by the great uſe he hath made of it, in the preſent controverſy. For it was repreſented all over the town after the late letters paſſed, that it was I that wrote the <hi>firſt letter</hi> and was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of the ſtrife, and people were in a rage at me for it; and it was ſometime before we could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them about it. And the like report was carried to other towns. When the news reached me of my writing firſt, I could not imagine what it meant or whence it ſprang; and it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before I could recollect that I had ever wrote him any offenſive letter at all; ſo far was I from retaining it in my mind, or bearing him any old grudge or prejudice upon the account, or indeed on any other account. How ungrounded, and very injurious then is his repreſentation of things? but he ſeems reſolved to <hi>ruin</hi> me if poſſible, or to drive me to deſperation. To this end he and his 2 emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have made it their buſineſs for a 12 month paſt to repreſent me every where, "as an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, malicious, ſpiteful, revengeful man: one who, if once offended, will never forgive or be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" This is their conſtant theme in the houſe and <hi>by the way,</hi> where they think it will make impreſſion. This they utter in diſcourſe. This they write, and this they print. But God knows, and my own conſcience knows, and the people lately my charge do univerſally know, that this is not my diſpoſition, or turn of mind. I know I am naturally <hi>haſty</hi> and <hi>paſſionate:</hi> but rooted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and malice, and implacability are the remoteſt things poſſible from my natural temper. I dare appeal to his own father (a former intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance) for the truth of this; who I believe if he <hi>really knew</hi> how his ſon managed, would be far from countenancing him: the <hi>grieving</hi> of whom
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012739_0119_0F8BEA530883A060"/>is what goes as near to me as almoſt any thing in the preſent controverſy.</p>
               <p>But why then am I not reconciled to Mr. <hi>R?</hi> has he not ſaid and done enough to ſatisfy any reaſonable man? but do not I remain inflexible? obſtinately ſtanding out againſt the advice of <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> who all with one voice cry out, that the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> he offers is ſufficient? thus he hath repreſented the matter to the world: how <hi>truly</hi> will preſently appear. Reconciliation was what I had at heart, and truly ſought, and was the <hi>firſt mover</hi> in it. At my requeſt, deacon <hi>T.</hi> propoſed a meeting to him with ſome brethren, he ſeemed not much inclined to it, and the deacon was forced to go backward and forward ſeveral times before the matter was fully ſettled: at length he complies upon theſe terms, "that there ſhould be an equal number of the brethren on both ſides, that the brethren ſhould <hi>ſay nothing,</hi> but that all the talk ſhould be between him and me,<note n="*" place="bottom">The chief reaſon of this reſtriction I ſuppoſe to be, becauſe he thought by his voluble tongue, and great flow of words to obtain an advantage againſt me, and ſo to drown and confuſe me, if left alone: and that he took the advantage, appears from the <hi>narrative</hi> of the whole conference drawn up by a brother preſent. <q>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſays he, often deſired time to ſpeak, told Mr. <hi>R.</hi> you break in upon me when I attempt to ſpeak, and confuſe me; but it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied no great matter, it appeared to me he did it on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q> I ſhould be glad to inſert the whole narrative, by which it would appear how unchriſtianly I was uſed; but it would lengthen out the book too much. If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſhould ſay, that he had another reaſon for this reſtriction, namely. "becauſe I inſiſted upon a particular brother's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, who he did not want ſhould ſpeak." This no way militates with the reaſon I give, becauſe that brother was the moſt capable of helping and aſſiſting me, if there had been occaſion; and perhaps he thought he could do well enough with the reſt, if he was abſent. If he ſhould ſay, "it was not upon this account that he was for debarring that brother, but becauſe of his unplacable turn of mind, and that his preſence would rather hinder than promote a reconciliation." Such a ſuggeſtion would be <hi>unchriſtian</hi> to the laſt degree; and contrary to truth; <hi>none being more tender and helpful on ſuch occaſions</hi> (in which he had been much uſed) tho' I do not think he would have ſuffered me to have been <hi>trampled on.</hi> And beſides, if Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was <hi>perſonally offended</hi> with him, there was more reaſon for his being preſent, that the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation might have been complete. I could not conſent, that ſuch a <hi>ſlight</hi> ſhould be put upon one of the principle members of the church; and then I wanted him as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſome <hi>particulars,</hi> in caſe I could have brought Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to have talked of them. And ſurely it did not ſhow much of a <hi>diſpoſition for peace</hi> in Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to caſt ſuch contempt on a fellow-member, and a fellow ſufferer with me, eſpecially when I did not <hi>object</hi> againſt any brother of his chooſing, though I had much more reaſon for it.</note> and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012739_0120_0F8BEA53B483D900"/>that there ſhould be no diſcourſe upon <hi>any particular</hi> on either ſide, but that we ſhould make up in a general way." I thought the terms hard; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not meet, I complied; hoping to convince him of the unreaſonableneſs of the preliminaries, and to bring him to allow the brethren to ſpeak and mediate,<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of the brethren that went with me have declared ſince, that if they had known of the terms before-hand, they would not have gone.</note> and to a free diſcuſſion of particulars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no good end could be anſwered by the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Well, we met, I carried; brethren with me, and found that he had invited 4, contrary to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I objected not, but preſently proceeded to the buſineſs of the meeting. Having lamented the difference, and expreſſed my hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of its being peaceably healed, I endeavored to draw him into a diſcourſe of ſome particulars, telling him <hi>that deceit lay in generals,</hi> and that it was neceſſary to diſcourſe on ſome things more particularly, or an amicable agreement could not be expected. But he utterly refuſed, and inſiſted on a general making up, and then declared the terms he would conſent to, and nothing elſe; namely, "that as many things had been ſaid on both ſides that had better have never been ſaid, he was willing to make mutual conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012739_0121_0F8BEA5600AC4590"/>to each other, and to bury the hatchet, and that we ſhould both forget and forgive all that was paſt, and for the future live together in love." He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the terms rather more largely in his book, but I am ſatisfied this account comes nearer the truth; and ſo ſay the brethren that were with me; the words being exactly cited from the narrative mentioned in the margin. I expreſſed my diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with this, and told him I did not think this a proper way of healing the breach. Upon which he replied very quick, and with a great deal of warmth, "you think I have injured you, I think you have injured me 30 times more by your letter, and I think it a peice of condeſcention in me, to go ſo far as I have offered." Which expreſſions were repeated in the courſe of the converſation. I think, more than once. After this I did, with difficulty, force him to diſcourſe a little on 3 or 4 particulars. One was about "the <hi>moſt</hi> godly, being on his ſide." This I thought hard and uncharitable. He <hi>denied</hi> the charge, and inſiſted that he allowed thoſe on our ſide to be <hi>equally</hi> godly, and referred to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript for proof. I told him he ſpake of the one in the <hi>poſitive,</hi> and the other in the <hi>ſuperlative</hi> degree, which was an evident preferrence. But ſtill he kept <hi>denying,</hi> and ſo I left it, and let him have the laſt word. Another particular was about <hi>arminianiſm:</hi> he told me he did not call me an <hi>arminian,</hi> but only taxed me with doctrines tending to <hi>arminianiſm.</hi> I anſwered, I cared not for the name: whether he charged me with <hi>arminianiſm</hi> or not, he certainly charged me with <hi>dangerous and deſtructive doctrines, ſuch as rendred me unfit to preach,</hi> and read part of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove it. This he anſwered with a ſhrug.—Another thing diſcourſed of was, about his aſſerting before the council at <hi>Middleborough,</hi> when he found he could not ſupport the charges in his letter from any thing contained in my 3d Eſſay, which was read there, "that his letter was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more on what I <hi>ſaid</hi> at the church-meeting than on <hi>what I read,</hi> and that I ſaid a great deal, turning myſelf round, and ſwinging my hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" And that he ſtood to it (before the miniſters) in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012739_0122_0F8BEA56E58EE9F8"/>to the declaration of three of the brethren, then preſent, when in reality I had <hi>ſaid nothing</hi> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole meeting, relative to the point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. His anſwer to this was a mere <hi>evaſion,</hi> namely, "that he did not know but that while I was reading, I might put in ſomething here and there memoriter:" though he did not pretend to recollect any thing omitted in the manuſcript. This falſity then, was by no means cleared up. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing I mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d was, his reporting about, that I never preached for him <hi>without pay.</hi> He deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had ever ſo reported, and owned that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was groundleſs, I having preached ſeveral times without, to his knowlege. During this diſcourſe, he would frequently call me to order, and to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the preliminaries, and finally refuſed to go any further into particulars. And as to <hi>generals,</hi> he never ſo much as offered to acknowlege that his letters were <hi>haſty</hi> and <hi>ſevere,</hi> or <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>unguarded,</hi> or expreſſed any <hi>ſorrow</hi> or <hi>concern</hi> for the writing of them. If he had gone ſo far as that, I would have acquieſced, rather than have continued in a broil. Nay, he was ſo far from it, that in 3 hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, he did not ſo much as hint that he tho't himſelf <hi>wrong in the letters,</hi> either for <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> either in <hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular,</hi> either in <hi>part</hi> or in <hi>whole:</hi> but appeared to juſtify the letters, and every thing relating to them, from beginning to end, as he does now in his book.<note n="*" place="bottom">The brother in his narrative ſays, <q>I do not believe one of the brethren will ſay, they heard him ſpeak one word in the whole of their confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The account he has given of the affair is full of groſs errors, tending to miſlead the reader greatly. 1ſt. He ſays, "a number of the brethren met at his houſe, in order to confer, and endeavor to heal the breach." <hi>p.</hi> 71. The brethren did not meet to <hi>confer</hi> and <hi>uſe endeavors,</hi> but to ſet as <hi>mum-chances</hi> to hear us jaw, and contradict. If a free conference had been allowed, it is likely ſomething might have been brought to paſs. But this was ſtrictly forbid, though two of the brethren on his ſide ſpoke ſeveral times, without controul, either from him or me; but when one that went with me once attempted to ſpeak, his mouth was ſtopped immediately before he could bring out one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. (<hi>"You are not to ſpeak one word,"</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to him) The end of my having <hi>brethren</hi> with me was in purſuance of Chriſt's rule, <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. 16. and I ſuppoſe their buſineſs was, to interpoſe when either party carried matters too high, and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and propoſe terms of accommodation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the door was effectually barred againſt this. My end alſo in this meeting was purſuant to the ſame rule. <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. <hi>to tell him his fault,</hi> i. e. the particulars I was offended at. But neither was this ſuffered: and the reaſon he gives is, <hi>becauſe it would not make for peace.</hi> Who ever heard of ſuch a reaſon before, why a man muſt not be told of his <hi>faults</hi> by a brother offended? but this by the way. 2d. He attempts to make the world believe, that he made me ſome <hi>confeſſion,</hi> or at leaſt offered to do it <hi>conditionally.</hi> The brethren that went with me, ſay, he made me no confeſſion at all, but rather <hi>inſulted</hi> me. But what does he confeſs? the book ſays, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that it has been a day of <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>controverſy</hi> among us, we had both, no doubt, ſaid and done many things which are wrong, and which at another time we ſhould not have done.</q> The expreſſion I never heard before, as I can recollect; I dare ſay none of the brethren preſent (no nor Mr. <hi>R.</hi> himſelf) will venture to give their oaths, that theſe were <hi>the individual words.</hi> But ſuppoſe they were, did he deſign to confeſs
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012739_0124_0F8BEA5837DA37C0"/>any thing that I wanted him to confeſs?<note n="*" place="bottom">I dare put it to his conſcience, whether he deſigned in thoſe words to confeſs, that he had done me any wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by the letters. And indeed the words do not import, that he had any ſenſe of his having wronged <hi>me perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> at all. They may refer to <hi>any other wrong ſtep</hi> that he was conſcious of, in the management of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, that had no relation to me. Yea, they may mean, that he had <hi>only wronged himſelf,</hi> and <hi>not others,</hi> by ſomething he had ſaid or done.</note> was it not rather a general expreſſion deviſed to make the hearers think, that he confeſſed ſomething, when really he confeſſed nothing? that this was the caſe, appeared by the whole of his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, and by his book now. <q>My firſt letter, ſays he, contained my real ſentiments upon his conduct and principles; and I have never yet met with any juſt cauſe to <hi>alter</hi> my ſentiments.</q> 
                  <hi>p</hi> 61. How then can he fault me for not accepting his confeſſion? he tells us, that he meant <hi>nothing</hi> by it; and yet I am blame-worthy in his and the brethren's opinion, for not taking up with it. How unreaſonable is this? and beſides, was I not to have <hi>joined with him</hi> in the confeſſion? was not the acknowlegement to be <hi>mutual?</hi> the ſame terms he uſed, was I not to have uſed? and how could I do it without a conſciouſneſs of guilt? if I had been guilty, why did he not tell me wherein? why would he not come to particulars, and point out my faults? I ſtood ready to <hi>hear</hi> him, and upon <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> would as readily have acknowleged. But as things then appeared to me, how could I do it? and I would obſerve further, that if he was <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> he had <hi>wronged</hi> me, he ought to have confeſſed whether I did or no; and if he <hi>was not</hi> conſcious of it; how comes he to offer any thing that looked like confeſſion? in ſhort, this whole affair of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion<note n="†" place="bottom">I would obſerve here, that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> carefully avoids the term <hi>confeſſion,</hi> in all his account of the affair; he <hi>ſcorned</hi> to have it thought, that he had made me any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at all.

                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:012739_0125_0F8BEA590767BC98"/>upon me and others. If I had accepted the terms, how would he and his party have laughed in their ſleeves? telling all about, "that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had confeſſed nothing: that after making a great ſtir, I had given up all for a ſong; that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my own guilt, I durſt not proſecute the affair any further, but was glad to come off ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" And he would have gone on juſtifying his letters and conduct to the end of time. 3. He ſays, "the major part of the brethren thought the ſatisfaction he offered, reaſonable and ſufficient, and that they ſhould deſire no more, had they been the offended." <hi>p.</hi> 71. But how could they know <hi>that,</hi> without they heard the <hi>particulars</hi> I had againſt him? will they fall under the condemnation of <hi>judging a matter before they hear it?</hi> "but they knew the particulars." No, they did not know all. And as for thoſe they knew, how could they tell but that they would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them in quite a different light, if I had had liberty to have ſpoken to them particularly?<note n="*" place="bottom">I am ſatisfied that ſome of theſe brethren had not then heard the whole of the three letters. Or if they had, how could they paſs a proper judgment of them, upon hearing them <hi>once tranſiently?</hi> his firſt letter appeared to me ten times worſe in the after deliberate peruſal, than it did at firſt; and ſo it might to them, if they had heard it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately a ſecond time, and the particulars of it cloſely canvaſſed.</note> They had previouſly heard Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s explanation and defence, but not mine. Whether they ever declared to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> that they thought the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient or no, I cannot tell. I am ſure they never told me ſo, either at the meeting or ſince. By the way, he would not have been able to ſay, that the <hi>major part</hi> of the brethren gave their voice in favor of his propoſals, if he had not broke the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012739_0126_0F8BEA59B7CD9560"/>agreement, and invited one more to the meeting than I. Two of which number were as great ſticklers in the affair as himſelf, and <hi>I</hi> would <hi>rather</hi> have left the whole matter to him alone, than to them. And the 3d in the number was wholly under his influence. And the 4th (who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard my account of the matter) ſeemed, by what he ſaid at the meeting, to go upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, "that as no body thought the <hi>worſe</hi> of me for his letter, it would be beſt to paſs it lightly by:" being a man of peace, he would have been glad of peace at any rate. Upon the whole here, let me obſerve, both with reſpect them and others, that if they are among thóſe who <hi>juſtify the letters,</hi> it is no wonder they think the ſatisfaction ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for in that caſe no ſatisfaction was due; but confeſſion ought to come from me, as having charged him unjuſtly, and withdrawn from his communion without grounds.</p>
               <p>Again, he ſays, "miniſters as well as brethren adviſed to ſuch a general making up as he propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." He means the miniſters of <hi>Middleborough</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: I have aſked 3 of them, and they tell me they never gave ſuch advice. That there was indeed a tranſient expreſſion of one of the miniſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent about burning the letters, and ſo finiſhing the controverſy—and that was all.</p>
               <p>Finally, he ſays, "that I pulled out 3 or 4 <hi>confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for him to make." <hi>p.</hi> 72. This conveys a wrong idea. I made a few <hi>memorandums</hi> in ſhort hand on the back of his letter, running in theſe terms. 1ſt. As to the charge of <hi>inſincerity and deceit.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſays in his laſt letter, "that it was far from his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." I expect he will add further, that he diſavows all ſuch expreſſions as look that way, or carry ſuch an implication in them, in the apprehenſion of any. 2d. As to the charge of <hi>arminianiſm,</hi> I expect he ſay thus much at leaſt, that he did this without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds, and that it aroſe from miſtaken ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of what I read. 3d. That the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were uncharitable and improper, wherein he aſſerts "that the <hi>moſt godly</hi> among us, were all on his ſide of the queſtion." There were 2, or 3,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012739_0127_0F8BEA5F24B0F1C0"/>other articles ſet down, that did not relate to the letters. But theſe were all I read to him. And I thought it impoſſible to propoſe more moderate terms. But he would ſcarce give me the hearing, and rejected the whole with diſdain. As for my refuſing to anſwer a queſtion. <hi>p.</hi> 72. I think I was quite right in it, unleſs he would go into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and tell me wherein I had offended. Thus the meeting terminated. And by this account, which is juſt, does it appear, that he was any ways diſpoſed to peace? The brother, mentioned in his narrative, ſays, "I am much ſurprized Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſhould ſay <hi>"he endeavored a reconciliation in the preſence of a number of the brethren."</hi> It appeared to me, and ſo it did to others preſent, <q>that there appeared no diſpoſition in Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to take one proper or chriſtian ſtep for a reconciliation; for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could be more deaf to any propoſals made by another, and more fixedly to appearance ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the matter not to hear any thing Mr. <hi>C.</hi> offered, and <hi>often</hi> ſpake of his own propoſal, as if it was going further than was needful, but that he did it for peace ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" Again, he ſays, there appeared to me from the beginning to the end of their conference, that there was no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to make up the matter in any ſhape, unleſs he could lay Mr. <hi>C.</hi> under ſuch a <hi>diſadvantage</hi> as no <hi>chriſtian</hi> ought to <hi>conſent</hi> to.</q> He ſays further, "that captain <hi>C.</hi> deacon <hi>T.</hi> and I (the three brethren preſent) have divers times ſince ſaid to one another, that it appeared to us, that Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s treatment of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> at that time was rather an <hi>inſulting</hi> of him, than ſhewing any <hi>real deſire</hi> of ſettling the affair in a friendly and chriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner." And ſince that time what hath he done towards reconciliation? he indeed goes about every where crying, "how much he is for peace; that he longs to have the matter ſettled, that he is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do any thing," <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">By this means his hearers are induced to think, that he is all made up of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>peace:</hi> but let any one touch upon <hi>particulars,</hi> he will juſtify <hi>all</hi> as much as ever, and miſrepreſentation abound more and more.</note> And yet what <hi>one ſtep</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:012739_0128_0F8BEA61686ED868"/>hath he taken towards it? I was indeed a little in hopes, that he would have laid ſome foundation for a reconciliation in his book, or made ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, after ſo long time of deliberation: but in ſtead of that, he aggravates matters to the utmoſt, and hath widened the breach ten-fold more than ever. Which gives a ſpecimen of what he would have done at this meeting, if we had come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Who then can blame me for not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his propoſal, or agreeing to his offer of a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral oblivion?</hi> which is the utmoſt that can be ſaid of it, and really all he intended.</p>
               <p>I come now to the article of his "giving me the lye in the face of the church." <hi>p.</hi> 73. I had diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed in the moſt ſolemn terms any <hi>direct deſign</hi> of getting him away, and declared that our oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeded <hi>ſolely</hi> from conſciencious motives. He preſently ſtarts up, and tells the church in effect, that he did not believe one word I ſaid, but that "he was now <hi>confirmed</hi> in it, our whole deſign was to get him away." But what were the grounds of his diſbelief? or what gave him confirmation? he tells us, "it was a matter much talked of, in the town." I dare ſay, it was never talked of, till he and his <hi>two</hi> emiſſaries infuſed it into people. Not ſo, ſays he, "I ſuppoſe they formed their opinion from the whole tenor of his conduct towards me of late." I challenge him and his whole <hi>poſſe</hi> to allege <hi>one ſpeech</hi> or <hi>overt-act</hi> tending that way, (except my public writings have that tendency.) But what, though it appeared ſo evident to the whole pariſh, that I had a deſign of getting him away; yet he ſeems ſtill to heſitate and doubt about it: how comes he at length "to be better ſatisfied, that the reports were true?" why, by the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>extraordinary manner,</hi> in which my laſt piece was delivered?" this gave full proof and "confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," whatever I could ſay to the contrary. But why does he put in the <hi>manner,</hi> except it be to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the public? what could there be <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> in that? if it was delivered with "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian heat," as he intimates, <hi>p.</hi> 75. had that a tendency to get him away? ſhould I not defeat
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012739_0129_0F8BEA6253CC92B0"/>my own end by taking ſuch a method? in truth I had ſuch a bad cold and cough at that time, and for above 3 months before, that I believe I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered myſelf in a <hi>very ordinary manner,</hi> and not with much <hi>pathos.</hi> As for the <hi>matter,</hi> that appears from the print, to be worſe than it was, the church appeared to be in ſuch <hi>extraordinary agitation</hi> upon the account of a paper clandeſtinely ſigned, and brought in (of which more preſently) that I tho't I would not aggravate matters. And accordingly in reading my Eſſay, I omitted that paragraph about <hi>infant's being ſprinkled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 62. And alſo the whole of the 10th and 11th heads, <hi>p.</hi> 70. and the whole of the concluſion about his expedient, <hi>p.</hi> 73. which ſeemed to have a <hi>perſonal</hi> reference; and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> never ſaw or heard them, till they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in print.<note n="*" place="bottom">There was likewiſe another article omitted both in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in the <hi>printing</hi> too (leaſt I ſhould load him too much, and which unleſs remedied, there will be no peace, to this church;) and that relates to a record he made (after the 2 or 3 firſt meetings) which he calls <hi>ſtating the arguments on both ſides,</hi>" and which was made of his own mere motion without the knowledge and conſent of the church. It is among the propoſals to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of my laſt Eſſay, and runs in thoſe terms. "3d. I would propoſe, that the church record relating to this point may be eraſed or amended. It is the duty of a <hi>clerk</hi> to record the tranſactions of the ſociety he belongs to, and not his own fancies and opinions. If the clerk of the general court, or of a town, ſhould take liberty of ſtating caſes, reciting arguments, and giving prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which ſide he pleaſes, and making it part of the public records, without the knowlege of his conſtituents; how would it be reſented? but if a clerk ſhould go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill, and draw up ſuch a ſtate of the caſe, as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned the court or town, and brought a <hi>ſlur</hi> upon their <hi>former practices</hi> (upon their own records) what a <hi>ſtigma</hi> would he bring upon himſelf? it is certain, that the account ſet down on the church records does not contain a full and compleat ſtate of the arguments on both ſides; ſome of the arguments are wholly omitted, others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> and ſome things are added, which I never heard at any church-meeting. In ſhort, the account is <hi>imperfect</hi> from beginning to end. But if it was ever ſo perfect, it ought not to have been made <hi>matter of record,</hi> without the church's <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> I would therefore move, that the church would order it to be eraſed from the records. Or if this will not paſs, I move that a committee be choſen to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſuch addition to the church-records, as may leave a fair ſtate of the caſe to <hi>poſterity;</hi> who will have <hi>ſtrange ideas</hi> of the <hi>preſent generation,</hi> if it ſhould ſtand as it now does."</note> So that there was ſcarce any thing
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012739_0130_0F8BEA62B702E6A8"/>except <hi>general matter</hi> left. And how could he from that infer, that I had a deſign of getting him away; yea, and be abſolutely confirmed in it too? but ſtill ſays he, "actions ſpeak louder than words;" and from them it was evident, that I had ſuch a deſign. But what were theſe actions? why a ſeries of wrongs, or "injurious treatment frequently given." <hi>p.</hi> 72. I had ſaid and done things (to his prejudice) which he could not have thought poſſible before," they were ſo very bad. <hi>p.</hi> 70. "By all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of late, it was evident I had LONG ſome <hi>root of prejudice</hi> againſt him; and that nothing was wanting but opportunity, for it to manifeſt itſelf. But that now opportunity being given by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, I had uſed it to purpoſe." <hi>p.</hi> 71. And that all the while "my conſcience was ſo <hi>perfectly</hi> CALLOUS and <hi>inſenſible,</hi> that I would not own I had wronged him at all." <hi>p.</hi> 59. And to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſeveral other places.</p>
               <p>Thus hath he cloathed me "in a garb of his own manufacture, terrible eno'l acknowledge," and much like the dreſs of victims devoted to deſtruction by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inquiſition, all painted with devils; yea, and exactly in the ſame ſtrain and language of a late printed advertiſement. But to ſtrip myſelf of this awful garb, let me obſerve a few things. 1ſt. That at the time of this meeting, our diviſion was comprized in a narrow compaſs. It was in a manner, all contained in the letters that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: he did not ſo much as hint, that he had any thing further againſt me at the meeting with
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012739_0131_0F8BEA639ABD8CF0"/>the brethren, that followed ſoon after; no, nor at any other time hath he intimated to me, that he took offence at any thing elſe. But now it ſeems there was a ſeries of other injuries. How unjuſt and unchriſtian are ſuch repreſentations? as for my letter, the world hath that before them; and they may judge, as well as we, whether it gave founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all this outcry. 2d. The ſuggeſtion is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groundleſs, "that nothing but <hi>opportunity</hi> was wanting for me to revenge myſelf, or to manifeſt the <hi>rooted prejudice</hi> or grudge I had long bore him." For never man gave more <hi>opportunities,</hi> if I had been diſpoſed to embrace them. His <hi>imprudent management</hi> was ſuch from year to year, that the pariſh was frequently in a flame about it.<note n="*" place="bottom">At ſome of theſe times, I myſelf heard one of his preſent <hi>prime pillars</hi> allege in his excuſe, "that we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he was but <hi>a child;</hi> and that when he had more years over his head, he would behave with more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and caution."</note> But how did I behave at ſuch times? why, inſtead of taking the opportunity, I was either ſilent, or endeavored to ſmooth over his conduct. And even when it was propoſed to print my firſt Eſſay, I declined it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this ground, leſt it ſhould bring on a <hi>perſonal conteſt</hi> between me and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> And previous to this, when I have been blamed for not preaching in his abſence, or for being ſo loth to preach, I have rather bore the blame than tell my reaſons pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, leſt it ſhould hurt him. And when he ſent the provoking letters to the precinct committee about his ſalary, I, with the reſt, endeavored to ſtifle and ſuppreſs them, becauſe I knew how much the precinct would reſent it, if they were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated (as he deſigned they ſhould be) though for this, many much blamed us. Yea, under all the flights and neglects, or ill-treatment in general, I received from him in former years,<note n="†" place="bottom">Perhaps he will here retort, that this is only a <hi>general charge,</hi> and utterly deny any ſuch treatment. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, let me ſubjoin one inſtance among many. When he knew, that <hi>3</hi> quarters of the pariſh or more would gladly hear me preach, and (being about to take a journey to <hi>Connecticut</hi>) was earneſtly urged by ſome of the principal men to invite me to ſupply the pulpit, and told, that it ſhould not coſt him a farthing; he rather than do it, choſe to ride above <hi>40</hi> miles to get a young preacher, who when he came no body liked, and I was forced at laſt to preach part of the time, at the invitation of the deacons and precinct committee. And (ſtrange to tell) though I preached ſo frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he never once heard me till the time of his <hi>great concern</hi> about <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> years ago, altho' he hath been in the town ever ſince the year <hi>1759.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed never went ſo far as (he has now) to forbid my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he knew that would not bear; however he diſcouraged it as far as he durſt, all the while declaring to ſome that were then cloſely attached to me, "how he <hi>longed</hi> to hear me preach and what a value he had for me, &amp;c." but to others he talked otherways; and to juſtify himſelf, told about town, "that the <hi>aſſociation</hi> adviſed him not to aſk me to preach; which I cannot think true, moſt of them freely and repeatedly aſking me into their own pulpits. Nay, to ſuch a height did he carry his diſlike, that when once he was obliged by his people to invite me to preach upon his being ſuddenly taken ill, his <hi>wife</hi> went to the other meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though there was no miniſterial communion between him and the other miniſter. This could not proceed from any diſtaſte to my manner of preaching for ſhe had never heard me. Many other ſlights there were, beſides thoſe on the article of preaching. Let me particularly mention one; when I was choſen <hi>town-clerk</hi> anno 1766, he was pleaſed to ſay after the meeting, in a large and promiſcuous company, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me and my competitor; "he wondered that they ſhould choſe Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Mr. <hi>S—r</hi> would have made a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clerk." Here obſerve, a <hi>meddling</hi> with town and precinct affairs; which I and others have had ten-fold more <hi>experience</hi> of the laſt <hi>March.</hi>
                  </note> I bore it with
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012739_0132_0F8BEA6439694BD0"/>patience, and would not ſo much as hint any thing to his diſadvantage. Here, by the way, I cannot help obſerving, that if he had not been <hi>conſcious</hi> of ill-treating me in former years, he would not have <hi>ſuſpected</hi> I bore him an old grudge. I ſhould ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been one of the <hi>worſt</hi> of mortals to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt any one that never injured me,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012739_0133_0F8BEA6561A25230"/>but had always treated me with kindneſs and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. I would obſerve further, that after the church-meetings upon this affair had been diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for about a 12 month, I had no hand in their revival; I knew nothing of the 3 deacon's making the motion, till after it was done; I was not conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it; if I had been, I ſhould have adviſed againſt it: ſo far was I from puſhing it on, to get him away. It ſtruck me with conſternation when I firſt heard of it, as partly ſeeing the event. I knew Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s natural diſpoſition, that he would be <hi>ſtrengthened by oppoſition,</hi> at leaſt from ſuch <hi>minute beings</hi> as he apprehended us to be; whereas by longer forbearance he might fall off from his new notions of his own accord, his native ſickleneſs and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility giving ſome ground of hope. I could ſee no other conſequence reſulting from a new meeting, but that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> muſt leave us, or the church give up the practice to gratify him: to prevent <hi>either,</hi> I ſet myſelf to ſtudy for ſome expedient, in which both might agree, and at length thought of <hi>a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring miniſter</hi>'s <hi>coming;</hi> which I accordingly propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: how Mr. <hi>R.</hi> received it, the world hath heard. And even after he had given <hi>me offence</hi> by his letters, I made another propoſal (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 73.) even giving up the point of <hi>qualifications.</hi> But it was not taken the <hi>leaſt</hi> notice of. This was the caſe. And yet now one of theſe very perſons, that petitioned for the meetings being revived, and was as earneſt in it as the reſt, <hi>joins</hi> in the cry of a deſign of driving Mr. <hi>R.</hi> off, when I did all I could to prevent it; which I think very hard: when he had laid me under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of going on with my defence (I could do no other, when the meetings were once revived). That yet he ſhould tax me for it, and impute it to <hi>bad deſigns,</hi> even without once diſcourſing with me upon the affair: Is this <hi>brotherly</hi> or <hi>chriſtian!</hi> Alas! how far will affection ſometimes lead good men! To ſum up all in a word, if ſuch prejudice ſubſiſted in my breaſt, as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> here ſuggeſts, if I retained an old grudge againſt him, is it poſſible it ſhould lye dormant? could I help manifeſting it ſome way or other, in ſuch a long courſe of years? and I appeal
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012739_0134_0F8BEA65D7FF5750"/>to the whole pariſh, whether by word or action, I have tried to hurt him. But to paſs on, 3d. His charges, the reader will naturally obſerve, are all of a general nature, except the letter in 1764, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular; much like the charges of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> againſt <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> xxiv. 5. And how eaſy is it to aſperſe the beſt man alive in this manner? and who could eſcape? if I was guilty of ſuch acts of injury, and that ſo frequently, why are they not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized? why does he not tell the world what they are? I challenge him to do it; I demand it of him, as a man, as a chriſtian, as a miniſter, that he bring them forth: I will turn the whole cauſe upon it, if he can produce ſo much as one, except he raiſes up falſe witneſſes againſt me, or except he accuſes me <hi>in the matter of my God,</hi> i. e. for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of what I think a truth, an important truth of Chriſt. And muſt I leave this undefended? muſt I give it up, for fear of getting him away? let me be firſt caſt to <hi>the lions. Dan.</hi> vi. It is true, in the preſent ſituation of things, no body can imagine that I ſhould <hi>much grieve</hi> if he was gone, without there appeared a great change in him. But as for ſaying or doing any thing previous to or at the church-meeting, with deſign to get him away, I utterly diſavow it. And even <hi>ſince</hi> the church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have taken no meaſures or ſteps for ſuch a purpoſe; but have been much upon the reſerve, ſaying or doing nothing, except by way of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; which I think is my bounden duty, and none can juſtly blame me for it. And ſo far am I from being <hi>implacable</hi> and <hi>unforgiving,</hi> that if there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any <hi>hearty concern</hi> in him for his miſ-management, and the injuries he hath done me, or if he was in the ſame temper and diſpoſition he was about four years ago, I could freely paſs by all, and receive him as cordially as ever. But till this appears, <hi>chriſtianity itſelf</hi> does not oblige me to <hi>forgive,</hi> except ſo far as not to bear him <hi>ill-will,</hi> but to wiſh and pray for his ſpiritual welfare, that his eyes may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here for a <hi>coronis</hi> on this head, I hope it will be a warning to the reader, in caſe he ſhould
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012739_0135_0F8BEA6D50C2F460"/>return an anſwer to this book, not to give heed to <hi>general charges</hi> and <hi>accuſations.</hi> If this ſubterfuge ſhould fail him, I know he would have very little left. I hope alſo, it will be a warning to his <hi>pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,</hi> not to regard ſuch general outcry "of <hi>injury, abuſe and perſecution,</hi>" which I expect will be more abundant than ever, and that he <hi>will ride all over the town</hi> for that purpoſe. To ſhow any regard to them, would manifeſt to the world, that they are more ſwayed by <hi>affection</hi> than by <hi>judgment,</hi> and that the <hi>prejudice</hi> lays wholly on their ſide and not on mine; and that <hi>the grieving the good Mr.</hi> R. (as the phraſe is) lyes nearer their hearts, than <hi>juſtice, truth</hi> and <hi>the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good</hi> of their own dear offspring,<note n="*" place="bottom">Some there are, that declare, "they are in my ſentiments, and that they think the practice right;" yet will give it up, for fear of grieving or offending Mr. <hi>R.</hi> which ſhows, that they are <hi>man-pleaſers;</hi> and that they prefer <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>truth;</hi> and that preſent eaſe is better in their eſteem than the ſpiritual advantage of their children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> which I think cloſely connected with this controverſy. Which God forbid.</p>
               <p>Well, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> having cleared himſelf from the heinous charge of <hi>giving me the lye,</hi> he next proceeds to retort the charge. It ſeems "I gave him the lye too, in the face of the church." After much ſtudy, he hath hammered out ſomething, that he thought would carry ſuch an appearance. <hi>p.</hi> 74. But as it happens it wants <hi>truth</hi> to ſupport it in every part. Firſt he ſays, "he told me and the church <hi>publicly,</hi> that ſome churches had practiced agreable to his expedient, both in this province and <hi>connecticut,</hi> one in the former, and another in the latter, both of which he named." It makes me ſick to hear ſo much of things ſaid in public, which were never ſaid, (I believe I could mention near a ſcore of inſtances, which were only the fruit of after ſtudy). This expedient of his, was never propoſed in a <hi>formal manner</hi> in public; but only to the members <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>everally in a <hi>private</hi> way in their own houſes or as he had opportunity; thus he propoſed it to me at my own home. But finding
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012739_0136_0F8BEA6E673F0710"/>it would not bear, I ſuppoſe upon this account he forebore offering it in public. For which reaſon when my 2d. Eſſay was read at the meeting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the laſt (which was done by one of the deacons, as I have noted, upon the account of my indiſpoſition) I ſtood up, when he came to my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations about the expedient, and ſaid, "that inaſmuch as the propoſal had never been made to the church at any of our public meetings, I tho't it beſt he ſhould omit reading that part, and that it was time enough to read it when the propoſal was brought into public:" it was omitted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly (<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 21 to 26. of the Eſſays,) and the church never heard it at all.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was in too great ferment, to make ſuch a deliberate propoſal in our laſt meeting. However, I recollect, that when one of the deacons then expreſſed his wiſhes, that he would come into our expedient of a neighbouring miniſter's coming, he turned it off ſlightly, and ſaid, he thought we might as well come into his expedient: and ſo the matter went off, without being particularly urged and enforced. To be ſure, there was no particular mention of other churches in the practice, as I, or others of good memories, can poſſibly recollect. However, if there had been, this does not prove <hi>I gave him the lye:</hi> for I did not thwart or contradict him at that time in the face of the church; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaying or reading any thing relating to the expedient.</note> And as for what he puts in contraſt to this, and which makes the <hi>lye,</hi> namely, my ſaying, "no church in the province practices any thing like it, and that we could not tell whether the report about the <hi>Connecticut</hi> church was true or no." (<hi>p.</hi> 73. Eſſays.) This was not read at the church-meeting, as I have obſerved before; no, neither was it ſo much as wrote; I adding that part, when I tranſcribed the Eſſays for the preſs, upon hearing that after the diſſolution of the meeting, he ſtill urged the members to come into the expedient. So that <hi>his aſſertion</hi> and my <hi>denial</hi> in the face of the church publicly, muſt both fall to the ground; there never was any ſuch thing on either ſide. And as for his telling me of it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate at my own houſe, I am certain he never did;
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012739_0137_0F8BEA6ED519DB00"/>we talking only of the propriety of the expedient. I had the account of the practice of the <hi>Connecticut</hi> church from another quarter. And as for the church in this province that is in the practice, I know not what he means; I cannot ſo much as gueſs even now what church he refers to. I have heard ſince my Eſſays were in the preſs, that this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was in common uſe among the <hi>Connecticut</hi> church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Dr. <hi>B</hi>'s ſcheme. Why did he not tell us of this! had he a mind to appear among us as one of the prime leaders in this new device? and ſo be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to poſterity on the liſt of fame?</p>
               <p>I paſs over the reſt of his 74th <hi>p.</hi> though it juſtly deſerves caſtigation. And proceed to his account of the laſt church-meeting, <hi>p.</hi> 75. with which he finiſhes his book. I had prepared a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this meeting to be added to my Eſſays: but fearing to bring diſcredit on the church (which was my <hi>alma mater</hi>) I eraſed it; and only concluded with a general and ſhort relation, which I thought impoſſible any ſhould be offended at. But it ſeems Mr. <hi>R.</hi> hath taken great offence. And by his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and imprudent manner of writing about it, hath neceſſitated me to be particular in the affair, which I am really ſorry for. He ſays, "I repreſent him, as <hi>unſatisfied</hi> with the diſſolution of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing" I never gave any ſuch repreſentation, as I have noted before; it was what he wanted. He tells us "the church were not willing to hear me any more, having ſeen the ſad effects of my Eſſays in former meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What an idea does this carry with it, as if I had <hi>forced</hi> my Eſſays upon the church in former meetings, (ſo that they were wearied out with them) and urged the matter even to nauſeouſneſs? when in fact the church appeared always deſirous to hear me till now, and many act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually put me on to ſpeak. The more their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that they now give me up a <hi>victim</hi> to Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s reſentment! they cannot but know, that <hi>I am ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for pleading their cauſe and the cauſe of their children:</hi> and why will they not ſee me <hi>righted?</hi> how cruel and unbrotherly to leave me thus in the lurch? But why were they not willing to hear me now?
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012739_0138_0F8BEA6F76392638"/>becauſe Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and his ſeconds had told them, "that it was not <hi>conſcience,</hi> but <hi>revenge</hi> that influenced us, and that our only motive was to drive him off:" and they had previouſly determined to bar any further proceſs, and to diſſolve the meeting at all events. But what were the <hi>ſad effects</hi> of my Eſſays formerly? why, it prevented his gaining his ends, and getting the practice caſt out, and he had <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly picked a quarrel</hi> with me for it. He could not brook oppoſition. "I could not have believed it poſſible, ſays he, ſome years ago." <hi>p.</hi> 70. <hi>Believed what?</hi> why, that I ſhould be ſo preſumptuous as to riſe in rebellion, and dare to defend a practice, that he had ſtigmatized. This was the whole that he could object againſt me. He tells us further, "that there was more warmth and unchriſtian heat in this than in any of our meetings before, and that we <hi>had all reaſon to be aſhamed of it.</hi>" It is well he <hi>takes himſelf in;</hi> it is the <hi>firſt time</hi> he hath done it throughout his whole book. But what was "the occaſion of this heat?" why, "our oppoſition to the diſſolution of the meeting." Here he <hi>ſkulks</hi> out again, and lays all the blame on us. But was this fact? no; it was not the diſſolving the meeting (this we would have conſented to on proper terms) but <hi>the paper</hi> that he immediately mentions, which cauſed all this heat and warmth. A paper had been drawn up (not "a day or two," as he ſays, but) ſeveral days before the meeting, and put into the hands of a <hi>proper inſtrument,</hi> who, carrying it about, <hi>ployed his game</hi> ſo well, as to get near half the church to ſign. But "this they did willingly, ſays Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and not by conſtraint or <hi>perſuaſion.</hi>" How could this be, when he went to one member no leſs than 3 times, <hi>perſuading</hi> him to ſign, but he finally refuſed? and was not the utmoſt art, or rather artifice, uſed with the reſt? did he not tell the members applied to, "that this was the only way to keep Mr. <hi>R?</hi> that there was a plan laid to get him away? that this was all we had in view in our oppoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" or ſuch like ſuggeſtions. And was it not ſuch conſiderations as theſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſign? I appeal to the members ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether this was not the caſe. This paper
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012739_0139_0F8BEA71C314F890"/>was kept a profound ſecret, till the opening of the church-meeting, and then was preſented: Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was in a great hurry to read it, and ſtopped one of the deacons for that end who was beginning upon the merits of the cauſe. But previous to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he told us. "he had no hand or concern in it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Some folks had need have good memories. For ſome time after, in the courſe of the debate, he ſaid in <hi>his haſte, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that he had the <hi>correcting,</hi> if not the firſt <hi>draughting</hi> the paper: and yet it ſeems by his firſt declaration, he had <hi>no concern</hi> in it at all. It was a mere free will offering of others, to which he was an intire ſtranger.</note> And then read as follows.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012739_0141_0F8BEA733A8450F0"/>I was angry to purpoſe, and it was the only time that I was thoroughly angry at any of our meetings. We proteſted againſt the paper;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012739_0142_0F8BEA73F5830538"/>we deſired to be heard upon it, and inſiſted upon our right to ſpeak: but all in vain. A vote was <hi>hurried on,</hi> (Mr. <hi>R.</hi> the ring-leader in it,) and it paſſed in the very words of the paper. After the paſſing of it, the oppoſite party, who, <hi>all the while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be in as great agitation as we,</hi> became ſo far <hi>calmed</hi> as to ſuffer us to ſpeak, before the ſentence of diſſolution was pronounced, though Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared utterly averſe to it. We then argued and remonſtrated, ſhewing the <hi>impropriety</hi> of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the <hi>bad conſequences</hi> that would reſult from it; and withal claiming it as our right and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to deliver our whole minds on the affair, and ſhowing the injuſtice of ſtopping our mouths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>M—w</hi> were our chief oppoſers all the while. But at length (with much difficulty, and after a ſtruggle of 2 or 3 hours) the church re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their vote, and liberty was granted to ſpeak to the merits of the cauſe. One of the old members ſaying, "<hi>come let us hear Mr.</hi> C. <hi>perhaps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this noiſe, the mountain will bring forth a mouſe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems he could not hear me long with patience; for he kept altering his poſture, riſing and ſitting, ſhifting ſeats, walking in the alley, running out of doors, and then returning; and ſometimes ſpeaking and objecting, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtop me, &amp;c. For which management I gave a <hi>ſtamp</hi> at him, and kept on reading. This I mention, leſt Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (as he never miſſes an advantage) ſhould make a formidable ſtory of it in his next piece and leave out the provoking circumſtances. It was the <hi>only</hi> method where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I could well teſtify my diſlike of his behavior; for my breath and ſtrength was nigh ſpent with ſpeaking and reading (being not well) and then a verbal reproof would have engaged me in a diſpute, and diverted and ſtopt my reading in the midſt, which was what he wanted. And beſides, we had a <hi>moderator,</hi> that would keep no ſort of order; on the contrary, he was moſt <hi>unorderly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and encouraged the like in others, (<hi>his friends,</hi> as he calls them.)</note> I took no notice of the ſpeech, but proceeded to read my laſt piece, leaving out the parts moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012739_0143_0F8BEA74B5DDB410"/>After this, others ſpoke to the point in controverſy, (the meeting not being immediately diſſolved, as he aſſerts, but continuing near an hour after) and pleaded for the continuance of the practice. But not expecting it would have any effect, the brethren with me finally offered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the diſſolution of the meeting upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per terms; which were, that the offenſive paper ſhould be wholly laid aſide: and, inaſmuch as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igners of it had with one voice declared, "that the intent of it was only, that the affair might be dropt for the preſent, and that things ſhould remain in the ſame ſituation they were before we had any church-meetings." That the vote ſhould be drawn up accordingly. But this could not be obtained. Then it was offered further, to join in the vote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms uſed in the paper, provided the latter clauſe relating to the paſtor might be left out. But neither could this be obtained: but the vote finally paſſed as it ſtood at firſt. And then the meeting was diſſolved. This was the true ſtate of the caſe. How unfair is Mr. <hi>R.</hi> then in telling the world, that I (with others) oppoſed a diſſolution of the meeting with vehemence? and that this was the ſole cauſe of all the unchriſtian heat appearing at that time? the real cauſe was the <hi>unchriſtian paper,</hi> that was brought into the meeting. And this had ſuch effects, afterwards, that ſeveral withdrew from the communion upon the account, looking upon it that the conſtitution of the church was intirely changed; and Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> was obliged to have a church-meeting on the affair; which was held on the <hi>ſabbath!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſtopped the church after meeting, to get them to make the following declaration (ready prepared to their heads;) namely, "That they did not intend by the offenſive clauſe to make any alteration in the conſtitution of the church, or inveſt the paſtor with any new power in his office, which he was not poſſeſſed of before the vote paſſed; but that the conſtitution of the church and the power of the paſtor ſhould be conſidered juſt in the ſame point of light as before." And he took <hi>the ſabbath</hi> for it, <hi>to prevent any debate on the affair.</hi> However there was ſome debate, and the church after deliberation were ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making ſuch a <hi>contradictory declaration</hi>) as to ſtrike at the <hi>root</hi> and to vote an eraſure; to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent diſſatisfiaction of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and 2 or 3 other zealous ſticklers. Here I deſire the reader to recall to mind how <hi>his zeal was ſtirred</hi> at my writing <hi>remarks</hi> on his <hi>prayer</hi> upon <hi>the ſabbath;</hi> and how I am taxed with it even <hi>twice.</hi> Lo! here are <hi>church-meetings</hi> (as well as <hi>weddings</hi>) on the SABBATH!</note> In
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012739_0144_0F8BEA75E2B84E40"/>which the church agreed to eraſe the paſſage moſt offenſive in their vote; namely, thoſe words, <hi>"in the mean time to leave the conduct of the affair under conſideration to the wiſdom and prudence of the paſtor."</hi> So that Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s abſolute power and reign was of ſhort continuance; at leſt in word and name, though in reality it remains as much as ever; and perhaps more ſo.</p>
               <p>And thus I have at length arrived to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his book; having ſo much <hi>rubbiſh</hi> to remove out of the way, I have proceeded the more ſlowly and gradually; and yet have left unnoticed many articles leſs material and which did not ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately affect my reputation, which were as groſsly miſrepreſented as the reſt. What I have taken notice of appeared abſolutely neceſſary to me: "they are facts (to uſe his own words, <hi>p.</hi> 65.) which ſhould never have been made more public by me, had not Mr. <hi>R.</hi> really obliged me to it, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate myſelf from thoſe <hi>charges</hi> which he has thrown out againſt me in his <hi>bitter remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Eſſays;</hi> which have made it <hi>neceſſary</hi> that I ſhould thus let the world know the <hi>particular (manner,</hi> as well as) <hi>reaſons</hi> of my conduct, eſpecially in <hi>publiſhing his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which he has endeavored to repreſent to his readers in ſuch terrible colours." And upon the whole would obſerve, that his <hi>talent</hi> ſeems to lye in miſrepreſentation, and in giving the moſt odious turn to the moſt innocent actions. And if he would take ſuch liberty in a <hi>public piece,</hi> where I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing and anſwering for myſelf; how much more may we ſuppoſe, that he gave
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012739_0145_0F8BEA76656889C0"/>himſelf latitude in his <hi>private viſits</hi> (which were ſo abundant) where I had little opportunity of hearing &amp; knowing what he ſaid? (in fact picking up all the <hi>tittle-tattle</hi> that ever he heard about me from my childhood to this day, which received <hi>new authority as it came from his mouth.</hi>) No wonder then, that he hath wrought people to ſo high a pitch againſt me, eſpecially ſince I am ſuch "<hi>a hermit,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſo little with people." (Eſſays. <hi>p.</hi> 49.) And ſo have no opportunity of counter-acting his motions.</p>
               <p>Theſe things lye as a continued load on my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; they wear out my life, depriving me of my natural reſt, and rendering we weary of a vain world, where <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>friendſhip</hi> and every thing are ſo mutable and uncertain. And what will be the end of them is known only to the wiſe diſpoſer of all things. To whom I deſire to ſubmit in this and all his diſpenſations, for I ſuffer JUSTLY from him, though UNJUSTLY from man. But whatever becomes of me, whether I ſtand or fall; it is ſure the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt his church. His cauſe will flouriſh in ſpite of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

               </p>
               <p>May God give a happy termination to theſe things; may peace as well as truth flouriſh in our days; may we all have the temper of the goſpel implanted and cultivated in us; and may this church (the firſt in <hi>New-England</hi>) be increaſed with the increaſings of God, and may all the members of it be found walking in the ways of truth and peace, to the Redeemer's glory, the good of others, and rejoicing of their own ſouls in the day of Chriſt.

            <p>SINCE the finiſhing of this anſwer, ſomething has occurred, proper to mention, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the reader will look upon as a mere tragi-comedy. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> a brother of the church being very uneaſy at the preſent ſituation of affairs, of his own mere motion went to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged him to come and converſe with me alone, and endeavor to heal the breach between us: this Mr. <hi>R.</hi> utterly refuſed. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> then propoſed, that we ſhould have another conference with ſome of the brethren preſent, to ſee if nothing could be done. This Mr. <hi>R.</hi> conceded to, and gave him leave to propoſe it to me; withal ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that he was ſenſible he had been to blame in the affair.

That in order the more effectually to bring about an accommodation, whether it would not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adviſable to have 2 or 3 neighboring mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preſent? unleſs theſe terms be agreed to, I am confident it would be to little purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in any ſhape. But if Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> concedes to them, I ſtand ready to meet him at any place that he ſhall propoſe, although I do not think myſelf obliged by the laws of chriſtianity to take any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>private ſteps,</hi> but the affair ſeems ripe for a public cognizance. But for the ſake of peace, I am ready to fall in with any thing that is lawful and reaſonable, and that has a tendency to put an end to this uncomfortable affair.—</p>

            <p>This I wrote to prevent wrong accounts of the affair, (well knowing the <hi>danger</hi> of a <hi>verbal anſwer;</hi>) but I wrote not to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> becauſe he did not write to me, and becauſe my laſt letter was ſent back with contempt, unread as he ſays. <hi>p.</hi> 70. The whole was deſigned merely as a memorandum, and to help Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s memory in returning an anſwer. This ſcript being communicated to a number of the brethren and approved by them, I ſometime after delivered to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who upon hearing it read, ſaid, "he believed (as he gathered from Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s talk) that he would conſent to every particular, except that about miniſter's being preſent." I then directed him either to read the paper to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> or let him read it himſelf, and even take a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it (if he deſired it) but to bring back the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> accordingly gave him the paper, which having read, he deſired it might be left
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012739_0148_0F90909706A5ACE8"/>with him for a while, as not having time to take a copy of it then. It ſeems he was in ſuch a hurry to communicate it, that he would not take time, as he might well have done; and he could not ſo well repreſent it as a letter to him if it had not been in my hand-writing. He preſently repairs to his <hi>grand non-communicant counſellor</hi> ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in this piece; and having conſulted with him, he then flies about the town from houſe to houſe, and read the paper (after his manner) to thoſe of his favorers he met with, communicants or non-communicants, old and young, (with large annotations) ſpending the remainder of this and moſt of the next day in this exerciſe. So that it was late the next day, and after going 2 or 3 times, before Mr. <hi>H.</hi> could get back the original, and even then he appeared loth to part with it. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned me no anſwer by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> either written or verbal, and ſignified to him his diſlike of <hi>the whole paper,</hi> and that he was generally adviſed to take no notice of it, with intimations of my being impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the mean time, the report flew like lightning every where, and even into neighboring pariſhes, "that I had wrote another letter to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and in it abuſed and <hi>inſulted</hi> him in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in ſhort had <hi>done worſe than ever before.</hi>" I could not imagine how this could be; and the paper being returned, one or two of the brethren traced, the reports, having the original in their pockets; and the brethren to whom Mr. <hi>R.</hi> read it, appeared generally highly incenſed againſt me for my bad treatment of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Upon which they read the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them. Moſt of them ſeemed amazed, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> did not read it ſo to them, and could ſcarce believe it was the ſame paper, and ſome of them deſired to hear it 2 or 3 times before they could give any credit to it, and moſt of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, they could ſee no harm in the paper as it was read to them now. And ſome ſeemed ſo uneaſy, that they ſaid they would go and diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>R.</hi> upon it. But how can this be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for? would even one of the worſt of men have dared thus to impoſe upon people, when he was
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012739_0149_0F909097B9B32DE0"/>ſo liable to detection? I anſwer, I ſuppoſe the caſe to be this; that as he read the paper, he kept paraphraſing as he went along, and keeping his eye upon the paper, they took his comments to be part of the paper: and ſo were angry or pleaſed; juſt as he appeared to be himſelf. However, this is not a full ſolution. It is evident by their ſeveral accounts, that there muſt be ſome paragraphs omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reading: for it was generally underſtood. 1ſt. That I wrote him another letter, and ſo was going to create a freſh diſturbance. 2d. That the motion for another meeting originated from me and not from him. 3d. That I inſiſted upon his making a confeſſion previous to the meeting, and bringing or ſending it to me in writing, or <hi>he ſhould not ſee my face</hi> (as he phraſed it, or read it, as ſome ſay.) Whereas the contrary to all this appeared plainly from the face of the paper. It was wrote to prevent miſtakes, and not directed to him. It is a declared anſwer to a propoſal of his; and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired was, "that he ſhould <hi>ſignify his readineſs</hi>" to make ſuch a confeſſion: but the <hi>actual doing</hi> of it was to be part of the buſineſs of the meeting. Thus they would have certainly underſtood it, if it had been read as it ought to have been. As to the article of <hi>confeſſion,</hi> I thought it a <hi>neceſſary</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary; for what ſignified it to meet, unleſs he appeared <hi>diſpoſed to do ſomething?</hi> and this was the <hi>leaſt</hi> I could accept of; and it was in ſome ſort a coming to his terms of <hi>a general making up,</hi> which (to uſe his phraſe) I thought even "a condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in me." With reſpect to the ſecond article, he ſaid, that his hands were to be tyed, but I was to be leſt open and looſe: Whereas I had ſeveral ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial articles againſt him, beſides that of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were left as much at a looſe. The 3d. article he read with an <hi>emphaſis,</hi> and it was made criminal in an high degree. There was nothing but <hi>ſhall, ſhall, ſhall.</hi> In ſhort, I appeared as arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and abſolute as the great <hi>Turk:</hi> it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but SHALL and WILL with me. So that I SHALL be almoſt afraid even to ſpeak in the future tenſe again, at leaſt in addreſſing Mr. <hi>R.</hi> There
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012739_0150_0F90909876AF3CB0"/>was another deſpotical or dogmatic SHALL under the 4th head. As to the 5th, I was for bringing a council upon him at once, and it ſeems the words "proper and adviſable," and it's being propoſed by way of query, were ſunk in the reading. For the hearers took it, that there was another SHALL here too. And to crown all, he denied that it was he who ſtop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed the brethren's mouth at the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meeting, and ſaid, "it was my own propoſal." (Article 3d.) My PROPOSAL! where are we now? into what a world have we got? I ſhould as ſoon have expected, that he would have denied that we ever had any meeting at all: however I am glad it is come out before my anſwer went to the preſs. My PROPOSAL! the deacon who interpoſed between us, and the only witneſs in the caſe, will give his oath to the contrary. And his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the meeting (which I have recited) proves that the reſtriction came from him, and not from me. But it ſeems he is aſhamed of it, and is going to father it upon me; when as I ever abhorred it, being unreaſonable in itſelf, tending to defeat the whole deſign of the meeting, and repugnant to the example of all chriſtians in the like caſes: (I dare ſay no inſtance of this nature can be found in the annals of the church. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> muſt have the ſole honor of the invention.) It was nothing but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, and my great deſire of peace, that brought me to ſubmit to it. A meeting was to be had upon no other terms But did he not offer other terms? and did not my refuſal neceſſitate him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this? he indeed offered not to lay this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, if I would have excluded one brother from the meeting. But this I could not conſent to: it was as neceſſary that brother ſhould be preſent as I myſelf. Not only as an evidence, but as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offended; he looking upon himſelf as equally involved in the charge of <hi>arminianiſm</hi> and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine; and there could be no thoro' making up without him. As to the concluſion of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that expreſſion was very offenſive, "the affair ſeems ripe for a public cognizance." Here it ſeems
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012739_0151_0F9090995E78B090"/>I threatned him with a council. But withal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that he would not join or take notice of a council. He then thanks his mountain ſo ſtrong, that it connot be moved; and is reſolved to brave it out againſt all the world, as long as he can keep the majority of the pariſh on his ſide. But is this a chriſtian diſpoſition? is it not <hi>his</hi> (as well as <hi>my</hi>) duty to uſe all proper means of reconciliation? and is not the advice of miniſters and churches one <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted means</hi> for that end? and will he reject all? and make numbers his ſole refuge? Alas! what one ſingle ſtep hath he ever yet taken for peace, ſince this controverſy begun? and he ſeems now to declare, that he never deſigns to take any, but to leave me to my fate! (which ſort of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems to give full confirmation to a report long prevalent among us, namely, his ſaying, <hi>that if we had not got deacon</hi> T. <hi>with us, he ſhould ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e nothing about it</hi>) And his principal adherents join in the ſame declaration, of taking no notice of my efforts. Theſe are the chief things, that have tranſpired reſpecting this paper. His friends ſeem cautious of ſpeaking, otherwiſe no doubt we ſhould have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up many more. One thing indeed I have heard further, that he gives out "Mr. <hi>H.</hi> went beyond his commiſſion;" whether in making the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſition in his name, or in ſignifying his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of being to blame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in both, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. Thus propoſals of peace from me are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into crimes: if I do, or not do, ſpeak, write, or ſit ſtill, people will be more and more angry at me. If I had taken no notice of the propoſal at all, I ſhould have been repreſented as implacable, and bad to the laſt degree, as refuſing all overtures of peace: and if I do take notice of it in the moſt modeſt and chriſtian manner, it is looked upon as criminal. What ſhall I then do? and what will be the end of theſe things!</p>
