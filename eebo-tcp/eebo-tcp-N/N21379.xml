            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER, PREACHING, &amp;c. OF THE REVEREND Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD, Impartially repreſented and ſupported, in a SERMON, preached in Charleſton, South-Carolina, March 26th, Anno Domini, 1740, by JOSEPH SMITH, V. D. M. With a Preface by the Rev. Dr. COLMAN, and Mr. COOPER, of Boſton, New-England.</head>

               <head>TO THE READER.</head>
               <p>THE following diſcourſe was incloſed to us by our dear brother, the worthy author of it; and we have read it with high pleaſure and ſatisfaction. The deſign is ſufficiently intimated in the title page. It is indeed a ſermon of an extraordinary nature. To give from the pulpit, the perſonal and miniſterial character of a living preacher is very unuſual, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, perhaps altogether new. But ſo is the occaſion—And the diſcourſe muſt be looked upon to be apologetical rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> encomiaſtic. The manifeſt deſign is to ſupport the cauſe by vindicating the man; not a private and party cauſe; but that of primitive piety, and Catholic Chriſtianity; the cauſe of Chriſt and truth, if the peculiar doctrines of the goſpel, the aſſerting and clearing whereof, was the glory of the Reformation, may be ſo called? A cauſe this, in which zeal is certainly a virtue.</p>
               <p>As to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, the perſon referred to, and named, he is the wonder of the age; and no
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028079_0005_0FD69344D19AC660"/>
man more employs the pens, and fills up the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of people, than he does at this day: none more admired and applauded by ſome, contemned and reproached by others. The common lot of the moſt excellent men the world has ever had to ſhew!</p>
               <p>While ſo many others are ſpeaking and publiſhing their ſentiments concerning him with all freedom, Mr. Smith thought himſelf not precluded. He hath had as much opportunity as moſt, to inform himſelf concerning Mr. Whitefield's doctrine, manner of life, purpoſe, faith, charity, long-ſuffering, patience, perſecutions, and afflictions which have come unto him: and what he has ſeen and heard, that declares he unto us: and we receive his teſtimony, becauſe we know him to be a gentleman of good ſenſe and ſtrict veracity; and alſo free from enthuſiaſtic im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, unleſs ſerious religion and experimental piety are ſo called, as we have melancholy occaſion to obſerve they often are. There appear to us plain marks of ſincerity and impartiality in the following account. And the ſame things have been reported to us by our Reverend brethren, of the like character, whom we know and correſpond with, in places where Mr. Whitefield hath viſited and preached in.</p>
               <p>And as to his thoughts reſpecting the views of providence in raiſing up men of this ſtamp and ſpirit in our day, he expreſſes them with great modeſty and caution, and we cannot but apprehend they are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced from ſcripture, reaſon, and obſervation.</p>
               <p>When God is about to carry on ſalvation-work with any remarkable ſucceſs, he will raiſe up ſuitable inſtruments to work by. He will form and ſpirit men for great and extraordinary undertakings when he has any great and extraordinary purpoſes to ſerve.</p>
               <p>Thus when God's time for the great and good work of building the ſecond temple was come, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028079_0006_0FD69345E2B669E0"/>
and others were animated to undertake it; and though they were men wondered at, for the warmth of their zeal and the boldneſs of their enterprize; that in the face of ſo many oppoſers and difficulties they ſhould undertake to rebuild the holy city and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet they were raiſed above all diſcouragements, and ſtood firm againſt all oppoſition, being fortified with a ſpecial promiſe of the Meſſiah, in whoſe ſtrength and by whoſe influence they ſhould be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully carried on in their work. <q>Hear now, O Joſhua the high-prieſt, Thou and thy fellows that ſit before thee; for they are men wondered at: for I will bring forth my ſervant the branch. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the ſtone that I have laid before Joſhua: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes. I will engrave the engraving thereof, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</q> Zech. ii. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>So when the goſpel-church was to be ſet up in the world, and the Gentile nations to be converted to the knowledge and faith of Jeſus, a dozen poor illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate fiſhermen were endued with power from on high; and ſent forth to open men's eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God. And in them was fulfilled that which is written, Pſalm viii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine enemies; that thou mighteſt ſtill the enemy and the avenger.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And when the church was overſpread with Popiſh darkneſs, ſuperſtition, and idolatry, and the Romiſh tyranny was at its very height<note n="*" place="bottom">In the 16th century.</note>, it pleaſed God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten ſome eccleſiaſtics gradually in the knowledge of his truth, and then animate and aſſiſt them to lay open the errors and corruptions of Popery, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028079_0007_0FD6934752C680D8"/>
to aſſert and maintain the pure truths of the goſpel. Of this number were Zuinglius in Switzerland, and Luther in Germany; names that will be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance in the records of the church.</p>
               <p>The reſolute oppoſition that was made againſt them, and the contempt that was poured upon them, inſtead of cooling, inflamed their courage. The further ſearch they made into the depth of thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that had overſpread the church, the more light ſtill broke in upon them. They found its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines poiſoned with hereſy, and its worſhip corrupted with ſuperſtition and idolatry; and Chriſtianity grown very like to Paganiſm. Under this conviction they loudly called upon all that had any concern for their ſouls to go out of Babylon, as they would not be partakers of her plagues. And multitudes of people were influenced by their preaching and writings, to renounce the Romiſh doctrines and ſuperſtition; and many of the princes of Europe were inclined to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and fall in with the Reformation.</p>
               <p>As for Luther in particular, he was a wondrous man, and the almighty power of God was eminently manifeſted in him. When he firſt appeared, <q>What could be expected from a poor friar, creeping out of a cloiſter? He was adviſed by his friends to get into his cell again, and to ply his prayers, and not venture upon ſo hazardous an undertaking, as to preach againſt the Pope, or attempt ſo impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a work as the reformation. But not by might, nor power but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</q>—This ſingle inconſiderable man was more than a match for the powers of Rome, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to produce one of the greateſt changes the world has ever had to marvel at.</p>
               <p>And when it pleaſes God to renew the face of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; when primitive Chriſtianity, and the power of

Conſidering the preſent ſtate of things in the Chriſtian world, how can we expect any great change for the better, but in a way that ſhall be extraordinary.</p>
               <p>And if there is any appearance of ſuch a work at any time, or in any place, ſurely we ſhould take care not to ſlight and undervalue it; much leſs ſhould we reproach and cenſure it, or thoſe who are uſed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in it, ſo far as it ſeems to be from heaven, and further it with our prayers, as thoſe who are waiting for the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>We would therefore beſpeak the prayers of the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, into whoſe hands theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers may come, both for our dear brother and the author of this diſcourſe; who is with great zeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for ſome important points of the faith once delivered unto the ſaints, againſt ſome who openly oppoſe them, and labouring to promote practical godlineſs, in the place where divine providence has appointed his preſent ſtation; that he may be aſſiſted

and ſucceeded in all his faithful ſervices for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's kingdom; and alſo for the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, that he may, (as he has well expreſſed himſelf in ſome of his letters to us) <q>be kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dependent on our dear Lord Jeſus;</q> be preſerved in his travels, ſtrengthened to his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon labours, and fortified againſt all oppoſition: that Satan, (who cannot but have a peculiar enmity at thoſe who ſo ſet themſelves againſt his kingdom) may never get advantage of him, to the blemiſh or hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the great and good work which we hope is begun and going on; that God will cauſe him always to triumph in Chriſt, while he makes manifeſt the favour of his knowledge by him in every place, and uſes him as an inſtrument to bring back many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſheep to the Shepherd and Biſhop of their ſouls; and very particularly that his purpoſed coming to us, may be with as full a bleſſing of the goſpel of Chriſt as other places have experienced, and much more abundant by the will and grace of our God!</p>

               <p>I. I ſhall give you my opinions of the doctrines he inſiſted upon among us.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak more generally, They were doctrines, I am of opinion agreeable to the dictates of reaſon; evidently founded upon ſcripture; exactly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent with the articles of the eſtabliſhment; of great uſe and neceſſity in forming the Chriſtian life; which I had early imbibed from the beſt writers and ſyſtems; from which I had never yet ſeen reaſon to recede, and which therefore you are witneſſes, I have not failed to introduce and inculcate, in the courſe of my miniſtry among you.</p>
               <p>To be more particular;</p>
               <p>One of the doctrines, which he has hardly paſſed over in ſilence in any ſingle diſcourſe, is that of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin. A truth ſo manifeſt in ſcripture, that I am almoſt of opinion, it is impoſſible any ſincere, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and unprejudiced inquirer ſhould miſs it: for it is written in ſun-beams that a man may run and read.</p>
               <p>By original ſin I mean nothing leſs than the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Adam's firſt ſin to all his poſterity by ordinary generation; which imputation is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultance of his being conſtituted to act for them in the extenſive capacity of a legal repreſentative; the conſequence of which is, that inherent corruption of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> into the world.—As to the point of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028079_0012_0FD69353AD57F0D0"/>
imputation, it is a doctrine, it muſt be confeſſed, of more intricacy; about which, it is therefore poſſible, a well meaning man may labour under ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, while perhaps he allows of the depravity of human nature. Though I muſt beg leave to expreſs my ſurpriſe, that any perſon of judgment ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this depravity, and not immediately diſcover its neceſſary connection with the imputation, and how impoſſible it is to ſecure the juſtice of God, without having recourſe to it: for certainly the corruption of human nature, ſo univerſal and inſeparable, is one of the greateſt puniſhments that could be inflicted upon the ſpecies; and that it is inflicted, appears from hence, that <hi>God made man at firſt upright.</hi> Now, if there be no previous imputation, to lay a legal foundation for this puniſhment, then God has inflicted an evident puniſhment upon a race of men, perfectly innocent, and which had neither ſinned perſonally, nor yet by imputation; and thus, while we imagine we honour the juſtice of God by renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imputation, we in fact pour the higheſt diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon that ſacred attribute—This, I fear, is the grand reaſon, why the adverſaries of original ſin la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo hard to explode the depravity of nature; for ſhould they once admit that, they are conſcious they muſt admit imputation too. I ſay, I fear this is the grand reaſon.—How elſe is it poſſible a man ſhould queſtion a truth, written in capitals upon the moral world? A truth, we feel in every power of our ſoul! what we read upon our own hearts; and is indeed ſtamped upon univerſal nature, within our horizon; and which the more righteous any man is, the more he feels and groans under.—We need not wonder then, our late incomparable preacher ſhould inſiſt upon original ſin, when we conſider, not only in what an inconteſtible manner he proved it, but of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028079_0013_0FD69354CBB5D550"/>
what vaſt importance it muſt be. For to give my opinion freely; I cannot think, I can ſee, how the Chriſtian ſcheme can be conſiſtent with itſelf, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with honour, without this baſis. I look upon it, not merely as a doctrine of the ſcriptures, the great fountain of truth, but a very fundamental one; from which, I hope, God will ſuffer none of you to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, by any ſophiſtry of the ſubtle diſputers of this world, or charms of language.</p>
               <p>But to proceed.—</p>
               <p>Another doctrine we have lately had in the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt language impreſſed upon us, is that Pauline one of juſtification by faith alone. And here you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how the preacher vindicated himſelf from all ſuſpicions of Antinomian error, and opening a door to licentious manners: for while on the one hand, he earneſtly contended for our juſtification as the free gift of God, by faith alone, in the blood of Chriſt, an article of faith delivered to the ſaints of old; ſo on the other hand, he took ſpecial care to guard againſt the licentious abuſe of it, and would not make void the law, when he aſſerted that good works were the neceſſary fruits and evidences of true faith; telling us plainly, and with the cleareſt diſtinction, that a man was juſtified theſe three ways; meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by Chriſt, inſtrumentally by faith alone, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively by good works. And believe me, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this is the true goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and the writings of the apoſtles. For when Abraham believed God, was not it (his faith) imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? And yet, was not Abraham our father juſtified by works, when he had offered Iſaac his ſon upon the altar! How ſhall we then reconcile this? Why very eaſily. The act of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> juſtified him through Chriſt, and the offering Iſaac juſtified that faith: the firſt in the ſight of God, the other in the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028079_0014_0FD6935A74863678"/>
ſight of man. In juſtification faith precedes, works follow after; for if works precede, or had any caſual influence into our juſtification, we might ſeem to have whereof to glory before God. But here, it is the free gift of God, and boaſting for ever excluded. God, when he juſtifies a man, never finds, but makes him holy; without any previous merit, of which there can be no ſhadow in an apoſtate creature. No; <hi>By grace ye are ſaved, through faith; and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> And, could I live the moſt exact life ever man lived; could I even excel the virtues of the pious preacher himſelf; could I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many good works as the ſaints in all ages collected together; I would not for ten thouſand worlds put my juſtification upon them: I would only conſider them, as bright and pleaſant evidences of the truth of my faith in Chriſt. Good works are valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things; God forbid we ſhould liſp a word againſt them, in their proper place; we plead for them, we preſs the practice of them, as incumbent upon all Chriſtians; but we cannot allow them any ſhare in our juſtification before God. They may prove we are juſtified; but they cannot juſtify us. No verily: <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but of his own mercy, God ſaveth us.</hi>—Hitherto then, our preacher is othodox in his doctrine, which both excludes licentiouſneſs, eſtabliſhes the law, and exalts free grace; the evident deſign and language of the goſpel, and which, I am of opinion, every miniſter of Chriſt ſhould earneſtly contend for: becauſe the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt firſt ſee himſelf naked, before he will come to Chriſt for his white raiment; the pure and fine linen, which is the righteouſneſs of the ſaints, and which I council you all to buy of him.</p>
               <p>Regeneration was another great doctrine, which the excellent man much inſiſted upon; hardly a ſingle
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028079_0015_0FD6935C4E2A9E10"/>
ſermon, but he mentioned it, ſometimes more than twice; and one, and perhaps the beſt of his diſcourſes was <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> upon this ſubject. Nor can any man be ſurpriſed, that a miniſter of the New Teſtament ſhould ſo heartily eſpouſe a principle, which our Lord himſelf began to ſpeak, and aſſerted as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Chriſtianity, indiſpenſibly requiſite to eternal life; and this with ſo much vehemency, and earneſt repetition. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again (from above) he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> He aſſures us, <hi>We muſt be born of water and of the Spirit.</hi> Our regeneration reſults in its neceſſity, from original ſin. They that are <hi>ſhapen in iniquity, and conceived in ſin,</hi> muſt be waſhed and cleanſed.—By which is not meant the mere forms and rites of baptiſm; not the waſhing away the filth of the fleſh, as the corrupt Phariſees might waſh their hands, and the outſide of the cup; but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, purged by the blood of Chriſt. For we can only be <hi>ſaved by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> the infuſion of a new life, a divine, heavenly and prolific principle. As we are by nature dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, God muſt quicken us by his Spirit, and through that we muſt <hi>mortify the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and crucify the fleſh with its luſts and affections.</hi> For until we know (until we feel the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of) the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, we have no part in him: we cannot enter into heaven; or if we ſhould, our firſt petition would be, to be diſchaged as ſoon as poſſible. Pleaſure is the reſult of harmony; the nature muſt agree with the object: there muſt be a great change upon the nature, to make us ſuſceptive of the pleaſures of God's preſence.—</p>
               <p>Cavillers and ſcoffers, I know, there are enough, in theſe laſt days againſt this doctrine. Some maſter

of Iſrael may aſk, <hi>How can theſe things be? Can a man when he is old enter a ſecond time into his mother's womb, and be born?</hi>—Who ever ſaid he could? Or what would it avail, if he ſhould? But I hope, there may be ſuch a thing as a ſpiritual birth, ſubſequent to the natural.—May we not be again begotten to a lively hope? May not God of his own will do it by his word and Spirit? And may we no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Are we not told, in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs language,—<hi>that which is born of the fleſh, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>hetoricated upon, can never adorn us in the ſight of God, nor qualify us for his redeeming love.</p>
               <p>True religion is an inward thing, a thing of the heart; it chiefly reſides there, and conſiſts in a right diſpoſition and ſanctified temper of the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and as we have been lately told, <hi>in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally introduces another doctrine, nearly allied to this, and which was very ſtrongly inſiſted on, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The impreſſions or (which was the preacher's own phraſe) inward feelings of the Spirit. And here you remember how he guarded againſt the invidious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of aſſuming the character of an apoſtle.</p>
               <p>He renounced all pretenſions to the extraordinary powers and ſigns of apoſtleſhip, gifts of healing, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with tongues, the faith of miracles; things pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the age of inſpiration, and extinct with them. He alſo allowed theſe feelings of the Spirit were not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028079_0017_0FD69364A0807AF8"/>
in every perſon, or at all times, in the ſame degree; and that though a full aſſurance were attainable, and what every one ſhould labour to attain, yet not of abſolute neceſſity to the being of a Chriſtian.—Only he aſſerted that we might feel the Spirit of God, in his ſanctifying and ſaving impreſſions, and witneſſing with our own ſpirits. And what is there in all this repugnant to reaſon! What is there in it, but what is perfectly agreeable to ſcripture! How can we be led by the Spirit, or have joy in the Holy Ghoſt, without ſome ſenſible perceptions of it?—Can I at any time feel my ſoul in ſacred raptures, burning with the love of God, and of Chriſt, and all my beſt paſſions alive? Can I feel a ſecret pleaſure in the word, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and communion of God? Can I <hi>taſte the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world to come?</hi> Can I feel the threatnings of God impreſſed upon my conſcience, or promiſes of paradiſe working upon my hopes! Can I groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of my corruptions, or exult in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpirit, I may ſometimes have, in a calm and retired hour, in the meditation of my pardon, and the contemplation of heaven and immortality? I ſay, Can I have all theſe things in me, and do I feel them upon my ſoul, and yet this doctrine of feeling the Spirit be burleſqued and ridiculed, in an age of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and of men who love to ſpeak evil of the things which they <hi>know not?</hi> Indeed a ſinful and adulterous generation may ſeek after a ſign. But what ſign can we give them of things that muſt be known by being felt? Or what ideas can I convey of light to the blind, and of harmony to the deaf?—Let God touch their hearts as he has done ours, and they ſhall feel what we feel; and what I would not but feel, for millions of worlds. But till then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in nature to repreſent it, in a full adequate light to them; and they may as well aſk for mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028079_0018_0FD69366F03B9860"/>
demonſtrations in a point of pure morality. This is a doctrine, I have been acquainted with theſe many years; it is not new or ſurpriſing to me; you have heard me preach it ſcores of times, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, clothed in other expreſſions, and the influences of the Spirit, the impreſſions of grace. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever derided by ſome, who ſet up and careſs a ſyſtem of rational religion, I hope to have always enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm enough to maintain that the Spirit of God may be felt.—To conclude this head, all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines now mentioned, are primitive, proteſtant, puritanic ones; which our good fathers, conformiſts and diſſenters, have filled their writings with: and as Dr. Watts has well obſerved, <q>They fill heaven apace, for God was with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet all that vaſt reverence, with which I heard theſe doctrines from the mouth of our famous preacher, could not win my applauſe or approbation of ſome few harſher epithets and expreſſions (you know what I mean) which dropt from his lips. Theſe in my opinion, may be pronounced failings; but ſuch as often attend a warm zeal for orthodoxy, in the points of the laſt importance; ariſe from a principle of conſcience, and are found interwoven with the brighteſt characters: and he that has none, let him caſt the firſt ſtone.</p>
               <p>II. I ſhall next give you my opinion of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his preaching.</p>
               <p>And here I need not ſay, nor can my pen deſcribe his action and geſture, in all their ſtrength and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies. He is certainly a finiſhed preacher, and a great maſter of pulpit oratory and elocution, while a noble negligence ran thro' his ſtyle. Yet his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were very extraordinary when we conſider how little they were premeditated, and how many of them he gave us, the little time he was with us.—
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028079_0019_0FD693684DECED18"/>
Many, I truſt, have felt, and will long feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his zeal and fire, the paſſion and flame of his expreſſions: which were ſuch, that I cannot think my public character of him<note n="†" place="bottom">South-Carolina Gazette, No. 107.</note>, in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the bounds of truth and ſtrict verity; only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that allowance for figures of ſpeech, which is always expected, upon extraordinary occaſions, and in the portraiture of great characters.</p>
               <p>He appeared to me, in all his diſcourſes, very deeply affected and impreſſed in his own heart. How did that burn and boil within him, when he ſpake of the things he had made, touching the King? How was his tongue like the pen of a ready writer? touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as with a coal from the altar! With what a flow of words, what a ready profuſion of language, did he ſpeak to us upon the great concerns of our ſouls? In what a flaming light did he ſet our eternity before us? how earneſtly did he preſs Chriſt upon us? How did he move our paſſions with the conſtraining love of ſuch a Redeemer? The awe, the ſilence, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſat upon the face of ſo great an audience, was an argument, how he could reign over all their powers. Many thought, <hi>He ſpake as never man ſpoke,</hi> before him. So charmed were people with his manner of addreſs, that they ſhut up their ſhops, forgot their ſecular buſineſs, and laid aſide their ſchemes for the world; and the oftener he preached, the keener edge he ſeemed to put upon their deſires of hearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> again!—How awfully, with what thunder and ſound did he diſcharge the artillery of Heaven upon us? And yet, how could he ſoften and melt even a ſoldier of Ulyſſes, with the love and mercy of God! How cloſe, ſtrong, and pungent were his applications to the conſcience; mingling light and heat, pointing the arrows of the Almighty at the hearts of ſinners,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028079_0020_0FD69369E1FA0F20"/>
while he poured in the balm upon the wounds of the contrite, and made broken bones rejoice? Eternal themes, the tremendous ſolemnities of our religion, were all alive upon his tongue! So methinks (if you will forgive the figure) ſaint Paul would look and ſpeak in a pulpit, and in ſome ſuch manner, I have been tempted to conceive of a ſeraph, were he ſent down to preach among us, and to tell us what things he had ſeen and heard above!—How bold and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous did he look? He was no flatterer, would not ſuffer men to ſettle upon their lees; did not prophecy ſmooth things nor ſow pillows. <hi>He taught the way of God in truth, and regarded not the perſon of men.</hi> The politeſt, the moſt modiſh of our vices he ſtruck at, the moſt faſhionable entertainments; regardleſs of every one's preſence, but his in whoſe name he ſpake, with this authority—He delivered his own ſoul, very ſharply rebuked our balls and midnight aſſemblies, that bane of all that is ſerious and religious: and I dare warrant, if none would go to theſe diverſions, till they have anſwered the ſolemn queſtions he put to their conſciences, our theatre would ſoon ſink and periſh.</p>
               <p>You may be ſure I was not diſpleaſed with this part of his conduct, when I have ſo often myſelf mentioned theſe things, as of pernicious tendency to our morals, religion, and proſperity. And who can blame a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's freedom and zeal; what hard meaſures, what cruel treatment would it be to cenſure our plainneſs of ſpeech; when our very commiſſion requires us to lift up our voice like a trumpet, to cry aloud, and not ſpare, to ſhew people their tranſgreſſions; and when the blood of your ſouls, the moſt inſupportable thing in the world, muſt be required at our hands, if we be afraid to warn! I am ſure, would people conſider this, and that we cannot poſſibly propoſe any
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028079_0021_0FD6936B4CBF2F00"/>
temporal advantage to ourſelves, by ſtriking at the right eye, they would applaud, and not cenſure our warmth and freedom. I muſt tell you, over and over again, ſuch things are dangerous to your ſouls; this cannot conſiſt with your Chriſtian profeſſion and baptiſm; they tend to devour the ſeeds and weaken all the young ſprings of virtue, and to craze the moſt pious impreſſions.</p>
               <p>But if the voice of miniſters cannot be heard, at leaſt let the circumſtances of our country, and the louder roarings of providence, awe and reſtrain us; for ſure I am it is now a time to mourn, and not to dance: and the ſcripture ſeverely threatens a people, that diſregarded the operations of God's hands.</p>
               <p>III. I now proceed to ſhew my opinion of our preacher, in his <hi>perſonal character</hi> and <hi>behaviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I may take courage, and challenge his worſt enemies to lay any thing to the charge of his morals, or to arraign his ſincerity, ſo viſible in his whole deportment.</p>
               <p>While he preaches up faith alone, in our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, yet he is careful to maintain good works, and denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly. Theſe things the grace of God teacheth us; and how much of this doctrine has he tranſcribed into his life? How rich has he been in all good works? What an eminent pattern of piety towards God? How holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in all converſation and godlineſs? How ſeaſoned, how much to the uſe of edifying, all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes? How naturally does he turn them to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? How much is he given to meditation himſelf, and how does he labour to excite it in others?</p>
               <p>It is indiſputable with me that he affects no party religion, nor ſets himſelf at the head of any: had this been his aim, no man living has had fairer occaſions
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028079_0022_0FD6933743A048A0"/>
offered; but he abhors the ſpirit, he endeavours to ſuppreſs it. He is always careful to time his Sabbath diſcourſes, ſo as not to interfere with the ſtated hours of worſhip, in that church, of which he is a profeſſed member, and miniſter, and in the opinion of many people a very bright ornament; becauſe, as he told us, he would not tempt away hearers from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and reſpective paſtors. And is not this a noble and generous, a catholic and Chriſtian ſpirit! He is not bigotted to the modalities and leſſer rites and forms of religion, while zealous enough and very warm and jealous in all its eſſentials, eſpecially in the divine honours and godhead of his Saviour. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes love to good men of every denomination, and told us, that the <hi>kingdom of heaven conſiſts not of meats and drinks.</hi> He appears to me a man full of the Holy Ghoſt and of faith. Though his prayers, in this pulpit were all extempore, yet how copious, how ardent, with what compaſs of thought? The ſpirit of grace and ſupplication ſeemed to be poured out upon him in plenty, and to kindle and animate his devotions. He prays in public, with that ſpirit, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and fluency which could only be expected from a man, who was no ſtranger to the ſacred duty in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.—He lives much by faith, and above the world: deſpiſes preferments and riches; of which laſt, I am told, he has had great offers in Europe—His heart ſeems ſet upon doing good. He goes about his great Maſter's work with diligence and application; and with ſuch cheerfulneſs, as would make one in love with a life of religion, which has ſo many inward ſprings of the beſt comforts, and is not that gloomy, melancholy thing, which prejudice and imagination make it. He is proof againſt reproach and invective. When he is reviled, revileth not again, but prays heartily for all his enemies, and that ſuch as oppoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028079_0023_0FD628A779ABCB40"/>
the truth, may be converted to it. He profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to lay down his life for Chriſt, and to ſpend and be ſpent in the ſervice of ſouls.—Such a man has all imaginable claim to our higheſt love and honour. I freely own he has taken my heart, and I feel his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.—God ſeems to be with him of a truth; has ſet his ſeal upon him: his rod has budded, and he has many to whom he can ſay, <hi>Ye are my epiſtle.</hi> Wherever he has preached he has been thronged, and many have come to him pricked in their hearts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved!</hi> He has put a new face upon religion, my letters inform me, in ſome populous cities and parts of our neighbouring conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; given new life to miniſters and people; made ſermons, once a drug, a vendible commodity among them; evening and weekly lectures are ſet up, and always crowded with perſons of different perſuaſions; while he has put a damp upon their polite diverſions, which always dwindle as Chriſtianity revives. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no man could do theſe things, I had almoſt ſaid, theſe miracles, unleſs God were with him, who gives the increaſe, <hi>even when Paul plants, and Apollos waters.</hi> Had eccleſiaſtic preferments been his idol, fame and reputation his motive, as he has taken a prepoſterous way to acqiure them, ſo I can never ſuffer myſelf to think God would have owned him ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or given him ſo many ſeals of his miniſtry. Our Saviour himſelf makes good fruits the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of good miniſters. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> Either the fruits and ſucceſs of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the deſign and tendency of their doctrines, or the fruits of the Spirit in their lives. And which of theſe have been wanting in this extraordinary man? Who can object againſt the tendency of his doctrines? And for ſucceſs, his enemies know it to their own confuſion. And who can ſay his life is unfruitful, or
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028079_0024_0FD6931C1D62D3C0"/>
that he has appeared like an immoral man? He ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to all their due. While zealous for the things of God, he is a friend to Caeſar; a loyal ſubject to King George, heartily prays for him and his royal houſe; "<hi>May it abide before God!</hi>" A prayer, to which, I doubt not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are all ready to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed with our character of the preacher, whom hath he wronged or defrauded? <hi>Whoſe ox or whoſe aſs hath he taken?</hi> Say, if any man hath found ought in his hands: ſo far from it, that he ſeems to live, not by bread alone, but by the word and promiſe of God; without taking thought for the morrow, <hi>what he ſhall eat, or drink, or put on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for charity, as it conſiſts in compaſſion and acts of beneficence, we have few men like minded. In this grand circle of practical religion, he ſeems to be a ſecond Job, as well as for patience; and deſerves a good report of all men, and of the truth itſelf. Had he been under any criminal influence of a mercenary, covetous temper, had he collected money for himſelf, in his journeying often, and itinerant preachings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of doing it for the poor, as he was ſlanderouſly reported, he had certainly a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enrich himſelf. But we have ſeen a plain fact cannot be denied, that he caſt all into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and ſerves the table of the poor with it.—Strol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vagabond orphans, poor and helpleſs, without father, without mother, without purſe, and without friend, he ſeeks out, picks up, and adopts into his family: He is now building accommodations, and laying the beſt foundation for their ſupport and religious inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any viſible fund; encouraged to go on in faith, from the ſhining example of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in Germany, who began a like pious work with almoſt nothing; and raiſed it to ſuch perfection, as is the wonder and aſtoniſhment of all that hear it. This
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028079_0025_0FD6931D52DFF478"/>
is a ſacrifice well-pleaſing to God: The loins of the poor will bleſs him, <hi>the bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh, will come upon him!</hi>—He hath diſperſed abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteouſneſs ought to endure, and be celebrated among us. After this, let none call him an uncharitable man: for what brighter evidence of pure religion than this, to viſit the fatherleſs in their affliction.</p>

Irreligion has been ruſhing in, even upon the Proteſtant world like a flood: the deareſt and moſt obvious doctrines of the Bible have fallen into low contempt; the principles and ſyſtems of our good and pious fathers have been more and more exploded. And now, behold! God ſeems to have revived the ancient ſpirit and doctrines. He is raiſing up our young men, with zeal and courage to ſtem the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

            <p>THE following SERMONS, I think I may ſay, were given me by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and according to my preſent light, are agreeable to the form of ſound words delivered to us in the lively oracles of God. They contain the ſum and ſubſtance, I will not ſay word for word, of what was delivered from the pulpit; for as I had no occaſion in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, Scotland, and England, to preach upon the ſame ſubjects, I was obliged, according to the freedom and aſſiſtance

I had no leiſure or freedom to commit any of them to writing, but during my laſt voyage from America to England; nor do I expect to find leiſure to write down any freſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, till it ſhall pleaſe God that I embark again.

            <p>WHOEVER is acquainted with the nature of mankind in general, or the propenſity of his own heart in particular, muſt acknowledge, that ſelf-righteouſneſs is the laſt idol that is rooted out of the heart.—Being once born under a covenant of works, it is natural for us all to have recourſe to a covenant of works for our everlaſting ſalvation. And we have contracted ſuch a deviliſh pride by our fall from God, that we would, if not wholly, yet in part at leaſt, glory in being the cauſe of our own ſalvation. We cry out againſt Popery, and that very juſtly; but we are all papiſts, at leaſt I am ſure we are all Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by nature; and therefore, no wonder ſo many natural men embrace that ſcheme. It is true, we diſclaim the doctrine of merit, are aſhamed directly to ſay we deſerve any good at the hands of God; therefore as the apoſtle excellently well obſerves, we go about, we fetch a circuit, to eſtabliſh a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own, and, like the phariſees of old, will not wholly ſubmit to that righteouſneſs, which is of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>This is the ſoreſt, though alas! the moſt common
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028079_0031_0FD6932F6CCC52A0"/>
evil that was ever yet ſeen under the ſun. An evil, that in any age, eſpecially in theſe dregs of time wherein we live, cannot ſufficiently be inveighed againſt.—For as it is with the people, ſo it is with the prieſts; and it is to be feared, even in thoſe places where once the truth, as it is in Jeſus, was eminently preached, many miniſters are ſo ſadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from their pious anceſtors, that the doctrines of grace, eſpecially the perſonal, all-ſufficient righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus, is but too ſeldom, too ſlightly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Hence the love of many waxeth cold; and I have often thought, was it poſſible, that this ſingle conſideration would be ſufficient to raiſe our venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forefathers again from their graves; who would thunder in their ears their fatal error.</p>
            <p>The righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is one of thoſe great myſteries which the angels deſire to <hi>look into,</hi> and ſeems to be one of the firſt leſſons that God taught men after the fall. For what were the coats that God made to put on our firſt parents, but types of the application of the merits or righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to believer's hearts? We are told, that thoſe coats were made of ſki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of beaſts, and as beaſts were not then food for men, we may fairly infer, that thoſe beaſts were ſlai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in ſacrifice, in commemoration of the great ſacrifice Jeſus Chriſt thereafter to be offered. And the ſkins of thoſe beaſts thus ſlain, being put on Adam and Eve, they were thereby taught how their nakedneſs was to be covered with the righteouſneſs of the Lamb of God.</p>
            <p>This is it which is meant, when we are told Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed on the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs. In ſhort, this is it of which both the law and all the prophets have ſpoken, eſpecially Jeremiah in the words of the text—<hi>The Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If ſo, if there were no other text in the Bible to prove the divinity of Chriſt, that is ſufficient. For if the word <hi>Lord</hi> may properly belong to Jeſus Chriſt, he muſt be God.

thoſe morning-ſtars, and worſhip him as truly God.—For otherwiſe you are as much idolaters, as thoſe that worſhip the Virgin Mary. And as for you Socinians, who ſay Chriſt was a mere man, and yet profeſs that he was your Saviour, according to your own principles, you are accurſed. For, if Chriſt be a mere man, then he is only an arm of fleſh—And it is written, <hi>Curſed is he that truſteth on an arm of fleſh.</hi>—But I would hope there are no ſuch monſters here. At leaſt, that after theſe conſiderations, they would be aſhamed of broaching ſuch monſtrous abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities any more.—For it is plain, that by the word Lord, we are to underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who here takes to himſelf the title of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and therefore muſt be very God, of very God, or, as the apoſtle devoutly expreſſes it, God <hi>bleſſed for ever more.</hi>

            <p>II. How the Lord is to be <hi>man's righteouſneſs</hi> comes next to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>And that is, in one word, by <hi>imputation.</hi>—For it pleaſed God, after he had made all things <hi>by the word of his power,</hi> to create man after his own image. And ſo infinite was the condeſcenſion of the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, that although he might have inſiſted on the everlaſting obedience of him and his poſterity, yet he was pleaſed to oblige himſelf, by a covenant or agreement made with his own creautures, upon condition of an unſinning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to give them immortality and eternal life.—For when it is ſaid, <hi>the day thou enteſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> we may fairly infer, ſo long as he continued obedient, and did not eat thereof, he ſhould ſurely live.—The 3d of Geneſis gives us a full, but mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account, how our firſt parents broke this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and thereby ſtood in need of a better righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than their own, in order to procure their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acceptance with God—For what muſt they
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028079_0034_0FD628A5CE38D6B0"/>
do? They were as much under a covenant of works as ever. And, though after their diſobedience they were without ſtrength, yet they were obliged not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do, but continue to do all things, and that too in the moſt perfect manner which the Lord had required of them.—And not only ſo, but to make ſatisfaction to God's infinitely offended juſtice, for the breach they had already been guilty of—Here then opens the amazing ſcene of divine philanthropy—I mean, God's love to man—For behold, what man could not do, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of his Father's love, undertakes to do for him. And that God might be juſt in juſtifying the ungodly, though he was in the form of God, and therefore thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet he took upon him the form of a ſervant, even human nature—In that nature he obeyed, and thereby fulfilled the whole moral l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and being God and man, in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wrought out a full, perfect, and ſufficient righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for all to whom it was to be imputed.</p>
            <p>Here then we ſee the meaning of the word <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> It implies the active, as well as paſſive obedience of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We generally, when talking of the merits of Chriſt, only mention the latter, <hi>viz.</hi>—his death; whereas the former, <hi>viz.</hi> his life and active obedience, is equally neceſſary. Chriſt is not ſuch a Saviour as becomes us, unleſs we join both together.—Chriſt not only died, but lived; not only ſuffered, but obeyed, for or inſtead of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And both theſe jointly make up that complete righteouſneſs which is to be imputed to us, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of our firſt parents was made ours by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:028079_0035_0FD69370F5ED86D8"/>
In this ſenſe, and no other, are we to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that parallel which St. Paul draws in the 5th of the Romans, between the firſt and ſecond Adam. This is what he elſewhere terms our <hi>being made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> This is the ſenſe wherein the prophet would have us to underſtand the words of the text; therefore Jer. xxxiii. verſe 16. <hi>She i. e.</hi> the church itſelf ſhall be called (having this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to her) the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>—A paſſage, I think, worthy of the profoundeſt medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the ſons and daughters of Abraham.</p>
            <p>Many are the objections which the proud hearts of fallen men are continually urging againſt this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, this divine, this ſoul ſaving doctrine. I come now, in the third place, to anſwer ſome few of thoſe which I think the moſt conſiderable.</p>
            <p>And firſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſay, becauſe they would appear friends to morality, <q>That the doctrine of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs is deſtructive of good works, and leads to licentiouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And who pray are the perſons, that generally urge this objection? Are they men full of faith, and men really concerned for good works? No, whatever few exceptions there may be, if there be any at all, it is notorious, they are generally men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. The beſt title I can give them is, that of profane moraliſts or moraliſts falſely ſo called. For I appeal to the experience of the preſent, as well as paſt ages, if iniquity did and does not moſt abound where the doctrine of Chriſt's whole perſonal righteouſneſs is moſt cried down, and moſt ſeldom mentioned,—Arminian being antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian principles, always did and always will lead to antichriſtian practices. And never was there a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation brought about in the church but by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs.—
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028079_0036_0FD6937463936818"/>
This, as that man of God Luther calls it, is <hi>Articulus ſtantis aut cadentis Eccleſiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the article by which the church ſtands or falls.—And though the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this doctrine are generally branded by thoſe on the other ſide with the opprobious names of antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, deceivers, and what not; yet I believe, if the truth of the doctrine on both ſides was to be judged of by the lives of the preachers and profeſſors of it, thoſe on our ſide the queſtion would have the advantage every way.</p>
            <p>It is true, this, as well as every other doctrine of grace may be abuſed. And perhaps the unchriſtian walk of ſome, who have talked of Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs, juſtification by faith, and the like, and yet never felt it imputed to their own ſouls, has given the enemies of the Lord thus cauſe to blaſpheme. But this is a very unſafe, as well as very unfair way of arguing—The only queſtion ſhould be, Whether or not this doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs does in itſelf cut off the occaſion of good works, or lead to licentiouſneſs? No, in no wiſe. It excludes works indeed from being any cauſe of our juſtification in the ſight of God.—But it requires good works as a proof of our having this righteouſneſs imputed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us, and as a declarative evidence of our juſtification in the ſight of men. And then how can the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs be a doctrine leading to licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>It is all calumny.—St. Paul introduces an infidel making this objection in his epiſtle to the Romans—And none but infidels, that never felt the power of Chriſt's reſurrection upon their ſouls, will urge it over again—And therefore, notwithſtanding this objection, with the prophet in the text, we may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Satan, (and no wonder that his ſervants imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028079_0037_0FD693779A6537A8"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) often <hi>transforms himſelf into an angel of light.</hi> And therefore (ſuch perverſe things will infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Arminianiſm make men ſpeak) in order to dreſs their objections in the beſt colours, ſome urge, <q>that our Saviour preached no ſuch doctrine—that in his ſermon upon the mount, he mentions only morality.</q> and conſequently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs falls wholly to the ground.</p>
            <p>But ſurely the men who urge this objection, either never read, or never underſtood our bleſſed Lord's diſcourſe, wherein the doctrine of an imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſo plainly taught, that he that runs, if he has eyes that ſee, may read.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Lord does recommend morality and good works (as all faithful miniſters will do) and clears the moral law from the many corrupt gloſſes put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by the letter-learned Phariſees—But then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to this, it is remarkable, he talks of inward piety, ſuch as poverty of ſpirit, meekneſs, holy mourning, purity of heart,—eſpecially hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting after righteouſneſs, and then recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends good works, as an evidence of our having his righteouſneſs imputed to us, and theſe graces and divine tempers wrought in our hearts—<q>Let your light, (that is, the divine light I before have been mentioning) ſhine before men, in a holy life, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorify your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven.</q>—And then immediately adds, <q>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the <hi>moral law</hi>—I came not to deſtroy, to take away the force of it as a rule of life, but to fulfil, to obey it in its whole latitude, and give the complete ſenſe of it.</q>—And then he goes on to ſhew, how exceeding broad the moral law is. So that our Lord, inſtead of diſannulling an imputed righteouſneſs in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon the mount, not only confirms it, but alſo
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028079_0038_0FD69378E20CBC60"/>
anſwers the foregoing objection urged againſt it, by making good works a proof and evidence of its being imputed to our ſouls—He therefore that has ears to hear, let him hear what the prophet ſays in the words of the text—<hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Satan not only quoted ſcripture, but alſo backed one temptation with it after another, when he attacked Chriſt's perſon in the wilderneſs; ſo his children generally take the ſame method in treating his doctrine. And therefore they urge another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs from the example of the young man in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>We may ſtate it thus:—<q>The evangeliſt, St. Mark, ſay they, chap. x. mentions a young man that came to Chriſt, running and aſking him what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life? Chriſt, ſay they, referred him to the commandments, to know what he muſt do to inherit eternal life. It is plain therefore, works were to be partly, at leaſt, the cauſe of his juſtification: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs is unſcriptural.</q>—This is the objection in all its full ſtrength; and little ſtrength in all its fulneſs.—For, was I to prove the neceſſity of an imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I ſcarce know how I could bring a better inſtance to make it good.</p>
            <p>Let us take a more intimate view of this young man, and our Lord's behaviour towards him, Mark x. 17. the evangeliſt tells us, <q>That when Chriſt was gone forth into the way, there came one run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (it ſhould ſeem it was ſome nobleman, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity indeed, to ſee ſuch a one running to Chriſt!) and not only ſo, but he kneeled to him (tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many of his rank now ſcarce know the time when they kneeled to Chriſt) and <hi>aſked him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Good maſter, what ſhall I do that I may inherit
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028079_0039_0FD6937AAEB82CB0"/>
eternal life?</hi>
               </q>—Then Jeſus, to ſee whether or not he believed him to be what he really was, truly and properly God, ſaid unto him; <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</hi>—And that he might directly anſwer his queſtion; ſays he, <hi>Thou knoweſt the commandments: Do not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Do not bear falſe witneſs, Defraud not, Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi> This, I ſay, was a direct anſwer to his queſtion; namely, that eternal life was not to be attained by his doings.—For our Lord, by referring him to the commandments, did not (as the objectors inſinuate) in the leaſt hint, that his moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity would recommend him to the favour and mercy of God.—But he intended thereby to make the law his ſchoolmaſter to bring him to himſelf; that the young man, ſeeing how he had broken every one of theſe commandments, might thereby be convinced of the inſufficiency of his own, and conſequently of the abſolute neceſſity of looking out for a better righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whereon he might depend for eternal life.</p>
            <p>This was what our Lord deſigned.—The young man being ſelf-righteous, and willing to juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaid, <hi>All theſe have I obſerved from my youth</hi>—But had he known himſelf, he would have confeſſed, <hi>All theſe have I broken from my youth.</hi>—For ſuppoſing he had not actually committed adultery, had he never luſted after a woman in his heart? What, if he had not really killed another; had he never been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry without a cauſe, or ſpoken unadviſedly with his lips? If ſo, by breaking one of the leaſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the leaſt degree, he became liable to the curſe of God: For, <hi>curſed is he,</hi> (ſaith the law) <hi>that continueth not to do all things that are written in this book.</hi>—And therefore, as I obſerved before, our Lord was ſo far from ſpeaking againſt, that he treated the young man in that manner on purpoſe to convince him of the neceſſity of an imputed righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:028079_0040_0FD6937BDDB11300"/>
But perhaps they will reply, it is ſaid, <hi>Jeſus behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, loved him.</hi> And what then? This he might do with a human love, and at the ſame time this young man have no intereſt in his blood.—Thus Chriſt is ſaid to wonder,—to weep over Jeruſalem, and ſay—<hi>Oh that thou hadſt</hi> KNOWN, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſuch like paſſages are to be referred only to his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And there is a great deal of difference between the love wherewith Chriſt loved this young man, and that wherewith he loved Mary, Lazarus, and their ſiſter Martha.—To illuſtrate this by a compariſon.—A miniſter of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing many amiable diſpoſitions, ſuch as a readineſs to hear the word, a decent behaviour at public worſhip, a life outwardly ſpotleſs in many, cannot but ſo far love them. But then there is much difference betwixt that love which a miniſter feels for ſuch, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, that union and ſympathy of ſoul, which he feels for thoſe that he is ſatisfied are really born again of God.—Apply this to our Lord's caſe, as a ſaint illuſtration of it—Conſider what has been ſaid upon the young man's caſe in general, and then, if before you were fond of this objection, inſtead of triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like him, you will go ſorrowful away.—Our Saviour's reply to him more and more convinces us of the truth of the prophet's aſſertion in the text, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a fourth and grand objection yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and that is taken from the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, <q>where our Lord is deſcribed, as reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people with eternal life, becauſe they fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and ſuch like.—Their works therefore were a cauſe of their juſtification; conſequently, the doctrine of imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not agreeable to ſcripture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, I confeſs, is the moſt plauſible objection that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028079_0041_0FD6937D538FB0C0"/>
is brought againſt the doctrine inſiſted on from the text. And in order that we may anſwer it in as clear and as brief a manner as may be, we confeſs, with the article of the church of England, <q>That albeit good works do not juſtify us, yet they will follow after juſtification, as fruits of it; and tho' they can claim no reward in themſelves, yet foraſmuch as they ſpring from faith in Chriſt, and a renewed ſoul, they ſhall receive a reward <hi>of grace,</hi> though not <hi>of debt;</hi> and conſequently, the more we abound in ſuch good works, the greater will be our reward when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Take theſe conſiderations, along with us, and they will help us much to anſwer the objection now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.—For thus St. Matthew—<hi>Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world—For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink. I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in. Naked, and ye clothed me. I was ſick, and ye viſited me. I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> 
               <q>I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reward you, becauſe you have done theſe things out of love to me, and hereby have evidenced yourſelves to be my true diſciples.</q>—And that the people did not depend on theſe good actions for their juſtification in the ſight of God is evident. <hi>For when ſaw we thee an hungered,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and fed thee? Or thirſty, and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and cloathed thee? Or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon and came unto thee?</hi>—Language and queſtions quite improper for perſons relying on their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for acceptance and acquittance in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>But then they reply againſt this.—In the latter part
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028079_0042_0FD6937ECF8799E8"/>
of the chapter, ſay they, it is plain that Jeſus Chriſt rejects and damns the others for not doing theſe things. And therefore, if he damns thoſe for not doing, he ſave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe for doing; and conſequently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs is good for nothing.</p>
            <p>But that is no conſequence at all—For God may juſtly damn any man for omitting the leaſt duty of the moral law, and yet in himſelf is not obliged to give any one any reward, ſuppoſing he has done all that he can. We are unprofitable ſervants, we have done not near ſo much as it was our duty to do, muſt be the language of the moſt holy ſouls living; and therefore from or in ourſelves, cannot be juſtified in the ſight of God—This was the frame of the devout ſouls juſt now referred to—Senſible of this, they were ſo far from depending on their works for juſtification in the ſight of God, that they were filled, as it were with a holy bluſhing, to think our Lord ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to mention, much more to reward them for their poor works of faith and labours of love. I am perſuaded their hearts would riſe with a holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt thoſe who urge this paſſage as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the aſſertion of the prophet in the words of the text, that the <hi>Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I think we have fairly anſwered theſe grand objections, which are generally urged againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of an imputed righteouſneſs.—Was I to ſtop here, I think I might ſay, we are made more than conquerors, through him that loved us—But there is a way of arguing which I have always admired, becauſe I have thought always very convincing, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing the abſurdities that will follow from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any particular propoſition in diſpute.</p>
            <p>IV. This is the next thing that was propoſed. <q>And never did greater or more abſurdities flow
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028079_0043_0FD693812A3DBC68"/>
from the denying any doctrine, than will flow from denying the doctrine of Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, if we deny this doctrine, we turn the truth. I mean the word of God, as much as we can into a lie, and utterly ſubvert all thoſe places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſay, <hi>That we are ſaved by grace; that it is not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>—That ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is God's free gift—and that, <hi>He that glorieth, muſt glory only in the Lord.</hi> For if the whole perſonal righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt be not the ſole cauſe of my acceptance with God, if any work done by or foreſeen in me, was in the leaſt to be joined with it, or looked upon by God as an inducing impulſive cauſe of acquitting my ſoul from guilt, then I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what whereof I may glory in myſelf. Now boaſting is excluded in the great work of our redemption. But that cannot be, if we are enemies to the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs.—It would be endleſs to enumerate how many texts of ſcripture muſt be falſe, if this doctrine be not true. Let it ſuffice to affirm in the general, that if we deny an imputed righteouſneſs, we may as well deny a divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all at once.—For it is the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end of the book of God.—We muſt either diſbelieve that, or believe what the prophet hath ſpoken in the text, <hi>That the Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther.—I obſerved at the beginning of this diſcourſe, that we are all Arminians and Papiſts by nature;—for, as one obſerves, Arminianiſm is the back way to Popery. And here I venture further to affirm, <q>That if we deny the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs, whatever we may ſtyle ourſelves, we are really Papiſts in our hearts, and deſerve no other title from men.</q>
            </p>

Sirs, What think you?—Suppoſe I was to come and tell you, that you muſt intercede with ſaints, for them to intercede with God for you,—would you not then ſay, I was juſtly reputed a Popiſh miſſionary by ſome, and deſervedly thruſt out of the ſynagogues by others?—I ſuppoſe you would. And why? Becauſe you would ſay, the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt was ſufficient of itſelf, without the interceſſion of ſaints; and that it was blaſphemous to join theirs with his, as though it was not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I went a little more round about, and told you, that the death of Chriſt was not ſufficient, without our death being added to it; that you muſt die as well as Chriſt, join your death with his, and then it would be ſufficient.—Might you not then, with a holy indignation, throw duſt in the air, and juſtly call me a ſetter forth of ſtrange doctrines? And now then, if it be not only abſurd, but blaſphemous, to join the interceſſion of ſaints with the interceſſion of Chriſt, as though his interceſſion was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; or our death with the death of Chriſt, as though his death was not ſufficient; judge ye, if it be not equally abſurd, equally blaſphemous, to join our obedience, either wholly or in part with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, as if that was not ſufficient. And if ſo, what abſurdities will follow the denying that the Lord, both as to his active and paſſive obedience, is our righteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>One more abſurdity I ſhall mention, that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the denying this doctrine, and I have done.</p>
            <p>I remember a ſtory of a certain prelate, who, after many arguments in vain urged to convince the Earl of Rocheſter of the inviſible realities of another world, took his leave of his lordſhip with ſome ſuch words as theſe:—<q>Well, my lord, ſays he, if there be no hell, I am ſafe;—but, if there ſhould be ſuch a thing,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028079_0045_0FD69388F4AD0410"/>
my lord, as hell, what will become of you?</q> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. that oppoſe the doctrine now inſiſted on. If there be no ſuch thing as the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs, thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hold it, and bring forth fruit unto holineſs, are ſafe. But if there be ſuch a thing, (as there certainly is) what will become of you that deny it? It is no difficult matter to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.—Your portion muſt be in the lake of fire and brimeſtone for ever and ever; ſince you will rely upon your works, by your works you ſhall be judged.—They ſhall be weighed in the balance of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.—They will be found wanting.—By your works therefore ſhall you be condemned; and you, being out of Chriſt, ſhall find God to your poor wretched ſouls a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>The great Stoddard of Northampton in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, has therefore well intitled a book which he wrote (and which I would take this opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend) "The ſafety of appearing in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt."—For why ſhould I lean upon a broken reed, when I can have the rock of ages to ſtand upon, that never can be moved?</p>
            <p>And now before I come to a more particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, give me leave, in the apoſtle's language tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly to cry out, Where is the ſcribe? where the diſputer? where is the reaſoning infidel of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Can any thing appear more reaſonable, even according to your own way of arguing, than the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine here laid down? Have you not felt a convincing power go along with the word? Why then will you not believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he may become the Lord your righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But it is time for me to come a little cloſer to your conſciences.</p>
            <p>Brethren, though ſome may be offended at this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and may account at fooliſhneſs; yet to many of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028079_0046_0FD6938A0E429E98"/>
you, I doubt not but it is precious, it being agreeable to the form of ſound words, which from your infancy has been delivered to you: and coming from a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you would leaſt have expected, may be received with more pleaſure and ſatisfaction. But give me leave to aſk you one queſtion, Can you ſay, the Lord our righteouſneſs?—I ſay, the Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For entertaining this doctrine in your heads, without receiving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſavingly by a lively faith into your hearts, will but increaſe your damnation.—As I have often told you, ſo I tell you again, an unapplied Chriſt, is no Chriſt at all. Can you then with believing Thomas, cry out, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> Is Chriſt your ſanctification, as well as your outward righteouſneſs? For the word righteouſneſs in the text, not only implies Chriſt's perſonal righteouſneſs imputed to us, but alſo holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart wrought in us.—Theſe two God hath joined together—He never did, He never does, He never will put them aſunder.—If you are juſtified by the BLOOD, you are alſo ſanctified by the Spirit of the Lord. Can you then in this ſenſe ſay, the Lord our righteouſneſs? Were you never made to abhor yourſelves for your actual and original ſins, and to loathe your own righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (or as the prophet beautifully expreſſes it, your righteouſneſſes) as filthy rags? Were you never made to ſee and admire the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and excited by the ſpirit of God to hunger and thirſt after it? Could you ever ſay, my ſoul is athirſt for Chriſt, yea, even for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? Oh, when ſhall I come to appear before the preſence of my God in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt! Oh, nothing but Chriſt! nothing but Chriſt? Give me Chriſt, O God, and I am ſatisfied! My ſoul ſhall praiſe thee for ever. Was this, I ſay, ever the language of your hearts?—And
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028079_0047_0FD6938B9F3647B8"/>
after theſe inward conflicts, were you ever enabled to reach out the arm of faith, and embrace the bleſſed Jeſus in your ſouls, ſo that you could ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his?</hi> If ſo, fear not, whoever you are. Hail, all hail, you happy ſouls! The Lord, the Lord Chriſt, the everlaſting God is your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.—Chriſt has juſtified you: who is he that condemneth you? Chriſt has died for you, nay rather is riſen again, and ever liveth to make interceſſion for you.—Being now juſtified by his grace, you have peace with God, and ſhall, ere long, be with Jeſus in glory, reaping everlaſting and unſpeakable redemption both in body and ſoul.—For there is no condemnation to thoſe that are really in Chriſt Jeſus. Whether Paul or Apollos, or life or death, all is yours, if you are Chriſt's for Chriſt is God's—Oh, my brethren, my heart is enlarged towards you!—Oh, think on the love of Chriſt in dying for you!—If the Lord be your righteouſneſs, let the righteouſneſs of your Lord be continually in your mouth. Talk of, oh talk of and recommend the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, when you lie down, and when you riſe up, at your going out, and coming in!—Think of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the gift, as well as of the giver!—Shew to all the world in whom you have believed!

Let that love conſtrain you to obedience! Having much forgiven, love much. Be always aſking, what ſhall I do to expreſs my gratitude to the Lord, for giving me his righteouſneſs? Let

            <p>Alas, my heart almoſt bleeds! What a multitude of precious ſouls are now before me!

Oh, that the Lord may be your righteouſneſs!—For whether would you flee, if death ſhould find you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?—Indeed there is no hiding yourſelves from his preſence.—The pitiful fig-leaves of your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will not cover your nakedneſs, when God ſhall call you to ſtand before him.—Adam found them ineffectual, and ſo will you.—Oh, think of death! Oh, think of judgment! Yet a little while, and time ſhall be no more: and then what will become of you, if the Lord be not your righteouſneſs? Think you, that Chriſt will ſpare you? No, He that formed you, will have no mercy on you. If you are out of Chriſt, if Chriſt be not your righteouſneſs, Chriſt himſelf will

Alas! what profit will there be of all your labour under the ſun, if you do not ſecure this pearl of invaluable price? This one thing, ſo abſolutely needful, that it can only ſtand you in ſtead, when all other things ſhall be taken from you. Labour therefore no longer ſo anxiouſly for the meat which periſheth, but henceforward ſeek for the Lord to be your righteouſneſs—A righteouſneſs that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title you to life everlaſting.—I ſee alſo many hoary heads here, and perhaps the moſt of them cannot ſay, the Lord is my righteouſneſs.—O grey-headed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I could weep over you!—Your grey hairs, which ought to be your crown, and in which perhaps you glory, are now your ſhame.

Oh, haſte then, haſte, ye aged ſinners, and ſeek an intereſt in redeeming love!—Alas, you have one foot already in the grave.—Your glaſs is juſt run out.—Your ſun is juſt going down, and it will ſet and leave you in an eternal darkneſs, unleſs the Lord be your righteouſneſs!—Flee then, oh flee for your lives! be not afraid.—All things are poſſible with God. If you come, though it be at the eleventh hour, Chriſt Jeſus will in no wiſe caſt you out. Oh, ſeek then for the Lord to be your righteouſneſs, and beſeech him to let you know how it is that a man can be born again when he is old!—But I muſt not forget the lambs of the flock.—To feed them was one of my Lord's laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.—I know he will be angry with me, if I do not tell them, that the Lord may be their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.—Come then, ye little children, come to Chriſt; the Lord Chriſt ſhall be your righteouſneſs.—Do not

It is wonderful to obſerve, how gradually God revealed his Son to mankind. He began with the promiſe in the text, and this the elect lived upon till the time of Abraham; to him God made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoveries of his eternal counſel concerning man's redemption.

            <p>This firſt promiſe muſt certainly be but dark to our

            <p>How they came to ſtand in need of this promiſe, and what is the extent and meaning of it, I intend, God willing, to make the ſubject-matter of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meditation.</p>
            <p>The fall of man is written in too legible characters not to be underſtood: thoſe that deny it, by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying prove it. The very heathens confeſſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed it: They could ſee the ſtreams of corruption running through the whole race of mankind, but could not trace them to the fountain-head. Before God gave a revelation of his Son, man was a riddle to himſelf. And Moſes unfolds more in this one chapter (out of which the text is taken) than all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could have been capable of finding out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves though they had ſtudied to all eternity.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing chapter, he had given us a full account, how God ſpoke the world into being; and eſpecially how he formed man of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, ſo that he became a living ſoul. A council of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was called concerning the formation of this lovely creature. The reſult of that council was, <hi>Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created be him.</hi> Moſes remarkably repeats the words, that we might take particular notice of our divine original. Never was ſo much expreſſed in ſo few words. None but a man inſpired could have done ſo. But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that though Moſes mentions our being made in the image of God, yet he mentions it but twice, and that, as it were, in a tranſient manner, as though he would have ſaid, <q>Man was made in

honour, God made him upright, <hi>in the image of God, male and female created be them.</hi> But man ſo ſoon fell, and became like the beaſts that periſh, nay, like the devil himſelf, that it is ſcarce worth mentioning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How ſoon man fell after he was created, is not told us, and therefore to fix any time, is to be wiſe above what is written. And, I think, they who ſuppoſe that man fell the ſame day in which he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> made, have no ſufficient ground for their opinion. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which are crowded together in the former chapter, ſuch as the formation of Adam's wife, his giving names to the beaſts, and his being put into the garden which God had planted, I think require a longer ſpace of time than a day to be tranſacted in. However all agree in this, "Man ſtood not long." How long or how ſhort a while, I will not take upon me to determine. It more concerns us to enquire how he came to fall from his ſteadfaſtneſs, and what was the riſe and progreſs of the temptation which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over him. The account given us in this chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much ſervice, under God, to make ſome remarks upon it.</p>

               <hi>Now the ſerpent,</hi> ſays the ſacred hiſtorian, <hi>was more ſubtil than any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made, and he ſaid unto the woman, yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Though this was a real ſerpent, yet he that ſpoke was no other than the devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old ſerpent, becauſe he took poſſeſſion of the ſerpent when he came to beguile our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

God made man upright, and with full power to ſtand if he would. He was juſt, therefore in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to be tempted: if he fell, he had no one

to blame except himſelf. But how muſt Satan effect his fall? He cannot do it by his power, he attempts it therefore by policy. He takes poſſeſſion of a ſerpent, which was more ſubtil than all the beaſts of the field, which the Lord God had made; ſo that men that are full of ſubtility, but have no piety, are only machines for the devil to work upon, juſt as he pleaſes.</p>

And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028079_0057_0FD693A997D0D510"/>
Ver. 2. 3. The woman ſaid unto the ſerpent, <hi>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But, of the fruit of the tree which is in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former part of the anſwer was good, <q>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, God has not forbid us eating of every tree of the garden. No, we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, (and it ſhould ſeem even of the tree of life, which was as a ſacrament to man in a ſtate of innocence) there is only one tree in the midſt of the garden, of which God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</q> Here ſhe begins to warp, and ſin begins to conceive in her heart. Already has ſhe contracted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the ſerpent's poiſon, by talking with him, which ſhe ought not to have done at all. For ſhe might eaſily ſuppoſe, that it could be no good being, that could put ſuch a queſtion unto her, and inſinuate ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable thoughts of God. She ſhould therefore have fled from him, and not ſtood to have parleyed with him at all. Immediately the ill effects of it appear, ſhe begins to ſoften the divine threatening. God had ſaid, the <hi>day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> or, <hi>dying thou ſhalt die:</hi> But Eve ſays, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die. We may be aſſured we are fallen into, and begin to fall by temptation, when we begin to think God will not be as good as his word, in reſpect to the execution of his threatnings denounced againſt ſin. Satan knew this, and therefore artfully</p>
            <p>Said unto the woman, (ver. 4.) <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> in an inſinuating manner, <q>Ye ſhall not ſurely die. Surely God will not be ſo cruel as to damn you only for eating an apple: it cannot be.</q>

meaſure, to his eating that fruit; and therefore, if he received ſo much improvement, ſhe might alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a like benefit from it. All this, I think, is clear; for, otherwiſe, I do not ſee with what propriety it could be ſaid, <hi>When the Woman ſaw that it was good for food.</hi> How could ſhe know it was good for food, unleſs ſhe had ſeen the ſerpent feed upon it?</p>
            <p>Satan now begins to get ground apace. Luſt had conceived in her heart; ſhortly it will bring forth ſin. Sin being conceived, brings forth death. Ver. 6. <hi>And when the Woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo unto her huſband, and he did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſenſes are the landing ports of our ſpiritual enemies. How needful is that reſolution of holy Job, <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes.</hi> When Eve began to gaze on the forbidden fruit with her eyes, ſhe ſoon began to long after it with her heart. When ſhe ſaw that it was good for food, and pleaſant to the eyes, (here was the luſt of the fleſh, and luſt of the eye) but, above all, a tree to be deſired, to make one wiſe, wiſer than God would have her be, nay, as wiſe as God himſelf: ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and gave alſo unto her huſband with her, and he did eat. As ſoon as ever ſhe ſinned herſelf, ſhe turned tempter to her huſband. It is dreadful when thoſe, who ſhould be help-mates for each other in the great work of their ſalvation, are only promoters of each others damnation: but thus it is. If we ourſelves are good, we ſhall excite others to goodneſs; if we do evil, we ſhall entice others to do evil alſo. There is a cloſe connection between doing and teaching. How needful then is it for us all to take heed that we do not ſin any way ourſelves, leſt we ſhould
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028079_0059_0FD693B1010BCAB0"/>
become factors for the devil, and enſnare, perhaps, your neareſt and deareſt relations? <hi>She gave alſo unto her huſband with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Alas! what a complication of crimes was there in this one ſingle act of ſin! Here is an utter diſbelief of God's threatning; the utmoſt ingratitude to their Maker, who had ſo lately planted this garden and placed them in it, with ſuch a glorious and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive charter. Here is the utmoſt neglect of their poſterity, who they knew were to ſtand or fall with them: here was the utmoſt pride of heart; they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be equal with God: here is the utmoſt contempt put upon his threatning and his law; the devil is credited and obeyed before him, and all this only to ſatisfy their ſenſual appetite. Never was a crime of ſuch a complicated nature committed by any here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Nothing but the devil's apoſtacy and rebellion could equal it.</p>
            <p>And what are the conſequences of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Are their eyes opened? Yes, their eyes are opened; but, alas! it is only to ſee their own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For, we are told, ver. 7. <hi>that the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked:</hi> Naked of God, naked of every thing that was holy and good; and deſtitute of the divine image, which they before enjoyed. They might rightly now be termed Ichabod; for the glory of the Lord departed from them. Oh! how low did theſe ſons of the morning then fall; out of God into themſelves; from being partakers of the divine nature, into the nature of the devil and the beaſt. Well, therefore, might they know that they were naked not only in body but in ſoul.</p>
            <p>And how do they behave now they are naked? Do they flee to God for pardon? Do they ſeek to him for a robe to cover their nakedneſs? No. They were
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028079_0060_0FD693B5B1D10D40"/>
now dead to God, earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh; and therefore, inſtead of applying to God for mercy, they <hi>ſewed,</hi> or <hi>platted fig-leaves together, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aprons,</hi> or things to gird about them. This is a lively repreſentation of all natural men: We ſee that we are naked: We, in ſome meaſure, confeſs it; but, inſtead of looking up to God for ſuccour, we patch up a righteouſneſs of our own (as our firſt parents platted fig-leaves together) hoping to cover our nakedneſs by that. But our righteouſneſs will not ſtand the ſeverity of God's judgment: It will do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s no more ſervice than the fig-leaves did Adam and Eve, that is none at all.</p>
            <p>For, ver. 8. <hi>They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the trees of the garden, in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife</hi> (notwithſtanding their fig-leaves) <hi>

                  </gap>id themſelves from the preſence of the Lord God, among the trees of the garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They heard the voice of the Lord God, or the Word of the Lord God, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the Word that was with God, and the Word that was God.</hi> They heard him walking in the trees of the garden, in the <hi>cool of the day.</hi> A ſeaſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when Adam and Eve uſed to go, in an eſpecial manner, and offer up an evening ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving. The <hi>cool of the day.</hi> Perhaps, the ſin was committed early in the morning, or at noon; but God would not come upon them immediately, he ſtaid till the cool of the day. For if we would effectually reprove others, we ſhould not do it, when they are warmed with paſſion, but wait till the cool of the day.</p>
            <p>But what an alteration is here! Inſtead of rejoicing at the voice of their Beloved, inſtead of anſwering the voice of their God, with ſongs of praiſe and thankſgiving; having now broken his only law and

diveſted themſelves, by their diſobedience, of their perfect innocence, they, who had ſo openly braved the Almighty, by the violation of his ſingle and eaſy command, now, ſtung by conſcience and dreading the conſequences of ſuch a deliberate crime, ſlunk abaſhed behind the ſhadowy trees; thus attempting to elude the ſearch of him who is all-ſeeing. Is not this then what has diſrobed our ſouls, and thus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating the ſource, renders us impure by nature? aſſuredly it is. We labour to cover our nakedneſs with the fig-leaves of our own righteouſneſs: We hide ourſelves from God as long as we can; and will not come, and never ſhould come, did not the Father prevent, draw, and ſweetly conſtrain us by his grace, as he here prevented Adam.</p>
            <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the Lord God called unto Adam, and ſaid unto him, Adam, where art thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The Lord God called unto Adam," (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Adam would never have called unto the Lord God) and ſaid, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> 
               <q>How is it that thou comeſt not to pay thy devotions as uſual.</q> Chriſtians, remember the Lord keeps an account when you fail coming to worſhip.

It may be underſtood in another and better ſenſe, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> What a condition is thy poor ſoul in? This is the firſt thing the Lord aſks, and convinces a ſinner of, when he prevents, and calls him effectually by his grace. He alſo calls him by name: For unleſs God ſpeaks to us in particular, and we know where we are, how poor, how miſerable, how blind, how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, we ſhall never value the redemption wrought out for us by the death and obedience of the dear Lord Jeſus. <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi>

Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, I heard thy voice in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I was afraid.</hi> See what cowards ſin makes us. If we knew no ſin, we ſhould know no fear. <hi>Becauſe I was naked, and I hid myſelf.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked! Haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I</hi> (thy Maker and Lawgiver) <hi>commanded thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God knew very well that Adam was naked, and that he had eaten of the forbidden fruit: But God would know it from Adam's own mouth. Thus God knows all our neceſſities before we aſk, but yet inſiſts upon our aſking for his grace, and confeſſing our ſins. For, by ſuch acts, we acknowledge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, take ſhame to ourſelves, and thereby give glory to his great name.</p>
            <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the man ſaid, the woman which thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was nature more lively delineated. See what pride Adam contracted by the fall! How unwilling he is to lay the blame upon, or take ſhame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This anſwer is full of inſolence towards God, enmity againſt his wife, and diſingenuity in reſpect to himſelf. For herein he tacitly reflects upon God. <hi>The woman that</hi> THOU <hi>gaveſt to be with me.</hi> As much as to ſay, <hi>If</hi> THOU <hi>hadſt not given me</hi> THAT WOMAN, <hi>I had not eaten the forbidden fruit.</hi> Thus when men ſin, they lay the fault upon their paſſions; then blame and reflect upon God for giving them thoſe paſſions. Their language is, <q>The appetites that THOU gaveſt us, they deceived us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſinned againſt thee.</q> But, as God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, puniſhed Adam for hearkening to the voice of his wife, ſo he will puniſh thoſe who hearken to the dictates of their corrupt inclinations. For God compels no man to ſin. Adam might have

withſtood the ſolicitations of his wife, if he would; and ſo, if we look up to God, we ſhould find grace to help in the time of need. The devil and our own hearts tempt, but they cannot force us to conſent, without the concurrence of our own wills. So that our damnation is of ourſelves, as it will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the great day, notwithſtanding all men's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent impudent replies againſt God, as Adam ſpeaks inſolently in reſpect to God, ſo he ſpeaks with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt his wife: The woman, or <hi>this woman, ſhe gave me.</hi> He lays all the fault upon her, and ſpeaks of her with much contempt. He does not ſay, my wife, my dear wife; but <hi>this Woman.</hi> For ſin diſunites the moſt united hearts. It is the bane of holy fellowſhip. Thoſe who have been compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſin here, if they die without repentance, will both hate and condemn one another hereafter. All damned ſouls are accuſers of their brethren. Thus it is, in ſome degree, on this ſide the grave. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi> What a diſingenuous ſpeech was here! He makes uſe of no leſs than fifteen words to excuſe himſelf, and but one or two (in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) to confeſs his fault, if it may be called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at all. <hi>The woman which thou gaveſt to be with me ſhe gave me of the tree;</hi> here are fifteen words; <hi>and I did eat.</hi> With what reluctance do theſe laſt words come out?

What reaſon can be given, why ſentence of death ſhould not be pronounced againſt the priſoners at the bar? All muſt own they are worthy to die. Nay, how can God, conſiſtently with his juſtice, poſſibly forgive them? He had threatened, that the day
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028079_0066_0FDA24178F80E328"/>
wherein they eat of the forbidden fruit, they ſhould <hi>ſurely die;</hi> and, if he did not execute this threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the devil might then ſlander the Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And yet mercy cries, Spare theſe ſinners, ſpare the work of thine own hands. Behold then, wiſdom contrives a ſcheme how God may be juſt, and yet be merciful; be faithful to his threatening, puniſh the offence, and at the ſame time ſpare the offender. An amazing ſcene of divine love here opens to our view, which had been from all eternity hid in the heart of God! Notwithſtanding Adam and Eve were thus unhumbled, and did not ſo much as put up one ſingle petition for pardon, God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately paſſes ſentence upon the ſerpent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to them a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the Lord God ſaid unto the Serpent, Becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art accurſed above all cattle, and above every beaſt of the field; upon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life, i. e.</hi> he ſhould be in ſubjection, and his power ſhould always be limited and reſtrained. <hi>His enemies ſhall lick the duſt,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt. Ver. 15. <hi>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the explanation of this verſe, I cannot but take notice of one great miſtake, which the author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> is guilty of, in making this verſe contain a covenant between God and Adam, as though God perſonally treated with Adam, as before the fall. For, talking of the ſecond covenant, in his preface concerning caring for the ſoul, ſays he, <q>This ſecond covenant was made with Adam, and us in him, preſently after the fall, and is contained in theſe words, Gen. iii. 15. where God declares <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028079_0067_0FD693C6CC0CEA48"/>
break the ſerpent's head;</hi> and this was made up, as the firſt was, of ſome mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome duties to be performed by us.</q> This is exceeding falſe divinity: For theſe words are not ſpoken to Adam; they are directed only to the ſerpent. Adam and Eve ſtood by as criminals, and God could not treat with them, becauſe they had broken his covenant. And it is ſo far from being a covenant, wherein, <q>ſome mercies are to be afforded by God, and ſome duties to be performed by us,</q> that here is not a word looking that way; it is only a declaration of a free gift of ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. God the Father and God the Son had entered into a covenant concerning the ſalvation of the elect from all eternity; wherein God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſed, that if the Son would offer his ſoul a ſacrifice for ſin, he ſhould ſee his ſeed. Now this is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> open revelation of this ſecret covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſpeaks in the moſt poſitive terms. <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> The firſt Adam God had treated with before; he proved falſe; God therefore to ſecure the ſecond covenant from being broken, puts it into the hands of the ſecond Adam, the Lord from heaven. Adam, after the fall, ſtood no longer as our repreſentative; he and Eve were only private perſons as we are, and were only to hold on the declaration of mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this promiſe by faith (as they really did) and by that they were ſaved. I do not ſay, but we are to believe and obey, if we are everlaſtingly ſaved. Faith and obedience are conditions, if we only mean that they in order go before our ſalvation; but I deny that theſe are propoſed by God to Adam, or that God treats with him on this promiſe, as he did before the fall under the covenant of works. For, how could that be, when Adam and Eve were now pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028079_0068_0FD693C9F6BB5A40"/>
at the bar, without ſtrength to perform any conditions at all? The truth is this: God as a reward of Chriſt's ſufferings, promiſed to give the elect faith and repentance, in order to bring them to eternal life: And both theſe and every thing elſe neceſſary for their everlaſting happineſs, are infallibly ſecured to them in this promiſe, as Mr. Boſton, an excellent Scotch divine, ſweetly and clearly ſhews, in a book intitled, <hi>A view of the covenant of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is, by no means, an unneceſſary diſtinction; it is a matter of great importance: For want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, people have been ſo long miſled. They have been taught that they muſt Do ſo and ſo, as though they were under a covenant of works; and then for DOING this, they ſhould be ſaved. This is plainly the whole drift of the book wrongly intitled, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be taught, that the Lord Jeſus was the ſecond Adam, with whom the Father entered into covenant for fallen man: that they can now do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of or for themſelves, and ſhould therefore come to God, beſeech him to give them faith, by which they ſhall be enabled to lay hold on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and that faith they will then ſhew forth by their works, out of love and gratitude to the ever-bleſſed Jeſus, their moſt glorious Redeemer, for what he has done for their ſouls. This is a conſiſtent ſcriptural ſcheme: without holding this, we muſt run into one of thoſe two bad extremes; I mean, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm on the one hand, or Arminianiſm on the other: from both which may the good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: by the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> we are here to underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who though very God of very God was, for us men and our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to have a body prepared for him by the Holy
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028079_0069_0FD693CE547D1A18"/>
Ghoſt, and to be born of a woman who never knew man, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by his obedience and death make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for man's tranſgreſſion, and bring in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, work in them a new nature, and thereby bruiſe the ſerpent's head, <hi>i. e.</hi> deſtroy his power and dominion over them. By the <hi>ſerpent's ſeed,</hi> we are to underſtand, the devil and all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are permitted by God to tempt and ſift his children. But, bleſſed be God, he can reach no further than our heel.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but Adam and Eve under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this promiſe in this ſenſe; for it is plain, in the latter part of the chapter, ſacrifices were inſtituted. From whence ſhould thoſe ſkins come, but from beaſts ſlain for ſacrafice, of which God made them coats? We find Abel, as well as Cain, offering ſacrifice in the next chapter: and the apoſtle tells us, he did it by <hi>faith,</hi> no doubt in this promiſe. And Eve, when Cain was born, ſaid, <hi>I have gotten a man from the</hi> LORD; or, (as Mr. Henry obſerves, it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) <hi>I have gotten a man,</hi>—THE LORD,—the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah. Some further ſuppoſe, that Eve was the firſt believer; and therefore they tranſlate it thus, the <hi>ſeed</hi> (not of THE, but) of THIS <hi>woman;</hi> which magnifies the grace of God ſo much the more, that ſhe, who was the firſt in the tranſgreſſion, ſhould be the firſt partaker of redemption. Adam believed alſo, and was ſaved: for unto Adam and his wife did the Lord make coats of ſkins, and cloathed THEM, which was a remarkable type of their being clothed with the righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This promiſe was literally fulfilled in the perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Satan bruiſed his heel, when he tempted him for forty days together in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: he bruiſed his heel, when he raiſed up ſtrong
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028079_0070_0FD693D08AC20F10"/>
perſecution againſt him, during the time of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic miniſtry: he, in an eſpecial manner, bruiſed his heel, when our Lord complained, that his <hi>ſoul was exceeding ſorrowful even unto death, and be ſweat great drops of blood, falling upon the ground,</hi> when praying in the garden: he bruiſed his heel, when he put it in the heart of Judas to betray him; and he bruiſed him yet moſt of all, when his emiſſaries nailed him to an accurſed tree, and our Lord cried out, <hi>My God, my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Yet in all this, the bleſſed Jeſus, the ſeed of the woman, bruiſed Satan's accurſed head: for, in that he was tempted he was able to <hi>ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> By <hi>his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him. By dying, he deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil. He thereby ſpoiled principalities and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them upon the croſs.</p>
            <p>This promiſe has been, is, and will be fulfilled in the elect of God, conſidered collectively, as well before, as after the coming of our Lord in the fleſh: for they may be called the <hi>ſeed of the woman.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel not, that <hi>all who will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> In this promiſe, there is an eternal enmity put between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent; ſo that thoſe that are born after the fleſh, cannot but perſecute thoſe that are born after the Spirit. This enmity ſhewed itſelf ſoon after this promiſe was revealed, in Cain's bruiſing the heel of Abel: it continued in the church through all ages before Chriſt came in the fleſh, as the hiſtory of the Bible and the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews plainly ſhews. It raged exceedingly after our Lord's aſcenſion; witneſs the Acts of the Apoſtles, and the hiſtory of the primitive Chriſtians.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028079_0071_0FD693D226BC61C0"/>
It now rages, and will continue to rage and ſhew itſelf, in a greater or leſs degree to the end of time. But let not this diſmay us; for in all this the ſeed of the woman is more than conqueror, and bruiſes the ſerpent's head Thus the Iſraelites, the more they were oppreſſed, the more they increaſed. Thus it was with the apoſtles; thus it was with their immediate followers. So that Tertullian compares the church in his time to a mowed field; the more frequently it is cut, the more it grows. The blood of the martyrs was always the ſeed of the church. And I have often ſat down with wonder and delight, and admired how God has made the very ſchemes which his enemies contrived in order to hinder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt effectual means to propagate his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The devil has had ſo little ſucceſs in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if I did not know that he and his children, according to this verſe, could not but perſecute, I ſhould think he would count it his ſtrength to ſit ſtill. What did he get by perſecuting the martyrs in queen Mary's time? Was not the grace of God exceedingly glorified in their ſupport! What did he get by perſecuting the good old Puritans? Did it not prove the peopling of New-England? Or to come nearer our own times. What hath he got by putting us out of the ſynagogues? Hath not the word of God, ſince that, mightily prevailed? My dear hearers, you muſt excuſe me for enlarging on this head; God fills my ſoul generally, when I come to this topic. I can ſay with Luther, <q>If it were not for perſecution, I ſhould not underſtand the ſcripture.</q> If Satan ſhould be yet ſuffered to bruiſe my heel further, and his ſervants ſhould thruſt me into priſon, I doubt not, but even that would only tend to the more effectual bruiſing of his head. I remember a ſaying of the then Lord
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028079_0072_0FD693D40485F580"/>
Chancellor to the pious Bradford: <q>Thou haſt done more hurt, ſaid he, by thy exhortations in private in priſon, than thou didſt in preaching before thou waft put in,</q> or words to this effect. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the text is my daily ſupport; <hi>I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further: This promiſe is alſo fulfilled, not only in the church in general, but in every individual believer in particular. In every believer there are two ſeeds, the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent; the fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh. It is with the believer, when quickened with grace in his heart, as it was with Rebeccah, when ſhe had conceived Eſau and Jacob in her womb; ſhe felt a ſtruggling, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be uneaſy; <hi>If it be ſo,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>why am I thus?</hi> Thus grace and nature ſtruggle, (if I may ſo ſpeak) in the womb of a believer's heart: But, as it was there ſaid, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger: ſo it is here,—grace in the end ſhall get the better of nature; the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head. Many of you that have believed in Chriſt, perhaps may find ſome particular corruption yet ſtrong, ſo ſtrong, that you are ſometimes ready to cry out with David, <hi>I ſhall fall one day by the hand of Saul.</hi> But fear not, the promiſe in the text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the perſeverance and victory of believers over Sin, Satan, Death, and Hell. What if indwelling corruption does yet remain, and the ſeed of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent bruiſe your heel, in vexing and diſturbing your righteous ſouls? Fear not, though faint, yet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: You ſhall yet bruiſe the ſerpent's head. Chriſt has died for you, and yet a little while, and he will ſend death to deſtroy the very being of ſin in you. Which brings me</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:028079_0073_0FD693D510FC28E8"/>
To ſhew the moſt extenſive manner in which the promiſe of the text ſhall be fulfilled, viz. At the final judgment, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall preſent the elect to his Father, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, glorified both in body and ſoul.</p>
            <p>Then ſhall the ſeed of the woman give the laſt and fatal blow, in bruiſing the ſerpent's head. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the accuſer of the brethren, and all his accurſed feed, ſhall then be caſt out, and never ſuffered to diſturb the ſeed of the woman any more. Then ſhall the righteous ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father, and fit with Chriſt on thrones in majeſty on high.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, not be weary of well-doing; for we ſhall reap an eternal harveſt of comfort if we faint not. Dare, dare, my dear brethren in Chriſt to follow the Captain of our ſalvation, who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> made perfect through ſufferings. The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head. Fear not men. Be not too much caſt down at the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your hearts. Fear not devils; you ſhall get the victory even over them. The Lord Jeſus his engaged to make you more than conquerors over all. Plead with your Saviour, plead: Plead the promiſe in the text. Wreſtle, wreſtle with God in prayer. If it has been given you to believe, fear not if it ſhould alſo be given you to ſuffer. Be not any wiſe terrified by your adverſaries; the king of the church has them all in a chain: Be kind to them; pray for them; but fear them not. The Lord will yet bring back his ark, though at preſent driven into the wilderneſs; and Satan, like lightning, ſhall fall from heaven.</p>
            <p>Are there any enemies of God here? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the text encourages me to bid you defiance: The <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> the ever bleſſed Jeſus, <hi>ſhall

Who are you that perſecute the children of the ever bleſſed God. Though a poor ſtripling, the Lord Jeſus, the ſeed of the woman, will enable me to bruiſe your heads.</p>
            <p>My brethren in Chriſt, I think I do not ſpeak thus in my own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of my Redeemer. I know in whom I have believed; I am perſuaded he will keep that ſafe, which I have committed unto him. He is faithful who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>that the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head.</hi> May we all experience a daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of this promiſe, both in the church and in our hearts, till we come to the church of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, in the preſence and actual fruition of the great God our heavenly Father.</p>

            <p>WHEN our Lord Jeſus was pleaſed to take upon himſelf the form of a ſervant, and go about preaching the kingdom of God, he took all opportunities in public, and more eſpecially in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to caution his diſciples againſt ſeeking great things for themſelves; and alſo to forwarn them of the many diſtreſſes, afflictions, and perſecutions which they muſt expect to endure and go through for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſake. The great St. Paul, therefore, the author of this epiſtle, in this, as in all other things, following the ſteps of his bleſſed Maſter, takes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care, among other apoſtolical admonitions, to warn young Timothy of the difficulties he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet when in the courſe of his miniſtry:—<q>This know alſo, (ſays he, verſe 1ſt of this chapter) that in the laſt days perilous times ſhall come. For men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſure more than
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028079_0076_0FD693DA05217618"/>
lovers of God; having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away. For of this ſort are they which creep into houſes, and lead captive filly women laden with ſins—lead away with divers luſts; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</q> 
               <hi>Now, as Jannes and Jambres</hi> (two of the Egyptian magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians) <hi>withſtood Moſes</hi> (by working ſham miracles) <hi>ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the truth:</hi> and (notwithſtanding they keep up the form of religion) <hi>are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</hi> But, in order to keep him from ſinking under their oppoſition, he tells him, that though God, for wiſe ends, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe falſe teachers, as he did the magicians, to oppoſe for ſome time, yet they ſhould now proceed no farther. <hi>For their folly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall be made manifeſt unto all men, as theirs</hi> (the magicians) <hi>alſo was,</hi> when they could not ſtand before Moſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the boil; for the boil was upon the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians as well as upon all the Egyptians. And then to encourage Timothy yet the more, he propounds to him his own example: <q>But thou haſt fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpoſe, faith, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, charity, patience, perſecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lyſtra; what perſecutions I endured; But out of them all the Lord delivered me.</q> And then leſt Timothy might think that this was only the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe of Paul: <hi>Yea,</hi> ſays he, in the words of the text, <hi>and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words, without conſidering them as they ſtand in relation to the context, contain a neceſſary and important truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>perſecution</hi> is the common lot of every godly man. This is a hard ſaying. How few can bear it? I truſt God, in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, will enable me to make it good, by ſhewing,

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ſhall apply the whole.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> Let us conſider what it is to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus: this ſuppoſes, that we are made the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, that we are born again, and are made one with Chriſt by a living faith, and a vital union, even as Jeſus Chriſt and the Father are one. Unleſs we are thus converted; and transformed by the renewing of our minds, we cannot properly be ſaid to be in Chriſt, much leſs to live godly in him. To be in Chriſt merely by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and an outward profeſſion, is not to be in him in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word: No; They that are in Chriſt Jeſus, are new creatures; old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new in their hearts. Their life is hid with Chriſt in God; their ſouls daily feed on the inviſible realties of another world. To live godly in Chriſt, is to make the divine will, and not our own, the ſole principle of all our thoughts, words, and actions; ſo that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we eat or drink, or whatſoever we do, we do all to the glory of God. Thoſe who live godly in Chriſt, may not ſo much be ſaid to live, as Chriſt to live in them; he is their alpha and omega, their firſt and laſt, their beginning and end. They are led by his Spirit, as a child is led by the hand of its Father; and are willing to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he leads them. They hear, know, and obey his voice. Their affections are ſet on things above. Their hopes are full of immortality; their citizenſhip is in heaven. Being born again of God, they habitually live to, and daily walk with
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028079_0078_0FD693DE9FD52B80"/>
God. They are pure in heart; and, from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of faith in Chriſt, are holy in all manner of converſation and godlineſs.</p>
            <p>This is to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus: and hence we may eaſily learn, why ſo few ſuffer perſecution? becauſe ſo few live godly in Chriſt Jeſus. You may attend on outward duties; you may live morally in Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> you may do (as they term it) no one any harm, and avoid perſecution: but they that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the meaning of the word <hi>perſecution,</hi> and how many kinds there are of it, I come now to conſider.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>perſecution</hi> is derived from a Greek word, ſignifying to <hi>purſue,</hi> and generally implies, <q>purſuing a perſon for the ſake of his goodneſs, or God's good will to him.</q> The firſt kind of it, is that of the heart. We have an early example of this in that wicked one Cain, who, becauſe the Lord had reſpect to Abel and his offering, and not to him and his offering, was very wroth, his countenance fell, and at length he cruelly ſlew his envied bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus the Phariſees hated and perſecuted our Lord long before they laid hold on him: and our Lord mentions being inwardly hated of men, as one kind of perſecution his diſciples were to undergo. This heart enmity (if I may ſo term it) is the root of all other kinds of perſecution, and is in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other, to be found in the ſoul of every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated man; and numbers are guilty of this perſecution, who never have it in their power to perſecute any other way. Nay, numbers would be carried out actually to put in practice all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of perſecution, was not the name of perſecution become odious amongſt mankind, and did they not hereby run the hazard of loſing their reputation.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028079_0079_0FD693DF8DAF95F8"/>
Alas! how many at the great day, whom we know not now, will be convicted and condemned, that all their life harboured a ſecret evil-will againſt Zion! They may now ſcreen it before men; but God ſeeth the enmity of their hearts, and will judge them as perſecutors at the great and terrible day of judgment!</p>
            <p>A ſecond degree of perſecution is that of the tongue; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. Many I ſuppoſe think it no harm to ſhoot out arrows, even bitter words, againſt the diſciples of the Lord: they ſcatter the fire-brands, arrows, and death, ſaying, "Are we not in ſport?" But, however they may eſteem it, in God's account, evil-ſpeaking is a high degree of perſecution. Thus Iſhmael's mocking Iſaac in the Old, is termed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting him in the New Teſtament. Bleſſed are ye, ſays our Lord, when men ſhall revile you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my name's ſake. From whence we may gather, that reviling and ſpeaking all manner of evil falſely for Chriſt's ſake, is a high degree of perſecution. For a good name, ſays the wiſe man, is better than precious ointment, and to many is dearer than life itſelf. It is a great breach of the ſixth commandment, to ſlander any one; but to ſpeak evil of and ſlander the diſciples of Chriſt, merely becauſe they are his diſciples, muſt be highly provoking in the ſight of God; and ſuch who are guilty of it (without repentance) will find that Jeſus Chriſt will call them to an account, and puniſh them for all their ungodly and hard ſpeeches in a lake of fire and brimſtone. This ſhall be their portion to drink.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt kind of perſecution, is that which expreſſes itſelf in actions; as when wicked
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028079_0080_0FD693E112F58018"/>
men ſeparate the children of God from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; <hi>bleſſed are ye,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>when they ſhall ſeparate you from their company:</hi> or expoſe them to church cenſures. <hi>They ſhall put you out of their ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues;</hi> threatening and prohibiting them from making an open profeſſion of his religion or worſhip; or interdicting miniſters for preaching his word, as the high prieſts threatened the apoſtles, and forbad them <hi>any more to ſpeak in the name of Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>Paul breathed out threatenings and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of the Lord:</hi> Or when they call them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to courts; <hi>you ſhall be called before governors,</hi> ſays our Lord: Or when they fine, impriſon, or puniſh them, by confiſcation of goods, cruel ſcourging, and, laſtly, death itſelf.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to enumerate in what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhapes perſecution has appeared. It is a many-headed monſter, inſatiable as hell, cruel as the grave; and, what is worſe, it generally appears under the cloak of religion. But cruel, inſatiable, and horrid as it is, they that live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt expect to ſuffer and encounter with it in all its forms.</p>
            <p>This is what we are to make good under our next general head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why is it that godly men muſt expect to ſuffer perſecution? And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This appears from the whole tenour of our Lord's doctrine. We will begin with his divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are they who are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake; for theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi> So that, if our Lord ſpoke truth, we are not ſo bleſſed as to have an intereſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, unleſs we are or have been <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> Nay, our Lord, (it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable) employs three verſes in this beautitude, and only one in each of the others; not only to ſhew
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028079_0081_0FD693E29EEB3CC8"/>
that it was a thing which men (as men) are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe, but alſo the neceſſary conſequence of it upon our being Chriſtians. This is likewiſe evident from all thoſe paſſages, wherein our Lord informs us, that he came upon the earth, not to ſend peace but a ſword; and that the father-in-law ſhall be againſt the mother-in-law, and that a man's foes ſhall be thoſe of his houſehold. Paſſages, which though confined by falſe prophets to the firſt, I am perſuaded will be verified by the experience of all true Chriſtians in this, and every age of the church. It would be endleſs to recount all the places wherein our Lord forwarns his diſciples that they ſhould be called before rulers, and thruſt out of ſynagogues, nay, that the time would come, wherein men ſhould think they did God ſervice to kill them. For this reaſon he ſo frequently declared, that unleſs a man <hi>forſake all that he had, and even hated life itſelf, he could not be his diſciple.</hi> And therefore it is worthy our obſervation; that in that remarkable paſſage, wherein our Lord makes ſuch an extenſive promiſe to thoſe who <hi>left all for him,</hi> he cautiouſly inſerts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. <hi>And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe, or breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or lands, for my ſake and the goſpel's, but he ſhall receive an hundred fold</hi> now <hi>in this time; houſes and brethren, and ſiſters and mothers, and children and lands,</hi> with perſecutions; (the word is in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, including all kinds of perſecution) and <hi>in the world to come eternal life.</hi> He that hath ears to hear let him hear what Chriſt ſays in all theſe paſſages, and then confeſs, that <hi>all who live godly in Chriſt, Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this is proved from our Lord's doctrine, ſo it is no leſs evident from his life. Follow him from
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028079_0082_0FD693E48F7E9550"/>
the manager to the croſs, and ſee whether any perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was like that which the Son of God, the Lord of glory, underwent whilſt here on earth. How was he hated by wicked men? How often would that hatred have excited them to take hold of him, had it not been for fear of the people? How was he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, counted and called a blaſphemer, a wine biber, a Samaritan, nay, a devil, and, in one word, had all manner of evil ſpoken againſt him falſely? What contradiction of ſinners did he endure againſt himſelf? How did men ſeparate from his company, and were aſhamed to walk with him openly? Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he once ſaid to his own diſciples, <hi>Will you alſo go away?</hi> Again, how was he ſtoned, thruſt out of the ſynagogues, arrained as a deceiver of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a ſeditious and peſtilent fellow, an enemy to Ceſar, and as ſuch ſcourged, blindfolded, ſpit upon, and at length condemned, and nailed to an accurſed tree? Thus was the maſter perſecuted; thus did the Lord ſuffer; and the ſervant is not above his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor the diſciple above his Lord: <hi>If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you,</hi> ſaith the bleſſed Jeſus. And again, <hi>every man that is perfect,</hi> that is, a true Chriſtian, <hi>muſt be as his Maſter, i. e.</hi> ſuffer as he did. For all theſe things our Lord has let us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps: and therefore, God forbid that any who would live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould hence forward expect to eſcape ſuffering perſecution.</p>
            <p>But farther: Not only our Lord's example, but the example of all the ſaints that ever lived, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrates the truth of the apoſtle's aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the text. How ſoon was Abel made a martyr for his religion? How was Iſaac mocked by the ſon of the bond-woman! And what a large catalogue of ſuffering Old Teſtament ſaints, have we recorded
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028079_0083_0FD693E5957FEBE8"/>
in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews! Read the Acts of the Apoſtles, and ſee how the Chriſtians were threatened, ſtoned, impriſoned, ſcourged, and perſecuted even unto death. Examine church-hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in after ages, and you will find the murder of the innocents by Herod, was but an earneſt of the innocent blood which ſhould be ſhed for the name of Jeſus. Examine the experience of ſaints now living on earth; and if it were poſſible to conſult the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, I am perſuaded each would concur with the Apoſtle in aſſerting, that <hi>all who will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can it be otherwiſe in the very nature of things? Ever ſince the fall, there has been an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable enmity between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent. Wicked men hate God, and therefore, cannot but hate thoſe who are like him: they hate to be reformed, and therefore muſt hate and perſecute thoſe who, by a contrary behaviour, teſtify of them, that their deeds are evil. Beſides, pride of heart leads men to perſecute the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. If they commend them, they are afraid of being aſked, <q>Why do you not follow them?</q> And therefore becauſe they dare not imitate, though they may ſometimes be even forced to approve their way, yet pride and envy make them turn perſecutors. Hence it is, that as it was formerly, ſo it is now, and ſo will it be to the end of time; he that is born after the fleſh the natural man, does and will perſecute him that is born after the Spirit, the regenerate man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtians are not of the world, but Chriſt hath choſen them out of the world, therefore the world will hate them. If it be objected againſt this doctrine, <q>that we now live in a Chriſtian world,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028079_0084_0FD693E921C25580"/>
and therefore muſt not expect ſuch perſecution as formerly; I anſwer, All are not Chriſtians that are called ſo; and, till the heart is changed, the enmity againſt God (which is the root of all perſecution) remains,</q> and conſequently Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, falſely ſo called, will perſecute as well as others. I obſerved therefore, in the beginning of this diſcourſe, that Paul mentions thoſe that had a form of religion, as perſons of whom Timothy had need be chiefly aware: for, as our Lord and his Apoſtles were moſtly perſecuted by their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Jews, ſo we muſt expect the like uſage from the formaliſts of our own nation, the Phariſees, who ſeem to be religious. For the moſt horrid and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous perſecutions have been carried on by thoſe who have called themſelves Chriſtians; witneſs the days of queen Mary; and the fines, baniſhments, and impriſonments of the children of God in the laſt century, and the bitter irreconcileable hatred that appears in thouſands who call themſelves Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, even in the preſent days wherein we live.</p>
            <p>Perſons who argue againſt perſecution now, are not ſufficiently ſenſible of the bitter enmity of the heart of every unregenerate man againſt God. For my own part, I am ſo far from wondering that Chriſtians are perſecuted, that I wonder our ſtreets do not run with the blood of the ſaints: was men's power equal to their wills, ſuch a horrid ſpectacle would ſoon appear. But,</p>
            <p>Perſecution is neceſſary in reſpect to the godly themſelves. If we have not all manner of evil ſpoken of us, how can we know whether we love contempt, and ſeek only that honour which cometh from above? If we have not perſecutors, how can our paſſive graces be kept in exerciſe? How can many Chriſtians precepts be put into practice?
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028079_0085_0FD693EBF5833418"/>
How can we love, pray for, and do good to thoſe who deſpite fully uſe us? How can we overcome evil with good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhort, how can we know we love God better than life itſelf? St. Paul was ſenſible of all this, and therefore ſo poſitively and peremptorily aſſerts, that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>Not than I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, <q>All are perſecuted in a like degree.</q> No: This would be contrary both to ſcripture and experience. But though all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are not really called to ſuffer every kind of perſecution, yet all Chriſtians are liable thereto: and notwithſtanding ſome may live in more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful times of the church than others, yet all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in all ages, will find by their own experience, that, whether they act in a private or public capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they muſt, in ſome degree o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> other, ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>Here then I would pauſe, and, <hi>loſtly,</hi> by way of application, exhort all perſons,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſtand a while and examine themſelves. For, by what has been ſaid, you may gather one mark, whereby you may judge whether you are Chriſtians or not. Were you ever perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake? If not, you never yet lived godly in Chriſt our Lord. Whatever you may ſay to the contrary, the inſpired apoſtle, in the words of the text (the truth of which, I think, I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved) poſitively aſſerts, that <q>all that will live godly in him, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</q> Not that all who are perſecuted are real Chriſtians; for many ſometimes ſuffer, and are perſecuted on other accounts than for Righteouſneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The great queſtion therefore is, <q>Whether you are ever perſecuted for living godly?</q> You may boaſt (as perhaps you may think) of your great prudence and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028079_0086_0FD693EDE4329DE8"/>
ſagacity, (and indeed theſe are excellent things) and glory becauſe you have not run ſuch lengths, and made yourſelves ſo ſingular, and liable to ſuch contempt, as ſome others have. But, alaſs! this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not a mark of your being a Chriſtian, but of a Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean ſpirit, neither hot nor cold, and fit only to be ſpewed out of the mouth of God. That which you call prudence, is often only cowardice, dreadful hypocriſy, pride of heart, which makes you dread contempt; and afraid to give up your reputation for God. You are aſhamed of Chriſt and his goſpel; and in all probability; was he to appear a ſecond time upon earth, in words, as well as works, you would deny him. Awake therefore, all ye that live only formally in Chriſt Jeſus, and no longer ſeek that honour which cometh of man. I do not deſire to court you, but I intreat you to live godly, and fear not contempt for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. Beg of God to give you his Holy Spirit, that you may ſee through, and diſcover the latent hypocriſy of your hearts, and no longer deceive your own ſouls. Remember you cannot reconcile two irreconcileable differences. God and Mammon, the friendſhip of this world, with the favour of God. Know you not who hath told you, that the <q>friendſhip of this world is enmity with God?</q> If therefore you are in friendſhip with the world, notwithſtanding all your ſpecious pretences to piety, you are at enmity with God: you are only heart hypocrites, and, <q>What is the hope of the hypocrite, when God ſhall take away his ſoul?</q> Let the words of the text ſound an alarm in your ears—Oh let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

That is more than you know: in all probability your chief enemies will be thoſe of your own houſehold. If therefore they ſhould oppoſe you, are you willing naked to follow a naked Chriſt; and to wander about in ſheep-ſkins, and goat-ſkins, in dens and caves of the earth, being afflicted, deſtitute, tormented, rather than not be Chriſt's diſciples?

will you not be immediately offended? Be not angry with me for putting theſe queſtions to you. I am jealous over you, but it is with a godly jealouſy; For, alas! how many have put their hands to the plough, and afterwards have ſhamefully looked back? I only deal with you, as our Lord did with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſaid, <q>Lord I will follow thee whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou wilt. The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man, ſays he, hath not where to lay his head.</q> What ſay you? Are you willing to endure hardneſs, and thereby approve yourſelves good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt! You now come on foot out of the towns and villages to hear the word, and receive me as a meſſenger of God: But will you not by and by cry out, <q>Away with him, away with him; it is not fit ſuch a fellow ſhould live upon the earth?</q> Perhaps ſome of you, like Hazael, may ſay, "Are we dogs that we ſhould do this? But, alas! I have met with many unhappy ſouls, who have drawn back into perdition, and have afterwards accounted me their enemy, for dealing faithfully with them; though once, if it were poſſible, they would have plucked out their own eyes, and have given them unto me. Sit down therefore, I beſeech you, and ſeriouſly count the coſt, and aſk yourſelves again and again, whether you count all things but dung and droſs, and are willing to ſuffer the loſs of all thing, ſo that you may win Chriſt, and be found in him; for you may aſſure yourſelves, the apoſtle hath not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain, <q>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The text ſpeaks to you that are patiently ſuffering for the truth's ſake: <q>Rejoice and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad; great ſhall be your reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q> For to you it is given not only to believe,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028079_0089_0FD693F48B2E26F0"/>
but alſo to ſuffer, and perhaps remarkably too, for the ſake of Jeſus! This is a mark of your diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an evidence that you do live godly in Chriſt Jeſus. Fear not therefore, neither be diſmayed. Oh, be not weary and faint in your minds! Jeſus, your Lord, your life, cometh and his reward is with him. Though all men forſake you, yet will not he: No; the Spirit of Chriſt and of glory ſhall reſt upon you. In patience therefore, poſſeſs your ſouls. Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Be in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrified by your adverſaries: on their part Chriſt is evil ſpoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on your part he is glorified. Be not aſhamed of your glory, ſince others can glory in their ſhame. Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, wherewith you are or may be tried. The devil rages, knowing that he hath but a ſhort time to reign. He or his emiſſaries have no more power than what is given them from above; God ſets them their bounds, which they cannot paſs; and the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; no one ſhall ſet upon you to hurt you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your heavenly Father's knowledge. Do your earthly friends and parents forſake you? Are you caſt out of the ſynagogues? The Lord ſhall reveal himſelf to you, as to the man that was born blind. Jeſus Chriſt ſhall take you up. If they carry you to priſon, and load you with chains, ſo that the iron enter into your ſouls, even there ſhall Chriſt ſend an angel from heaven to ſtrengthen you, and enable you with Paul and Silaa, to ſing praiſes at midnight. Are you threatened to be thrown into a den of lions, or caſt into a burning fiery furnace, becauſe you will not bow down and worſhip the boaſt? Fear not; the God whom you ſerve, is able to deliver you: Or, if he ſhould ſuffer the flames to devour your bodies, they would only ſerve as ſo many fiery cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028079_0090_0FD693F6146AA770"/>
to carry your ſouls to God. Thus it was with the martyrs of old; ſo that one, when he was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cried out, <q>Come, you Papiſts, if you want a miracle, here, behold one! This bed of flames is to me a bed of down.</q> Thus it was with almoſt all that ſuffered in former times; For Jeſus, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he withdrew his own divinity from himſelf, yet has always lifted up the light of his countenance upon the ſouls of ſuffering ſaints.—<q>Fear not therefore thoſe that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: but fear him only, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell.</q> Dare, dare, to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, though you ſuffer all manner of perſecution. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are there any true miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt here? You will not be offended if I tell you, that the words of the text are in an eſpecial manner applicable to you. St. Paul wrote them to Timothy: and we, of all men, that live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt expect to ſuffer the ſevereſt perſecution. Satan will endeavour to bruiſe our hoels, let who will eſcape: and it has been the general way of God's providence, in times of perſecution, to permit the ſhepherds firſt to be ſmitten, before the ſheep are ſcattered. Let us not therefore ſhew that we are only hirelings, who care not for the ſheep; but, like the great Shepherd and biſhop of fouls, let us readily lay down our lives for the ſheep. Whilſt others are boaſting of their great preferments, let us rather glory in our great afflictions and perſecutions for the ſake of Chriſt. St. Paul now rejoices that he ſuffered afflictions and perſecutions at Iconium and Lyſtra: Out of all the Lord delivered him; out of all the Lord will deliver us, and cauſe us hereafter to ſit down with him on thrones, when he comes to judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:028079_0091_0FD693F78D2A4CE0"/>
I could proceed; but I am conſcious in this part of my diſcourſe, I ought more particularly to ſpeak to myſelf, knowing that Satan has deſired to have me, that he may <hi>ſift me as wheat.</hi> I know I muſt (how can it be avoided?) ſuffer great things for Chriſt's name ſake. Without a ſpirit of prophecy, we may eaſily diſcern the ſigns of the times. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is even at the doors: The tabernacle of the Lord is already driven into the wilderneſs; the ark of the Lord is fallen into the unhallowed hands of uncircumciſed Philiſtines. They have long ſince put us out of their ſynagogues, and high prieſts have been calling on civil magiſtrates to exert their authority againſt the diſciples of the Lord: Men in power have been breathing out threatnings: We may eaſily gueſs what will follow, impriſonment and ſlaughter. The ſtorm has been gathering ſome time; it muſt break ſhortly. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will fall on me firſt.</p>
            <p>Brethren therefore whether in the miniſtry or not, I beſeech you, <hi>pray for me,</hi> that I may never ſuffer juſtly, as an evil-doer, but only for Righteouſneſs ſake. Oh! pray that I may not deny my Lord in any wiſe, but that I may joyfully follow him, both to priſon and to death, if he is pleaſed to call me to ſeal his truths with my blood. Be not aſhamed of Chriſt, or of his goſpel, though I ſhould become a priſoner of the Lord. Though I am bound, the word of God will not be bound: No; an open, an effectual door is opened for the preaching the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel, and men or devils ſhall never be able to prevail againſt it. Only pray, whether it be in life or death, Chriſt may be glorified in me: Then I ſhall rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
            <p>And now to whom ſhall I addreſs myſelf next?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To thoſe, <q>who perſecute their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028079_0092_0FD693F9986F37F0"/>
for living godly in Chriſt Jeſus.</q> But, what ſhall I ſay to you? Howl and weep for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you: for a little while the Lord permits you to ride over the heads of his people; but, by and by, death will arreſt you, judgment will find you, and Jeſus Chriſt ſhall put a queſtion to you, which ſhall ſtrike you dumb: <q>Why perſecuted you me?</q> You may plead your laws and your canons, and pretend what you do is out of zeal for God; but God ſhall diſcover the curſed hypocrite and ſerpentine enmity of your hearts, and give you over to the tormentors. It is well, if in this life, God does not ſet ſome mark upon you. He pleaded the cauſe of Naboth, when innocently condemned for blaſpheming God and the King; and our Lord ſent forth his armies, and deſtroyed the city of thoſe who killed the prophets, and ſtoned them that were ſent unto them. If you have a mind therefore to fill up the meaſure of your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, go on, perſecute and deſpiſe the diſciples of the Lord: but know, that, for all theſe things, God ſhall bring you into judgment. Nay, thoſe you now perſecute, ſhall be in part your judges, and ſit on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, whilſt you are dragged by infernal ſpirits into a Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, and the ſmoke of your torment ſhall be aſcending up for ever and ever. Lay down therefore, ye rebels, your arms againſt the Moſt High God, and no longer perſecute thoſe who live godly in Chriſt Jeſus. The Lord will plead, the Lord will avenge their cauſe. You may be permitted to bruiſe their heels, yet in the end they ſhall bruiſe your accurſed heads. I ſpeak not this, as though I were afraid of you; for I know in whom I have believed: Only out of pure love I warn you, and becauſe I know not but Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028079_0093_0FD693FD37F90290"/>
may make ſome of you veſſels of mercy, and ſnatch you, even you, perſecutors, as fire-brands out of the fire. Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even perſecutors, the worſt of ſinners: his righteouſneſs is ſufficient for them; his ſpirit is able to purify and change their hearts. He once converted Saul: may the ſame God magnify his power in converting all thoſe who are cauſing the godly in Chriſt Jeſus, as much as in them lies, to ſuffer perſecution! The Lord be with you all, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE great Apoſtle Paul, in one of his epiſtles, informs us, that <hi>whatſoever was written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the holy ſcripture might have hope.</hi> And as without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, or to be accepted in Jeſus, the Son of his love; we may be aſſured, that whatever inſtances of a more than common faith are recorded in the book of God, they were more immediately deſigned by the Holy Spirit for our learning and imitation, upon whom the ends of the world are come. For this reaſon, the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter, mentions a noble catalogue of Old Teſtament ſaints and martyrs, <q>who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, ſtopped the mouths of lions, &amp;c. and are gone before us to inherit the promiſes.</q> A ſufficient confutation, I think, of their error, who lightly eſteem the Old
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028079_0095_0FD694036FB58810"/>
Teſtament ſaints, and would not have them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to Chriſtians, as perſons whoſe faith and patience we are called upon more immediately to follow. If this was true, the apoſtle would never have produced ſuch a cloud of witneſſes out of the Old Teſtament, to excite the Chriſtians of the firſt, and conſequently pureſt age of the church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the profeſſion of their faith. Amidſt this catalogue of ſaints, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, the patriarch Abraham ſhines the brighteſt, and differs from the others, as one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory; for he ſhone with ſuch diſtinguiſhed luſtre, that he was called the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful;</hi> and thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt, are ſaid to be ſons and daughters of, and to be bleſſed, with faithful Abraham. Many trials of his faith did God ſend this great and good man, after he had commanded him to get out from his country, and from his kindred, unto a land which he ſhould ſhew him; but the laſt was the moſt ſevere of all; I mean that of offering up his only ſon. This, by the divine aſſiſtance, I propoſe to make the ſubject of your preſent meditation, and, by way of concluſion, to draw ſome practical inferences, as God ſhall enable me, from this inſtructive ſtory.</p>
            <p>The ſacred penman begins the narrative thus; verſe 1. <hi>And it came to paſs, after theſe things, God did tempt Abraham. After theſe things,</hi> that is, after he had underwent many ſevere trials before, after he was old, full of days, and might flatter himſelf perhaps, that the troubles and toils of life were now finiſhed; <q>after theſe things, God did tempt Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</q> Chriſtians, you know not what trials you may meet with before you die: notwithſtanding you may have ſuffered, and been tried much already, yet, it may be, a greater meaſure is ſtill behind,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028079_0096_0FD694044AD64AC0"/>
which you are to fill up. "Be not high-minded, but fear." Our laſt trials, in all probability, will be the greateſt: and we can never ſay our warfare is accompliſhed, or our trials finiſhed, till we bow down our heads, and give up the ghoſt. <q>And it came to paſs, after theſe things, that God did tempt Abraham.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"God did tempt Abraham." But can the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contradict itſelf? Does not the apoſtle James tell us, that God tempts no man; and God does tempt no man to evil, or on purpoſe to draw him into ſin; for, when a man is thus tempted, he is drawn away of his own heart's luſt, and enticed. But in another ſenſe, God may be ſaid to tempt, I mean, to try his ſervants; and in this ſenſe we are to underſtand that paſſage of Matthew, where we are told, that <q>Jeſus was led up by the Spirit (the good Spirit) into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the devil.</q> And our Lord, in that excellent form of prayer which he has been pleaſed to give us, does not require us to pray that we may not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be led into temptation, but delivered from the evil of it; whence we may plainly infer, that God ſees it fit ſometimes to lead us into temptation, that is, to bring us into ſuch circumſtances as will try our faith, and other Chriſtian graces. In this ſenſe we are to underſtand the expreſſion before us, God did tempt or try Abraham."</p>
            <p>How God was pleaſed to reveal his will at this time to his faithful ſervant, whether by the Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, or divine appearance, or by a ſmall ſtill voice, as he ſpoke to Elijah, or by a whiſper, like that of the Spirit to Philip, when he commanded him to join himſelf to the Eunuch's chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to enquire. It is enough that we are informed, God ſaid unto him, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;

               </gap> Abraham knew it was the voice of God: for, "he ſaid, behold, here I am." O what a holy familiarity (if I may ſo ſpeak) is there between God and thoſe holy ſouls that are united to him by faith in Chriſt Jeſus! God ſays, Abraham: and Abraham ſaid, (it ſhould ſeem without the leaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe) "Behold, here I am," being reconciled to God by the death and obedience of Chriſt, which he rejoiced in, and ſaw by faith afar off; he did not, like guilty Adam, ſeek the trees of the garden to hide himſelf from, but takes pleaſure in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with God, and talketh with him, as a man talketh with his friend. O that CHIRIST-leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners knew what it is to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son? They would envy the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſaints, and count it all joy to be termed enthuſiaſts and fools for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>But what does God ſay unto Abraham; Ver. 3. <q>Take now thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I ſhall tell thee of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Every word deſerves our particular obſervation. Whatever he was to do, he muſt do it now, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, without conferring with fleſh and blood. But what muſt he do? <hi>Take now thy ſon.</hi> Had God ſaid, take now a firſtling, or choiceſt lamb or beaſt of thy flock, and offer it up for a burnt-offering, it would not have appeared ſo ghaſtly; but for God to ſay, <q>Take now thy ſon, and offer him up for a burnt-offering,</q> one would have imagined, was enough to ſtagger the ſtrongeſt faith. But this is not all: It muſt not only be a ſon, but <hi>thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt.</hi> If it muſt be a ſon, and not a beaſt, that muſt be offered, why will not Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael do, the ſon of the bond-woman?

            <p>Well might the apoſtle, ſpeaking of this man of God, ſay, that <hi>againſt hope he believed in hope, and, being ſtrong in faith, gave glory to God:</hi> For, had he not been bleſſed with faith which man never before bad, he muſt have refuſed to comply with this ſevere command. For how many arguments might nature ſuggeſt, to prove that ſuch a command could never come from God, or to excuſe himſelf from obeying it? <q>What! (might the good man have ſaid) butcher my child! it is contrary to the very law of nature: Much more to butcher my dear ſon Iſaac, in whoſe ſeed God himſelf has aſſured me, that all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed. But ſuppoſing I could give up my own affections, and be willing to part with him, though I love him ſo dearly, yet, if I murder him, what will become of God's promiſe? Beſides I am now like a city built upon a hill; I ſhine as a light in the world, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: How then ſhall I cauſe God's name to be blaſphemed, how ſhall I become a by-word among the heathen, if they hear that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a crime which they abhor! But, above all, what will Sarah my wife ſay? How can I ever return to her again, after I have imbrued my hands in my dear child's blood? O that God would parden me in this thing, or take my life in the place of my ſon's!</q> Thus, I ſay, Abraham
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028079_0099_0FD628ACB78735C0"/>
might have argued, and that too ſeemingly with great reaſon, againſt complying with the divine command. But, as before by faith he conſidered not the deadneſs of Sarah's womb, when ſhe was paſt age, but believed on him, who ſaid, <q>Sarah thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon indeed;</q> ſo now being convinced that the ſame God ſpoke to and commanded him to offer up that ſon, and knowing that God was able to raiſe him from the dead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay he obeys the heavenly call.</p>
            <p>O that unbelievers would learn of faithful Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and believe whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it! Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his ſon, and therefore believed, notwithſtanding carnal reaſoning might ſuggeſt many objections. We have ſufficient teſtimony, that God has ſpoken to us by his Son; why ſhould we not alſo believe, though many things in the New Teſtament are above our reaſon? For, where reaſon ends, faith begins. And, however infidels may ſtyle themſelves reaſoners, of all men they are the moſt unreaſonable: For is it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reaſon, to meaſure an infinite by a finite underſtanding, or think to find out the myſteries of godlineſs to perfection?</p>
            <p>But to return to the patriarch Abraham: We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before what plauſible objections he might have made; but he anſwered not a ſingle word: No, without replying againſt his Maker, we are told, ver. 3. that <q>Abraham roſe up early in the morning, and ſaddled his aſs, and took two of his young men with him, and Iſaac his ſon, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and roſe up and went unto the place of which God had told him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this verſe we may gather, that God ſpoke to Abraham in a dream, or viſion of the night: For
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028079_0100_0FD69448D5212E00"/>
it is ſaid, he <hi>roſe up early.</hi> Perhaps it was near the fourth watch of the night, juſt before break of day, when God ſaid, <hi>Take now thy ſon;</hi> and Abraham riſes up early to do ſo; as I doubt not but he uſed to riſe up early to offer up his morning-ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving. It is often remarked of people in the Old Teſtament, that they roſe early in the morning; and particularly of our Lord in the New, that he roſe a great while before day to pray. The morning befriends devotion; and if people cannot uſe ſo much ſelf-deniel as to riſe early to pray, I know not how they will be able to die as a ſtake (if called to it) for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The humility, as well as piety of the patriarch, is obſervable: He ſaddled his own aſs (great men ſhould be humble;) and to ſhew his ſincerity, though he took two of his young men with him, and Iſaac his ſon, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he keeps his deſign as a ſecret from them all: Nay, he does not ſo much as tell Sarah his wife: For he knew not but ſhe might be a ſnare unto him in this affair; and, as Rebeccah afterwards, on another occaſion, adviſed Jacob to flee, ſo Sarah alſo might perſuade Iſaac to hide himſelf; or the young men, had they known of it, might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him away, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> after-ages the ſoldiers reſcued Jonathan out of the hands of Saul. But Abraham ſought no ſuch evaſion, and therefore, like an Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite indeed, in whom there was no guile, he himſelf reſolutely <q>clave the wood for the burnt-offering, roſe up and went unto the place of which God had told him.</q> In the ſecond Verſe, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to offer up his ſon upon one of the mountains which he would tell him of. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to offer his ſon up, but would not then directly tell him the place where: This was to keep him dependent and watching unto prayer: For
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028079_0101_0FD69405D0140B08"/>
there's nothing like being kept waiting upon God; and, if we do, aſſuredly God will reveal himſelf unto us yet further in his own time. Let us prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe what we know, follow providence ſo far as we can ſee already; and what we know not, what we ſee not as yet, let us only be found in the way of duty, and the Lord will reveal even that unto us. Abraham knew not directly where he was to offer up his ſon; but he riſes up and ſets forward, and behold now God ſhews him; and he went to the place of which God had told him. Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Ver. 4. Then on the third day, Abraham lift up his eyes, and ſaw the place afar off.</p>
            <p>So that the place, of which God had told him, was no leſs than three days journey diſtant from the place where God firſt appeared to him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to take his ſon. Was not this to try his faith, and to let him ſee that what he did, was not merely from a ſudden pang of devotion, but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of choice and deliberation? But who can tell what the aged patriarch felt during theſe three days? Strong as he was in faith, I am perſuaded his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els often yearned over his dear ſon Iſaac. Methinks I ſee the good old man walking with his dear child in his hand, and now and then looking upon him, loving him, and then turning aſide to weep. And perhaps, ſometimes he ſtays a little behind to pout out his heart before God; for he had no mortal to tell his caſe to. Then, methinks, I ſee him join his ſon and ſervants again, and talking to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, as they walked by the way. At length, on the third day, he lift up his eyes, and ſaw the place afar off. And, to ſhew that he was yet ſincerely reſolved to do whatſoever the Lord required of him, he even
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028079_0102_0FD6944ADF6E0158"/>
now will not diſcover his deſign to his ſervants, but ſaid, ver. 5. in his young men, (as we ſhould ſay to our worldly thoughts when about to tread the courts of the Lord's home) <q>Abide ye here with the aſs; and I and the lad will go up yonder, and worſhip, and come again to you.</q> This was a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their ſtaying behind; and, it being their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's cuſtom to go frequently to worſhip, they could have no ſuſpicion of what he was going about. And by Abraham's ſaying, that he and the lad would come again, I am apt to think he believed God would raiſe him from the dead, if ſo be he permitted him to offer his child up for a burnt-offering. However that be, he is yet reſolved to obey God to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and therefore,</p>
            <p>Ver. 6. <q>Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Iſaac his ſon; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and they went both of them together.</q> Little did Iſaac think that he was to be offered on that very wood which he was carrying upon his ſhoulders; and therefore, ver. 7. Iſaac innocently, and with a holy freedom (for good men ſhould not keep their children at too great a diſtance) ſpake unto Abraham his father, and ſaid, My father; and he (with equal affection and holy condeſcenſion) ſaid, Here am I, my ſon. And to ſhew how careful Abraham had been (as all chriſtian parents ought to be) to inſtruct his Iſaac how to ſacrifice to God, like a youth train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the way wherein he ſhould go; Iſaac ſaid, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? How beautiful is early piety! How amiable, to hear young people aſk queſtions about ſacrificing to God in an acceptable way! Iſaac knew very well that a lamb was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that a lamb was neceſſary for a proper
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028079_0103_0FD6940DED5D28C0"/>
ſacrifice: Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? Young men and maidens, learn or him.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, it is plain, Iſaac knew nothing of his father's deſign: But I believe by what his father ſaid in anſwer to his queſtion, that now was the time Abraham revealed it unto him.</p>
            <p>Verſe 8. <q>And Abraham ſaid, My ſon, God will provide himſelf a lamb for a burnt-offering.</q> Some think that Abraham by faith ſaw the Lord Jeſus afar off, and here ſpake prophetically of that Lamb of God already ſlain in decree, and hereafter to be actually offered up for ſinners. This was a lamb of God's providing indeed) we dared not have thought of it) to ſatisfy his own juſtice, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him juſt in juſtifying the ungodly. What is all our fire and wood, the beſt preparation and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances we can make or preſent, unleſs God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided himſelf this Lamb for a burnt offering? He could not away with them. The words will well bear this interpretation. But, whatever Abraham might intend, I cannot but think he here made an application, and acquainted his ſon of God's dealing with his ſoul; and at length, with tears in his eyes, and the utmoſt affection in his heart, cried out, <q>Thou art to be the lamb, my ſon; God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to provide thee for a burnt-offering, and to offer thee upon the mountain which we are now aſcending.</q> And, as it appears from a ſubſequent verſe, Iſaac, convinced that it was the divine will, made no reſiſtance at all: for it is ſaid, "they went both of them together;" and again, verſe 9, when we are told that Abraham bound Iſaac, we do not hear of his complaining or endeavouring to eſcape, which he might have done, being (as ſome think) near thirty years of age, and it is plain,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028079_0104_0FD6944C59B613B8"/>
capable enough for carrying wood enough for a burnt-offering. But he was partaker of the like precious faith with his aged father, and therefore is as willing to be offered, as Abraham is to offer him: and ſo they went both of them together.</p>
            <p>Verſe 6. At length <q>they came to the place of which God had told Abraham. He built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Iſaac his ſon, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here let us pauſe awhile, and by faith take a view of the place where the father has laid him. I doubt not but the bleſſed angels hovered round the altar and ſang, Glory be to God in the higheſt, for giving ſuch faith to man. Come, all ye tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted parents, who know what it is to look over a dying child: Fancy that you ſaw the altar erected before you, and the wood laid in order, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Iſaac bound upon it: Fancy that you ſaw the aged parent ſtanding by weeping. (For, why may we not ſuppoſe that Abraham wept, ſince Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wept at the grave of Lazarus?) O what pious, endearing expreſſions paſſed now alternately between the father and the ſon! Joſephus records a pathetic ſpeech made by each, whether genuine I know not: but methinks I ſee the tears trickle down the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Abraham's cheeks; and, out of the abundance of the heart, he cries, Adieu, adieu, my ſon; the Lord gave thee to me, and the Lord calls thee away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord: adieu, my Iſaac, my only ſon, whom I love as my own ſoul; adieu, adieu. I ſee Iſaac at the ſame time meekly reſigning himſelf into his heavenly Father's hands, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt High to ſtrengthen his earthly parent to ſtrike the ſtroke. But why do I attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what either ſon or father felt? It is impoſſible:
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028079_0105_0FD6940ECFE97898"/>
we may indeed form ſome ſaint idea of, but ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully comprehend it, till we come and ſit down with them in the kingdom of heaven, and hear them tell the pleaſing ſtory over again.—Haſten, O Lord, that bleſſed time! O let thy kingdom come!</p>
            <p>And now, ver. 10. The fatal blow is going to be given. <q>And Abraham ſtretched forth his hand, and took the knife to ſlay his ſon.</q> But do you not think he intended to turn away his head, when he gave the blow? Nay, why may we not ſuppoſe be ſometimes drew his hand in, after it was ſtretched out, willing to take another laſt farewel of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Iſaac, and deſirous to defer it a little, though reſolved at laſt to ſtrike home? Be that as it will, his arm is now ſtretched out, the knife is in his hand, and he is about to put it to his dear ſon's throat.</p>
            <p>But ſing, O heavens! and rejoice, O earth! Man's extremity is God's opportunity: for behold, juſt as the knife, in all probability, was near his throat, ver. 11. <q>the angel of the Lord, (or rather, the Lord of angels, Jeſus Chriſt. the angel of the everlaſting covenant) called unto him, (probably in a very audible manner) from heaven, and ſaid, Abraham, Abraham. (The word is doubled to engage his attention; and perhaps the ſuddenneſs of the call made him draw back his hand, juſt as he was going to ſtrike his ſon.) And Abraham ſaid, Here am I,</q>
            </p>
            <p>And he ſaid, verſe 12. <q>Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now know I that thou feareſt God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here then it was that Abraham received his ſon Iſaac from the dead in a figure. He was in effect offered upon the altar, and God looked upon him as
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028079_0106_0FD6944DCBE8DBD0"/>
offered and given unto him. Now it was that Abraham's faith; being tried, was found more precious than gold purified ſeven times in the fire. Now as a reward of grace, though not of debt, for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

convince you, that we are fallen creatures, and that we do not love God or Chriſt as we ought to do: for, if you admire Abraham offering up his Iſaac, how much more ought you to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and adore the love of God, who ſo loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <q>that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life;</q> May we not well cry out Now know we, O Lord, that thou haſt loved us, ſince thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thine only ſon from us? Abraham was God's creature (and God was Abraham's friend) and therefore under the higheſt obligation to ſurrender up his Iſaac. But, O ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous love! Whilſt we were his enemies, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, that he might become a curſe for us. O the freeneſs, as well as the infinity, of the love of God our Father! It is unſearchable: I am loſt in contemplating it; it is paſt finding out. Think, O believers, think of the love of God, in giving Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation for our ſins. And when you hear how Abraham built as altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound Iſaac his ſea, and laid him on the altar upon the wood; think how your heavenly Father bound Jeſus Chriſt his only Son, and offered him upon the altar of his juſtice, and laid upon him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of us all. When you read of Abraham's ſtretching forth his hand to ſlay his ſon, think, O think, how God actually ſuffered his Son to be ſlain, that we might live for evermore. Do you read of Iſaac carrying the wood upon his ſhoulders, upon which he was to be offered. Let this lead you to Mount Calvary, (this very mount of Moriah, where Iſaac was offered, as
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028079_0108_0FD694519118B198"/>
ſome think) and take a view of the antitype Jeſus Chriſt, that Son of God, bearing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink under the weight of that croſs on which he was to hang for us. Do you admire Iſaac ſo freely conſenting to die, though a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore obliged to go when God called? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> do not forget to admire infinitely more the dear Lord Jeſus, that promiſed ſeed, who willingly ſaid, "Lo, I come," though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation ſo to do, "to do thy will," to obey and die for men, O God! Did you weep juſt now, when I bid you fancy that you ſaw the altar, and the wood laid in order, and Iſaac laid bound on the altar? Look up by faith, behold the bleſſed Jeſus, our all-glorious Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, not bound, but nailed on an accurſed tree: ſee how he hangs crowned with thorns, and had in deriſion of all that are round about him: ſee how the thorns pierce him, and how the blood in purple ſtreams trickles down his ſacred temples! Hark how the God of nature groans! See how he bows his head, and at length humanity gives up the ghoſt! Iſaac is ſaved, but Jeſus, the God of Iſaac, dies; a ram is offered up in Iſaac's room, but Jeſus has no ſubſtitute; Jeſus muſt bleed, Jeſus muſt die: God the Father provided this Lamb for himſelf from all eternity. He muſt be offered in time, or man muſt be damned for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And now where are all your tears? Shall I ſay, refrain your voice from weeping? No, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let me exhort you to look to him whom you have pierced, and mourn, as a women mourneth for her firſt-born: for we have been the betrayers, we have been the murderers of this Lord of glory; and ſhall we not bewail thoſe ſins, which brought ſhe bleſſed Jeſus to the accurſed tree? Having
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028079_0109_0FD694161B8B54A0"/>
ſo much done, ſo much ſuffered for us, ſo much forgiven, ſhall we not love much? O! let us love him with all our hearts, and minds, and ſtrength, and glorify him in our ſouls and bodies; for they are his. Which leads me to a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I ſhall draw from the foregoing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>From hence we may learn the nature of true juſtifying faith. Whoever underſtands and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the truth as it is in Jeſus, muſt acknowledge, that ſalvation is God's free gift, and that we are ſaved, not by any or all the works of righteouſneſs which we have done or can do: no; we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly nor in part juſtify ourſelves in the ſight of God. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if we are accepted with God, it muſt be only in and through the perſonal righteouſneſs, the active and paſſive obedience of Jeſus Chriſt his beloved Son. This righteouſneſs muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, or counted over to us, and applied by ſaith to our hearts, or elſe we can in no wiſe be juſtified in God's ſight: and that very moment a ſinner is enabled to ſay hold on Chriſt's righteouſneſs by faith, he is freely juſtified from all his ſins, and ſhall never enter into condemnation, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was a fire-brand of hell before. Thus it was that Abraham was juſtified before he did any good work: he was enabled to believe on the Lord Chriſt; it was accounted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; that is, Chriſt's righteouſneſs was made over to him, and ſo accounted his. This, this is goſpel; this is the only way of finding acceptance with God: good works have nothing to do with our juſtification in his ſight. We are juſtified by faith alone, as ſaith the article of our church; agreeable to which the apoſtle Paul ſays, <q>By grace ye are ſaved, through faith, and that not
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028079_0110_0FD69452B053DF38"/>
of yourſelves; it is the gift of God.</q> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding good works have their proper place: they juſtify our faith, though not our perſons: they follow it, and evidence our juſtification in in the ſight of men. Hence it is that the apoſtle James aſks, was not Abraham juſtified by works (alluding no doubt to the ſtory on which we have been diſcourſing) that is, did he not prove he was in a juſtified ſtate, becauſe his faith was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of good works? This declarative juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſight of men, is what is directly to be underſtood in the words of the text: "Now know I," ſays God, <q>that thou feareſt me, ſince thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me.</q> Not but that God knew it before; but this is ſpoken in condeſcenſion to our weak capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and plainly ſhews, that his offering up his ſon was accepted with God, as an evidence of the ſincerity of his faith, and for this, was left on record to future ages. Hence then you may learn whether you are bleſſed with, and are ſons and daughters of faithful Abraham. You ſay you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; you talk of free grace, and free juſtification: you do well; the devils alſo believe and tremble. But has the faith which you pretend to, influenced your hearts, renewed your ſouls, and, like Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's worked by love? Are your affections, like his, ſet on things above? Are you heavenly-minded, and like him, do you confeſs yourſelves ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth. In ſhort, has your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But I muſt draw one more inference, and with that I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>Learn, O ſaints! from what has been ſaid, to fit looſe to all your worldly comforts; and ſtand really prepared to part with every thing, when God ſhall require it at your hand. Some of you, perhaps, may have friends, who are to you as your own ſouls, and others may have children, in whoſe lives your own lives are bound up: all I believe have their Iſaacs, their particular delights of ſome kind or other. Labour, for Chriſt's ſake, labour, ye ſons and daughters of Abraham, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them, daily in affection to God, that, when he ſhall require you really to ſacrifice them, you may not confer with fleſh and blood, any more than the bleſſed patriarch now before us. And as for you that have been in any meaſure tried like unto him, let his example encourage and comfort you. Remember, Abraham your father was tried ſo before you: think, O think, of the happineſs he now enjoys, and how he is inceſſantly thanking God for tempting and trying him when here below. Look up often by the eye of faith, and ſee him ſitting with his dearly beloved Iſaac in the world of ſpirits. Remember, it will be but a little while, and you ſhall ſit with them alſo, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As this is true of every particular Chriſtian, ſo it
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028079_0114_0FD6945850858DA0"/>
is true of every Chriſtian church in general. For ſome years paſt we have heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Chriſtians, and Chriſtian churches muſt then expect enemies.

            </p>
            <p>The perſecutor Saul, mentioned in the words
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028079_0115_0FD6941B5235BE40"/>
of the text, (and whoſe converſion, God willing. I propoſe to treat on in the following diſcourſe) is a noble inſtance of this kind.</p>
            <p>I ſay, a perſecutor, and that a bloody one: for ſee how he is introduced in the beginning of this chapter: <q>and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of our Lord, went unto the high prieſt, and deſired of him letters to Damaſcus to the ſynagogues, that if he found any of THIS WAY, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jeruſalem.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"And Saul yet breathing out." This implies that he had been a perſecutor before. To prove which, we need only look back to the ſeventh chapter, where we ſhall find him ſo very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably active at Stephen's death, that the <q>witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes laid down their clothes at a young man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> feet, whoſe name was Saul.</q> He ſeems, though young, to be in ſome authority. Perhaps, for his zeal againſt the Chriſtians, he was preferred in the church, and was allowed to ſit in the great council or ſanhedrim: for we are told, chap. viii. ver. 1. "That Saul was conſenting unto his death:" and again, at ver. 3. he is brought in as exceeding all in his oppoſition; for thus ſpeaks the evangeliſt <q>as for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every houſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aling men and women, committed them to priſon.</q> One would have imagined, that this ſhould have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, at leaſt abated the fury of this young zealot. No: being exceedingly mad againſt them, as he himſelf informs Agrippa, and having made havock of all in Jeruſalem, he now is reſolved to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the diſciples of the Lord, even to ſtrange cities; and therefore yet breathing out threatening.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028079_0116_0FD6945B9BC66D88"/>
"Breathing out." The words are very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and expreſſive of his bitter enmity. It was as natural to him now to threaten the Chriſtians, as it was for him to breathe: he could ſcarce ſpeak, but it was ſome threatenings againſt them. Nay, he not only breathed one threatenings, but ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo, (and thoſe who threaten, would alſo ſlaughter, if it were in their power) againſt the diſciples of the Lord. Inſatiable therefore as hell, finding he could not refuſe or ſtop the Chriſtians by force of argument, he is reſolved to do it by force of arms; and therefore went to the high prieſt (foe there never was a perſecution yet without a high prieſt at the head of it) and deſired of him letters, iſſued out of his ſpiritual court, to the ſynagogues or eccleſiaſtical courts at Damaſcus, giving him authority, <q>that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jeruſalem,</q> I ſuppoſe to be arraigned and condemned in the high prieſt's court. Obſerve how be ſpeaks of the Chriſtians. Luke, who wrote the Acts, calls them diſciples of the Lord. And Saul ſtiles then men and women of this way. I doubt not but he repreſented them as a company of upſtart enthuſiaſts, that had lately gotten into a new method or way of living; that would not be content with the temple-ſervice, but they moſt be righteous over-much, and have their private meetings of conventicler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and break bread, as they called it, from houſe to houſe, to the great diſturbance of the eſtabliſhed clergy, and to the utter ſubverſion of all order and decency. I do not hear that the high prieſt makes any objection: no, he was as willing to grant letters, as Saul was to aſk them; and wonderfully pleaſed within himſelf, to find he had ſuch an active zealot to employ againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:028079_0117_0FD6941F0A3DBC10"/>
Well then, a judicial proceſs is immediately iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out, with the high prieſt's ſeal affixed to it. And now methinks I ſee the young perſecutor finely equipped, and pleaſing himſelf with thoughts how triumphantly he ſhould ride back with the men and women of this way, dragging after him to Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>What a condition may we imagine the poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at Damaſcus were in at this time! No doubt they had heard of Saul's impriſoning and making havock of the ſaints at Jeruſalem, and we may well ſuppoſe were appriſed of his deſign againſt them. I am perſuaded this was a growing, becauſe a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time with theſe dear people. O how did they wreſtle with God in prayer, beſeeching him either to deliver them from, or give them grace ſufficient to enable them to bear up under the fury of their perſecutors? The high prieſt doubtleſs with the reſt of his reverend brethren, flattered themſelves, that they ſhould now put an effectual ſtop to this growing hereſy, and waited with impatience for Saul's return.</p>
            <p>But, <q>He that ſitteth in heaven laughs them to ſcorn, the Lord has them in deriſion.</q> And therefore, ver. 3. <q>As Saul journeyed and came even near unto Damaſcus,</q> perhaps to the very gates, (our Lord permitting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to try the faith of his diſciples, and more conſpicuouſly to baffle the deſigns of his enemies) <q>ſuddenly (at mid-day; as he acquaints Agrippa) there ſhined round about him a light from heaven,</q> a light brighter than the ſun; <q>and he fell to the earth, (why not into hell?) and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</q> The word is doubled, Saul, Saul: like that of our Lord to Martha; Martha, Martha; or the prophet, O
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028079_0118_0FD6945BCDFFA610"/>
earth, earth, earth! Perhaps theſe words came like thunder to his ſoul. That they were ſpoken audibly, we are aſſured from verſe 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> His compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions heard the voice. Our Lord now arreſts the perſecuting zealot, calling him by name; for the word never does us good, till we find it ſpoken to us in particular. <q>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou ME?</q> Put the emphaſis upon the word <hi>why,</hi> what evil have I done? Put it upon the word <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt,</hi> why perſecuteſt! I ſuppoſe Saul thought he was not perſecuting; no, he was only putting the laws of the eccleſiaſtical court into execution; but Jeſus, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, ſaw through the hypocriſy of his heart, that, notwithſtanding his ſpecious pretences, all this proceeded from a perſecuting ſpirit, and ſecret enmity of heart againſt God; and therefore ſays, <q>Why perſecuteſt thou ME? Put the emphaſis upon the word ME, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</q> Alas! Saul was not perſecuting Chriſt, was he? He was only taking care to prevent innovations in the church, and bringing a company of enthuſiaſts to juſtice, who otherwiſe would overturn the eſtabliſhed conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Jeſus ſays, "Why perſecuteſt thou me?" For what is done to Chriſt's diſciples, he takes as done to himſelf, whether it be good or whether it be evil. He that touches Chriſt's diſciples, touches the apple of his eye; and they that perſecute the followers of our Lord would perſecute our Lord himſelf, was he again to come and tabernacle amongſt us.</p>
            <p>I do not find that Saul gives any reaſon why he did perſecute; no, he was ſtruck dumb; as every perſecutor will be, when Chriſt Jeſus puts this ſame queſtion to them at the terrible day of judgment. But being pricked at the heart, no doubt with a

This admirably points out the way in which God's Spirit works upon the heart: It firſt powerfully convinces of ſin, and of our damnable ſtate: and then puts us upon inquiring after Jeſus Chriſt. Saul being ſtruck to the ground or pricked to the heart, cries out after Jeſus "Who art thou, Lord?"

This ſeems to be ſpoken to convince Saul more and more of his ſin: and I doubt not, but every word was ſharper than a two-edged ſword, and came like ſo many daggars to his heart: O, how did theſe words affect him! a Jeſus! a Saviour! and yet I am perſecuting him! This ſtrikes him with horror; but then the word Jeſus, though he was a perſecutor, might give him ſome hope. However, our dear Lord, to convince Saul that he was to be ſaved by grace, and that he was not afraid of his power and enmity, tells him, <q>It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</q> As much as to ſhy, though he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, yet he could not overthrow the church of Chriſt: For he would ſit as King upon his holy hill of Zion; tho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

They heard a voice, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe, out not the articulate voice of him that ſpake to Saul, and therefore remained uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. For what are all ordinances, all, even the moſt extraordinary diſpenſations of providence, without Chriſt ſpeaks to the ſoul in them? Thus it is now under the word preached: many, like Saul's companions are ſometimes ſo ſtruck with the outgoings of God appearing in the ſanctuary, that they even ſtand ſpeechleſs; they hear the preacher's voice, but not the voice of the Son of God, who, perhaps at the ſame time is ſpeaking effectually to many other hearts; this I have known often; and what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? O the depth of the ſovereignty of God! It is paſt finding out. Lord, I deſire to adore what I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. <q>Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight!</q>

But to return to Saul: the Lord bids him ariſe and go into the city; and we are told, verſe 8. that <q>Saul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roſe from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,</q> (he was ſo overpowered with the greatneſs of the light that ſhone upon them, that) <q>he ſaw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damaſcus,</q> that very city which was to be the place of his executing or impriſoning the diſciples of the Lord. <q>And he was three days without fight, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did eat nor drink</q> But who can tell what horrors of conſcience, what convulſion of ſoul, what deep and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> convictions of ſin he underwent during theſe three long days? It was this took away his appetite, (for who can eat or drink when under a ſenſe of the wrath of God for ſin?) and, being to be greatly employed hereafter, he muſt be greatly humbled now; therefore the Lord leaves him three days groaning under the ſpirit of bondage, and buffetted, no doubt, with the fiery darts of the devil, that, being tempted like unto his brethren, he might be able hereafter, to ſuccour thoſe that were tempted. Had Saul applied to any of the blind guides of the Jewiſh church under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they would have ſaid, he was mad, or going beſide himſelf; as many carnal teachers and blind Phariſees now deal with, and ſo more and more diſtreſs poor ſouls labouring under awakening convictions of their damnable ſtate. But God often at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> firſt awakenings, viſits us with ſore trials, eſpecially thoſe who are, like Saul, to ſhine in the church, and to be uſed as inſtruments in bringing many ſons to glory: thoſe who are to be highly exalted, muſt firſt be deeply humbled; and this I ſpeak for the comfort of ſuch, who may be now groaning under the ſpirit of bondage, and perhaps,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028079_0123_0FD69427B9DBB0F8"/>
like Saul, can neither eat nor drink; for I have generally obſerved, that thoſe who have had the deepeſt convictions, have afterwards been favoured with the moſt precious communications, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed moſt of the divine preſence in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. This was afterwards remarkably exemplified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Saul, who was three days without ſight, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did eat nor drink.</p>
            <p>But will the Lord leave his poor ſervant in this diſtreſs? No: his Jeſus (though Saul perſecuted him) promiſed and he will perform, that it <q>ſhould be told him what he muſt do. And there was a certain diſciple at Damaſcus, named Ananias, and unto him ſaid the Lord, in a viſion, Ananias; and he ſaid, Behold, I am here, Lord.</q> What a holy familiarity is there between Jeſus Chriſt and regenerate ſouls! Ananias had been uſed to ſuch love-viſits, and therefore knew the voice of his beloved. The Lord ſays, Ananias; Ananias ſays, "Behold, I am here, Lord." Thus it is that Chriſt now, as well as formerly, often talks with his children at ſundry times, and after divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as a man talketh with his friend.—But what has the Lord to ſay to Ananias?</p>
            <p>Ver. 11. <q>And the Lord ſaid unto him, ariſe, and go into the ſtreet, which is called Streight, and enquire in the houſe of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarſus;</q> (ſee here for your comfort, O children of the moſt high God, what notice Jeſus Chriſt takes of the ſtreet, and the houſe where his own dear ſervants lodge) "for behold, he prayeth;" but why is this uſhered in with the word <hi>behold?</hi> What, was it ſuch a wonder to hear that Saul was praying? Why, Saul was a Phariſee, and therefore no doubt, faſted and made long prayers: and, ſince we are told that he profited above many of his
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028079_0124_0FD694657A7295E0"/>
equals, I doubt not but he was taken notice of for his gift in prayer; and yet it ſeems, that before theſe three days, Saul never prayed in his life; and why; Becauſe, before theſe three days, he never felt himſelf a condemned creature: he was alive in his own opinion, becauſe without a knowledge of the ſpiritual meaning of the law; he felt not a want of, and therefore, before now, cried not after a Jeſus, and conſequently, though he might have ſaid, or made a prayer, as many Phariſees do now-a-days, he never prayed a prayer; but now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! he prayed indeed; and this was urged as one reaſon why he was converted. None of God's children, as one obſerves, comes into the world ſtill-born; prayer is the very breath of the new creature: and therefore, if we are prayerleſs, we are CHRIST-leſs; if we never had the ſpirit of ſupplication, it is a ſad ſign that we never had the ſpirit of grace in our ſouls: and you may be aſſured you never did pray, unleſs you have felt yourſelves ſinners, and ſeen the want of Jeſus to be your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. May the Lord, whom I ſerve in the goſpel of his dear Son, prick you all to the heart, and may it be ſaid of you all as it was of Saul, Behold, they pray!</p>
            <p>The Lord goes on to encourage Ananias to go to Saul: ſays he, verſe 12. <q>For he hath ſeen in a viſion a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his ſight.</q> So that though Chriſt converted Saul immediately by himſelf, yet he will carry on the work, thus begun, by a miniſter. Happy they, who under ſoul-troubles have ſuch experienced guides, and as well acquainted with Jeſus Chriſt as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in God; he will carry on his own work without them.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, Ananias was a good man; but ſhall I commend him for his anſwer to our Lord? I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him not: for, ſays he, ver. 13. <q>Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints at Jeruſalem: and here he hath authority from the chief prieſts to bind all that call upon thy name.</q> I fear this anſwer proceeded from ſome relics of ſelf-righteouſneſs, as well as infidelity, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> undiſcovered in the heart of Ananias. <q>Ariſe, (ſaid our Lord) and go into the ſtreet, which is called Streight, and enquire in the houſe of Judas, for one called Saul of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; for behold he prayeth!</q> One would think this was ſufficient to ſatisfy him: but ſays Ananias, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man" (he ſeems to ſpeak of him with much contempt; for even good men are apt to think too contemptuouſly of thoſe who are yet in their ſins) <q>how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints at Jeruſalem; and here, he hath authority from the chief prieſts, to bind all that call upon thy name.</q> And what then, Ananias? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Who made thee to differ? Could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted thee, convert him alſo! Surely Ananias here forgets himſelf, or perhaps fears, left this man, who had authority from the chief prieſts to bind all that call upon Chriſt's name, ſhould bind him alſo, if he went unto him; but the Lord ſilences all objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a <q>Go thy way, for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and kings, and the children of Iſrael.

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028079_0126_0FD69467153C0518"/>
and preaching to him the doctrine of election. And the frequent converſion of notorious ſinners to God, to me is one great proof, amongſt a thouſand others, of that precious, but too much exploced, and ſadly miſrepreſented doctrine of God's electing love; for whence is it that ſuch are taken, whilſt thouſands not near ſo vile, die ſenſeleſs and ſtupid? All the anſwer that can be given, is, <q>They are choſen veſſels; Go thy way, (ſays God) for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Iſrael: for I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my name's ſake.</q> Obſerve what a cloſe connection there is between doing and ſuffering for Chriſt. If any of my brethren in the miniſtry are preſent, let them hear what preferment we muſt expect, if we are called out to work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably for God: not great prebendaries or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprics, but great ſufferings for our Lord's name ſake; theſe are the fruits of our labour; and he that will not contentedly ſuffer great things for preaching Chriſt, is not worthy of him. Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be found to be the beſt preferment, when we are called to give an account of our miniſtry at the great day.</p>
            <p>I do not hear, that Ananias quarrelled with God concerning the doctrine of election: no; O that all good men would, in this, learn of him! <q>He went his way, and entered into the houſe; and put his hands on him, and ſaid, Brother Saul;</q> juſt now it was this man; now it is Brother Saul: It is no matter what a man has been, if he be now a Chriſtian; the ſame ſhould be our brother, our ſiſter, and mother: God blots out every convert's tranſgreſſions as with a thick cloud, and ſo ſhould we; the more vile a man

has been, the more ſhould we love him when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt will be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified on this behalf. I doubt not, but Ananias was wonderfully delighted to hear that ſo remarkable a perſecutor was brought home to God?

            <p>The ſcales then are now removed from the eyes of Saul's mind; Ananias has done that for him, under God; he muſt now do another office—bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him, and ſo receive him into the viſible church of Chriſt; a good proof to me of the neceſſity of baptiſm where it may be had: for I find here, as well as elſewhere, that baptiſm is adminiſtered even to thoſe who had received the Holy Ghoſt; Saul was convinced of this, and therefore aroſe and was baptized; and now it is time for him ſo recruit the outward man, which, by three days abſtinence and ſpiritual conflicts, had been much impaired: we are therefore told (verſe 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lovely was this meeting; ſo lovely, that it ſeemed Saul continued certain days with them, to communicate experiences, and to learn the way of God more perfectly, to pray for a bleſſing on his future miniſtry, and to praiſe

Chriſt Jeſus for what he had done for their ſouls. Saul, perhaps, had ſat certain years at the feet of Gamaliel, but undoubtedly learnt more theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days, than he had learnt before in all his life. It pleaſes me to think how this great ſcholar is transformed by the renewing of his mind: what a mighty change was here! That ſo great a man as Saul was, both as to his ſtation in life, and internal qualifications, and ſuch a bitter enemy to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; for him, I ſay, to go and be certain days with the people of <hi>this mad way,</hi> and to ſit quietly, and be taught by illiterate men, as many of theſe diſciples we may be ſure were, what a ſubſtantial proof was this of the reality of his converſion!</p>
            <p>What a hurry and confuſion may we ſuppoſe the chief prieſts now were in! I warrant they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry out, what! is he alſo deceived? As for the common people, who knew not the law and are accurſed; for them to be carried away, is no ſuch wonder, but for a man bred at the feet of Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel, for ſuch a ſcholar ſuch an enemy to the cauſe as Saul; for him to be led away with a company of fifty, deceived men and women, ſurely it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: We cannot believe it. But Saul ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of the reality of his becoming a fool for Chriſt's ſake: For ſtraightway, inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deliver the letters from the high prieſts, as they expected, in order to bring the diſciples that were at Damaſcus bound to Jeruſalem, <q>he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues, that he is the Son of God.</q> This was another proof of his being converted. He not only converſed with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in private, but he preached Chriſt publickly in the ſynagogues: Eſpecially, he inſiſted on the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Lord, proving, notwithſtanding the ſtate of humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</p>

               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:028079_0131_0FD69430925FC410"/>
But why did Saul preach Chriſt thus? Becauſe he had felt the power of Chriſt upon his own ſoul. And here is the reaſon why Chriſt is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> preached, and his divinity ſo ſlights inſiſted on in our ſynagogues, becauſe the generality of thoſe that pretend to preach him never felt a ſaving work of converſion upon their own ſouls. How can they preach, unleſs they are firſt taught of, and then ſent by God? Saul did not preach Chriſt before he knew him; no more ſhould any one elſe. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted miniſter, though he could ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, will be but as a ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing braſs and tinkling cymbal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o thoſe whoſe ſenſes are exerciſed to diſcern ſpiritual things.

               </gap> the Spirit and with power, unleſs they preach from experience, and have had a proof of his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by a work of grace wrought upon their own ſouls. God forgive thoſe who lay hands on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man, knowing that he is ſuch: I would not do it for a thouſand worlds. Lord Jeſus, keep thy own ſervants pure, and let them not be then partakers of other men's ſins!</p>
            <p>Such an inſtance as was Saul's converſion, we may be aſſured, muſt make a great deal of noiſe; and, therefore, no wonder we are told, ver. 21. <q>But all that heard him were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this he that deſtroyed them who called on this name in Jeruſalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief prieſts?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it will be with all that appear publickly for Jeſus Chriſt; and it is as impoſſible for a true Chriſtian to be hid, as a city built upon a hill.

in general muſt ſuffer; miniſters in particular muſt ſuffer great things. But let not this move any of us from our ſtedfaſtneſs in the goſpel: He that ſtood by and ſtrengthened Saul, will alſo ſtand by and ſtrengthen us: He is a God mighty to ſave all that put their truſt in him. If we look up with an eye of faith, we, as well as the firſt martyr St. Stephen, may ſee Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God, ready to aſſiſt and protect us. Though the Lord's feat is in heaven, yet he has reſpect to his ſaints in an eſpecial manner, when ſuffering here on earth: Then the Spirit of Chriſt and of glory reſts upon their ſouls. And, if I may ſpeak my own experience. <q>I never enjoy more rich communications from God, than when deſpiſed and rejected of men for the fake of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> However little they may deſign it, my enemies are my greateſt friends. What I moſt fear, is a calm; but the enmity which is in the hearts of natural men againſt Chriſt, will not ſuffer them to be quiet long: No; as I hope the work of God will increaſe, ſo the rage of men and devils will increaſe alſo. Let us put on, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the whole armour of God: Let us not fear the face of men: Let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You have juſt now heard of a proud, powerful zealot ſtopped in his full career, ſtruck down to the earth with a light from heaven, converted by the almighty power of efficacious grace, and thereupon zealouſly promoting, nay, reſolutely ſuffering for, the faith which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

our Lord may give them repentance unto life? Moſt think, that Chriſt had reſpect to Stephen's prayer, when he converted Saul. Perhaps for this reaſon God ſuffers his adverſaries to go on, that his goodneſs and power may ſhine more bright in their converſion.</p>
            <p>But let not the perſecutors of Chriſt take encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from this to continue in their oppoſition. Remember, though Saul was converted, yet the high prieſt and Saul's companions, were left dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: And, if this ſhould be your caſe, you will of all men be moſt miſerable: For perſecutors have the loweſt place in hell. And, if Saul was ſtruck to the earth by a light from heaven, how will you be able to ſtand before Jeſus Chriſt, when he comes in terrible majeſty to take vengeance on all thoſe who have perſecuted his goſpel? Then the queſtion, "Why perſecuted thou me?" will cut you through and through. The ſecret enmity of your hearts ſhall be then detected before men and angels, and you ſhall be doomed to dwell in the blackneſs of darkneſs for evermore. Kiſs the Son therefore, leſt he be angry: For even you may yet find mercy, if you believe on the Son of God: Though you perſecute him, yet he will be your Jeſus. I cannot deſpair of any of you, when I find a Saul among the diſciples at Damaſcus. What though your ſins are as ſcarlet, the blood of Chriſt ſhall waſh them as white as ſnow. Having much to be forgiven, deſpair not; only believe, and like Saul, of whom I have now been ſpeaking, love much. He counted himſelf the chiefeſt ſinner of all, and therefore laboured more abundantly than all Who is there among you fearing the Lord?

Not as though Jeſus Chriſt was not God alſo; but God the Father is the fountain of the Deity; and, if we conſider Jeſus Chriſt acting as Mediator, God the Father is greater than he; there was an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal contract between the Father and the Son: <q>I have made a covenant with my choſen, and I have ſworn unto David my ſervant;</q> now David was a type of Chriſt, with whom the Father made a covenant, that if he would obey and ſuffer, and make himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, he ſhould <q>ſee his ſeed, he ſhould prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his hands.</q> This compact our Lord refers to, in that glorious prayer recorded in the 17th chap. of John; and therefore he prays for, or rather demands with a full aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, all that were given to him by the Father: <q>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</q> For this ſame reaſon the apoſtle breaks out into praiſes of God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for he loved the elect with an everlaſting love, or as our Lord expreſſes it, <q>before the foundation of the world;</q> and therefore, to ſhew them to whom they were beholden for their ſalvation, our Lord, in the 25th of Matthew, repreſents himſelf, ſaying, <q>Come, ye bleſſed children of my Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q> And thus, in reply to the mother of Zebedee's children, he ſays, <q>It is not mine to give, but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of the Father.</q>

            <p>Would to God, this point of doctrine was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered more, and people were more ſtudious of the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son! we ſhould not then have ſo much diſputing againſt the doctrine of election, or hear it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (even by good men) as a doctrine of devils. For my own part, I cannot ſee how true humbleneſs of mind can be attained without a knowledge of it; and though I will not ſay, that every one who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies election is a bad man, yet I will ſay, with that ſweet ſinger, Mr. Trail, it is a very bad ſign: ſuch a one, whoever he be, I think cannot truly know himſelf: for, if we deny election, we muſt, partly at leaſt glory in ourſelves; but our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo ordered, that no fleſh ſhould glory in the divine preſence; and hence it is, that the pride of man oppoſes this doctrine, becauſe according to this doctrine, and no other, <q>he that glories muſt glory only in the Lord.</q> But what ſhall I ſay? Election is a myſtery that ſhines with ſuch reſplendent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that, to make uſe of the words of one who has drank deeply of electing love, it dazzles the week eyes even of ſome of God's dear children; however, tho' they know it not, all the bleſſings they receive, an the privileges they door will enjoy through Jeſus Chriſt, flow from the everlaſting love of God tho Father: <q>But of him are you in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</q>
            </p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come to ſhew what theſe bleſſings are, which are here, through Chriſt, made over to the elect And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt is made to them wiſdom; but wherein does true wiſdom conſiſt? Was I to aſk ſome of you, perhaps you would ſay, in indulging the luſt of the fleſh, and ſaying to your ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, eat, drink, and be merry; but this is only the wiſdom of brutes; they have as good a guſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for ſenſual pleaſures, as the greateſt epicure an earth. Others would tell me true wiſdom conſiſted in add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe to houſe, and field to field, and calling lands after their own names; but this cannot be true wiſdom; for riches often take to them wings and fly away, like an eagle towards heaven. Even wiſdom itſelf aſſures us, <q>that a man's life doth not conſiſt in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſes;</q> vanity, vanity, all theſe things are vanity; for, if riches leave not the owner, the owners muſt ſoon leave them; <q>for rich men muſt alſo die, and leave their riches for others;</q> their riches cannot procure them redemption from the grave, whither we are all haſtening apace.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you deſpiſe riches and pleaſure, and therefore place wiſdom in the knowledge of books: but it is poſſible for you to tell the numbers of the ſtars, and call them all by their names, and yet be mere fools; learned men are not always wiſe; nay, our common learning ſo much cried up, makes men only ſo many accompliſhed fools; to keep you therefore no longer in ſuſpenſe, and withal to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, I will ſend you to a heathen ſchool, to learn what true wiſdom is: <hi>know thyſelf,</hi> was a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of the wiſe men of Greece; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true wiſdom, and this is that wiſdom ſpoken of in the text, and which Jeſus Chriſt has made to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028079_0140_0FD694768EF066E0"/>
all elect ſinners; they are made to know themſelves, ſo as not to think more highly of themſelves, than they ought to think. Before they were darkneſs; now they are light in the Lord; and in that light they ſee their own darkneſs; they now bewail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as fallen creatures by nature, dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, ſons and heirs of hell, and children of wrath; they now ſee that all their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are as filthy rags; that there is no health in their ſouls; that they are poor and miſerable, blind, and naked; and that there is no name given under heaven, whereby they can be ſaved, but that of Jeſus Chriſt. They ſee the neceſſity of cloſing with a Saviour, and behold the wiſdom of God in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing him to be a Saviour; they are alſo made willing to accept ſalvation upon our Lords own terms, and to receive him as their all in all: thus Chriſt is made to them wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Righteouſneſs. <q>Who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs;</q> Chriſt's whoſe perſonal righteouſneſs is made over to, and accounted theirs. Being enabled to lay hold on Chriſt by faith, God the Father blots out their tranſgreſſions, as with a thick cloud; their ſins, and their iniquities he remembers no more; they are made the righteouſneſs of God in Jeſus, who is the end of the ſaw for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. In one ſenſe, God now ſees no ſin in them; the whole covenant of works is fulfilled in them; they are actually juſtified, acquitted, and looked upon as righteous in the ſight of God; they are perfectly accepted in the Beloved; they are complete in him; the flaming ſword of God's wrath, which before moved every way, is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and free acceſs given to the tree of life; they are enabled now to reach out the arm of faith,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028079_0141_0FD6943E11116280"/>
and pluck and live for evermore. Hence it is that the apoſtle, under a ſenſe of this bleſſed privilege, breaks out into this triumphant language; <q>it is Chriſt that juſtifies, who is he that condemns?</q> Does ſin condemn? Chriſt's righteouſneſs delivers believers from the guilt of it: Chriſt is their Saviour, and is become a propitiation for their ſins: who therefore ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? Does the law condemn? By haring Chriſt's righteouſneſs imputed to them, they are dead to the law, as a covenant of works: Chriſt has fulfilled it for them, and in their ſtead. Does death threaten them? They need not fear: The ſting of death is ſin, the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but God has given them the victory, by imputing to them the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And what a privilege in here! Well might the angels at the birth of Chriſt, ſay to the humble ſhepherds <q>Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joys unto you that believe in Chriſt, a Saviour is born.</q> And well may they rejoice at the converſion of poor ſinners: for the Lord is their righteouſneſs: they have peace with God, through faith in Chriſt's blood, and ſhall never enter into condemnation. O believers! (for this diſcourſe is intended in a ſpecial manner for you) lift up your heads; <q>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I ſay, rejoice.</q> Chriſt is made to you of God, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, what then ſhould you fear? you are made the righteouſneſs of God in him; you may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, "The Lord our righteouſneſs." Of what then ſhould you be afraid? What ſhall ſeparate you henceforward from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? No; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028079_0142_0FD6947D0B931AB0"/>
principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who of God is made unto you righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>This is a glorious privilege, but this is only the beginning of the happineſs of believers: for,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt is not only made to them righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but ſanctification. By ſanctification, I do not mean a bare hypocritical attendance on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances (though rightly informed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians will think it their duty and privilege conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend on all outward ordinances.) Nor do I mean by ſanctification, a bare outward reformation, and a few tranſient convictions, or a little legal ſorrow; for all this an unſanctified man may have; but, by ſanctification, I mean a total renovation of the whole man; by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers become legally, by ſanctification they are made ſpiritually, alive; by one they are entitled to, by the other they are made meet for glory. They are ſanctified therefore throughout, in ſpirit, ſoul and body.</p>
            <p>Their underſtandings which were before dark, now become light in the Lord: and their wills, before contrary to, now become one with the will of God: their affections are now ſet on things above; their memory is now filled with divine things; their natural conſciences are now enlightened; their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which were before inſtruments of uncleanneſs, and of iniquity unto iniquity, are now inſtruments of righteouſneſs and true holineſs; in ſhort, they are new creatures; <q>old things are paſſed away, all things are become new,</q> in their hearts; ſin has now no longer dominion over them; they are freed from the power, though not the indwelling
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028079_0143_0FD6943F8E8773B0"/>
and being of it; they are holy both in heart and life, in all manner of converſation; they are made partakers of a divine nature; and from Jeſus Chriſt, they receive grace for grace; and every grace that is in Chriſt, is copied and tranſcribed into their ſouls; they are transformed into his likeneſs; he is formed within them; they dwell in him, and he in them; they are led by the Spirit, and bring forth the fruits thereof; they know that Chriſt is their Immanuel, God with and in them; they are living temples of the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore, being a holy habitation unto the Lord, the whole Trinity dwells and walks in them; even here, they ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt in heavenly places, and are vitally united to him, their head, by a living faith; their Redeemer, their Maker, is their Huſband; they are fleſh of his fleſh, bone of his bone; they talk, they walk with him, as a man talketh and walketh with his friend; in ſhort, they are one with Chriſt, even as Jeſus Chriſt and the Father are one.</p>
            <p>Thus is Chriſt made to believers ſanctification. And O what a privilege is this! To be changed from beaſts into ſaints, and from a deviliſh to be made partakers of a divine nature; to be tranſlated from the kingdom of Satan, into the kingdom of God's dear Son! To put off the old man, which is corrupt, and to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, O what an unſpeakable bleſſing is this! I almoſt ſtand amazed at the contemplation thereof. Well might the apoſtle exhort believers to rejoice in the Lord; indeed they have reaſon always to rejoice, yea, to rejoice on a dying bed; for the kingdom of God is in them; they are changed from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord: well may this be a
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028079_0144_0FD6947E90B71D20"/>
myſtery to the natural, for it is a myſtery even to the ſpiritual man himſelf, a myſtery which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fathom. Does it not often dazzle your eyes, O ye children of God, to look at your own bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the candle of the Lord ſhines out, and your Redeemer lifts up the light of his bleſſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon your ſouls? Are you not aſtoniſhed, when you feel the love of God ſhed abroad in your hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, and God holds out the golden ſceptre of his mercy, and bids you aſk what you will, and it ſhall be given you? Does not that peace of God, which keeps and rules your hearts, ſurpaſs the utmoſt limits of your underſtandings? And is not the joy you feel unſpeakable? Is it not full of glory? I am perſuaded it is; and in your ſecret communion, when the Lord's love flows in upon your ſouls, you are as it were ſwallowed up in, or, to uſe the apoſtle's phraſe, <q>filled with all the fulneſs of God.</q> Are you not ready to cry out with Solomon, <q>And will the Lord, indeed, dwell thus with men? How is it that we ſhould be thus thy ſons and daughters, O Lord God Almighty!</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you are children of God, and know what it is to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son; if you walk by faith, and not by fight; I am aſſured this is frequently the language of your hearts.</p>
            <p>But look forward, and ſee an unbounded proſpect of eternal happineſs lying before thee, O believer! What thou haſt already received, are only the firſt fruits, like the cluſter of grapes brought out of the land of Canaan; only an earneſt and pledge of yet infinitely better things to come: the harveſt is to follow; thy grace is hereafter to be ſwallowed up in glory. Thy great Joſhua, and merciful High Prieſt, ſhall adminiſter an abundant entrance to thee into the land of promiſe, that reſt which awaits

the children of God: for Chriſt is not only made to believers, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, but alſo redemption.</p>
            <p>But, before we enter upon the explanation and contemplation of this privilege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Learn hence the great miſtake of thoſe writers, and clergy, who, notwithſtanding they talk of ſanctification and inward holineſs, (as indeed ſometimes they do, though in a very looſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial manner) yet they generally make it the cauſe, whereas they ſhould conſider it as the effect, of our juſtification. Of him "are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs," and then ſanctification. For Chriſt's righteouſneſs, or that which Chriſt has done in our ſtead without us, is the ſole cauſe of our acceptance in the ſight of God, and of all holineſs wrought in us. To this, and not to the light within, or any thing wrought within, ſhould poor ſinners ſeek for juſtification in the ſight of God: for the ſake of Chriſt's righteouſneſs alone, and not any thing wrought in us, does God look favourably upon us; our ſanctification at beſt, in this life, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete: Though we are delivered from the power, we are not freed from the in-being of ſin; but not only the dominion, but the in-being of ſin, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the perfect law of God: For it is not ſaid, <q>thou ſhalt not give way to luſt, but, thou ſhalt not luſt.</q> So that whilſt the principle of luſt remains in the leaſt degree in our hearts, though we are otherwiſe never ſo holy, yet we cannot, on account of that, hope for acceptance with God: We muſt firſt therefore, look for a righteouſneſs without us, even the righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For this reaſon the apoſtle mentions it, and puts it before ſanctification in the words of the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028079_0146_0FD6948010A932A0"/>
text. And whoſoever teacheth any other doctrine, doth not preach the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence alſo, the Antinomians and formal hypocrites may be confuted who talk of Chriſt without, but know nothing, experimentally, of a work of ſanctification wrought within them. Whatever they may pretend to, ſince Chriſt is not in them, the Lord is not their righteouſneſs, and they have no well-grounded hope of glory: For though ſanctification is not the cauſe, yet it is the effect of our acceptance with God; <q>who of God is made unto us righteouſneſs and ſanctification.</q> He therefore, that is really in Chriſt, is a new creature; it is not going back to a covenant of works, to look into our hearts, and, ſeeing that they are changed and renewed, from thence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a comfortable and well-grounded aſſurance of the ſafety of our ſtates: No, but this is what we are directed to in ſcripture; by our bringing forth the fruits, we are to judge whether or no we ever did truly partake of the Spirit of God. <q>We know, (ſays John) that we are paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren.</q> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may talk of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt legal preachers; yet, if we are not holy in heart and life, if we are not ſanctified and renewed by the Spirit in our minds, we are ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, we are only formal hypocrites: For we muſt not put aſunder what God has joined together; we muſt keep the medium between the two extremes: not inſiſt ſo much on the one hand upon Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as to exclude Chriſt within, as an evidence of our being his, and as a preparation for future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor on the other hand, ſo depend on inherent righteouſneſs or holineſs wrought in us, as to exclude the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt without us. But;</p>

4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us now go on, and take a view of the other link, or rather the end, of the believer's golden chain of privileges, redempion. But we muſt look very high; for the top of it, like Jacob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ladder, reaches heaven, where all believers will aſcend, and be placed at the right hand of God. <q>Who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a golden chain indeed! And, what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> can ever be broken aſunder from another. Wat there no other text in the book of God, this ſingle one ſufficiently proves the final perſeverance of true believers: for never did God yet juſtify a man, whom he did not ſanctify; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſanctify one whom he did not completely redeem and glorify; no, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect; he always carried on and finiſhed the work he began; thus it was in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo it is in the new creation; when God ſays, "let there be light," there is light, that ſhines more and more unto the perfect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when believers enter into their eternal reſt, as God entered into his. Thoſe whom God has juſtified, he has in effect glorified: for as a man's worthineſs was not the cauſe of God's giving him Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſo neither ſhall his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs be a cauſe of his taking it away; God's gifts and callings are without repentance, and I cannot think they are clear in the notion of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, who deny the final perſeverance of the ſaints; I fear, they underſtand juſtification in that low ſenſe, which I underſtood it in a few years ago, as implying no more than remiſſion of ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but it not only ſignifies remiſſion of ſins paſt, but alſo a foederal right to all good things to come. If God has given us his only Son, how will he not with him freely give us all things? Therefore, the apoſtle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028079_0148_0FD694C2130D8870"/>
he ſays, "who of God is made unto us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs," does not ſay, perhaps he may be made to us ſanctification and redemption; but he is made: for there is an eternal, indiſſoluble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between theſe bleſſed privileges. As the obedience of Chriſt is imputed to believers, ſo his perſeverance in that obedience is to be imputed to them alſo: and it argues great ignorance of the covenant of grace and redemption to object againſt it.</p>
            <p>By the word redemption, we are to underſtand, not only a complete deliverance from all evil, but alſo a full enjoyment of all good both in body and ſoul: I ſay both in body and ſoul; for the Lord is alſo for the body; the bodies of the ſaints in this life are temples of the Holy Ghoſt; God makes a covenant with the duſt of believers; after death, though worms deſtroy them, yet, even in their fleſh ſhall they ſee God. I fear, indeed there are ſome Sadducees in our days, or at leaſt heretics who ſay, either, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eſh, at the day of judgment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and conſeqently, we muſt throw aſide the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper. For why ſhould we remember the Lord's death until he come to judgment, when he is already come to judge our heart, and will not come a ſecond time? But all this is only the reaſoning of unlearned, unſtable men, who certainly know not what they ſay, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they affirm. That we muſt follow our Lord in the regeneration, be partakers of a new birth, and that Chriſt muſt come into our hearts, we freely confeſs, and we hope, when ſpeaking of theſe things, we ſpeak no more than what we know and

            <p>Here then, O believers! is one, though the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, degree of that redemption which you are to be partakers of hereafter; I mean, the redemption of your bodies: For this corruptable muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, this mortal muſt put on immortality.

            <p>But what is the redemption of the body, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the redemption of the better part, our ſouls? I muſt, therefore ſay to you believers, as the angel ſaid to John, "Come up higher," and let us take as clear a view as we can, at ſuch a diſtance, of the redemption Chriſt has purchaſed for, and will ſhortly put you in actual poſſeſſion of. Already you are juſtified, already you are ſanctified, and thereby freed from the guilt and dominion of ſin: but, as I have obſerved, the being and indwelling of ſin yet remains in you; God ſees it proper to leave ſome Amalekites in the land, to keep his Iſrael in action.</p>
            <p>The moſt perfect Chriſtian, I am perſuaded, muſt agree, according to one of our articles, <q>that the corruption of nature remains even in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;

that the fleſh luſteth always againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</q> So that believers cannot do things for God with that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they deſire; this grieves their righteous ſouls day by day, and, with the holy apoſtle, makes them to cry out, <q>Who ſhall deliver us from the body of this death!</q> I thank God, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will, but not completely before the day of our diſſolution; then will the very being of ſin be deſtroyed, and an eternal ſtop put to inbred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling corruption. And is not this a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? I am ſure believers eſteem it ſo: for there is nothing grieves the heart of a child of God ſo much, as the remains of indwelling ſin. Again, believers are often in heavineſs through manifold temptations; God ſees that it is needful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But be not weary; be not faint in your minds: the time of your complete redemption draweth nigh.

who count the lives of Chriſtians to be madneſs, and their end to be without honour? Unhappy men! you know not what you do. Were your eyes open, and had you ſenſes to diſcern ſpiritual things, you would not ſpeak all manner of evil againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, but you would eſteem them as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ones of the earth, and envy their happineſs; your ſouls would hunger and thirſt after it: you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo would become fools for Chriſt's ſake. You boaſt of wiſdom; ſo did the Philoſophers of Corinth: but your wiſdom is the fooliſhneſs of folly in the ſight of God. What will your wiſdom avail you, if it does not make you wiſe unto ſalvation? Can you, with all your wiſdom, propoſe a more conſiſtent ſcheme to build your hopes of ſalvation on, than what has now been laid down before you? Can you with all the ſtrength of natural reaſon, find out a better way of acceptance with God, than by the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Is it right to think your own works can in any meaſure deſerve or procure it? If not, why will you not believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Do not you find that you are full of diſorders and that theſe diſorders make you unhappy? Do not you find that you cannot change your own hearts? Have you not reſolved many and many a time, and have not your corruptions yet dominion over you? Are you not bond-ſlaves to your luſts, and led captive by the devil at his will? Why then will you not come to Chriſt for ſanctification? Do you not deſire to die the death of the righteous, and that your future ſtate may be like theirs? I am perſuaded you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the thoughts of being annihilated, much leſs of being miſerable for over. Whatever you may pretend, if you ſpeak truth, you muſt confeſs,

You have no righteouſneſs; away, therefore, to Chriſt: He is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. You are unholy; flee to the Lord Jeſus: he is full of grace and truth? and of his fulneſs, all may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that believe in him. You are as if afraid to die; let this drive you to Chriſt: he has the keys of death and hell; in him is plenteous redemption; he alone can open the door which leads to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Let not therefore, the deceived rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner boaſt any longer of his pretended reaſon. Whatever you may think, it is the moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing in the world not to believe on Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſent. Why, why will you die? Why will you not come unto him, that you may have life? Ho? every one that thirſteth, come unto the waters of life and drink freely: Come, buy without money and without price. Were theſe bleſſed privileges in the text to be purchaſed with money you might ſay, we are poor, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy: or, were they to be conferred only on ſinners of ſuch a rank or degree, then you might ſay, how can ſuch ſinners as we expect to be ſo highly favoured? But they are to be freely given of God to the worſt of ſinners. To us, ſays the apoſtle; to me a perſecutor, to you Corinthians, who were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

idolaters. Therefore, each poor ſinner may ſay then, why not unto me? Has Chriſt but one bleſſing? What if he has bleſſed millions already, by turning them away from their iniquities; yet, he ſtill continues the ſame: he lives for ever to make interceſſion, and therefore will bleſs you, even you alſo. Though, Eſau-like, you have been profane, and hitherto depiſed your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's birth-right; even now, if you believe, Chriſt will be made to you of God, <q>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt turn again to believers, for whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as I obſerved before, this diſcourſe was particularly intended. You ſee, brethren, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the heavenly calling, what great bleſſings are treaſured up for you in Jeſus Chriſt your head, and what you are entitled to by believing on his name. Take heed, therefore, that ye walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Think often how highly you are favoured; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, you have not choſen Chriſt, but Chriſt hath choſen you. Put on (as the elect of God) humbleneſs of mind, and glory, but let it be only in the Lord: for you have nothing but what you have received of God. By nature, ye were as fooliſh, as legal, as unholy, and in as damnable a condition as others. Be pitiful, therefore, be courteous; and, as ſanctification in a progreſſive work, beware of thinking you have already attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let him that is holy, be holy ſtill; knowing that he who is moſt pure in heart, ſhall hereafter enjoy the cleareſt viſion of God. Let indwelling fin be your daily burden; and not only bewail and lament, but ſee that you ſubdue it daily by the power of divine grace; and look up to Jeſus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to be the finiſher, as well as the author of your
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028079_0156_0FD694CECBFE3890"/>
faith. Build not on your own faithfulneſs, but on God's unchangeableneſs. Take heed of thinking you ſtand by the power of your own free-will. The everlaſting love of God the Father muſt be your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope and conſolation: let this ſupport you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all trials. Remember that God's gifts and callings are without repentance; that Chriſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once loved you, will love you to the end. Let this conſtrain you to obedience, and make you long and look for that bleſſed time. when he ſhall not only be your wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but alſo complete and everlaſting redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>THOUGH there be ſome who dare to deny the Lord Jeſus, and diſbelieve the revelation he has been pleaſed to give us, and thereby bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction; yet I would charitably hope there are but few, if any ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you to whom I am now to preach the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Was I to aſk you, <q>how you expect to be juſtified in the ſight of an offended God?</q> I ſuppoſe you would anſwer, only for the ſake of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But, was I to come more home to your conſciences, I fear moſt would make the Lord Jeſus but in part their Saviour, and go about, as it were, to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own. And this is not thinking contrary to the rules of Chriſtian charity: For we are all ſelf-righteous by nature; it is as natural for us to turn back to a covenant of works, as for the ſparks to fly upwards. We have had ſo many legal and ſo few free-grace preachers, for theſe many years, that moſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors now ſeem to be ſettled upon their lees, and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028079_0158_0FD694D0548D0838"/>
rather deſerve the title of Phariſees than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with the generality of the people during the time of our Lord's public miniſtrations: And therefore, in almoſt all his diſcourſes, he preached the goſpel to poor ſinners, and denounced terrible woes againſt proud ſelf-juſticiaries. The parable to which the words of the text belong, looks both theſe ways: For the evangeliſt informs as, (ver. 9) that our Lord <q>ſpake it unto certain who truſted in themſelves, than they were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and depiſed others</q> And a notable para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is; a parable worthy your moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. "He that hath ears to hear let him hear" what Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks to all viſible profeſſors in it.</p>
            <p>Ver. 16. "Two men went up to the temple to pray," (and never two men of more oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters) <q>the one a Phariſee, and the other a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</q> The Phariſees were the ſtricteſt ſect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews. I was of the ſtricteſt ſect of the Phariſees ſays Paul. They prayed often; not only ſo, but they made long prayers; and, that they might appear extraordinary devout, they would pray at the corners of the ſtreet, where two ways met, that people going or coming, both ways, might ſee them. <q>They made broad (as our Lord informs us) the borders of their philacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</q> they had pieces of parchment ſown to their long robes, on which ſome parts of the ſcripture were written, that people might from thence infer, that they were lovers of the law of God. They were ſo very punctual and exact in outward puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, that they waſhed at their going out and coming in. They held the waſhing of pots, brazen veſſels and tables, and many other ſuch like things they did. They were very zealous for the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028079_0159_0FD69492CD12A248"/>
of the fathers, and for the obſervation of the rites and ceremonies of the church, notwithſtanding they frequently made void the law of God by their traditions. And they were ſo exceedingly exact in the outward obſervation of the Sabbath, that they condemned our Lord for making a little clay with his ſpittle; and called him a ſinner, and ſaid, he was not of God, becauſe he had given ſight to a man born blind, on the Sabbath-day. For theſe reaſons they were had in high veneration among the people, who were ſadly miſled by theſe blind guides. They had the uppermoſt places in the ſynagogues, and greetings in the market places (which they loved dearly) and were called of men, Rabbi; in ſhort, they had ſuch a reputation for piety, that it became a proverb among the Jews, that if there were but two men ſaved, the one of them muſt be a Phariſee.</p>
            <p>As for the Publicans it was not ſo with them. It ſeems they were ſometimes Jews, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of the gate; for we find the one here coming up to the temple; but for the generality, I am apt to think they were Gentiles; for they were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Roman taxes, and uſed to amaſs much wealth (as appears by the confeſſion of Zaccheus one of the chief of them) by wronging men by falſe accuſations. They were ſo univerſally infamous, that our Lord himſelf tells his diſciples, the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated man ſhould be to them as a Heathen man, or a Publican. And the Phariſees thought it a ſufficient impeachment of our Lord's character, that he was a <q>friend to Publicans and ſinners, and went to ſit down with them at meat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, however they diſagreed in other things, they agreed in this, that public worſhip is a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon all: For they both came up to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028079_0160_0FD694D225362F20"/>
The very Heathens were obſervers of temple-worſhip. We have very early notice of men's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to, and calling upon the name of the Lord, in the Old Teſtament! and I find it no where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in the New. Our Lord, and his apoſtles, went up to the temple, and we are commanded by the apoſtle, <q>not to forſake the aſſembling of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together,</q> as the manner of too many is in our days; and ſuch too, as would have us think well of them, though they ſeldom or never tread the courts of the Lord's houſe. But, though our devotions begin in our cloſets, they muſt not end there. And, if people never ſhew their devotions abroad, I muſt ſuſpect they have little or none at home. "Two men went up to the temple." And what went they thither for? Not (as multitudes amongſt us do) to make the houſe of God a houſe of merchandiſe, or to turn it into a den of thieves; much leſs to ridicule the preacher, or diſturb the congregation. No, they came to the temple, ſays our Lord, to pray. Thither ſhould the tribes of God's ſpiritual Iſrael go up, to walk with and pour out their hearts before the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Two men went up to the temple to pray." I fear one of them forgot his errand. I have often been at a loſs what to call the Phariſee's addreſs. It certainly does not deſerve the name of a prayer: He may rather be ſaid to come to the temple to boaſt, than to pray; for I do not find one word of confeſſion of his original guilt; not one ſingle pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for pardon of his paſt actual ſins, or for grace to help and aſſiſt him for the time to come: he only brings in God, as it were, a reckoning of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and does that, which no fleſh can juſtly do, I mean, glory in his preſence.</p>
            <p>Verſe 11. <q>The Phariſee ſtood, and prayed thus
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028079_0161_0FD69497751D61B0"/>
with himſelf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers or even as this Publican.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord firſt takes notice of his poſture; the Phariſee ſtood, he is not to be condemned for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for prayer. When you ſtand praying, ſays our Lord; though ſometimes our Lord kneeled, nay, lay flat on his face upon the ground; his apoſtles alſo kneeled, as we read in the Acts, which has made me wonder at ſome, who are ſo bigotted to ſtanding in family as well as public prayer that they will not kneel, notwithſtanding all kneel that are around them. I fear there is ſomething of the Phariſee is this conduct. Kneeling and ſtanding are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, if the knee of the ſoul be bent, and the hear upright towards God. We ſhould ſtudy not to be particular in indifferent things, leſt we offend weak minds. What the Phariſee is remarked for, is his ſtanding by himſelf: For the words may be rendered, he ſtood by himſelf, upon ſome eminent place, at the upper part of the temple, near the holy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

who really pray by the Spirit: I only would hereby give a word of reproof to thoſe who are to bigotted to extempore prayer, that they condemn, at leaſt judge, all that uſe forms, as though not ſo holy and heavenly, as others who pray without them. Alas! this is wrong. Not every one that prays extempore is a ſpiritual, nor every one that prays with a form, a formal man. Let us not judge one another; let not him that uſes a form, judge him that prays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore, on that account; and let not him that prays extempore, deſpiſe him who uſes a form. "The Phariſee ſtood, and prayed thus by himſelf." Which may ſignify alſo praying inwardly in his heart; for there is a way (and that an excellent one too) of praying when we cannot ſpeak; thus Anna prayed when ſhe ſpoke not aloud, only her lips moved. Thus God ſays to Moſes, <q>Why crieſt thou?</q> when it is plain, he did not ſpeak a word. This is what the apoſtle means by the <q>Spirit making interceſſion (for believers) with groanings which cannot be uttered.</q> For there are times when the ſoul is too big to ſpeak; when God fills as it were, and overſhadows it with his preſence, ſo that it can only fall down, worſhip, adore, and lie in the duſt before the Lord. Again, there is a time when the ſoul is benumbed, barren, and dry, and the believer has not a word to ſay to his heavenly Father; and then the heart only can ſpeak. And I mention this for the encouragement of weak Chriſtians, who think they never are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted but when they have a flow of words, and fancy they do not pleaſe God at the bottom, for no other reaſon but becauſe they do not pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Such would do well to conſider, that God knows the language of the heart, and the mind of the ſpirit; and that we make uſe of words, not to

<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028079_0165_0FD694D6D3FEC258"/>
had to truſt in himſelf that he was righteous, merely becauſe he was not an extortioner, unjuſt, adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for all this while he might be, as he certainly was, (as is alſo every ſelf-righteous perſon) as proud as the devil. But he not only boaſts, but lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God (as all ſelf-juſticiaries will be found liars here or hereafter.) He thanks God that he was not unjuſt: but is it not an act of the higheſt injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to rob God of his prerogative! Is it not an act of injuſtice to judge our neighbour? And yet of both theſe crimes this ſelf-righteous vaunter is guilty. "Even as this Publican!" He ſeems to ſpeak with the utmoſt diſdain; <hi>this Publican!</hi> Perhaps he pointed at the poor man, the others might treat him with the like contempt. Thou proud, confident boaſter, what hadſt thou to do with that poor Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican? Suppoſing other Publicans were unjuſt, and extortioners, did it therefore follow that he muſt be ſo? Or if he had been ſuch a ſinner, how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou but he has repented of thoſe ſins? His coming up to the temple to pray, is one good ſign of a reformation at leaſt. Thou art therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, O Phariſee, who thus judgeſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican: for thou that judgeſt him to be unjuſt, art, in the very act of judging, unjuſt thyſelf: thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is only the ſacrifice of a fool.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen what the Phariſee's negative good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes to; I think, nothing at all. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Phariſee is not here condemned for his faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for faſting is a Chriſtian duty; "when you faſt," ſays our Lord, thereby taking it for granted, that his diſciples would faſt. And <q>when the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom

ſhall be taken away, then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days.</q> In faſting often, ſays the apoſtle. And all that would not be caſt-aways, will take care, as their privilege, without legal conſtraint, to "keep their bodies under, and bring them into ſubjection." The Phariſee is only condemned for making a righteouſueſs of his faſting, and thinking that God would accept him, or that he was any better then his neighbours, merely on account of his faſting: this is what he was blamed for. The Phariſee was not to be diſcommended for faſting twice in a week; I wiſh ſome Chriſtians would imitate him more in this: but to depend on faſting in the leaſt, for his juſtification in the fight of God was really abominable. "I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs:" He might as well have ſaid, I pay tithes. But ſelf righteous people (whatever they may ſay to the contrary) think they give-ſomething to God. I give tithes, of all that I poſſeſs: I make conſcience of giving tithes, not only of all that the law requires, but of my mint, anniſe, and cummin, of all things whatſoever I poſſeſs; this was well; but to boaſt of ſuch things, or of faſting, is Phariſaical and deviliſh. Now then let us ſum up all the righteouſneſs of this boaſting Phariſee, and ſee what little reaſon he had to truſt in himſelf, that he was righteous, or to deſpiſe others. He is not unjuſt (but we have only his word for that, I think I have proved the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;) he is no adulterer, no extortioner; he faſts twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he poſſeſſes; and all this he might do, and a great deal more, and yet be a child of the devil: for here is no mention made of his loving the Lord his God with all his heart, which was the "firſt and great commandment of the law;" here is not a ſingle ſyllable of inward religion; and he was not a true
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028079_0167_0FD694D973C05E08"/>
Jew, who was only one outwardly. It is only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide piety at the beſt; inwardly he is full of pride, ſelf-juſtification, free-will, and great uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.</p>
            <p>Were not the Phariſees, do you think, highly offended at this character? For they might eaſily know that it was ſpoken againſt them. And though perhaps ſome of you may be offended at me, yet, out of love, I muſt tell you, I fear this parable is ſpoken againſt many of you: For are there not many of you, who go up to the temple to pray, with no better ſpirit than this Phariſee did? And becauſe you faſt it may be in the Lent, or every Friday; and becauſe you do nobody any harm, receive the ſacrament, pay tithes, and give an alms now and then; you think that you are ſafe, and truſt in yourſelves that you are righteous, and inwardly deſpiſe thoſe, who do not come up to you in theſe outward duties? This, I am perſuaded, is the caſe of many of you, though, alas! it is a deſperate one, as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew at the cloſe of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Let us now take a view of the Publican, verſe 13. <q>And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto heaven. but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner.</q>

            <p>The "Publican ſtanding afar off." Perhaps in the outward court of the temple, conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he was not worthy to approach the holy of holies; ſo conſcious, and ſo weighed down with a ſenſe of his own unworthineſs, that he would not ſo much as lift up his eyes unto heaven, which he knew was God's throne. Poor heart! what did he feel at this time! None but returning Publicans, like himſelf, can tell. Methinks I ſee him ſtanding

afar off, penſive, oppreſſed, and even overwhelmed with ſorrow; ſometimes he attempts to look up; but then; thinks he, the heavens are unclean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And to ſhew that his heart was full of holy ſelf-reſentment, and that he ſorrowed after a godly ſort, he ſmote upon his breaſt; the word in the original implies, that he ſtruck hard upon his breaſt: he will lay the blame upon none but his own wicked heart. He will not, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled Adam, tacitly lay the fault of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What think you? would this Publican have been offended if any miniſter had told him that he deſerved to be
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028079_0169_0FD694DB4F5F3DE0"/>
damned? would he have been angry, if any one had told him, that by nature he was half a devil and half a beaſt? No: he would have confeſſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hells to have been his due, and that he was an earthly, deviliſh ſinner. He felt now what a dreadful thing it was to depart from the living God: he felt that he was inexcuſable every way: that he could in nowiſe, upon account of any thing in himſelf, be juſtified in the ſight of God; and therefore lays himſelf at the feet of ſovereign mercy, "God be merciful to me a ſinner." Here is no confidence in the fleſh, no plea fetched from faſting, paying tithes, or the performance of any other duty; here is no boaſting that he was not an extortioner, unjuſt, or an adulterer. Perhaps he had been guilty of all theſe crimes, at leaſt he knew he would have been guilty of all theſe, had he been left to follow the devices and deſires of his own heart; and therefore, with a broken and contrite ſpirit, he cries out, <q>God be merciful to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>

            <p>This man came up to the temple to pray, and he prayed indeed. And a broken and a contrite heart God will not deſpiſe.

            <p>Hear this, all ye ſelf-juſticiaries, tremble, and behold your doom! a dreadful doom, more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than words can expreſs, or thought conceive! If you refuſe to humble yourſelves, after hearing this parable, I call heaven and earth to witneſs againſt you this day, that God ſhall viſit you with all his ſtorms, and pour all the vials of his wrath upon your rebellious heads; you exalted yourſelves here, and God ſhall abaſe you hereafter; you are as proud as the devil, and with devils ſhall you dwell to all eternity. Be not deceived, God is not mocked; he ſees your hearts, he knows all things. And notwithſtanding you may come up to the temple to pray, your prayers are turned into ſin, and you go down to your houſes unjuſtified, if you are ſelf-juſticiaries; and do you know what it
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028079_0172_0FD694A0565FC0B0"/>
is to be unjuſtified? Why, if you are unjuſtified, the wrath of God abideth upon you; you are in your blood; all the curſes of the law belong to you: Curſed are you when you go out, curſed are you when you come in; curſed are your thoughts, curſed are your words, curſed are your deeds; every thing you do, ſay, or think from morning to night, is only one continued ſeries of ſin. However highly you may be eſteemed in the ſight of men, however you may be honoured with the uppermoſt ſeats in the ſynagogues in the church militant, you will have no place in the church triumphant. Humble yourſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God: Pull down every ſelf-righteous thought, and every proud imagination, that now exalteth itſelf againſt the perfect, perſonal, imputed righteouſneſs of the dear Lord Jeſus: For he (and he alone) that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>
            <p>He that humbleth himſelf, whatever he be; if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of faſting twice in the week, he has been drunk twice in the week; if, inſtead of giving tithes of all that he poſſeſſes, he has cheated the miniſter of his tithes, and king of his taxes; notwithſtanding he be unjuſt, an extortioner, an adulterer, nay, notwithſtanding the ſins of all mankind center and unite in him; yet, if through grace, like the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, he is enabled to humble himſelf, he ſhall be exalted; not in a temporal manner; for Chriſtians muſt rather expect to be abaſed, and to have their names caſt out as evil and to lay down their lives for Chriſt Jeſus in this world: But he ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in a ſpiritual ſenſe; he ſhall be freely juſtified from all his ſins by the blood of Jeſus; he ſhall have peace with God, a peace which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; not only peace, but joy in believing; he ſhall be tranſlated from the kingdom of Satan, to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028079_0173_0FD694DF70A7B428"/>
the kingdom of God's dear Son: He ſhall dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him: He ſhall be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with him: He ſhall drink of divine pleaſures as out of a river: He ſhall be ſanctified throughout in ſpirit, ſoul, and body; in one word, he ſhall be filled with all the fulneſs of God. Thus ſhall the man who humbleth himſelf be exalted here; but O how high ſhall he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted hereafter! as high as the higheſt heavens, even to the right hand of God: There he ſhall ſit, happy both in ſoul and body, and judge angels; high, out of the reach of all ſin and trouble, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſecure from all danger of falling. O ſinners, did you but know how highly God intends to exalt thoſe who humble themſelves and believe in Jeſus, ſurely you would humble yourſelves, at leaſt beg of God to humble you; for it is he that muſt ſtrike the rock of your hearts; and cauſe floods of contrite tears to flow therefrom. O that God would give this ſermon ſuch a commiſſion, as he once gave to the rod of Moſes! I would ſtrike you through and through with the rod of his word, until each of you was brought to cry out with the poor Publican, "God be merciful to me a ſinner." What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant language would this be in the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth!</p>
            <p>Are there no poor ſinners among you? What, are you all Phariſees? Surely, you cannot bear the thoughts of returning home unjuſtified; can you? what if a fit of the apoplexy ſhould ſeize you, and your ſouls be hurried away before the awful judge of quick and dead? What will you do without Chriſt's righteouſueſs? If you go out of the world unjuſtified, you muſt remain ſo for ever. O that you would humble yourſelves! then would the Lord exalt you; it may be, that, whilſt I am ſpeaking,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028079_0174_0FD694A1E4EC8B90"/>
the Lord might juſtify you freely by his grace. I obſerved, that perhaps the Publican had a ſenſe of his juſtification before he went from the temple, and knew that his pardon was ſealed in heaven: And who knows but you may be thus exalted before you go home, if you humble yourſelves? O what peace, love, and joy, would you then feel in yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hearts! You would have a heaven upon earth. O that I could hear any of you ſay (as I once heard a poor ſinner, under my preaching, cry out) <q>He is come, he is come!</q> How would you then, like him, extol a precious, a free-hearted Chriſt? How would you magnify him for being ſuch a friend to Publicans and ſinners? Greater love can no man ſhew, than to lay down his life for a friend; but Chriſt laid down his life for his enemies, ever for you, if you are enabled to humble yourſelves, as the Publican did. Sinners, I know not how to leave off talking with you; I would fill my mouth with arguments, I could plead with you. Come, let us reaſon together; though your ſins be as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, yet if you humble yourſelves, they ſhall be as white as ſnow. One act of true faith in Chriſt juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies you for ever and ever; he has not promiſed you what he cannot perform; he is able to exalt you: For God hath exalted, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow; nay, God hath exalted him to be not only a Prince, but a Saviour. May he be a Saviour to you! and then I ſhall have reaſon to rejoice in the day of judgment, that I have not preached in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>

            <p>THESE words contain part of a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which the bleſſed Jeſus was pleaſed to make to his weeping and ſorrowful diſciples. The time was now drawing near, in which the Son of man was firſt to be lifted upon the croſs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to heaven. Kind, wondrous kind! had this merciful High-prieſt been to his diſciples, during the time of his tabernacling amongſt them. He had compaſſion on their infirmities, anſwered for them when aſſaulted by their enemies, and ſet them right when out of the way, either in principle or practice. He neither called nor uſed them as ſervants, but as friends: and he revealed his ſecrets to them from time to time. He opened their underſtandings, that they might underſtand the ſcriptures; explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the hidden myſteries of the kingdom of God, when he ſpoke to others in parables: Nay, he became the ſervant of them all, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to waſh their feet. The thoughts of parting with ſo dear and loving a maſter as this.

eſpecially for a long ſeaſon, muſt needs affect them much. When on a certain occaſion he intended to be abſent from them only for a night; we are told, he was obliged to conſtrain them to leave him; no wonder then, that when he now informed them he muſt entirely go away, and that the Phariſees in his abſence would put them out of their ſynagogues, and excommunicate them; yea, that the time ſhould come, that whoſoever killed them, would think they did God ſervice (a prophecy, one would imagine, in an eſpecial manner deſigned for the ſuffering miniſters of this generation;) no wonder, I ſay, conſidering all this that we are told, ver. 6, Sorrow had filled their hearts: <q>Becauſe I have ſaid the things unto you, ſorrow hath filled your hearts.</q> The expreſſion is very emphatical; their hearts were ſo full of concern, that they were ready to burſt. In order, therefore, to reconcile them to this mournful diſpenſation our dear and compaſſionate Redeemer ſhews them the neceſſity he lay under to leave them; <q>Nevertheleſs I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away:</q> As though he had ſaid, Think not, my dear diſciples, that I leave you out of anger: No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is for your ſakes, for your profit that I go away: For if I go not away, if I die not upon the croſs for your fins, and riſe again for your juſtification, and aſcend into heaven to make interceſſion, and plead my merits before my Father's throne, the Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Holy Ghoſt, will not, cannot come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you: And, that they might know what he was to do, <q>When he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The perſon referred to in the words of the text, is plainly the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt; and the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028079_0177_0FD694E8573A3678"/>
promiſe was firſt made to our Lord's apoſtles. But though it was primarily made to them, and was literally and remarkably fulfilled at the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, when the Holy Ghoſt came down as a ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mighty wind, and alſo when three thouſand were pricked to the heart by Peter's preaching; yet, as the apoſtles were the repreſentatives of the whole body of believers, we muſt infer, that this promiſe muſt be looked upon as ſpoken to us, and to our children, and to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</p>
            <p>My deſign from theſe words, is to ſhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Holy Ghoſt generally works upon the hearts of thoſe, who, through grace, are made veſſels of mercy, and tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</p>
            <p>I ſay, generally: for as God is a ſovereign agent, his ſacred ſpirit bloweth not only on whom, but when and how it liſteth. Therefore, far be it from me to confine the Almighty to one way of acting; or ſay, that all undergo an equal degree of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no, there is a holy variety in God's methods of calling home his elect. But this we may affirm aſſuredly, that, wherever there is a work of true conviction and converſion wrought upon a ſinner's heart, the Holy Ghoſt, whether by a greater or leſs degree of inward ſoul-trouble, does that which our Lord Jeſus told the diſciples, in the words of the text, that he ſhould do when he came.</p>
            <p>If any of you ridicule inward religion, or think there is no ſuch thing as our feeling or receiving the Holy Ghoſt, I fear my preaching will be quite fooliſhneſs to you, and that you will underſtand me no more than if I ſpoke to you in an unknown tongue. But as the promiſe in the text is made to the world, and as I know it will be fulfilling till
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028079_0178_0FD694A69A9A68D8"/>
time ſhall be no more, I ſhall proceed to explain the general way whereby the Holy Ghoſt works upon every converted ſinner's heart; and I hope that the Lord, even whilſt I am ſpeaking, will be pleaſed to fulfil it in many of your hearts. <q>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of fin of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The word which we tranſlate reprove, ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be rendered convince; and in the original at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a conviction by way of argumentation, and coming with a power upon the mind equal to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. A great many ſcoffers of theſe loſt days, will aſk ſuch as they term pretenders to the Spirit, how they feel the Spirit, and how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Spirit? They might as well aſk, how they know, and how they feel the ſun when it ſhines upon the body? For with equal power and demonſtration does the Spirit of God work upon and convince the ſoul. And.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> It convinces of ſin; and generally of ſome enormous ſin, the worſt perhaps the convicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever was guilty of. Thus, when our Lord was converſing with the woman of Samaria, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her firſt of her adultery: <q>Woman, go call thy huſband. The woman anſwered, and ſaid, I have no huſband. Jeſus ſaid unto her, Thou haſt well ſaid, I have no huſband: for thou haſt had five huſbands, and he whom thou now haſt, is not thy huſband; in this ſaidſt thou truly.</q> With this, there went ſuch powerful conviction of all her other actual ſins, that ſoon after, ſhe <q>left her water-pot, and went her way into the city, and ſaith to the men, Come, and ſee a man that told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Chriſt?</q> Thus our Lord alſo dealt with the perſecutor Saul: he convinced him firſt of the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028079_0179_0FD694EBAA1262C0"/>
horrid ſin of perſecution; <q>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</q> Such a ſenſe of all his other ſins, probably at the ſame time revived in his mind, that immediately he died; that is, died to all his falſe confidences, and was thrown into ſuch an agony of ſoul, that he continued three days, and neither did eat nor drink. This is the method the Spirit of God generally takes in dealing with ſinners; he firſt convinces them of ſome heinous actual fin, and at the ſame time brings all their other ſins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembrance; and as it were ſets them in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-array before them: <q>When he is come, he will reprove the world of fin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And was it ever thus with you, my dear hearers? (For I muſt queſtion you as I go along, becauſe I intend, by the divine help, to preach not only to your heads, but your hearts.) Did the Spirit of God ever bring all your ſins thus to remembrance, and make you cry out to God, <q>thou writeſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things againſt me?</q> Did your actual ſins ever appear before you, as though drawn in a map? If not, you have great reaſon (unleſs you were ſanctified from the womb) to ſuſpect that you are not convicted, much more not converted, and that the promiſe of the text was never yet fulfilled in your hearts.</p>
            <p>Farther: When the Comforter comes into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's heart, though it generally convinces the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his actual ſin firſt, yet it leads him to ſee and bewail his original ſin, the fountain from which all theſe polluted ſtreams do flow.</p>
            <p>Though every thing in the earth, air and water; every thing both without and within, concur to prove the truth of that aſſertion in the ſcripture, "in Adam we have all died;" yet moſt are ſo hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028079_0180_0FD694AB0D198BD0"/>
they may give an aſſent to the truth of the propoſition in their heads, yet they never felt it really in their hearts. Nay, ſome in words profeſſedly deny it, though their works too, too plainly prove them to be degenerate ſons of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate father. But when the Comforter, the Spirit of God, arreſts a ſinner, and convinces him of ſin, all carnal reaſoning againſt original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, every proud and high imagination, which exalteth itſelf againſt that doctrine, is immediately thrown down; and he is made to cry out, <q>Who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death;</q> he now finds that concupiſcence is ſin; and does not ſo much bewail his actual ſins, as the inward perverſeneſs of his heart, which he now finds not only to be an enemy to, but alſo direct enmity againſt God.</p>
            <p>And did the Comforter, my dear friends, ever come with ſuch a convincing power as this into your hearts? Were you ever made to ſee and feel, that in your fleſh dwelleth no good thing; that you are conceived and born in ſin; that you are by nature children of wrath; that God would be juſt if he damned you, though you never committed an actual ſin in your lives? So often as you have been at church and ſacrament, did you ever feelingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that there was no health in you; that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of your original and actual ſins was grievous unto you, and the burden of them intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? If not, you have been only offering to God vain oblations; you never yet prayed in your lives, the Comforter never yet came effectually into your ſouls: conſequently you are not in the faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; no, you are at preſent in a ſtate of death and damnation.</p>
            <p>Again, the Comforter, when he comes effectually
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028079_0181_0FD694ECDFC9BDB8"/>
to work upon a ſinner, not only convinces him of the ſin of his nature, and the ſin of his life, but alſo of the ſin of his duties.</p>
            <p>We all naturally are legalliſts, thinking to be juſtified by the works of the law. When ſomewhat awakened by the terrors of the Lord, we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, like the Phariſees of old, go about to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſs, and think we ſhall find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, if we ſeek it with tears: find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves damned by nature and our actual ſins, we then think to recommend ourſelves to God by our duties, and hope, by our doings of one kind or another, to inherit eternal life. But, whenever the Comforter comes into the heart, it convinces the ſoul of theſe falſe reſts, and makes the ſinner to ſee that all his righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags; that his beſt works are but ſo many ſplendid ſins; and that, for the moſt pompous ſervices he deſerves no better a doom than that of the unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to be thrown into outer darkneſs, where is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
            <p>And was this degree of conviction ever wrought in any of your ſouls? Did the Comforter ever come into your hearts, ſo as to make you ſick of your duties, as well as your ſins? Were you ever, with the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, made to abhor your own righteouſneſs which is by the law, and acknowledge that you deſerve to be damned, though you ſhould give all your goods to feed the poor? Were you made to feel, that your very repentance needed to be repented of, and that every thing in yourſelves is but dung and droſs? And that all the arguments you can fetch for mercy, muſt be out of the heart and pure unmerited love of God? Were you ever made to lie at the feet of ſovereign grace, and to ſay, Lord, if thou wilt, thou mayeſt ſave
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028079_0182_0FD694AC75508388"/>
me; if not, thou mayeſt juſtly damn me; I have nothing to plead; I can in no wiſe juſtify myſelf in thy ſight; my beſt performances, I ſee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me; and all I have to depend upon is thy free grace? What ſay you? Was this, ever, or is this now; the habitual language of your hearts? You have been frequently at the temple; but did you ever approach it in the temper of the poor Publican; and, after you have done all, acknowledge that you have done nothing; and upon a feeling experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſenſe of your own unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs every way, ſmite upon your breaſts, and ſay, <q>God be merciful to us ſinners?</q> If you never were thus minded, the Comforter never yet effectually came into your ſouls, you are out of Chriſt; and if God ſhould require your ſouls in that condition, he would be no better to you than a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>But there is a fourth ſin, of which the comforter, when he comes, convinces the ſoul, and which alone (it is very remarkable) our Lord mentions as though it was the only ſin worth mentioning; for indeed it is the root of all other ſins whatſoever: It is the reigning as well as the damning ſin of the world. And what now do you imagine that ſin may be; It is that curſed ſin, that root of all other evils, I mean the ſin of unbelief. <q>Of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But does the Chriſtian world or any of you that hear me this day, want the Holy Ghoſt to convince you of unbelief? Are there any infidels here? Yes, (O that I had not too great reaſon to think ſo) I fear moſt are ſuch: Not indeed ſuch infidels as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly deny the Lord that bought us (though I fear too many even of ſuch monſters are in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;) but I mean ſuch unbelievers, that have no more faith in Chriſt than the devils themſelves.
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028079_0183_0FD694EE68477278"/>
Perhaps you may think, you believe, becauſe you repeat the creed, or ſubſcribe to a confeſſion of ſaith, becauſe you go to church or meeting, receive the ſacrament, and are taken into full communion. Theſe are bleſſed privileges; but all this may be done, without our being true believers. And I know not how to detect your falſe hypocritical faith better, than by putting to you this queſtion. How long have you believed? Would not moſt of you ſay, as long as we can remember, we never did diſbelieve. Then this is a certain ſign that you have no true faith at all; No, not ſo much as a grain of muſtard ſeed: For if you believe now, (unleſs you were ſanctified from your infancy, which is the eaſe of ſome) you muſt know that there was a time in which you did not believe on the Lord Jeſus, Chriſt; and the Holy Ghoſt, if ever you received it, convinced you of this. Eternal Truth has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <q>when he is come he will convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>None of us believe by nature: But after the Holy Ghoſt has convinced us of the ſin of our natures, and the ſin of our lives and duties, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our utter inability to ſave ourſelves, and that we muſt be beholden to God, as for every thing elſe, ſo for faith (without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe, or be ſaved by Chriſt) he convinces us alſo that we have no faith. Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? is the grand queſtion which the Holy Ghoſt now puts to the ſoul: At the ſame time he works with ſuch power and demonſtrations, that the ſoul ſees, and is obliged to confeſs, that it has no faith.</p>
            <p>This is a thing little thought of by moſt who call themſelves believers. They dream they are Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians becauſe they live in a Chriſtian country: If
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028079_0184_0FD694AEE997C420"/>
they were born Turks, they would believe on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet; for what is that which men commonly call faith, but an outward conſent to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> religion? But do not you thus deceive your our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; true faith is quite another thing. Aſk your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore, whether or not the Holy Ghoſt ever powerfully convinced you of the ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? You are perhaps ſo devout (you may imagine) as to get a catalogue of ſins, which you look over, and confeſs in a formal manner, as often as you go to the holy ſacrament: But among all your ſins, did you ever once confeſs and bewail that damning ſin of unbelief? Were you ever made to cry out, Lord, give me faith; Lord, give me to believe on thee; O that I had faith! O that I could believe! If you never were thus diſtreſſed, at leaſt, if you never ſaw and felt, that you had no faith, it is a certain ſign that the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came into and worked ſavingly upon your ſouls.</p>
            <p>But is it not odd, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be called a Comforter, when it is plain, by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all God's children, that this work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is uſually attended with ſore inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and a great deal of ſoul-trouble? I anſwer, the Holy Ghoſt may well be termed a Comforter, even in this work; becauſe it is the only way to, and ends in true ſolid comfort. Bleſſed are they that are thus convicted by him; for they ſhall be comforted. Nay, not only ſo, but there is preſent comfort, even in the midſt of theſe convictions; The ſoul ſecretly rejoices in the ſight of its own miſery, bleſſes God for bringing it out of darkneſs into light, and looks forward with a comfortable proſpect of future deliverances, knowing, that, <q>though ſorrow may endure for a night, joy will come in the morning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:028079_0185_0FD694EFDFAE0BE0"/>
Thus it is that the Holy Ghoſt convinces the ſoul of ſin. And, if ſo, how wretchedly are they miſtaken, that blend the light of the Spirit with the light of conſcience, as all ſuch do, who ſay, that Chriſt lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that light, if improved, will bring us to Jeſus Chriſt? If ſuch doctrine be true; the promiſe in the text was needleſs: Our Lord's apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had already that light; the world hereafter to be convinced, had that light; and, if that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring them to Chriſt, why was it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that Chriſt ſhould go away to heaven, to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to do this for them? Alas! all have not this Spirit: It is the ſpecial gift of God, and, without this ſpecial gift, we can never come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The light of conſcience will accuſe or convince us of any common ſin: but the light of natural conſcience never did, never will, and never can convince us of unbelief: If it could, how comes it to paſs, that not one of the heathens, who improved the light of nature in ſuch an eminent degree, was ever convinced of unbelief? No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atural conſcience cannot effect this; it is the peculiar property of the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter: <q>When he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have heard how he convinces of ſin: We come now to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the righteouſneſs, of which the Comforter convinces the world.</p>
            <p>By the word <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> in ſome places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are to underſtand that common juſtice which we ought to practice between man and man; as when Paul is ſaid to reaſon of temperance and righteouſneſs before a trembling Felix. But here
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028079_0186_0FD694B26111C260"/>
(as in a multitude of other places in holy writ) we are to underſtand by the word righteouſneſs, the active and paſſive obedience of the dear Lord Jeſus; even that perfect, perſonal, all-ſufficient righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which he has wrought out for that world which the Spirit is to convince. <q>Of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (ſays our Lord) becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more.</q> This is one argument that the Holy Spirit makes uſe of to prove Chriſt's righteouſneſs, becauſe he is gone to the Father, and we ſee him no more. For had he not wrought out a ſufficient righteouſneſs, the Father would have ſent him back, as not having done what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took: and we ſhould have ſeen him again.</p>
            <p>O the righteouſneſs of Chriſt! It ſo comforts my ſoul, that I muſt be excuſed if I mention it in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my diſcourſes. I would not, if I could help it, have one ſermon without it. Whatever infidels may object, or Arminians ſophiſtically argue againſt an imputed righteouſneſs; yet whoever know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and God, muſt acknowledge, that <q>Jeſus Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, (and perfect juſtification in the ſight of God,) to every one that believeth,</q> and that we are to be made the righteouſneſs of God in him. This, and this only a poor ſinner can lay hold of, as a ſure anchor of his hope. Whatever other ſcheme of ſalvation men may lay, I acknowledge I can ſee no other foundation whereon to build my hopes of ſalvation, but on the rock of Chriſt's perſonal righteouſneſs, imputed to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Many, I believe, have a rational conviction of, and agree with me in this: But rational convictions, if reſted in, avail but little; it muſt be a ſpiritual, experimental conviction of the truth which is ſaving. And therefore our Lord ſays, when the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028079_0187_0FD694F2C81EC028"/>
comes in the day of his power, it convinces of this righteouſneſs, of the reality, completeneſs and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of it, to ſave a poor ſinner.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen how the Holy Ghoſt convinces the ſinner of the ſin of his nature, life, duties, and of the ſin of unbelief; and what then muſt the poor creature do? He muſt, he muſt inevitably deſpair, if there be no hope but in himſelf. When therefore the Spirit has hunted the ſinner out of all his falſe reſts and hiding-places, taken off the pitiful fig-leaves of his own works, and driven him out of the trees of the garden (his outward reformations) and placed him naked before the bar of a ſovereign, holy, juſt, and ſin-avenging God; then, then it is, when the ſoul, having the ſentence of death within itſelf becauſe of unbelief; has a ſweet diſplay of Chriſt's righteouſneſs made to it by the holy Spirit of God. Here it is, that he begins more immediately to act in the quality of a Comforter, and convinces the ſoul ſo powerfully of the reality and all-ſufficiency of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, that the ſoul is immediately ſet a hungering and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it. Now the ſinner begins to ſee, that though he has deſtroyed himſelf, yet in Chriſt is his help; that, though he has no righteouſneſs of his own to recommend him, there is a fulneſs of grace, a fulneſs of truth, a fulneſs of righteouſneſs in the dear Lord Jeſus, which, if once imputed to him, would make him happy for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>None can tell, but thoſe happy ſouls who have experienced it, with what demonſtration of the Spirit this conviction comes. O how amiable, as well as all-ſufficient, does the bleſſed Jeſus now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear! With what new eyes does the ſoul now ſee the Lord its righteouſneſs! Brethren, it is unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. If you were never thus convinced of Chriſt's
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028079_0188_0FD694B450CC81B0"/>
righteouſneſs in your own ſouls, though you may believe it doctrinally, it will avail you nothing; if the Comforter never came ſavingly into your ſouls, then you are comfortleſs indeed. But</p>
            <p>What will this righteouſneſs avail, if the ſoul has it not in poſſeſſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The next thing therefore the Comforter, when he comes, convinces the ſoul of, is judgment.</p>
            <p>By the word <hi>judgment,</hi> I underſtand that well-grounded peace, that ſettled judgment, which the ſoul forms of itſelf, when it is enabled by the Spirit of God, to lay hold on Chriſt's righteouſneſs, which I believe it always does, when convinced in the manner before-mentioned. "Of judgment, (ſays our Lord) <q>becauſe the Prince of this world is judged;</q> the ſoul, being enabled to lay hold on Chriſt's perfect righteouſneſs by a lively faith, has a conviction wrought in it by the Holy Spirit, that the "Prince of this world is judged." The ſoul being now juſtified by faith, has peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and can trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly ſay, it is Chriſt that juſtifies me, who is he that condemns me? The ſtrong man armed is now caſt out? my ſoul is in a true peace; the Prince of this world will come and accuſe, but he has now no ſhare in me: The bleſſed Spirit which I have received, and whereby I am enabled to apply Chriſt's righteouſneſs to my poor ſoul power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convinces me of this: Why ſhould I fear? Or of what ſhall I be afraid, ſince God's Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes with my ſpirit, that I am a child of God? The Lord is aſcended up on high; he has led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive; he has received the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, that beſt of gifts for men: and that Comforter is come into my heart: he is faithful that hath promiſed: I, even I, am powerfully,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028079_0189_0FD694F8E25E4F30"/>
rationally, ſpiritually convicted of ſin, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and judgment. By this I know the prince of this world is judged.</p>
            <p>Thus, I ſay, may we ſuppoſe that ſoul to triumph, in which the promiſe of the text is happily ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And though, at the beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſaid, moſt had never experienced any thing of this, and that therefore this preaching muſt be fooliſhneſs to ſuch; yet I doubt not but there are ſome few happy ſouls, who, through grace, have been enabled to follow me ſtep by ſtep; and notwithſtanding the Holy Ghoſt might not directly work in the ſame order as I have deſcribed, and perhaps they cannot exactly ſay the time when, yet they have a well grounded confidence that the work is done, and that they have really been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin, righteouſneſs, and judgment, in ſome way, or at ſome time or another.</p>
            <p>And now what ſhall I ſay to you? O thank God, thank the Lord Jeſus, thank the ever bleſſed Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for this unſpeakable gift: For you would never have been thus highly favoured, had not he who firſt ſpoke darkneſs into light, loved you with an everlaſting love, and enlightened you by his Holy Spirit, and that too, not on account of any good thing foreſeen in you, but for his own name's ſake.</p>
            <p>Be humble therefore, O believers be humble: Look to the rock from whence you have been hewn: Extol free grace; admire electing love, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone has made you to differ from the reſt of your brethren. Has God brought you into light? Walk as becometh the children of light Provoke not the Holy Spirit to depart from you: For though he hath ſealed you to the day of redemption and you know that the Prince of this world is judged;
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028079_0190_0FD694B550B0A0F8"/>
yet if you backſlide, grow lukewarm, or forget your firſt love, the Lord will viſit your offences with the rod of affliction, and your ſin with ſpiritual ſcourges. Be not therefore high-minded, but fear. Rejoice, but let it be with trembling. As the elect of God, put on, not only humbleneſs of mind, but bowels of compaſſion; and pray, O pray for your unconverted brethren! Help me, help me now, O children of God, and hold up my hands, as Aaron and Hur once held up the hands of Moſes. Pray whilſt I am preaching, that the Lord may enable me to ſay, This day is the promiſe in the text ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in ſome poor ſinners' hearts. Cry mightily to God, and, with the cords of a holy violence, pull down bleſſings on your neighbours' heads. Chriſt yet lives and reigns in heaven: The reſidue of the Spirit is yet in his hand, and a plentiful effuſion of it is promiſed in the latter days of the church. And O that the Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Comforter, would now come down, and convince thoſe that are Chriſt-leſs among you, <q>of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment!</q> O that you were once made willing to be convinced!</p>
            <p>But perhaps you had rather be filled with wine than with the Spirit, and are daily chaſing that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt from your ſouls. What ſhall I ſay for you to God? <q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</q> What ſhall I ſay from God to you? Why? <q>that God was in Chriſt reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world unto himſelf:</q> Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, as in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God. Do not go away contradicting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming. I know Satan would have you begone. Many of you may be uneaſy, and are ready to cry out, "What a wearineſs is this!" But I will not let you go: I have wreſtled with God for my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028079_0191_0FD694FACB1F4A40"/>
in private, and I muſt wreſtle with you here in public. Though of myſelf I can do nothing, and you can no more by your own power come to and believe on Chriſt, than Lazarus could come forth from the grave; yet who knows but God may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſome of you again to a lively hope by this fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of preaching, and that you may be ſome of that world, which the Comforter is to convince "of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment?" Poor Chriſt leſs ſouls! do you know what a condition you are in? Why, you are lying in the wicked one, the devil; he rules in you, he walks and dwells in you, unleſs you dwell in Chriſt, and the Comforter is come into your hearts. And will you contentedly lie in that wicked one the devil? What wages will he give you? Eternal death. O that you would come to Chriſt! The free gift of God through him is eternal life. He will accept of you even now, if you will believe in him. The Comforter may yet come into your hearts, even yours. All that are now his living temples, were once lying in the wicked one as well as you. This bleſſed gift, this Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even for the rebellious.</p>
            <p>I ſee many of you affected: But are your paſſions only a little wrought upon, or are your ſouls really touched with a lively ſenſe of the heinouſneſs of your ſins, your want of faith, and the preciouſneſs of the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt? If ſo, I hope the Lord has been gracious, and that the Comforter is coming into your hearts. O do not ſtifle theſe convictions! Do not go away, and ſtraightway for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what manner of doctrine you have heard, and thereby ſhew that theſe are only common workings of a few tranſient convictions, floating upon the ſurface of your hearts. Beg of God that you may
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028079_0192_0FD694B6EB4F5378"/>
be ſincere (for he alone can make you ſo) and that you may indeed deſire the promiſe of the text to be fulfilled in your ſouls. Who knows but the Lord may be gracious! Remember you have no plea but ſovereign mercy; but for your encouragement alſo, remember it is the world, ſuch as you are, to whom the Comforter is to come, and whom he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: Wait therefore at Wiſdom's gates. The bare probability of having a door of mercy opened, is enough to keep you ſtriving. Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, the chief of them: You know not but he came to ſave you. Do not go and quarrel with God's decrees, and, if I am a reprobate, I ſhall be damned; if I am elected, I ſhall be ſaved; and therefore I will do nothing. What have you to do with God's decrees? Secret things belong to him; it is your buſineſs to give <q>all dilligence to make your calling and election ſure.</q> If there are but few who find the way that leads to life, do you ſtrive to be ſome of them: You know not but you may be in the number of thoſe few, and that your ſtriving may be the means which God intends to bleſs, to give you an entrance in. If you do not act thus you are not ſincere; and, if you do, who knows but you may find mercy? For though after you have done all that you can, God may juſtly cut you off, yet never was a ſingle perſon damned who did all that he could. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your hands are withered, ſtretch them out; though you are impotent, ſick, and lame, come lie at the pool. Who knows but by and by the Lord Jeſus may have compaſſion on you, and ſend the Comforter to convince you of ſin, righteouſneſs, and of judgment? He is a God full of compaſſion and long-ſuffering, otherwiſe you and I had been long ſince lifting up our eyes in torments. But ſtill he is patient with us!</p>

O Chriſt-leſs ſinners, you are alive, and who knows but God intends to bring you to repentance? Could my prayers or tears effect it, you ſhould have volleys of the one, and floods of the other.

               <bibl>LUKE xix. 9, 10.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This day is ſalvation come to this houſe, foraſmuch as he alſo is the ſon of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SALVATION, every where through the whole ſcripture, is ſaid to be the free gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Not only free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is a ſovereign agent, and therefore may withhold it from, or confer it on, whom he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but free, becauſe there is nothing to be found is man, that can any way induce God to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto him. The righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is the ſole cauſe of our finding favour in God's light: This righteouſneſs apprehended by faith (which is alſo the gift of God) makes it our own; and this faith, if true, will work by love.</p>
            <p>Theſe are parts of thoſe glad tidings which are publiſhed in the goſpel; and of the certainty of them, next to the expreſs word of God, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ſuch as have been ſaved, is the beſt, and as I take it, the moſt unbounded proof. That God might teach us every way, he has been pleaſed to live upon record many inſtances of the power of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028079_0196_0FD694BF367233B0"/>
his grace exerted in the ſalvation, of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that we hearing how he dealt with them, might from thence inter the manner we muſt expect to be dealt with ourſelves, and learn in what way we muſt look for ſalvation, if we truly deſire to be made partakers of the inheritance with the ſaints in light.</p>
            <p>The converſion of the perſon referred to in the text, I think will be of no ſmall ſervice to us in this matter, if rightly improved. I would hope, moſt of you know who the perſon is, to whom the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks; it is the Publican Zaccheus, to whoſe houſe the bleſſed Jeſus ſaid, ſalvation came, and whom he pronounces a ſon of Abraham.</p>
            <p>It is my deſign (God helping) to make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon his converſion recorded at large in the preceding verſes, and then to inforce the latter part of the text, as an encouragement to po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The evangeliſt Luke introduces the account of this man's converſion thus, ver. 1. <q>And Jeſus entered and paſſed through Jericho.</q> The holy Jeſus made it his buſineſs to go about doing good. As the ſun in the firmament is continually ſpreading his benign, quickening, and cheering influences over the natural; ſo the Son of Righteouſneſs aroſe with healing under his wings, and was daily and hourly diffuſing his gracious influences over the moral world. The preceding chapter acquaints us of a notable miracle wrought by the holy Jeſus on a poor blind Bartime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and in this, a greater preſents itſelf to our conſideration. The evangeliſt would have us take particular notice of it; for he introduces it with the word behold: <q>And behold,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028079_0197_0FD694FEC9E69390"/>
there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the Publicans, and he was rich.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well might the evangeliſt uſher in the relation of this man's converſion with the word <hi>behold!</hi> For, according to human judgment, how many inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacles lay in the way of it! Surely no, one will ſay there was any fitneſs in Zaccheus for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>vation; for we are told that he was a Publican, and therefore in all probability a notorious ſinner. The Publicans were gatherers of the Roman taxes; they were infamous for their abominable extortion; their very name therefore became ſo odious, that we find the Phariſees often reproached our Lord, as very wicked, becauſe he was a friend unto and far down to meat with them. Zaccheus then, being a Publican, was no doubt a ſinner; and, being chief among the Publicans, conſequently was chief among ſinners. Nay, he was rich. And one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired apoſtle has told us, that not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Another ſaith, <q>God has choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith.</q> And he who was the Maker and the Redeemer of the apoſtles, aſſures us, <q>that it is eaſier for a camel (or cable rope) to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</q> Let not therefore the rich glory in the multitude of their riches.</p>
            <p>But rich as he was, we are told, verſe 3. that "he ſought to ſee Jeſus." And that was a wonder indeed! The common people heard our Lord glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the poor received the Goſpel. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the very mob, the people that knew not the law, as the proud high-prieſts called them, uſed to follow him on foot into the country, and ſometimes ſtayed with him three days together to hear him preach: But did the rich believe or attend on him!
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028079_0198_0FD695262BBF7A68"/>
No. Our Lord preached up the doctrine of the croſs; he preached too ſearching for them, and therefore they counted him their enemy, perſecuted and ſpoke all manner of evil againſt him, falſely. Let not the miniſters of Chriſt marvel, if they meet with the like treatment from the rich men of this wicked and adulterous generation. I ſhould think it no ſcandal (ſuppoſing it true) to hear it affirmed, that none but the poor attended my miniſtry. Their ſouls are as precious to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the ſouls of the greateſt men. They were the poor that attended him in the days of his fleſh: Theſe are they whom he hath choſen to be rich in faith, and to be the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven. Were the rich in this world's goods generally to ſpeak well of me, woe be unto me; I ſhould think it a dreadful ſign that I was only a wolf in ſheep's clothing, that I ſpoke peace, peace, when there was no peace, and propheſied ſmoother things than the goſpel would allow of. Hear ye this, O ye rich. Let who will dare to do it, God forbid that I ſhould deſpiſe the poor; in doing ſo, I ſhould reproach my Maker. The poor are dear to my ſoul; I rejoice to ſee them fly to the doctrine of Chriſt, like the doves to their windows. I only pray that the poor who attend, may be evangelized, and turned into the ſpirit of the goſpel: <q>If ſo, bleſſed are ye; for yours is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But we muſt return to Zaccheus. He ſought to ſee Jeſus. That is good news. I heartily wiſh I could ſay, it was out of a good principle: But, without ſpeaking contrary to that charity which hopes and believeth all things for the beſt, we may ſay, that the ſame principle drew him after Chriſt, which now draws multitudes (to ſpeak plainly, it may be multitudes of you) to hear a particular

preacher, even curioſity: For we are told, that he came not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear his doctrine, but to view his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to uſe the words of the evangeliſt, to ſee who he was. Our Lord's fame was now ſpread abroad through all Jeruſalem, and all the country round about: Some ſaid he was a good man; others, nay, but he deceiveth the people. And therefore curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity drew out this rich Publican Zaccheus to ſee who this perſon was, of whom he had heard ſuch various accounts. But it ſeems he could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently get a ſight of him for the preſs, and becauſe he was little of ſtature. Alas! how many are kept from ſeeing Chriſt in glory, by reaſon of the preſs. I mean, how many are aſhamed of being ſingularly good, and therefore follow a multitude to do evil, becauſe they have a preſs or throng of polite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance! And, for fear of being ſet at nought by thoſe with whom they uſed to ſet at meat, they deny the Lord of glory, and are aſhamed to confeſs him before men. This baſe, this ſervile fear of man, is the bane of true Chriſtianity; it brings a dreadful ſnare upon the ſoul, and is the ruin of ten thouſands: For I am fully perſuaded, numbers are rationally convicted of goſpel truths; but, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to brook contempt, they will not proſecute their convictions, nor reduce them to practice. Happy thoſe, who in this reſpect, at leaſt, like Zaccheus, reſolved to overcome all impediments that lie in their way to a ſight of Chriſt: For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not ſee Chriſt becauſe of the preſs, and the littleneſs of his natural ſtature, he did not ſmite upon his breaſt, and depart, ſaying, <q>It is in vain to ſeek after a ſight of him any longer, I can never attain unto it.</q> No, finding he could not ſee Chriſt, if he continued in the midſt of the preſs, <q>he run before the multitude, and climbed
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028079_0200_0FD628B37B1240E0"/>
up into a ſycamore-tree, to ſee him; for he was to paſs that way.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ſeeing Chriſt in glory, unleſs we run before the multitude, and are willing to be in the number of thoſe deſpiſed few, who take the kingdom of God by violence. The broad way, in which ſo many go, can never be that ſtraight and narrow way which leads to life. Our Lord's flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little one: And unleſs we dare to run before the multitude in a holy ſingularity, and can rejoice in being accounted fools for Chriſt's ſake, we ſhall never ſee Jeſus with comfort, when he appears in glory. From menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the ſycamore-tree, and conſidering the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with which Zaccheus muſt climb it, we may farther learn, that thoſe who would ſee Chriſt, muſt undergo other difficulties and hardſhips, beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Zaccheus, without doubt, went through both. Did not many, think you, laugh at him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he ran along, and in the language of Michal, Saul's daughter, cry out, how glorious did the rich Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus look to day, when, forgetting the greatneſs of his ſtation, he ran before a pitiful, giddy mob, and climbed up a ſycamore-tree, to ſee an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic preacher! But Zaccheus cares not for all that; his curioſity was ſtrong: If he could but ſee who Jeſus was, he did not value what ſcoffers ſaid of him. Thus, and much more will it be with all thoſe who have an effectual deſire to ſee Jeſus in heaven: They will go on from ſtrength to ſtrength, break through every difficulty lying in their way, and care not what men or devils ſay of or do unto them. May the Lord make us all thus minded, for his dear Son's ſake!</p>
            <p>At length, after taking much pains, and going (as we may well ſuppoſe) through much contempt,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028079_0201_0FD695301B82D4D8"/>
Zaccheus has climbed the tree; and there he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>its, as he thinks, hid in the leaves of it, and watching when he ſhould ſee Jeſus paſs by: <q>For he was to paſs by that way.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Praiſe, magnify, and adore ſovereign, electing, free, preventing love; Jeſus the everlaſting God, the Prince of peace, who ſaw Nathaniel under the fig-tree, and Zaccheus from eternity, now ſees him in the ſycamore-tree, and calls him in time.</p>
            <p>Ver. 5. <q>And when Jeſus came to the place, he looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</q> Amazing love! Well might Luke uſher in the account with behold! It is worthy of our higheſt admiration. When Zaccheus thought of no ſuch thing, nay thought that Chriſt Jeſus did not know him; behold, Chriſt does what we never hear he did before or after, I mean, invite himſelf to the houſe of Zaccheus, ſaying, <q>Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</q> Not pray let me abide, but I muſt abide this day at thy houſe. He alſo calls him by name, as though he was well acquainted with him: and indeed well he might; for his name was written in the book of life, he was one of thoſe whom the Father had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him from all eternity: therefore he muſt abide at his houſe, that day. <q>For whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them he alſo called.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here then, as through a glaſs, we may ſee the doctrine of free grace evidently exemplified before us. Here was no fitneſs in Zaccheus. He was a Publican, chief among the Publicans; not only ſo, but rich, and came to ſee Chriſt only out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity: but ſovereign grace triumphs over all.
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028079_0202_0FD628C8CEEBB7A8"/>
And if we do God juſtice, and are effectually wrought upon, we muſt acknowledge there was no more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us than in Zaccheus; and, had not Chriſt prevented us by his call, we had remained dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and alienated from the divine life, even as others. <q>Jeſus looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus; make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With what different emotions of heart may we ſuppoſe Zaccheus received this invitation? Think you not that he was ſurpriſed to hear Jeſus Chriſt call him by name, and not only ſo, but invite himſelf to his houſe? Surely, thinks Zaccheus, I dream: it cannot be; how ſhould he know me? I never ſaw him before: beſides, I ſhall undergo much contempt, if I receive him under my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus, I ſay, we may ſuppoſe Zaccheus th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> within himſelf. But what ſaith the ſcripture? <q>I will make a willing people in the day of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</q> With this outward call, there went an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious power from God, which ſweetly over-ruled his natural will: and therefore, verſe 6. <q>He made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully,</q> not only into his houſe, but alſo into his heart.</p>
            <p>Thus it is the great God brings home his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He calls them by name by his word or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſpeaks to them alſo by his Spirit. Hereby they are enabled to open their hearts, and are made willing to receive the King of glory. For Zaccheus' ſake, let us not entirely condemn people that come unto the word, out of no better principle than curioſity, Who knows, but God may call them? It is good to be where the Lord is paſſing by. May all who are now preſent out of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028079_0203_0FD6953299581150"/>
hear the voice of the Son of God ſpeaking to their ſouls, and ſo hear that they may live! Not that men ought therefore to take encouragement to come out of curioſity. For perhaps a thouſand more, at other times, came to ſee Chriſt out of curioſity, as well as Zaccheus, who were not effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his grace. I only mention this for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of my own ſoul, and the conſolation of God's children, who are too apt to be angry with thoſe who do not attend on the word out of love to God: but let them alone. Brethren, pray for them. How do you know but Jeſus Chriſt may ſpeak to their hearts? A few words from Chriſt applied by his Spirit, will ſave their ſouls. <q>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, ſays Chriſt, make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and come down. And he made haſte, and came down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him joyfully.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have obſerved in holy ſcripture, how particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is remarked, that perſons rejoiced upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt. Thus the converted Eunuch went on his way rejoicing; thus the jailor rejoiced with his whole houſe; thus Zaccheus received Chriſt joyfully. And well may thoſe rejoice who receive Jeſus Chriſt; for with him they receive righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and eternal redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many have brought up an ill report upon our good land, and would fain perſuade people that religion will make them melancholy mad. So far from it, that joy is one ingredient of the kingdom of God in the heart of a believer; <q>the kingdom of God is righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</q> To rejoice in the Lord, is a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel duty. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I ſay, rejoice. And who can be ſo joyful, as thoſe who know that their pardon is ſealed before they go hence and are no more ſeen? The godly may, but

God is a ſovereign agent, and works upon his children in their effectual calling, according to the counſel of his eternal will. It is with the ſpiritual, as natural birth: All <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have not the like pangs; all Chriſtians have not the like degree of conviction. But all agree in this, that all have Jeſus Chriſt formed in their hearts! And thoſe who have not ſo many trials at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; may be viſited with the greater conflicts hereafter; though they never come into bondage again, after they have once received the ſpirit of adoption. <q>We have not (ſays Paul) received the ſpirit of bondage again unto fear.</q> We know not what Zaccheus underwent before he died: However this one thing I know, he now believed in Chriſt, and was juſtified, or acquitted, and looked upon as righteous in God's ſight, though a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can chief among the Publicans, not many moments before. And thus it is with all, that, like Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028079_0205_0FD6953411A28AA8"/>
receive Jeſus Chriſt, by faith into their hearts. The very moment they find reſt in him, they are freely juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes; <q>for by grace are we ſaved, through faith, and that not of ourſelves, it is the gift of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Say not within yourſelves this is a licentious, Antinomian doctrine; for this faith, if true, will work by love, and be productive of the fruits of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. See an inſtance in this convert Zaccheus: No ſooner had he received Jeſus Chriſt by faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, but he evidences it by his works; For ver. 8. we are <q>told Zaccheus ſtood forth, and ſaid unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> give unto the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having believed on Jeſus in his heart, he now makes confeſſion of him with his mouth to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Zaccheus ſtood forth: He was not aſhamed, but ſtood forth before his brother Publicans; for true faith caſts out all ſervile, ſinful fear of men; <q>And ſaid, Behold, Lord.</q> It is remarkable, how readily people in ſcripture have owned the divinity of Chriſt immediately, upon their converſion. Thus the woman at Jacob's well; <q>Is not this the Chriſt? Thus the man born blind; Lord, I believe; and worſhipped him.</q> Thus Zaccheus, "Behold, Lord." An inconteſtitle proof this to me, that thoſe who deny our Lord's divinity, never effectually felt his power: If they had, they would not ſpeak ſo lightly of him; they would ſcorn to deny his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. <q>Zaccheus ſtood forth, and ſaid, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028079_0206_0FD6950470A8D538"/>
falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</q> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits of a true living faith in the Lord Jeſus! Every word calls for our notice. Not ſome ſmall, not the tenth part, but the half. Of what? My goods; things that were valuable. My goods, his own, not another's: I give: Not, I will give when I die, when I can keep them no longer; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I give now, even now. Zaccheus would be his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor. For whilſt we have time we ſhould do good. But to whom would he give half of his goods? Not to the rich, not to thoſe who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready clothed in purple and fine linnen, of whom he might be recompenſed again; but to the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind, from which he could expect no recompenſe till the reſurrection of the dead. "I give to the poor." But knowing that he muſt be juſt, before be could be charitable, and conſcious to himſelf that in his public adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had wronged many perſons, he adds, <q>And, If I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</q> Hear ye this, all ye that make no conſcience of cheating the king of his taxes, or of buying or ſelling run goods. If ever God gives you true faith you will never reſt, till, like Zaccheus, you have made reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to the utmoſt of your power. I ſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion he thought it no harm to cheat thus, no more than you may do now, and pleaſed himſelf frequently, to be ſure, that he got rich by doing ſo: But now he is grieved for it at his heart; he confeſſes his injuſtice before men, and promiſes to make ample reſtitution. Go, ye cheating Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, learn of Zaccheus, go away and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; if you do not make reſtitution here, the Lord Jeſus ſhall make you confeſs your ſins before men and angels, and condemn you for it, when he
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028079_0207_0FD6953730B26E40"/>
comes in the glory of his Father to judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>After all this, with good reaſon might our Lord ſay unto him, <q>This day is ſalvation come to this houſe; foraſmuch as he is the ſon of Abraham;</q> not ſo much by a natural as by a ſpiritual birth. He was made partaker of like precious faith with Abraham: Like Abraham, he believed on the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: His faith, like Abraham's, worked by love; and I doubt not, but he has been long ſince ſitting In Abraham's harbour.</p>
            <p>And now are you not aſhamed of yourſelves, who ſpeak againſt the doctrines of grace eſpecially that doctrine of being juſtified by faith alone, as though it leaded to licentiouſneſs? What can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> more unjuſt than ſuch a charge? Is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Zaccheus a ſufficient proof to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Have I ſtrained it to ſerve my own turn? God forbid. To the beſt of my knowledge I have ſpoken the truth in ſincerity, and the truth as it is in Jeſus. I do affirm that we are ſaved by grace, and that we are juſtified by faith alone: But I do alſo affirm, that faith muſt be evidenced by good works where there is an opportunity of performing them.</p>
            <p>What therefore has been ſaid of Zaccheus, may ſerve as a rule, whereby all may judge whether they have faith or not, You ſay you have faith; but how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Jeſus call you by name? Were you ever made to obey that call? Did you ever, like Zaccheus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt joyfully into your hearts? Are you influenced, by the faith you ſay you have, to ſtand up and confeſs the Lord Jeſus before men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble yourſelves for, your paſt offences? Does your
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028079_0208_0FD695071461B278"/>
faith work by love, ſo that you conſcientiouſly lay up, according as God has proſpered you, for the ſupport of the poor? Do you give alms of all things that you poſſeſs? And have you made due reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe you have wronged? If ſo, happy are ye; ſalvation is come to your ſouls; you are ſons, you are daughters of, you ſhall ſhortly be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bleſſed with faithful Abraham. But, if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own ſouls; though you may talk of juſtification by faith, like angels, it will do you no good; it will only increaſe your damnation. You hold the truth, but it is in unrighteouſneſs: Your faith being without works, is dead; you have the devil, not Abraham, for your father. Unleſs you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, with devils and damned ſpirits ſhall you dwell for evermore.</p>
            <p>But it is now time to enforce the latter part of the text; <q>For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</q> Theſe words are ſpoken by our Saviour, in anſwer to ſome ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Phariſees, who inſtead of rejoicing with the angels in heaven, at the converſion of ſuch a ſinner, murmured, <q>that he was gone to be gueſt with a man that was a ſinner.</q> To vindicate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he tells them, that this was an act agreeable to the deſign of his coming; <q>For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</q> He might have ſaid, the "Son of God." But O the wonderful condeſcenſion of our Redeemer! He delights to ſtyle himſelf the Son of man. He came not only to ſave, <q>but to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</q> He came to Jericho to ſeek and ſave Zaccheus; for otherwiſe Zaccheus would nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have been ſaved by him. But from whence came he? Even from heaven, his dwelling-place, to this lower earth, this vale of tears, <q>to ſeek and ſave
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028079_0209_0FD69538F340ED08"/>
that which was loſt;</q> or all that feel themſelves loſt, and are willing, like Zaccheus, to receive him into their hearts to ſave them; with how great a ſalvation? even from the guilt, and alſo from the power of their ſins; to make them heirs of God, and joint heirs with himſelf, and partakers of that glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the world began. Thus will the Son of man ſave that which is loſt. He was made the Son of man, on purpoſe that he might ſave them. He had no other end but this in leaving his Father's throne, in obeying the moral law, and hanging upon the croſs: All that was done and ſuffered, merely to ſatisfy, and procure a righteouſneſs for poor, loſt undone ſinners, and that too without reſpect of perſons. "That which was loſt:" all of every nation and language, that feel, bewail, and are truly deſirous of being delivered from their loſt ſtate, did the Son of man come down to ſeek and to ſave: For he is mighty, not only ſo, but willing, to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God thro' him; he will in no wiſe caſt them out. For he is the ſame to-day, as he was yeſterday. He comes now to ſinners, as well as formerly; and, I hope, hath ſeat me out this day to ſeek, and, under him, to bring home ſome of you, the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>What ſay you? Shall I go home rejoicing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that many like ſheep, have gone aſtray, but they have now believed on Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to the great Shepherd and Biſhop of their ſouls? If the Lord would be pleaſed thus to proſper my handy-work, I care not how many le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſts and ſelf-righteous Phariſees murmur againſt me, for offering ſalvation to the worſt of ſinners; For I know the Son of man came to ſeek and to ſave them; and the Lord Jeſus will now be a gueſt to
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028079_0210_0FD69507198A8B30"/>
the worſt Publican, the vileſt ſinner that is amongſt you, if he does but believe on him. Make haſte then, O ſinners, make haſte, and come by faith to Chriſt. Then, this day, even this hour, nay this moment, if you believe, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come and make his eternal abode in your hearts. Which of you is made willing to receive the King of glory? Which of you obeys the call, as Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus did? Alas! why do you ſtand ſtill? How know you, whether Jeſus Chriſt may ever call you again? Come then, poor, guilty ſinners; come away, poor, loſt, undone Publicans: Make haſte, I ſay, and come away to Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord condeſcends to invite himſelf to come under the filthy roofs of the houſes of your ſouls. Do not be afraid of entertaining him; he will fill you with all peace and joy in believing. Do not be aſhamed to run before the multitude, and to have all manner of evil ſpoken againſt you falſely for his ſake: One ſight of Chriſt will make amends for all. Zaccheus was laughed at; and <q>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</q> But what of that? Zaccheus is now crowned in glory; as you alſo ſhall ſhortly be, if you believe on, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for Chriſt's ſake. Do not, therefore, put me off with frivolous excuſes; there is no excuſe can be given for your not coming to Chriſt. You are loſt, undone, without him; and if he is not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in your ſalvation, he will be glorified in your deſtruction: if he does not come and make his abode in your hearts, you muſt take up an eternal abode with the devil and his angels. O that the Lord would be pleaſed to paſs by ſome of you at this time! O that he may call you by his Spirit, and make you a willing people in this day of his power! For I know my calling will not do, unleſs he, by his efficacious grace, compel you to come in. O that
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028079_0211_0FD6953A1983DC40"/>
you once felt what it is to receive Jeſus Chriſt into your hearts! You would ſoon, like Zaccheus, give him every thing. You do not love Chriſt, becauſe you do not know him; you do not come to him, becauſe you do not feel your want of him: you are whole and not broken-hearted; you are not ſick, at leaſt not ſenſible of your ſickneſs; and, therefore, no wonder you do not apply to Jeſus Chriſt, that great, that almighty phyſician. You do not feel yourſelves loſt, and therefore do not ſeek to be found in Chriſt. O that God would wound you with the ſword of his Spirit, and cauſe his arrows of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtick deep in your hearts! O that he would dart a ray of divine light into your ſouls! For if you do not feel yourſelves loſt without Chriſt, you are of all men moſt miſerable: your ſouls are dead; you are not only an image of hell, but in ſome degree hell it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: you carry hell about with you, and you know it not. O that I could ſee ſome of you ſenſible of this, and hear you cry out, <q>Lord, break this hard heart; Lord, deliver me from the body of this death; draw me, Lord make me willing to come after thee; I am loſt; Lord, ſave me, or I periſh!</q> Was this your caſe, how ſoon would the Lord ſtretch forth his almighty hand, and ſay, be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid? What a wonderful calm would then poſſeſs your troubled ſouls! Your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would then be with the Father and the Son: Your life would be hid with Chriſt in God.</p>
            <p>Some of you, I hope, have experienced this, and can ſay, I was loſt, but I am found; I was dead, but am alive again. The Son of man came and ſought me in the day of his power, and ſaved my ſinful ſoul. And do you repent that you came to Chriſt? Has he not been a good Maſter? Is not his preſence ſweet to your ſouls?

O then, ye ſaints, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and talk of the love of Chriſt to others, and tell them, what great things the Lord has done for you! This may encourage others to come unto him. And who knows but the Lord may make you fiſher of men? The ſtory of Zaccheus was left on record for this purpoſe. No truly convicted ſoul, after ſuch an inſtance of divine grace has been laid before him, need deſpair of mercy, What if you are Publicans? Was not Zaccheus a Publican? What if you are chief among the Publicans? Was not Zaccheus likewiſe? What if you are rich? Was not Zaccheus rich alſo?

            <p>THE apoſtle, in the verſes before the text, had been cautioning the Philippians to beware of the conciſion, Judaizing teachers, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſubvert them from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, by telling them, they ſtill ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to circumciſion and all the other ordinances of Moſes. And that they might not think he ſpoke out of prejudice, and condemned their tenets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he himſelf was a ſtranger to the Jewiſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, he acquaints them, that if any other man thought he had whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, or ſeek to be juſtified by the outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the jews, he had more: for he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the eighth day; of the ſtock of Iſrael, (not a proſelyte, but a native Iſraelite;) of the tribe of Benjamin, (the tribe which adhered to Judah when the others revolted;) an Hebrew of the Hebrews, (a Jew both of the father and mother's ſide;) and as touching the law, a Phariſee, the ſtricteſt ſect amongſt all Iſrael. To ſhew that he was no Gallio in religion, through his great, though miſguided zeal, he had perſecuted the church of Chriſt; and as touching the righteouſneſs of the law (as far as the

            <p>Accordingly in the following diſcourſe I ſhall endeavour to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Chriſt is riſen indeed from the dead; and that it was neceſſary for him ſo to do; and,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it highly concerns us to know and experience the power of his reſurrection:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt is indeed riſen.</p>
            <p>That Jeſus ſhould riſe from the dead was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> On his own account. He had often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to this as the laſt and moſt convincing proof he would give them that he was the true Meſſiah, <q>There ſhall no other ſign be given you, than the prophet Jonas. And again, Deſtroy this temple of my body, and in three days I will build it up.</q> Which words his enemies remembered, and urged it as an argument, to induce Pilate to grant them a watch, to prevent his being ſtolen out of the grave. <q>We know that deceiver ſaid, whilſt he was yet alive after three days I will riſe again.</q> So that had he not riſen again, they might have juſtly ſaid, we know that this man was an impoſtor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was neceſſary on our account. <q>He roſe again, ſays the apoſtle, for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</q> or that the debt we owed to God for our ſins, might be fully ſatisfied and diſcharged.</p>
            <p>It had pleaſed the Father (for ever adored be his infinite love and free grace) to wound his only Son for our tranſgreſſions, and to arreſt and confine him in the priſon of the grave, as our ſurety for the guilt we had contracted by ſetting at nought his commandments. Now had Chriſt continued always in the grave, we could have had no more aſſurance that our ſins were ſatisfied for, than any common
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028079_0217_0FD69545AB217D18"/>
debtor can have of his creditor's being ſatisfied, whilſt his ſurety is kept confined. But he being releaſed from the power of death, we are thereby aſſured, that with his ſacrifice God was well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our atonement was finiſhed on the croſs, and that he had made a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſacrifice, oblation, and ſatisfaction for the ſins of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was neceſſary that our Lord Jeſus ſhould riſe again from the dead, to aſſure us of the certainty of the reſurrection of our own bodies.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the reſurrection of the body was entirely exploded and ſet at nought among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as appears from the Athenians mocking at, and calling St. Paul a babbler and a ſetter forth of ſtrange doctrines, when he preached to them Jeſus, and the reſurrection. And though it was believed by moſt of the Jews, as is evident from many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture, yet not by all; the whole ſect of the Sadducees denied it. But the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt put it out of diſpute. For as he acted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s our repreſentative, if he our Head be riſen, then muſt we alſo, who are his members, riſe with him. And as in the firſt Adam we all died, even ſo in him our ſecond Adam we muſt all, in this ſenſe, be made alive.</p>
            <p>As it was neceſſary, upon theſe accounts, that our bleſſed Lord ſhould riſe from the dead; ſo it is plain beyond contradiction, that he did. Never was any matter of fact better atteſted; never were more precautions made uſe of to prevent a cheat. He was buried in a ſepulchre, hewn out of a rock, ſo that it could not be ſaid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a ſepulchre alſo wherein never man before was laid; ſo that if any body did riſe from thence, it muſt be the body of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028079_0218_0FD6950EF42EEAD0"/>
Jeſus of Nazareth. Beſides, the ſepulchre was ſealed; a great ſtone rolled over the mouth of it; and a band of ſoldiers (conſiſting not of friends, but of his profeſſed enemies) was ſet to guard it. And as for his diſciples coming by night and ſtealing him away, it was altogether improbable: for it was not long ſince, that they had all forſaken him, and they were the moſt backward in believing his reſurrection. And ſuppoſing it was true that they came whilſt the ſoldiers ſlept; yet the ſoldiers m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt be caſt into a deep ſleep indeed, that the rolling away ſo great a ſtone did not awake ſome of them.</p>
            <p>And our bleſſed Lord's afterwards appearing at ſundry times, and in divers manners, to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as when they were aſſembled together, when they were walking to Emmaus, when they were fiſhing; nay, and condeſcending to ſhew them his hands and feet, and his appearing to above five hundred brethren at once, put the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection out of all diſpute.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is one objection that may be made againſt what has been ſaid, that the books wherein theſe facts are recorded were written by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>And who more proper perſons than thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his reſurrection? <q>But they were illiterate and ignorant men.</q> Yet as good witneſſes of a plain matter of fact, as the moſt learned maſters in Iſrael. Nay, this rendered them more proper witneſſes. For being plain men, they were therefore leſs to be ſuſpected of telling or making a lie, particularly, ſince they laid down their lives for a teſtimony of the truth of it. We read indeed of Jacob's telling a lie, though he was a plain man, in order to get his father's bleſſing.
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028079_0219_0FD69546CD329210"/>
But it was never heard ſince the world began, that any man, much leſs a whole ſet of men, died mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs for the ſake of an untruth, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were to reap no advantage from it.</p>
            <p>No, this ſingle circumſtance proves them to be Iſraelites indeed, in whom was no guile. And the wonderful ſucceſs God gave to their miniſtry after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when three thouſand were converted by one ſermon; and twelve poor fiſhermen, in a very ſhort time enabled to be more than conquerors over all the oppoſition men or devils could make, was as plain a demonſtration, that Chriſt was riſen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their goſpel, as that a divine power, at the ſound of a few ram horns, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſed the wall of Jericho to fall down.</p>
            <p>But what need we any farther witneſſes? Believe you the reſurrection of our bleſſed Lord? I know that you believe it, as your gathering together on this firſt day of the week in the courts of the Lord's houſe abundantly teſtifies.</p>
            <p>What concerns us moſt to be aſſured of, and which is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing I was to ſpeak to, is, Whether we have experimentally known the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; that is, Whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt, and by his powerful operations on our hearts, have been raiſed from the death of ſin, to a life of righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>It was this, the great apoſtle was chiefly deſirous to know: the reſurrection of Chriſt's body he was ſatisfied would avail him nothing, unleſs he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the power of it in raiſing his dead ſoul.</p>
            <p>For another, and that a chief end of our bleſſed Lord's riſing from the dead, was to enter heaven as our repreſentative, and to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to apply that redemption he had finiſhed on
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028079_0220_0FD6951014C8C918"/>
the croſs, to our hearts, by working an entire change in them.</p>
            <p>Without this, Chriſt would have died in vain. For it would have done us no ſervice to have had his outward righteouſneſs imputed to us, unleſs we had an inward inherent righteouſneſs wrought in us. Becauſe, being altogether conceived and born in ſin, and conſequently unfit to hold communion with an infinitely pure and holy God, we cannot poſſibly be made meet to ſee or enjoy him, till a thorough renovation has paſſed upon our hearts.</p>
            <p>Without this we leave out the Holy Ghoſt in the great work of our redemption. But as we were made by the joint concurrence and conſultation of the bleſſed Trinity; and as we were baptized in their name, ſo muſt all of them concur in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: as the Father made, and the Son redeemed, ſo muſt the Holy Ghoſt ſanctify and ſeal us, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have believed in vain.</p>
            <p>This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is what the apoſtle means by the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all.</p>
            <p>Without this, though we may be moraliſts, tho' we may be civilized, good-natured people, yet we are no Chriſtians. For he is not a true Chriſtian, who is only one outwardly; nor have we therefore a right, becauſe we daily profeſs, to believe that Chriſt roſe again the third day from the dead. But he is a true Chriſtian who is one inwardly, and then only can we be ſtyled true believers, when we not only profeſs to believe, but have felt the power of our bleſſed Lord's riſing from the dead, by being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and raiſed by his Spirit, when dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, to a thorough newneſs both of heart and life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="unknown:028079_0221_0FD695493B61DFB0"/>
The devils themſelves cannot but believe the doctrine of the reſurrection, and tremble; but yet they continue devils, becauſe the benefits of this reſurrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating power from it, to change and put off their diabolical nature. And ſo, unleſs we not only profeſs to know, but alſo feel that Chriſt is riſen indeed, by being born again from above, we ſhall be as far from the kingdom of God as they: our faith will be as ineffectual as the faith of devils.</p>
            <p>Nothing has done more harm to the Chriſtian world, nothing has rendered the croſs of Chriſt of leſs effect, than a vain ſuppoſition, that religion is ſomething without us. Whereas we ſhould conſider, that every thing that Chriſt did outwardly, muſt be done over again in our ſouls; or otherwiſe, the believing there was ſuch a divine Perſon once on earth who triumphed over hell and the grave, will profit us no more than believing there was once ſuch a perſon as Alexander who conquered the world.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt was born of the Virgin's womb, ſo muſt he be ſpiritually formed in our hearts. As he died for ſin, ſo muſt we die to ſin. And as he roſe again, from the dead, ſo muſt we alſo riſe to a divine life.</p>
            <p>None but thoſe who have followed him in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or new-birth, ſhall ſit on thrones as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of his ſentence, when he ſhall come in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible majeſty to judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>It is true, as for the outward work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was a tranſient act, and was certainly finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the croſs; but the application of that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our hearts, is a work that will continue always even unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>So long as there is an elect man breathing on the earth, who is naturally engendered of the offspring of the firſt Adam, ſo long muſt the quickening Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028079_0222_0FD69511EF0C6F00"/>
which was purchaſed by the reſurrection of the ſecond Adam, that Lord from heaven, be breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his ſoul.</p>
            <p>For though we may exiſt by Chriſt, yet we cannot be ſaid to exiſt in him, till we are united to him by one ſpirit, and enter into a new ſtate of things, as certainly as he entered into a new ſtate of things, after that he roſe from the dead.</p>
            <p>We may throng and crowd round about Chriſt, and call him Lord, Lord, when we come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before his footſtool; but we have not effectually touched him, till by a lively faith in his reſurrection, we perceive a divine virtue coming out of him, to renew and purify our ſouls.</p>
            <p>How greatly then do they err who reſt in a bare hiſtorical faith of our Saviour's reſurrection, and look only for external proofs to evidence it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were we the moſt learned diſputers of this world, and could ſpeak of the certainty of this fact with the tongue of men and angels, yet without this inward teſtimony of it in our hearts, though we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others, yet we ſhould never be ſaved by it ourſelves.</p>
            <p>For we are but dead men, we are like ſo many carcaſes wrapt up in grave clothes, till that ſame Jeſus who called Lazarus from his tomb, and at whoſe own reſurrection many that ſlept aroſe, doth raiſe us alſo by his quickening Spirit from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, in which we have ſo long lain, to a holy and heavenly life.</p>
            <p>We might think ourſelves happy, if we had ſeen the holy Jeſus after he was riſen from the dead, and our hands had handled that Lord of life. But more happy are they who have not ſeen him, and yet having felt the power of his reſurrection, therefore believe in him. For many ſaw our divine Maſter,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028079_0223_0FD6954CDAA99F60"/>
who were not ſaved by him; but whoſoever has thus felt the power of his reſurrection, has the earneſt of his inheritance in his heart, he has paſſed from death to life, and ſhall never fall into final condemnation.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that this is fooliſhneſs to the natural man, as were many ſuch like truths to our Lord's own diſciples, when only weak in faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he roſe again. But when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe natural men, like them, have fully felt the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they will then own that this doctrine is from God, and ſay with the Samaritans, <q>Now we believe not becauſe of thy ſaying,</q> for we ourſelves have experienced it in our hearts.</p>
            <p>And O that all unbelievers, all letter-learned maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iſrael, who now look upon the doctrine of the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, or our new birth as an idle tale, and condemn the preachers of it as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts and madmen, did but thus feel the power of it in their ſouls, they would no longer aſk, how this thing could be? But they would be convinced of it as much as Thomas was, when he ſaw the Lord's Chriſt; and like him, when Jeſus bid him reach out his hands and thruſt them into his ſide, in a holy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they would cry out, "My Lord, and my God!"</p>
            <p>But how ſhall an unbeliever, how ſhall the formal Chriſtian come thus to <q>know Chriſt, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his reſurrection?</q> God, who cannot lie, has told us, <q>I am the reſurrection and the life, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever liveth and believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live. Again ſays the apoſtle, By faith we are ſaved, and that not of ourſelves, it is the gift of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, this is the way, walk in it. Believe and you ſhall live in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you; you ſhall be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with you. But without this, your outward goodneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions will avail you nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="unknown:028079_0224_0FD695131E13EBB0"/>
But then, by this faith we are not to underſtand a dead ſpeculative faith, a faith in the head; but a living principle wrought in the heart by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful operations of the Holy Ghoſt, a faith that will enable us to overcome the world and forſake all in affection for Jeſus Chriſt. For thus ſpeaks our bleſſed Maſter. <q>Unleſs a man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo the apoſtle, in the words immediately following the text, ſays, <q>being made conformable to his death;</q> thereby implying, that we cannot know the power of Chriſt's reſurrection unleſs we are made conformable to him in his death.</p>
            <p>This we have ſhadowed out by the cuſtom of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing by immerſion in the primitive church, and (which is alſo recommended by our own) their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infants under the water, ſignified their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to die unto ſin; as their taking them out of the water, ſignified their riſing again to newneſs of life. To which the apoſtle plainly alludes, when he ſays, we are buried with him in baptiſm."</p>
            <p>If we can reconcile light and darkneſs, heaven and hell, then we may hope to know the power of Chriſt's reſurrection without dying to ourſelves and the world. But till we can do this, we might as well expect that Chriſt will have concord with Belial.</p>
            <p>For there is ſuch a contrariety between the ſpirit of this world, and the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that he who will be at friendſhip with the one, muſt be at enmity with the other: We cannot ſerve God and mammon."</p>
            <p>This may, indeed, ſeem a hard ſaying; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with the young man in the goſpel, may be tempted to go away ſorrowful: but wherefore ſhould this offend them? For what is all that is in the world, the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life, but vanity and vexation of ſpirit?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="unknown:028079_0225_0FD6954E4B963B78"/>
God is love; and therefore, could our own wills, or the world, have made us happy, he never would have ſent his own dear Son Jeſus Chriſt to die and riſe again, to deliver us from the power of them. But becauſe they only torment and cannot ſatisfy, therefore God bids us to renounce them.</p>
            <p>Had any one perſuaded profane Eſau not to loſe ſo glorious a privilege, merely for the ſake of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preſent corrupt inclination, when he ſaw him about to ſell his birth-right for a little red pottage, would not one think that man to have been Eſau's friend? And juſt thus ſtands the caſe between God and us. By the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we are new-born to an heavenly inheritance amongſt all them which are ſanctified; but our own corrupt wills would tempt us to ſell this glorious birth-right for the vanities of the world, which, like Eſau's red pottage, may pleaſe us for a while, but will ſoon be taken away from us. God knows this, and therefore rather bids us renounce them for a ſeaſon, than for the ſhort enjoyment of them loſe the privilege of that glorious birth-right, to which, by knowing the power of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we are entitled.</p>
            <p>O the depth of the riches and excellency of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity! Well might the great St. Paul count all things but dung and droſs for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. Well might he deſire ſo ardently to know Jeſus, and the power of his reſurrection. For even on this ſide eternity it raiſes us above the world, and makes us to ſit in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Well might that glorious company of worthies, recorded in the holy ſcriptures, ſupported with a deep ſenſe of their heavenly calling, deſpiſe the pleaſures and profits of this life, and wander about in ſheep-ſkins and goat-ſkins, in dens and caves
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028079_0226_0FD695148C22EB18"/>
of the earth, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented. And O that we were all like-minded! that we felt the power of Chriſt's reſurrection as they did! How ſhould we then count all things as dung and droſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord! How ſhould we then recover our primitive dignity, trample the earth under our feet, and with our ſouls be continually gaſping after God.</p>
            <p>And what hinders but we may be thus minded? Is Jeſus Chriſt, our great High Prieſt, altered from what he was? No; he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. And though he is exalted to the right-hand of God, yet he is not aſhamed to call us bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The power of his reſurrection is as great now as formerly, and the Holy Spirit, which was aſſured to us by his reſurrection, as ready and able to quicken us who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, as any ſaint that ever lived. Let us but cry, and that inſtantly, to him that is mighty and able to ſave; let us, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth, without ſecretly keeping back the leaſt part, renounce ourſelves and the world; then we ſhall be Chriſtians indeed. And though the world may caſt us out and ſeparate from our company, yet Jeſus Chriſt will walk with, and abide in us. And at the general reſurrection of the laſt day, when the voice of the archangel and trump of God ſhall bid the ſea and the graves to give up their dead, and all nations ſhall appear before him, then will he confeſs us before his Father and the holy angels, and we ſhall receive that invitation which he ſhall then pronounce to all who love and fear him, <q>Come, ye bleſſed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the beginning of the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>

            <head>THE INDWELLING OF THE SPIRIT, THE COMMON PRIVILEGE OF ALL BELIEVERS.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOHN vii. 37, 38, 39.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood, and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NOTHING has rendered the croſs of Chriſt of leſs effect; nothing has been a greater ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block and rock of offence to weak minds, than a ſuppoſition, now current among us, that moſt of what is contained in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, was deſigned only for our Lord's firſt and immediate followers, and conſequently calculated but for one or two hundred years. Accordingly, many now read the life, ſufferings, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſame manner as Caeſar's Commentaries, or the conqueſts of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander are read: as things rather intended to afford matter for ſpeculation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</p>
            <p>As this is true of the doctrines of the goſpel in general, ſo it is of the operation of God's Spirit upon the hearts of believers in particular; for we
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028079_0228_0FD695186C5EBBF0"/>
no ſooner mention the neceſſity of our receiving the Holy Ghoſt in theſe laſt days, as well as formerly, but we are looked upon by ſome, as enthuſiaſts and madmen; and by others, repreſented as wilfully deceiving the people, and undermining the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed conſtitution of the church.</p>
            <p>Judge ye then, whether it is not high time for the true miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who have been made partakers of this heavenly gift, to lift up their voices like a trumpet; and if they would not have thoſe ſouls periſh, for which the Lord Jeſus has ſhed his precious blood, to declare with all boldneſs, that the Holy Spirit is the common privilege and portion of all believers in all ages; and that we, as well as the firſt Chriſtians, muſt receive the Holy Ghoſt, before we can be truly called the children of God.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, (and alſo that I might anſwer the deſign of our church in appointing the preſent feſtival<note n="*" place="bottom">Whitſuntide.</note>) I have choſen the words of the text.</p>
            <p>They were ſpoken of by Jeſus Chriſt, when he was at the feaſt of Tabernacles. Our Lord attended on the temple ſervice in general, and the feſtivals of the Jewiſh Church in particular. The feſtival at which he was now preſent, was that of the feaſt of Tabernacles, which the Jews obſerved according to God's appointment in commemoration of their liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in tents. At the laſt day of this feaſt, it was cuſtomary for many pious people to fetch water from a certain place, and bring it on their heads, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this anthem out of Iſaiah, <q>And with joy ſhall they draw water out of the wells of ſalvation.</q> Our Lord Jeſus obſerving this, and it being his conſtant practice to ſpiritualize every thing he met with, cries out, <q>If any man thirſt let him come
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028079_0229_0FD69551B9C7EE60"/>
unto me (rather than unto the well) and drink. He that believeth on me as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſpoken,</q> (where it is ſaid, God will make water to ſpring out of a dry rock, and ſuch like) <q>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</q> And that we might know what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour meant by this living water, the evangeliſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds, <q>But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe: And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall briefly ſhew what is meant by the word Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Spirit is the common privilege of all believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the reaſon on which this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is founded. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conclude with a general exhortation to believe on Jeſus Chriſt, whereby alone we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew what is meant by the word Spirit.</p>
            <p>By the Spirit, is evidently to be underſtood the Holy Ghoſt, the third perſon in the ever-bleſſed Trinity, conſubſtantial and co-eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both. For, to uſe the words of our church in this day's office, that which we believe of the glory of the Father, the ſame we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, without any difference or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality.</p>
            <p>Thus ſays St. John, in his firſt epiſtle, chap. v. verſe 7. <q>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</q> And our Lord, when he gave his apoſtles commiſſion to go and teach
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028079_0230_0FD6951C5183D748"/>
all nations, commanded them to baptize in the name of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as of the Father and the Son. And St. Peter, Acts v. 3. ſaid to Ananias, <q>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt? and verſe 4. he ſays, Thou haſt not lied unto men, but unto God.</q> From all which paſſages, it is plain, that the Holy Ghoſt is truly and properly God, as well as the Father and the Son. This is an unſpeakable myſtery, but a myſtery of God's revealing, and, therefore to be aſſented to with our whole hearts; ſeeing God is not a man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould deceive. I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To prove, that the Holy Ghoſt is the common privilege of all believers.</p>
            <p>But, here I would not be underſtood of ſo receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt, as no enable us to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or ſhew outward ſigns and wonders. I allow our adverſaries, that to pretend to be inſpired in this ſenſe, is being wiſe above what is written. Perhaps it cannot be proved, that God ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this extraordinary manner, but when ſome new revelation was to be eſtabliſhed, as at the firſt ſettling of the Moſaic and goſpel diſpenſation: and as for my own part, I cannot but ſuſpect the ſpirit of thoſe who inſiſt upon a repetition of ſuch miracles at this time. For the world being now become nominally Chriſtian, (though God knows, little of its power is left among us) there need not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miracles, but only an inward co-operation of the Holy Spirit with the word, to prove that Jeſus is the Meſſiah which was to come into the world.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if it were poſſible for thee, O man, to have faith, ſo as to be able to remove mountains, or caſt out devils; nay, could'ſt thou ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, yea, and bid the ſun
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028079_0231_0FD6955535B7C138"/>
ſtand ſtill in the midſt of heaven; what would all theſe gifts of the Spirit avail thee, without being made partaker of his ſanctifying graces? Saul had the ſpirit of government for a while, ſo as to become another man, and yet probably was a caſt-away. And many, who caſt out devils in Chriſt's name, at the laſt will be diſowned by him. If, therefore, thou hadſt only the gifts, and was deſtitute of the graces of the Holy Ghoſt, they would only ſerve to lead thee with ſo much the more ſolemnity to hell.</p>
            <p>Here then we join iſſue with our adverſaries, and will readily grant, that we are not in this ſenſe to be inſpired, as were our Lord's firſt apoſtles. But unleſs men have eyes which ſee not, and ears that hear not, how can they read the latter part of the text, and not confeſs that the Holy Spirit in another ſenſe, is the common privilege of all believers, even to the end of the world? This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Obſerve he does not ſay, they that believe on him for one or two ages, but they that believe on him in general, or, at all times, and in all places. So that, unleſs we can prove, that St. John was under a deluſion when he wrote theſe words, we muſt believe that even we alſo, ſhall receive the Holy Ghoſt, if we believe on the Lord Jeſus with our whole hearts.</p>
            <p>Again, our Lord, juſt before his bitter paſſion, when he was about to offer up his ſoul an offering for the ſins of the elect world; when his heart was moſt enlarged, and he would undoubtedly demand the moſt excellent gifts for his diſciples, prays, <q>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one;</q> that is, that all his
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028079_0232_0FD6951FD22FD2A0"/>
true followers might be united to him by his Holy Spirit, by as real, vital, and myſtical an union, as there was between Jeſus Chriſt and the Father. I ſay all his true followers; for it is evident, from our Lord's own words, that he had us, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in view, when he put up this prayer; <q>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word;</q> ſo that, unleſs we treat our Lord as the high prieſts did, and count him a blaſphemer, we muſt confeſs, that all who believe in Jeſus Chriſt, through the word, or miniſtration of his ſervants, are to be joined to Jeſus Chriſt, by being made partakers of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>A great noiſe hath been made of late, about the word enthuſiaſt, and it has been caſt upon the preachers of the goſpel, as a term of reproach; but every Chriſtian, in the proper ſenſe of the word, muſt be an enthuſiaſt; that is, muſt be inſpired of God, or have God, by his Spirit, in him. St Peter tells us, we have many great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that we may be made partakers of the divine nature; our Lord prays, <q>that we may be one, as the Father and he are one;</q> and our own church, in conformity to theſe texts of ſcripture, in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent communion-office, tell us that thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacrament worthily, <q>Dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them; that they are one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them.</q> And yet, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians muſt have their names caſt out as evil, and miniſters in particular, muſt be looked upon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deceivers of the people, for affirming, that we muſt be really united to God, by receiving the Holy Ghoſt. "Be aſtoniſhed, O heavens, at this!"</p>
            <p>Indeed, I will not ſay, all our letter-learned preachers deny this doctrine in expreſs words; but
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028079_0233_0FD6955884209848"/>
however, they do in effect; for they talk profeſſedly againſt inward feelings, and ſay, we may have God's Spirit without feeling it, which is, in reality, to deny the thing itſelf. And had I a mind to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the progreſs of the goſpel, and to eſtabliſh the kingdom of darkneſs, I would go about telling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they might have the Spirit of God, and yet not feel it.</p>
            <p>But to return: When our Lord was about to aſcend to his Father and our Father, to his God and our God, he gave his apoſtles this commiſſion, <q>Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> And accordingly, by authority of this commiſſion, we do teach and baptize in this, and every age of the church. And though we tranſlate the words, "baptizing them in the name;" yet, as the name of God, in the Lord's prayer, and ſeveral other places, ſignifies his nature, they might as well be tranſlated thus, <q>baptizing them into the nature of the Father, into the nature of the Son, and into the nature of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> Conſequently, if we are all to be baptized into the nature of the Holy Ghoſt, before our baptiſm be effectual to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is evident, that we all muſt actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghoſt, and ere we can ſay, we truly believe in Jeſus Chriſt. For no one can ſay, that Jeſus is my Lord, but he that has thus received the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Numbers of other texts might be quoted to make this doctrine, if poſſible, ſtill more plain; but I am aſtoniſhed, that any who call themſelves members; much more, that many, who are preachers in the church of England, ſhould dare ſo much as to open their lips againſt it. And yet, with grief I ſpeak it, God is my judge, perſons of the eſtabliſhed
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028079_0234_0FD69521CD5B20E0"/>
church ſeem more generally to be ignorant of it than any diſſenters whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But, my dear brethren, what have you been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How often have your hearts given your lips the lie? How often have you offered to God the ſacrifice of fools, and had your prayers turned into ſin, if you approve of, and uſe our church-liturgy, and yet deny the Holy Spirit to be the portion of all believers? In the daily abſolution, the miniſter exhorts the people to pray, that <q>God would grant them repentance, and his Holy Spirit;</q> In the Collect for Chriſtmas-day, we beſeech God, <q>that he would daily renew us by his Holy Spirit.</q> In the laſt week's Collect, we prayed <q>that we may evermore rejoice in the comforts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt;</q> and in the concluding prayer, which we put up every day, we pray, not only that the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, but that "the fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt" may be with us all evermore.</p>
            <p>But farther, a ſolemn ſeaſon, to ſome, is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: I mean the Ember-days, at the end of which, all that are to be ordained to the office of a deacon, are in the ſight of God, and in the preſence of the congregation, to declare, that they truſt they are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that adminiſtration; and to thoſe who are to be ordained prieſts, the biſhop is to repeat theſe ſolemn words, <q>Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt, now committed unto thee by the impoſition of our hands.</q> And yet, O that I had no reaſon to ſpeak it, many that uſe our good forms, and many who have witneſſed this good confeſſion, yet dare to both talk and preach againſt the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Ghoſt now; and not only ſo, but cry out againſt thoſe, who do inſiſt upon it, as
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028079_0235_0FD69559A29FB178"/>
madmen, enthuſiaſts, ſchiſmatics, and underminers of the eſtabliſhed conſtitution.</p>
            <p>But you are the ſchiſmatics, you are the bane of the church of England, who are always crying out, "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord:" and yet ſtarve the people out of our communion, by feeding them only with the dry huſks of dead mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and not bringing out to them the fatted calf; I mean, the doctrines of the operations of the bleſſed Spirit of God. But here is the misfortune; many of us are not led by, and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we cannot talk feelingly of, the Holy Ghoſt; we ſubſcribe to our articles, and make them ſerve for a key to get into church-preferment, and then preach contrary to thoſe very articles to which we have ſubſcribed. Far be it from me, to charge all the clergy with this hateful hypocriſy: no, bleſſed be God, there are ſome left among us who dare maintain the doctrines of the reformation, and preach the truth as it is in Jeſus: But I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lie not; the generality of the clergy are fallen from our articles, and do not ſpeak agreeable to them, or to the form of ſound words delivered in the ſcriptures; woe be unto ſuch blind leaders of the blind! How can you eſcape the damnation of hell? It is not all your learning, (falſely ſo called) it is not all your preferments can keep you from the juſt judgment of God. Yet a little while, and we ſhall all appear before the tribunal of Chriſt; there, there will I meet you; there Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls, ſhall determine who are the falſe prophets, who are the wolves in ſheep's clothing. Thoſe who ſay, that we muſt now receive and feel the Holy Ghoſt, or thoſe who exclaim againſt it, as the doctrine of devils.</p>

But I can ſay no more? it is an unpleaſing taſk to cenſure any order of men, eſpecially thoſe who are in the miniſtry; nor would any thing excuſe it but neceſſity: That neceſſity which extorted from our Lord himſelf ſo many woes againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, the letter-learned rulers and teachers of the Jewiſh church; and ſurely if I could bear to ſee people periſh for lack of knowledge, and yet be ſilent towards thoſe who keep from them the key of true knowledge, the very ſtones would cry out.</p>
            <p>Would we reſtore the church to its primitive dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the only way is to live and preach the doctrine of Chriſt, and the articles to which we have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; then we ſhall ſee the number of diſſenters will daily decreaſe, and the church of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the joy of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>I am, in the <hi>Third</hi> place, to ſhew the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>I ſay the reaſonableneſs of the doctrine; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſeem fooliſhneſs to the natural man, yet to thoſe, who have taſted of the good word of life, and have felt the power of the world to come, it will appear to be founded on the higheſt reaſon; and is capable to thoſe who have eyes to ſee, even of a demonſtration; I ſay of demonſtration, for it ſtands on this ſelf-evident truth, that we are fallen creatures, or, to uſe the ſcripture-expreſſion, <q>Have all died in Adam.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I know indeed, it is now no uncommon thing amongſt us, to deny the doctrine of original ſin, as well as the divinity of Jeſus Chriſt; but it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on thoſe who deny it, firſt to diſprove the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the holy ſcriptures; if thou canſt prove, thou unbeliever, that the book, which we call the Bible, does not contain the lively oracles of God; if thou canſt ſhew, that holy men of old did not
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028079_0237_0FD6955B0F46F320"/>
write this book, as they were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt, then will we give up the doctrine of original ſin; but unleſs thou canſt do this, we muſt inſiſt upon it, that we are all conceived and born in ſin; if for no other, yet for this one reaſon, becauſe that God, who cannot lie, has told us ſo.</p>
            <p>But what has light to do with darkneſs, or polite infidels with the Bible! Alas! as they are ſtrangers to the power, ſo they are generally as great ſtrangers to the word of God. And therefore, if we will preach to them, we muſt preach to and from the heart: for talking in the language of ſcripture to them, is but like talking in an unknown tongue. Tell me then, O man, whoſoever thou art, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt the doctrine of original ſin, if thy conſcience be not ſeared as with a hot iron: tell me, if thou doſt not find thyſelf, by nature, to be a motley mixture of brute and devil? I know theſe terms will ſtir up the whole Phariſee in thy heart! But let not Satan hurry thee hence: ſtop a little, and let us reaſon together; doſt thou not find, that by nature thou art prone to pride? otherwiſe wherefore art thou now offended? Again, doſt not thou find in thyſelf the ſeeds of malice, revenge, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs? And what are theſe but the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the devil? Again, do we not all by nature follow, and ſuffer ourſelves to be led by our natural appetites, always looking downwards, never looking upwards to that God, in whom we live, move, and have our being? And what is this but the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beaſts that periſh? Out of thy own heart, therefore, will I oblige thee to confeſs, what an inſpired apoſtle has long ſince told us, that <q>the whole world (by nature) lies in the wicked one;</q> we are no better than thoſe whom St. Jude calls brute beaſts; for we have tempers in us all, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028079_0238_0FD695244DB0A380"/>
that prove to a demonſtration, that we are earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh.</p>
            <p>And this will ſerve as another argument, to prove the reality of the operations of the bleſſed Spirit on the hearts of believers, againſt thoſe falſe profeſſors, who deny there is any ſuch thing as influences of the Holy Spirit, that may be felt. For if they will grant that the devil worketh, and ſo as to be felt in the hearts of the children of diſobedience, (which they muſt grant, unleſs they will give an apoſtle the lie) where is the wonder that the good Spirit ſhould have the ſame power over thoſe who are truly obedient to the faith of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>If it be true then, that we are all by nature, ſince the fall, a mixture of brute and devil, it is evident, that we all muſt receive the Holy Ghoſt, ere we can dwell with and enjoy God.</p>
            <p>When you read, how the prodigal, in the goſpel, was reduced to ſo low a condition, as to eat huſks with ſwine, and how Nebuchadnezzar was turned out to graze with oxen; I am confident, you pity their unhappy ſtate. And when you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear how Jeſus Chriſt will ſay, at the laſt day, to all that are not born again of God. <q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</q> do not your hearts ſhrink within you, with a ſecret horror? And if creatures, with only our degree of goodneſs, cannot bear even the thoughts of dwelling with beaſts or devils, to whoſe nature we are ſo nearly allied, how do we imagine God, who is infinite goodneſs, and purity itſelf, can dwell with us, while we are partakers of both their natures? We might as well think to reconcile hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell.</p>
            <p>When Adam had eaten the forbidden fruit, he fled and hid himſelf from God; why? becauſe
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028079_0239_0FD6955ECD6F8F58"/>
he was naked; he was alienated from the life of God, the due puniſhment of his diſobedience. Now we are all by nature naked and void of God, as he was at that time and conſequently, until we are changed, renewed, and clothed with a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture again, we muſt fly from God alſo.</p>
            <p>Hence then appears the reaſonableneſs of our being obliged to receive the Spirit of God. It is founded on the doctrine of original ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you will always find, that thoſe who talk againſt feeling the operations of the Holy Ghoſt, very rarely, or ſlightly at leaſt, mention our fall in Adam; no, they refer St. Paul's account of the depravity of unbelievers, only to thoſe of old time. Whereas it it obvious, on the contrary, that we are all equally included under the guilt and conſequences of our firſt parents ſin, even as others; and to uſe the language of our own church-article, <q>bring into the world with us, a corruption, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us liable to God's wrath, and eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Should I preach to you any other doctrine, I ſhould wrong my own ſoul; I ſhould be found a falſe witneſs towards God and you; and he that preaches any other doctrine, howſoever dignified and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, ſhall bear his puniſhment, whoſoever he be.</p>
            <p>From this plain reaſon then appears the neceſſity, why we, as well as the firſt apoſtles, in this ſenſe, muſt receive the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>For the great work of ſanctification, or making us holy, is particularly referred to the Holy Ghoſt; therefore, our Lord ſays, <q>Unleſs a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt came down to ſave us, not only from
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028079_0240_0FD628B2705F31A8"/>

            <p>And now, my brethren, what ſhall I ſay more? Tell me, are not many of your offended at what has been ſaid already? Do not ſome of you think, tho' I mean well, yet I have carried the point a little too far? Are not others ready to cry out, if this be true, "who then can be ſaved?" Is not this driving people into deſpair?</p>
            <p>Yes, I ingenuouſly confeſs it is? but into what deſpair? a deſpair of mercy through Chriſt? No, God forbid; but a deſpair of living with God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving the Holy Ghoſt. And I would to God, that not only all you that hear me this day, but that the whole world was filled with this deſpair. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I have been doing no more that you allow your bodily phyſicians to do every day: if you have a wound, and are in earneſt about a cure, you bid the ſurgeon probe it to the very bottom; and ſhall not the phyſician of your ſouls be allowed the ſame freedom? What have I been doing but ſearching your natural wounds, that I might convince you of your danger, and put you upon applying to Jeſus Chriſt for a remedy? Indeed I have dealt with you as gently as I could; and now I have wounded, I will attempt to heal you: For I was in the</p>

Indeed, the poor generally receive the goſpel, and God has choſen the poor in this world, rich in faith. But though not many mighty, not many noble are called; and though it be eaſier for a camel to go, through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, yet even to you that are rich, do I now freely offer ſalvation, by Jeſus Chriſt, if you will renounce yourſelves, and come to Jeſus Chriſt as poor ſinners; I ſay as poor ſinners; for the poor in ſpirit are only ſo bleſſed as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Do not then ſay you are unworthy: for this is a faithful and true ſaying and worthy of all men to be received, <q>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners;</q> and if you are the chief of ſinners, if you feel yourſelves ſuch, verily Jeſus Chriſt came into the world chiefly to ſave you. When Joſeph was called out of the priſon-houſe to Pharoah's court, we are told, that he ſtaid ſome time to prepare himſelf; but do you come with all your priſon-clothes about you; come poor, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable and blind, and naked, as you are, and God the Father ſhall receive you with open arms, as was the returning prodigal. He ſhall cover your nakedneſs with the beſt robe of his dear ſon's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall ſeal you with the ſignet of his Spirit, and ſeed you with the fatted calf, even with the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt.

Come then, my guilty brethen, come and believe on the Lord that bought you with his precious blood; look up by faith, and ſee him whom you have pierced; behold him bleeding, panting, dying?

            <head>THE ETERNITY OF HELL-TORMENTS.</head>

               <bibl>MATTHEW xxv. 46.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE excellency of the goſpel diſpenſation is greatly evidenced by thoſe ſanctions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments which it offers to the choice of all its hearers, in order to engage them to be obedient to its precepts. For it promiſes no leſs than eternal happineſs to the good, and denounces no ſlighter a puniſhment that everlaſting miſery againſt the wicked: on the one hand, <q>It is a favour of life unto life; on the other, a favour of death unto death.</q> And though one would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be ſufficient to draw men to their duty, yet miniſters in all ages, have found it neceſſary, frequently to remind their people of the latter, and to ſet before them the terrors of the Lord, as ſo many powerful diſſuaſives from ſin.</p>
            <p>But whence is it that men are ſo diſingenuous? The reaſon ſeems to be this: the promiſe of eternal happineſs is ſo agreeable to the inclinations and wiſhes of mankind, that all who call themſelves? Chriſtians, univerſally and willingly ſubſcribe to the belief of it: but then there is ſomething ſo
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:028079_0246_0FD6952A615C40B0"/>
ſhocking in the conſideration of eternal torments, and ſeemingly ſuch an infinite diſproportion between an endleſs duration of pain, and a ſhort life ſpent in pleaſure, that men (ſome at leaſt of them) can ſcarcely be brought to confeſs it as an article of their faith, that an eternity of miſery awaits the wicked in a future ſtate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore, at this time, beg leave to inſiſt on the proof of this part of one of the articles of our creed; and endeavour to make good what our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord has here threatened in the words of the text, <q>Theſe (that is the wicked) ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, without conſidering the words as they ſtand in relation to the context, I ſhall reſolve all I have to ſay, into this one general propoſition, <q>That the torments reſerved for the wicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, are eternal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to make good this, I muſt inform you that I take it for granted,</p>
            <p>All preſent do ſtedfaſtly believe, They have ſomething within them, which we call a ſoul, and which is capable of ſurviving the diſſolution of the body, and of being miſerable or happy to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted farther, That you believe a divine revelation; that thoſe books emphatically called the Scriptures, were written by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and that the things therein contained, are founded upon eternal truth.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted, That you believe, that the Son of God came down to die for ſinners; and that there is but one Mediator between God and man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being granted, and they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be premiſed, proceed we now to make
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028079_0247_0FD69567CE653228"/>
good the one general propoſition aſſerted in the text, That the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal. <q>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</q> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> argument I ſhall advance to prove that the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, (for I have taken it for granted, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe books, emphatically called the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were written by the inſpiration of God, and that the things contained therein are founded upon eternal truth) is, that the word of God himſelf aſſures us, in line upon line, that it will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>To quote all the texts that might be produced in proof of this, would be endleſs. Let it ſuffice to inſtance only a few. In the old Teſtament, in the book of Daniel, chap. xii. verſe 2. we are told, that <q>ſome ſhall awake to everlaſting life, and others to everlaſting contempt.</q> In the book of Iſaiah, it is ſaid, that <q>the worm of thoſe who have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed God's law, and die impenitently, ſhall not die, nor their fire be quenched.</q> And, in another place, the holy prophet, ſtruck, no doubt, with aſtoniſhment and horror at the proſpect of the continuance of the torments of the damned, breaks out into this moving expoſtulation, <q>Who can dwell with everlaſting burning?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The New Teſtament is ſtill fuller as to this point, it being a revelation which brought this and ſuch like particulars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, That the words, everlaſting, and ever and ever, are often uſed in the Holy Scriptures, (eſpecially in the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament) when they ſignify not an endleſs duration; but a limited term of time.</p>
            <p>And this we readily grant: But then we reply, That when the words are uſed with this limitation, they either manifeſtly appear to be uſed ſo from the context; or are put in oppoſition to occaſional types, which God gave his people on ſome ſpecial occaſions, as when it is ſaid, <q>It ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual or everlaſting ſtatute, or, a ſtatute for ever;</q> that is, a ſtanding type, and not merely tranſient or occaſional, as was the pillar of cloud, the manna, and ſuch like. Or, laſtly, they have a relation to that covenant God made with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Iſrael; which if underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, will be everlaſting, though the ceremonial diſpenſation be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it ought to be obſerved, that ſome of the paſſages juſt now referred to, have neither of
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028079_0249_0FD695ADB10485E0"/>
theſe words ſo much as mentioned in them and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be interpreted, ſo as to denote only a limited term of years.</p>
            <p>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a demonſtration, that the words of the text will not admit of ſuch a reſtrained ſignification, as appears from their being directly oppoſed to the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following, <q>That the righteous ſhall go into life eternal.</q> From which words, all are ready to grant, that the life promiſed to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous will be eternal. And why the puniſhment threatened to the wicked ſhould not be underſtood to be eternal likewiſe, when the very ſame words in the original, is uſed to expreſs the duration of each, no ſhadow of reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ints with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs which will not equally prove that he ought to puniſh ſinners with eternal miſery.</p>
            <p>For, ſince we know nothing (at leaſt for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty) how he will deal with either, but by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation; and ſince, as was proved by the foregoing argument, he hath as poſitively threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternally to puniſh the wicked, as to reward the good; it follows, that his truth will be as much impeached and called in queſtion, did he not inflict his puniſhments, as it would be, if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> his rewards.</p>
            <p>To this alſo it has been objected, That though God is obliged by promiſe to give his rewards, yet his veracity could not be called in queſtion, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, he ſhould not execute his threatenings, as he actually did not in the caſe of Nineveh; which God expreſsly declared by his prophet Jonah, "ſhould be deſtroyed in forty days:" Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſequel of the ſtory informs us, that Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh was ſpared.</p>

               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:028079_0250_0FD6956D0A2ECBD8"/>
But in anſwer to this objection, we affirm, That God's threatenings, as well as promiſes, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; and for this reaſon, becauſe they are both founded on the eternal laws of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Accordingly we always find, that where the conditions were not performed, on the non-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which the threatenings were denounced; God always executed the puniſhment threaten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. The driving Adam out of Eden, the deſtruction of the old world by a deluge of water, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Sodom and Gomorrah, are, and will be always ſo many ſtanding monuments of God's exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his threatenings when denounced, though a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our weak apprehenſions, the puniſhment may ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> far to exceed the crime.</p>
            <p>It is true, God did ſpare Nineveh, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inhabitants did actually repent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore performed the conditions upon which it was ſuppoſed, by the prophet's being ſent to warn them, the threatened puniſhment ſhould be with-held.</p>
            <p>And ſo in reſpect to goſpel-threatenings. If men will ſo far conſult their own welfare as to comply with the goſpel, God certainly will not puniſh them, but on the contrary, confer upon them his rewards. But to affirm that he will not puniſh, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally too, impenitent, obſtinate ſinners, according as he hath threatened; what is it, in effect, but to make God like a man, that he ſhould lie, or the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent?</p>
            <p>But the abſurdity of ſuch an opinion will appear ſtill more evident from</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> argument I ſhall offer to prove, that the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, from the nature of the Chriſtian covenant.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt again obſerve, that it was taken for granted at the beginning of this diſcourſe, that
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028079_0251_0FD695AF08365B20"/>
you believe the Son of God came down to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that there is but one Mediator between God and man, even the man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And here I take it for granted farther. (unleſs you believe the abſurd and unwarrantable doctrine of purgatory) that you are fully perſuaded, this life is the only time allotted by Almighty God for working out our ſalvation, and that after a few years are paſſed over, there will remain no more ſacrifice for ſin.</p>
            <p>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it?) it follows, that if a wicked man dieth in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and under the wrath of God, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that ſtate to all eternity. For, ſince there is no poſſibility of his being delivered out of ſuch a condition, but by and through Chriſt; and ſince, at the hour of death, the time of Chriſt's mediation and interceſſion for him is irrecoverably gone; the ſame reaſon that may be given, why God ſhould puniſh a ſinner that dieth under the guilt of his ſins for a ſingle day, will equally hold good, why he ſhould continue to puniſh him for a year, an age, nay to all eternity.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt argument, to prove, That the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, becauſe the devil's puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be ſo.</p>
            <p>That there is ſuch a being whom we call the devil; that he was once an angel of light, but for his pride and rebellion againſt God, was caſt down from heaven, and is now permitted, with the reſt of the ſpiritual wickedneſſes, to walk to and fro, ſeeking whom they may devour; that there is a place of torment reſerved for them, or to uſe the apoſtle's words, <q>That they are reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs unto the judgment
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028079_0252_0FD6956E89213FF0"/>
of the great day;</q> are truths all here preſent were ſuppoſed to be convinced of, at the beginning of this diſcourſe, you believing the Holy Scriptures to be written by the inſpiration of God, wherein theſe truths are delivered.</p>
            <p>But then, if we allow all this, and thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it no injuſtice in God to puniſh thoſe once glorious ſpirits for their rebellion; how can we think it unjuſt in him to puniſh wicked men for their impertinency to all eternity.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, perhaps, that they have ſinned againſt greater light, and therefore deſerve a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er puniſhment. And ſo we grant that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fallen angels may be greater as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, than that of wicked men? but then we affirm, it will be equal as to the eternal duration of it: for in that day, as the lively oracles of God informs us, ſhall the Son of man ſay to them on his left hand, <q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</q> Where we find that impenitent ſinners are to be caſt into the ſame everlaſting fire with the devil and his angels; and that too very juſtly. For tho' they may have ſinned againſt greater light, yet Chriſtians ſin againſt greater mercy; ſince Chriſt took not hold of, did not die for, the fallen angels, but for men and for our ſalvation. So that if God ſpared not thoſe excellent beings, aſſure thyſelf, O obſtinate ſinner, whoever thou art, he will by no means ſpare thee.</p>
            <p>From what then has been ſaid it plainly appears, that verily the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter, are eternal. And if ſo, brethren, how ought we to fly to Jeſus Chriſt for refuge; how holy ought we to be in all manner of converſation and godlineſs. That we may be accounted worthy to eſcape this wrath to come!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:028079_0253_0FD695B0F8AF3718"/>
But before I proceed to a practical exhortation, permit me to draw an inference o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> two from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> if the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, what ſhall we ſay to thoſe, who make an open profeſſion in their creed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a life everlaſting, a life of miſery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> happineſs, and yet dare to live in the actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe ſins which will unavoidably, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, bring them into that place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Thou believeſt that the puniſhments of the impenitently wicked in another life, are eternal: thou doeſt well, the devils alſo believe and tremble. But know, O vain man, unleſs this belief doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thy practice, and makes thee bid adieu to thy ſins, every time thou repeateſt thy creed, thou doſt in effect ſay, I believe I ſhall be undone for ever.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> If the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, then let this ſerve as a caution to ſuch perſons, (and it is to be feared there are ſome ſuch) who go about to diſſuade others from the belief of ſuch an important truth; there being no ſurer way, in all probability, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and promote infidelity and prophaneneſs, than the broaching or maintaining ſo unwarrantable a doctrine. For if the poſitive threats of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eternity of hell-torments, are already found inſufficient to deter men from ſin, a higher pitch of wickedneſs may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any hopes of a future recovery out of them; or, what is ſtill worſe, that their ſouls are hereafter to be annihilated, and become like the beaſts that periſh? But wo unto ſuch blind leaders of the blind. No wonder if they both fall into the ditch. And let ſuch corrupters of God's word know, that I
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028079_0254_0FD695739C482C60"/>
teſtify unto every man that heareth me this day, <q>That if any one ſhall add unto, or take away from the words that are written in the book of God, God ſhall take his part out of the book of life, and ſhall add unto him all the plagues that are in that book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> If the torments reſerved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, then this may ſerve as a reproof for thoſe who quarrel with God, and ſay it is inconſiſtent with his juſtice, to puniſh a perſon to all eternity, only for enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon. But ſuch perſons muſt be told, that it is not their thinking or calling God unjuſt, will make him ſo, no more than a condemned priſoner's ſaying the law or judge is unjuſt, will render either duly chargeable with ſuch an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But knoweſt thou, O worm, what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy thou art guilty of, in charging God with injuſtice? <q>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</q> Wilt thou preſume to arraign the Almighty at the bar of thy ſhallow reaſoning? And call him unjuſt for puniſhing thee eternally, only becauſe thou wiſheſt it may not be ſo? But hath God ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? He hath ſaid it: and let God be true though every man be a liar. <q>Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</q> Aſſuredly he will. And if ſinners will not own his juſtice in his threatenings here, they will be compelled ere long to own and feel them, when tormented by him hereafter.</p>
            <p>But to come to a more practical application of what has been delivered.</p>
            <p>You have heard, brethren, the eternity of hell-torments plainly proved, from the expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Holy Scriptures, and conſequences natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028079_0255_0FD695B226035A90"/>
drawn from them. And now there ſeems to need no great art of rhetoric to perſuade any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſon to avoid and abhor thoſe ſins, which, without repentance will certainly plunge him into this eternal gulph. The diſproportion between the pleaſure and the pain (if there be any pleaſure in ſin) is ſo infinitely great that ſuppoſing it was only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though not certain, that the wicked would be everlaſtingly puniſhed, no one that has the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a man, for the enjoying a little momentary pleaſure, would, one might imagine, run the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of enduring eternal pain. But ſince the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned are not only poſſible, but certain, (ſince God himſelf, who cannot lie, has told us ſo) for men, notwithſtanding, to perſiſt in their diſobedience, and then flatter themſelves, that God will not make good his threatenings, is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> egregious inſtance of folly and preſumption.</p>
            <p>Dives himſelf ſuppoſed, that if one roſe from the dead, his brethren would amend their lives; but Chriſtians, it ſeems, will not repent, though the Son of God died and roſe again, and told them what they muſt expect, if they continue obſtinate in evil-doing.</p>
            <p>Would we now and then draw off our thoughts from ſenſible objects, and by faith meditate a while on the miſeries of the damned, I doubt not but we ſhould, as it were, hear many an unhappy ſoul venting his fruitleſs ſorrows, in ſome ſuch piteous moans as theſe.</p>

myſelf in them. Alas! are theſe the wages, theſe the effects of ſin? Are all the grand deceiver's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting promiſes come to this? O damned apoſtate! firſt to delude me with pretended promiſes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and after ſeveral years drudgery in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thus to involve me in eternal woe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O that I had never hearkened to his beguiling inſinuations! O that I had rejected his very firſt ſuggeſtions with the utmoſt deteſtation and abhorrence! O that I had taken up my croſs and followed Chriſt! O that I had never ridiculed ſerious godlineſs; and out of a falſe politeneſs, condemned the truly pious as too ſevere, enthuſiaſtic, or ſuperſtitious! For I then had been happy indeed, happy beyond expreſſion, happy to all eternity, yonder in thoſe bleſſed regions where they ſit, clothed with unſpeakable glory, and chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth their ſeraphic hallelujahs to the Lamb that ſitteth upon the throne for-ever. But, alas! theſe reflections come too late: theſe wiſhes now are vain and fruitleſs; I have not ſuffered, and therefore muſt not reign with them. I have in effect denied the Lord that bought me, and therefore juſtly am I now denied by him. But muſt I live for ever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in theſe flames? Muſt this body of mine, which not long ſince lay in ſtate, was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, muſt it be here eternally confined, and made the mockery of inſulting devils! O eternity! that thought fills me with deſpair: I muſt be miſerable for ever.</p>
            <p>Come then, all ye ſelf-deluding, ſelf-deluded ſinners, and imagine yourſelves for once in the place of that truly wretched man I have been here deſcribing.

of a ſelf-condemning conſcience will hereafter be to you. Think how impoſſible it will be for you <q>to dwell with everlaſting burnings.</q>

               </gap> ſtrict piety, ſelf-denial, and mortification, can keep you from thoſe torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the eternity of which I have been endeavouring to prove.</p>
            <p>But I can no more. Theſe thoughts are too me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for me to dwell on, as well as for you to hear; and God knows, as puniſhing is his ſtrange work, ſo denouncing his threatenings is mine; but if the bare mentioning the torments of the damned is ſo ſhocking, how terrible muſt the enduring of them be!</p>
            <p>And now, are not ſome of you ready to cry out, "Theſe are hard ſayings, who can bear them?"</p>
            <p>But let not ſincere Chriſtians be in the leaſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at what has been delivered: no, for you is reſerved a crown, a kingdom, an eternal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of glory. Chriſt never ſaid that the righteous, the believing, the upright, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but the wicked, mercileſs, negatively good profeſſors before deſcribed, ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment. For you, who love him in ſincerity, a new and living way is laid open into the holy of holies by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: and an abundant

            <p>But let no obſtinately wicked profeſſors dare to apply any of the divine promiſes to themſelves: <q>for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and give it unto dogs!</q> No, to ſuch the terrors of the Lord only belong. And as certainly as Chriſt will ſay to his true followers, <q>Come, ye bleſſed Children of my Father, receive the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the beginning of the world;</q> ſo he will unalterably pronounce this dreadful ſentence againſt all that die in their ſins, <q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</q>

            <p>From which unhappy ſtate, may God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy deliver us all through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom, with thee O Father, and thee O Holy Ghoſt, three perſons and one eternal God, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all honour, power, might, majeſty, and dominion, now and for evermore.</p>

               <bibl>JOSHUA xxiv. 15.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words contain the holy reſolution of pious Joſhua, who having, in a moſt moving, affectionate diſcourſe recounted to the Iſraelites what great things God had done for them, in the verſe immediately preceding the text, comes to draw a proper inference from what he had been delivering; and acquaints them, in the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing terms, that ſince God had been ſo exceeding gracious unto them, they could do no leſs, than out of gratitude for ſuch uncommon favours and mercies, dedicate both themſelves and families to his ſervice. <q>Now, therefore, fear the Lord and ſerve him in ſincerity and truth, and put away the Gods which your fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the flood.</q> And by the ſame engaging motive does the prophet Samuel afterwards enforce their obedience to the commandments of God, 1 Sam. xii. 24, <q>Only fear the Lord and ſerve him in truth with all your heart; for conſider how great things he hath done for you.</q> But then, that they might not excuſe themſelves (as too many might be apt to do) by his giving them a bad example, or
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028079_0260_0FD6957B1F23D128"/>
think he was laying heavy burdens upon them, whilſt he himſelf touched them not with one of his fingers, he tells them in the text, that whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they might pay to the doctrine he had been preaching, yet he (as all miniſters ought to do) was reſolved to live up and practiſe it himſelf: <q>Chooſe you therefore whom you will ſerve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gods which your fathers ſerved, or the gods of the Amorities, in whoſe land ye dwell: but as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A reſolution this, worthy of Joſhua, and no leſs becoming, no leſs neceſſary for every true ſon of Joſhua, that is intruſted with the care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a family in our day: and, if it was ever ſeaſonable for miniſters to preach up, or people to put in practice Family Religion, it was never more ſo than in the preſent age; ſince it is greatly to be feared, that out of thoſe many houſeholds that call themſelves Chriſtians, there are but few that ſerve God in their reſpective families as they ought.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, viſit our churches and you may perhaps ſee ſomething of the form of godlineſs ſtill ſubſiſting among us; but even that is ſcarcely to be met with in private houſes. So that were the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed angels to come, as in the patriarchal age, and obſerve our ſpiritual oeconomy at home, would they not be tempted to ſay, as Abraham to Abimelech, "Surely the fear of God is not in this place?" Gen. xx. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>How ſuch a general neglect of Family Religion firſt began to overſpread the Chriſtian world, is difficult to determine. As for the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, I am poſitive it was not ſo with them: No, they had not ſo learned Chriſt, as falſely to imagine religion was to be confined ſolely to their aſſemblies
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028079_0261_0FD695BC8D478170"/>
for public worſhip; but, on the contrary, behaved with ſuch piety and exemplary holineſs in their private families, that St. Paul often ſtyles their houſe a church: Salute ſuch a one, ſays he, and the church which is in his houſe. And, I believe we muſt for ever deſpair of ſeeing a primitive ſpirit of piety revived in the world, till we are ſo happy as to ſee a revival of primitive Family Religion; and perſons unanimouſly reſolving with good old Joſhua, in the words of the text, <q>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which words, I ſhall beg leave to inſiſt on theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is the duty of every governor of a family to take care, that not only he himſelf, but alſo that thoſe committed to his charge, ſerve the Lord.</item>
               <item>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew after what manner a governor and his houſehold ought to ſerve the Lord. And,</item>
               <item>III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall offer ſome motives, in order to excite all governors, with their reſpective houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, to ſerve the Lord in the manner that ſhall be recommended.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew that it is the duty of every governor of a family to take care, that not only he himſelf, but alſo that thoſe committed to his charge, ſhould ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>And this will appear, if we conſider that every governor of a family ought to look upon himſelf as obliged to act in three capacities: as a prophet, to inſtruct; as a prieſt, to pray for and with; as a king, to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed, the latter of theſe, their kingly office, they are not ſo frequently deficient in, (nay in this they are generally too ſolicitous;) but as for
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028079_0262_0FD6957CC9F6E740"/>
the two former, their prieſtly and prophetic offices, like Gallio, they care for no ſuch things. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indifferent ſome governors may be about it, they may be aſſured, that God will require a due diſcharge of theſe offices at their hands. For if, as the apoſtle argues, <q>he that does not provide for his own houſe, in temporal things, has denied the faith and is worſe than an infidel;</q> to what greater degree of apoſtacy muſt he have arrived, who takes no thought to provide for the ſpiritual welfare of his family.</p>
            <p>But farther, perſons are generally very liberal of their invectives againſt the clergy, and think they juſtly blame the conduct of that miniſter who does not take heed to and watch over the flock, of which the Holy Ghoſt has made him overſeer: but may not every governor of a family, be in a lower degree liable to the ſame cenſure, who takes no thought for thoſe ſouls who are committed to his charge? For every houſe is as it were a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, every governor (as was before obſerved) a prieſt, every family a flock: And if any of them periſh through the governor's neglect, their blood will God require at his hands.</p>
            <p>Were a miniſter to diſregard teaching his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple publicly, and from houſe to houſe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf by ſaying that he had enough to do to work out his own ſalvation with fear and trembling, without concerning himſelf with that of others; would you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be apt to think ſuch a miniſter, to be like the unjuſt judge, <q>One that neither feared God nor regarded man?</q> And yet, odious as ſuch a character would be, it is no worſe than that governor of a family deſerves, who thinks himſelf obliged only to ſave his own ſoul, without paying any regard to the ſouls of his houſehold. For (as
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028079_0263_0FD695BE111A4FA8"/>
was above hinted) every houſe is as it were a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and every maſter is concerned to ſecure, as much as in him lies, the ſpiritual proſperity of every one under his roof, as any miniſter whatever is obliged to look to the ſpiritual welfare of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon under his charge.</p>
            <p>What precedents men who neglect their duty in this particular, can plead for ſuch omiſſion, I cannot tell. Doubtleſs not the example of holy Job, who was ſo far from imagining that he had no concern, as governor of a family, with any one's ſoul but his own, that the ſcripture acquaints us, <q>When the days of his children's feaſting were gone about, that Job ſent and ſanctified them, and offered burnt offerings, according to the number of them all; for Job ſaid, it may be that my ſons have ſinned and curſed God, in their hearts:</q> Thus did Job continually." Nor can they plead the practice of good old Joſhua, whom, in the text, we find as much concerned for his houſehold's welfare, as his own. Nor laſtly, that of Cornelius, who feared God, not only himſelf, but with all his houſe: And were Chriſtians but of the ſame ſpirit of Job, Joſhua, and the Gentile centurion, they would act as Job, Joſhua, and Cornelius did.</p>
            <p>But alas! if this be the caſe, and all governors of families ought not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſerve the Lord them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but likewiſe to ſee that their reſpective houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds do ſo too; what will then become of thoſe who not only neglect ſerving God themſelves, but alſo make it their buſineſs to ridicule and ſcoff at any of their houſe that do? Who are not content with <q>not entering into the kingdom of heaven them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but thoſe alſo that are willing to enter in, they hinder.</q> Surely ſuch men are factors for the devil indeed. Surely their damnation ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028079_0264_0FD6957F15ED5F70"/>
not: For although God, in his good providence may ſuffer ſuch ſtumbling-blocks to be put in his children's way, and ſuffer their greateſt enemies to be thoſe of their own houſeholds, for a trial of their ſincerity, and improvemement of their faith; yet we cannot but pronounce a woe againſt thoſe maſters "by whom ſuch offences came." For if thoſe that only take care of their own ſouls, can ſcarcely be ſaved, where will ſuch monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and wicked governors appear?</p>
            <p>But hoping there are but few of this unhappy ſtamp, proceed we now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing propoſed; To ſhew after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a governor and his houſehold ought to ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the firſt thing I ſhall mention, is, reading the word of God. This is a duty incumbent on every private perſon. <q>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life,</q> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept given by our bleſſed Lord indifferently to all: but much more ſo, ought every governor of a family to think it in a peculiar manner ſpoken to myſelf, becauſe (as hath been already proved) he ought to look upon himſelf as a prophet, and therefore, agreeably to ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> character, bound to inſtruct thoſe under his charge in the knowledge of the word of God.</p>
            <p>This we find was the order God gave to his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people Iſrael: for thus ſpeaks his repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Moſes, Deut. vi. 6, 7. "Theſe words," that is, the ſcripture words, <q>which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children,</q> that is, as it is generally explained, ſervants as well as children, <q>and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe.</q> From whence we may infer, that
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028079_0265_0FD695C28EE8F888"/>
the only reaſon, why ſo many neglect to read the words of Scripture diligently to their children is, becauſe the words of Scripture are not in their hearts: for if they were, out of the abundance of the heart their mouth would ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſervants as well as children, are, for the generality, very ignorant, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re novices in the laws of God: And how ſhall they know, unleſs ſome one teach them? and what more proper to teach them by, than the lively oracles of God, <q>which are able to make them wiſe unto ſalvation?</q> And who more proper to inſtruct them by theſe lively oracles, than parents and maſters, who (as hath been more than once obſerved) are as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to feed them with ſpiritual, as with bodily bread, day by day.</p>
            <p>But if theſe things be ſo, what a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are thoſe unhappy governors in, who are ſo far from feeding thoſe committed to their care with the ſincere milk of the word, to the intent they may grow thereby, that they neither ſearch the ſcriptures themſelves, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re careful to explain them to others? Such families muſt be in a happy way indeed to do their maſter's will, who take ſuch prodigious pains to know it! Would not one imagine that they had turned converts to the church of Rome; that they thought ignorance to be the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and that thoſe were to be condemned as heretics who read their bibles? And yet how few families are there amongſt us, who do not act after this unſeemly manner! <q>But ſhall I praiſe them in this? I praiſe them not: Brethren, this thing ought not ſo to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Paſs we on now to the ſecond means whereby every governor and his houſehold ought to ſerve the Lord, Family-prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="unknown:028079_0266_0FD69583E4636A18"/>
This is a duty, though as much neglected, yet as abſolutely neceſſary as the former. Reading is a good preparative for prayer, as prayer is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to render reading effectual. And the reaſon why every governor of a family ſhould join both theſe exerciſes together, is plain, becauſe a governor of a family cannot perform his prieſtly office (which we before obſerved he is in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree inveſted with) without performing this duty of family-prayer.</p>
            <p>We find it therefore remarked, when mention is made of Cain and Abel's offering ſacrifices, that they brought them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all probability to their father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who, as prieſt of the family was to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in their names. And ſo likewiſe ought every ſpiritual ſon of the ſecond Adam, who is intruſted with the care of an houſehold to offer up the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifices of ſupplications and thankſgivings, acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and name of all who wait upon, or eat me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at his table.</p>
            <p>Thus we read our bleſſed Lord behaved when he tabernacled amongſt us: For it is ſaid often, that he prayed with his twelve diſciples, which was then his little family. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> himſelf has promiſed a particular bleſſing to joint ſupplications: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. And again, If two or three are agreed touching any thing they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be given them. Add to this, that we are commanded by the apoſtle to pray always, with all manner of ſupplication, which doubtleſs includes family-prayer. And holy Joſhua, when he ſet up the good reſolution in the text, that he and his houſehold would ſerve the Lord, certainly reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028079_0267_0FD695C292EA8398"/>
to pray with his family, which is one of the beſt teſtimonies they could give of their ſerving him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there are no families but what have ſome common bleſſings, of which they have been all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, to give thanks for; ſome common croſſes and afflictions, which they are to pray againſt; ſome common ſins, which they are all to lament and bewail: But how this can be done, without joining together in one common act of humiliation, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and thankſgiving, is difficult to deviſe.</p>
            <p>From all which conſiderations put together, it is evident, that family-prayer is a great and neceſſary duty; and conſequently, thoſe governors that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, are certainly without excuſe. And it is much to be feared, if they live without family-prayer, they live without God in the world.</p>
            <p>And yet, ſuch an hateful character as this is, it is to be feared, that was God to ſend out an angel to deſtroy us, as he did once to deſtroy the Egyptian firſt-born, and withal give him a commiſſion, as then, to ſpare no houſes but where they ſaw the blood on the lintel, ſprinkled on the door-poſt, ſo now, to let no families eſcape, but thoſe that called upon him in morning and evening prayer: few would remain unhurt by his avenging ſword. Shall I term ſuch families Chriſtians or heathens: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they deſerve not the name of Chriſtians; and heathens will ſurely riſe up in judgment againſt ſuch prophane families of this generation: for they had always their houſehold gods, whom they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and whoſe aſſiſtance they frequently invoked. And a pretty paſs thoſe families ſurely are arrived at, who muſt be ſent to ſchool to Pagans. But will not the Lord be avenged on ſuch prophane houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds as theſe? Will he not pour out his fury upon thoſe that call not upon his name?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="270" facs="unknown:028079_0268_0FD69586132D0EC0"/>
3. But it is time for me to haſten to the third and laſt means I ſhall recommend, whereby every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ought with his houſehold to ſerve the Lord, catechiſing and inſtructing their children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
            <p>That this, as well as the two former, is a duty incumbent on every governor of an houſe, appears from that famous encomium or commendation God gives of Abraham: <q>I know that he will command his children and his houſehold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.</q> And indeed ſcarce any thing is more frequently preſſed upon us in holy writ, than this duty of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing. Thus, ſays God in a paſſage before cited, <q>Thou ſhalt teach theſe words diligently to thy children.</q> And parents are commanded in the New Teſtament, <q>to breed up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</q> The holy Pſalmiſt acquaints us, that one geat end why God did ſuch great wonders for his people, was, <q>to the intent that when they grew up, they ſhould ſhew their children, or ſervants, the ſame.</q> And in Deuteronomy vi. at the 20th and following verſes, God ſtrictly commands his people to inſtruct their children in the true nature of the ceremonial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when they ſhould inquire about it, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would do, in time to come. And if ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children were to be inſtructed in the nature of Jewiſh rites, much more ought they now to be initiated and grounded in the doctrines and firſt principles of the goſpel of Chriſt: not only, becauſe it is a revelation, which has brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to a fuller and clearer light, but alſo, becauſe many ſeducers are gone abroad into the world, who do their utmoſt endeavour to deſtroy
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:028079_0269_0FD695C69078F310"/>
not only the ſuperſtructure, but likewiſe to ſap the very foundation of our moſt holy religion.</p>
            <p>Would then the preſent generation have their poſterity be true lovers and honourers of God; maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and parents muſt take Solomon's good advice, and train up and catechiſe their reſpective houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds in the way wherein they ſhould go.</p>
            <p>I am aware but of one objection, that can, with any ſhew of reaſon, be urged againſt what has been advanced; which is, that ſuch a procedure as this will take up too much time, and hinder families too long from their worldly buſineſs. But it is much to be queſtioned, whether perſons that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art ſuch an objection, are not of the ſame hypocritical ſpirit as the traitor Judas, who had indignation againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Mary, for being ſo profuſe of her ointment, in anointing our bleſſed Lord, and aſked why it might not be ſold for two hundred pence, and given to the poor. For has God given us ſo much time to work for ourſelves, and ſhall we not allow ſome ſmall pittance of it, morning and evening, to be devoted to his more immediate worſhip and ſervice? Have not people read, that it is God who gives men power to get wealth, and therefore that the beſt way to proſper in the world, is to ſecure his favour? And has not our bleſſed Lord himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that if we ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, all outward neceſſaries ſhall be added unto us?</p>
            <p>Abraham, no doubt, was a man of as great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as ſuch objectors may be; but yet he would find time to command his houſehold to ſerve the Lord. Nay, David was a king, and conſequently had a great deal of buſineſs upon his hands: yet notwithſtanding, he profeſſes that he would walk in his houſe with a perfect heart. And, to inſtance
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028079_0270_0FD69587AEFBE888"/>
but one more, holy Joſhua was a perſon certainly engaged very much in temporal affairs; and yet he ſolemnly declares before all Iſrael, that as for him and his houſehold, they would ſerve the Lord. And did perſons but redeem their time as Abraham, David, or Joſhua did, they would no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that family duties kept them too long from the buſineſs of the world.</p>
            <p>III. But my third and laſt general head, under which I was to offer ſome motives in order to excite all governors, with their reſpective houſeholds, to ſerve the Lord in the manner before recommended, I hope, will ſerve inſtead of a thouſand arguments, to prove the weakneſs and folly of any ſuch objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the firſt motive I ſhall mention is the duty of gratitude, which you that are governors of families owe to God.—Your lot, every one muſt confeſs, is caſt in a fair ground: providence hath given you a goodly heritage, above many of your fellow creatures; and therefore, out of a principle of gratitude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every perſon of your reſpective houſeholds to call upon him as long as they live: not to mention, that the authority, with which God has inveſted you as parents and governors of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is a talent committed to your truſt, and which you are bound to improve to your Maſter's honour. In other things we find governors and parents can exerciſe lordſhip over their children and ſervants readily, and frequently enough can ſay to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; to a third, Do this, and he doeth it. And ſhall this power be ſo often employed in your own affairs, and never exerted in the things of God? Be aſtoniſhed, O heavens, at this!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="unknown:028079_0271_0FD695C85A1E4F50"/>
Thus did not faithful Abraham; no, God ſays, that he knew Abraham would <q>command his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children after him.</q> Thus did not Joſhua; no, he was reſolved not only to walk with God himſelf, but to improve his authority in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all about him do ſo too: <q>As for me and my houſehold, we will ſerve the Lord.</q> Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If gratitude to God will not, methinks love and pity to your children ſhould move you, with your reſpective families to ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>Moſt people expreſs a great fondneſs for their children: nay ſo great, that very often their own lives are wrapped up in thoſe of their offspring. <q>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb?</q> ſays God by his prophet Iſaiah.

            <p>It is true indeed, parents ſeldom forget to provide for their children's bodies, (though, it is to be feared, ſome men are ſo far ſunk beneath the beaſts that periſh, as to neglect even that) but then how often do they forget, or rather, when do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, to ſecure the ſalvation of their immortal ſouls? But is this their way of expreſſing their fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the fruit of their bodies? Is this the beſt teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony they can give of their affection to the darling of their hearts? Then was Dalilah fond of Samſon,

            <p>It is true; ſome men may think they have done enough when they give unto their ſervants food and raiment, and ſay, did not I bargain with thee for ſo much a-year? But if they give them no other reward than this, what do they leſs for their very beaſts? But are not ſervants better than they? Doubtleſs they are: and however maſters may put off their conviction for the preſent, they will find a time will come, when they ſhall know they ought to have given them ſome ſpiritual as well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral wages; and the cry of thoſe that have mowed down their fields, will enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</p>

            <p>Did Chriſtanity, indeed, give any countanance to children and ſervants to diſregard their parents and maſters according to the fleſh, or repreſent their duty to them, as inconſiſtent with their entire obedience to their Father and Maſter who is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there might then be ſome pretence to neglect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them in the principles of ſuch a religion. But ſince the precepts of this pure and undefiled religion, are all of them holy, juſt, and good; and the more they are taught their duty to God, the better they will perform their duties to you; methinks to neglect the improvement of their ſouls, out of a dread of ſpending too much time in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, is acting quite contrary to your own intereſt as well as duty.</p>

nor even that moſt prevailing motive, ſelf-intereſt, will excite; yet let a conſideration of the terrors of the Lord perſuade you to put in practice the pious reſolution in the text. Remember, the time will come, and that perhaps very ſhortly, when we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt; where we muſt give a ſolemn and ſtrict account how we have had our converſation, in our reſpective families, in this world. How will you endure to ſee your children and ſervants (who ought to be your joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) coming out as ſo many ſwift witneſſes againſt you; curſing the father that begot them, the womb that bare them, the paps which they have ſucked, and the day they ever entered into your houſes? Think you not, the damnation which men muſt endure for their own ſins will be ſufficient, that they need load themſelves with the additional guilt of being acceſſary to the damnation of others alſo? O conſider this, all ye that forget to ſerve the Lord with your reſpective houſeholds, <q>leſt he pluck you away, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>But God forbid, brethren, that any ſuch evil ſhould befal you: No, rather will I hope, that you have been in ſome meaſure convinced, by what has been ſaid, of the great importance of Family-reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore are ready to cry out, in the words immediately following the text, <q>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we ſhould forſake the Lord;</q> and again verſe 21. "Nay, but we will" (with our ſeveral houſeholds) "ſerve the Lord."</p>
            <p>And that there may be always ſuch a heart in you, let me exhort all governors of families, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, often to reflect on the ineſtimable worth of their own ſouls, and the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028079_0275_0FD695CAF63B9F08"/>
infinite ranſom, even the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which has been paid down for them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that you are fallen creatures; that you are by nature loſt and eſtranged from God; and that you can never be reſtored to your primitive happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till by being born again of the Holy Ghoſt, you arrive at your primitive ſtate of purity, have the image of God reſtamped upon your ſouls, and are thereby made meet to be partakers of the ſaints in light. Do, I ſay, but ſeriouſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reflect on, and act as perſons that believe ſuch important truths, and you will no more neglect your family's ſpiritual warfare than your own. No, the love of God, which will be then ſhed abroad in your hearts, will conſtrain you to do your utmoſt to preſerve them: And the deep ſenſe of God's free grace in Chriſt Jeſus, (which you will then have) in calling you, will excite you to do your utmoſt to ſave others, eſpecially thoſe of your own houſehold. And though, after all your pious endeavours, ſome may continue unreformed; yet you will have this comfortable reflection to make, that you did what you could to make your families religious: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may reſt aſſured of ſitting down in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, with Abraham, Joſhua, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, and all the godly houſeholders, who in their ſeveral generations ſhone forth as ſo many lights in their reſpective houſeholds upon earth. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>AS God can ſend a nation or people no greater bleſſing, than to give them faithful, ſincere, and upright miniſters; ſo the greateſt curſe that God can poſſibly ſend upon a people in this world, is to give them over to blind, unregenerate, carnal, lukewarm, and unſkilful guides. And yet, in all ages, we find that there have been many wolves in ſheep's clothing, many that daubed with untemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morter, that prophecied ſmoother things than God did allow. As it was formerly, ſo it is now, there are many that corrupt the word of God, and deal deceitfully with it. It was ſo in a ſpecial manner in the prophet Jeremiah's time; and he, faithful to his Lord, faithful to that God that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him, did not fail, from time to time, to open his mouth againſt them, and to bear a noble teſtimony to the honour of that God, in whoſe name he from time to time ſpake. If ye will read his prophecy, ye will find, that none ſpake more againſt ſuch miniſters than Jeremiah: and here eſpecially, in the chapter out of which the text is taken, he
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028079_0277_0FD695D1AA44FBE0"/>
ſpeaks very ſeverely againſt them; he charges them with ſeveral crimes, particularly, he charges them with covetouſneſs: For, ſays he in the 13th verſe, <q>from the leaſt of them even to the greateſt of them, every one is given to covetouſneſs: and from the prophet even unto the prieſt, every one dealeth falſely.</q> And then in the words of the text, in a more ſpecial manaer, he exemplifies how they had dealt falſely, how they had behaved treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to poor ſouls, ſays he, <q>They have healed alſo the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</q> The prophet, in the name of God, had been denouncing war againſt the people, he had been telling them, that their houſe ſhould be left deſolate, and the Lord would certainly viſit the land with war, "Therefore," ſays he, in the 11th verſe, <q>I am full of the fury of the Lord: I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abroad, and upon the aſſembly of young men together: For even the huſband with the wiſe ſhall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. And their houſes ſhall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will ſtretch out my hand upon the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the land, ſaith the Lord.</q> The prophet gives a thundering meſſage, that they might be terrified, and have ſome convictions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to repent: but it ſeems that the falſe prophets, the falſe prieſts, went about ſtifling people's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and when they were hurt or a little terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they were for daubing over the wound, telling them, that Jeremiah was but an enthuſiaſtic preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that there could be no ſuch thing as a war among them; and bidding people <q>peace, peace, be ſtill,</q> when the prophet told them there was
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028079_0278_0FD6959310753220"/>
no peace. The words then refer primarily unto outward things; but I verily believe have alſo a further reference to the ſoul; and are to be referred to thoſe falſe teachers, when people were under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, when people were beginning to look towards heaven, they were for ſtifling their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and telling them they were good enough before. And indeed people generally love to have it ſo: our hearts are exceedingly deceitful and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked; none but the eternal God knows how treacherous they are. How many of us cry, peace, peace to our ſouls, when there is no peace. How many are there that are now ſettled upon their lees, that now think they are Chriſtians, that now flatter themſelves that they have an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; whereas, if we come to examine their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, we will find that their peace is but a peace of the devil's making; it is not a peace of God's giving; it is not a peace that paſſeth human underſtanding. It is matter therefore of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, my dear hearers, to know whether we may ſpeak peace to our hearts: We are all deſirous of peace, peace is an unſpeakable bleſſing: How can we live without peace? And therefore people, from time to time, muſt be taught how far they muſt go, and what muſt be wrought in them before they can ſpeak peace to their hearts. This is what I deſign at preſent, that I may deliver my ſoul, that I may be free from the blood of all thoſe to whom I preach, that I may not fail to declare the whole counſel of God. I ſhall, from the words of the text, endeavour to ſhew you what ye muſt undergo, and what muſt be wrought in you, before ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts.</p>
            <p>But before I come directly to this, give me leave to premiſe a caution or two. And the firſt is, that
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028079_0279_0FD695D3D9C872D8"/>
I take it for granted ye believe religion to be an inward thing; ye believe it to be a work in the heart, a work wrought in the ſoul by the power of the ſpirit of God. If you do not believe this, ye do not believe your bible: If ye do not believe this, though ye have got your bible in your hands, ye hate the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in your heart: for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is every where repreſented in ſcripture, as the work of God in the heart; <q>the kingdom of God is within us,</q> ſays our Lord; and, <q>he is not a Chriſtian that is one outwardly, but he is a Chriſtian who is one inwardly.</q> If any of you place religion in outward things, I ſhall not perhaps pleaſe you this morning; ye will underſtand me no more when I ſpeak of the work of God upon a poor ſinner's heart, than if I were talking in an unknown tongue. I would further premiſe a caution, that I would by no means confine God to one way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I would by no means ſay, that all perſons before they come to have a ſettled peace in their hearts, are obliged to undergo the ſame degrees of conviction. No; God has various ways of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his children home; his ſacred ſpirit bloweth when, and where and how, it liſteth. But however, I will venture to affirm this, that before ever ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts, whether by ſhorter or longer continuance of your convictions, whether in a more pungent or in a more gentle way, ye muſt undergo what I ſhall hereafter lay down in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, before ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts, ye muſt be made to ſee, made to feel, made to weep over, made to bewail your actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt the law of God. According to the covenant of works, the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die; curſed is that man, be what he will, be who he
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028079_0280_0FD69594D5D75EA0"/>
will, that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. We are not only to do ſome things, but we are to do all things, and we are to continue ſo to do; ſo that the leaſt deviation from the moral law, according to the covenant of works, whether in thought, word, or deed, deſerves eternal death at the hand of God. And if one evil thought, if one evil word, if one evil action, deſerves eternal damnation; how many hells, my friends, do every one of us deſerve, whoſe whole lives have been one continual rebellion againſt God. Before ever therefore ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts, ye muſt be brought to ſee, brought to believe, what a dreadful thing it is to depart from the living God. And now, my dear friends, examine your hearts, for I hope you come hither with a deſign to have your ſouls made better; give me leave to aſk you, in the preſence of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you know the time, and if ye do not know exactly the time, do you know there was a time when God wrote bitter things againſt you, when the arrows of the Almighty were within you? Was ever the remembrance of your ſins grievous to you? Was the burden of your ſins intolerable to your thoughts? Did you ever ſee that God's wrath might juſtly fall upon you, upon account of your actual tranſgreſſions againſt God? Were ye ever in all your life ſorry for your ſins? Could ye ever ſay, my ſins are gone over my head as a burden too heavy for me to bear? Did ye ever experience any ſuch thing as this? Did ever any ſuch thing as this paſs between God and your ſoul; if not, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake do not call yourſelves Chriſtians; ye may ſpeak peace to your hearts, but there is no peace. May the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you, may the Lord convert you, may the Lord give you peace, if it be his will, before ye go home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="unknown:028079_0281_0FD695D3DF42D2A8"/>
But further, ye may be convinced of your actual ſins, ſo as to be made to tremble, and yet ye may be ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt, ye may have no true work of grace upon your hearts. Before ever, therefore, ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction muſt go deeper; ye muſt not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of your actual tranſgreſſions againſt the law of God, but likewiſe of the foundation of all your tranſgreſſions; and what is that? I mean original ſin; that original corruption each of us brings into the world with us, which renders us liable to God's wrath and damnation. There are many poor ſouls that think themſelves fine reaſoners, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay there is no ſuch thing as original ſin? They will charge God with injuſtice in imputing Adam's ſin to us; although we have got the mark of the beaſt, and of the devil upon us, yet they tell us, we are not born in ſin. Let them look abroad into the world, and ſee the diſorders in it, and think if they can, if this is the paradiſe in which God did put man? No, every thing in the world is out of order. I have often thought, when I was abroad, that if there were no other argument to prove origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, but the riſing of wolves and tigers againſt man, nay, the barking of a dog againſt us, is a proof of original ſin. Tigers and lions durſt not riſe againſt us, if it were not for Adam's firſt ſin: for when the creatures riſe up againſt us, it is as much as to ſay, ye have ſinned againſt God, and we take up our Maſter's quarrel. If we look inward, we will ſee enough of luſts, and man's temper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the temper of God; there is pride, malice, and revenge in all our hearts, and this temper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come from God; it comes from our firſt parent, Adam, who, after he fell from God, fell out of God into the devil. However, therefore, ſome
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028079_0282_0FD69596DB284540"/>
people may deny this, yet when conviction comes, all carnal reaſonings are batter'd down immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the poor ſoul begins to feel and ſee the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which all the polluted ſtreams do flow. When the ſinner is firſt awakened, he begins to wonder how he came to be ſo wicked: the Spirit of God then ſtrikes in, and ſhows that he has no good thing in him by nature; then he ſees that he is altogether gone out of the way, that he is altogether become abominable; and the poor creature is made to lie down at the foot of the throne of God, and to acknowledge that God would be juſt to damn him, juſt to cut him off, though he never had committed one actual ſin in his life. Did ye ever feel and experience this any of you, to juſtify God in your damnation; to own that ye are by nature children of wrath, and that God may juſtly cut you off, though ye never actually had offended him in all your life. If ye were ever truly convicted, if your hearts were ever truly cut, if ſelf were truly taken out of you, ye will be made to ſee and feel this. And if ye have never felt the weight of original ſin, do not call yourſelves Chriſtians. I am verily perſuaded original ſin is the greateſt burden of a true convert; this even grieves the regenerate ſoul, the ſanctified ſoul. The indwelling of ſin in the heart is the burden of a converted perſon; it is the burden of a true Chriſtian; he continually cries out, O <q>Who will deliver me from this body of death,</q> this indwelling corruption in my heart; this is that which diſturbs a poor ſoul moſt. And, therefore, if ye never felt this inward corruption, if ye never ſaw that God might juſtly curſe you for it; indeed, my dear friends, ye may ſpeak peace to your heart, but I fear, nay, I know, there is no true peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="unknown:028079_0283_0FD695D548EFA0D0"/>
Further, before we can ſpeak peace to your hearts, ye muſt not only be troubled for the ſins of your life, the ſin of your nature, but likewiſe for the ſins of your beſt duties and performances. When a poor ſoul is ſomewhat awakened by the terrors of the Lord, then the poor creature, being born under the covenant of works flies directly to a covenant of works again. And as Adam and Eve hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the trees of the garden, and ſewed fig-leaves together to cover their nakedneſs; ſo the poor ſinner when awakened, flies to his duties, and to his performances, to hide himſelf from God; and goes to patch up a righteouſneſs of his own; ſays he, I will be mighty good now; I will reform, I will do all I can, and then certainly Jeſus Chriſt will have mercy on me. But before ye can ſpeak peace to your heart, ye muſt be brought to ſee that God may damn you for the beſt prayer ye ever put up in all your life: ye muſt be brought to ſee all your duties, all your righteouſneſs, as the prophet elegantly expreſſes it, put them altogether, are ſo far from recommending you to God, are ſo far from being any motive and inducement to God to have mercy on your poor ſouls, that ye will ſee them to be filthy rags, a menſtruous cloth; that God hates them, and cannot away with them, if ye bring them to him in order to recommend you to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. My dear friends, what is there in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to recommend us unto God; our perſons are in an unſanctified ſtate by nature, we deſerve to be damned ten thouſand times over; and what muſt our performances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e? We can do no good thing by nature; <q>they that are in the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God.</q> Ye may do things materially good, but ye cannot do a thing formally and rightly good; becauſe nature cannot act above it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028079_0284_0FD695988A47CA48"/>
It is impoſſible that a man that is unconverted can act for the glory of God; he cannot do any thing in faith, for <q>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</q> After we are renewed, yet we are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in part; indwelling ſin continues in us; there is a mixture of corruption in every one of our duties: ſo that after we are converted, were Jeſus Chriſt only to accept us according to our works, our works would damn us; for we cannot put up a prayer but it is far from that perfection which the moral law requireth. I do not know what ye may think; but I can ſay that I cannot pray but I ſin; I cannot preach to you or any others but I ſin; I can do nothing without ſin: and, as one expreſſeth it, my repentance wants to be repented of, and my tears to be waſhed in the precious blood of my dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; our beſt duties are as ſo many ſplendid ſins. Before ye can ſpeak peace to your hearts, ye muſt not only be ſick of your original and actual ſins; but ye muſt be made ſick of your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of all your duties and performances, There muſt be a deep conviction before ye can be brought out of your ſelf-righteouſneſs; it is the laſt idol that is taken out of our heart, the pride of our heart will not let us ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. But if ye never felt that ye had no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of your own; if ye never felt the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of your own righteouſneſs, ye can never come to Jeſus Chriſt. There are a great many now that may ſay, Well, we believe all this: but there is a great difference betwixt talking and feeling. Did ye ever feel the want of a dear Redeemer? Did ye ever feel the want of Jeſus Chriſt upon the account of the deficiency of your own righteouſneſs? And can ye now ſay from your heart, Lord, thou mayeſt juſtly damn me for the beſt duties that ever I did
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028079_0285_0FD695D8CFA14050"/>
perform: If ye are not thus brought out of ſelf, ye may ſpeak peace to yourſelves, but yet there is no peace.</p>
            <p>But then before ye can ſpeak peace to your ſouls there is one particular ſin ye muſt be greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for; and yet I fear there are few of you think what it is: it is the reigning, the damning ſin of the Chriſtian world; and yet the Chriſtian world ſeldom or never think of it; and pray what is that? It is what moſt of you think ye are not guilty of, and that is the ſin of unbelief; before we can ſpeak peace to your heart, ye muſt be troubled for the unbelief of your heart; but can it be ſuppoſed that any of you are unbelievers here in this church-yard, that are born in Scotland, in a reformed country, that go to church every Sabbath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I appeal to your own hearts, if ye would not think me uncharitable, if I doubted whether any of you believed in Chriſt; and yet I fear, upon examination, we ſhould find that moſt of you have not ſo much faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as the devil himſelf. I am perſuaded the devil believes more of the bible than moſt of us do; he believes the divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, that is more than many that call themſelves Chriſtians do; nay, he believes and trembles, and that is more than thouſands amongſt us do. My friends, we miſtake an hiſtorical faith for a true faith wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God. Ye fancy ye believe, becauſe ye believe there is ſuch a book we call the bible, becauſe ye go to church; all this ye may do, and have no true faith in Chriſt. Merely
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:028079_0286_0FD6959D9866E708"/>
to believe there was once ſuch a perſon as Chriſt, merely to believe there is ſuch a book called the bible, will do you no good, more than to believe there was ſuch a man as Caeſar or Alexander the Great. The bible is a ſacred depoſitory; what thanks have we to give to God for theſe lively oracles! But yet we may have theſe, and not believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. My dear friends, there muſt be a principle wrought in the heart by the Spirit of the living God. Did I aſk you how long it is ſince ye believed in Jeſus Chriſt, I ſuppoſe moſt of you would tell me, ye believed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as long as ever ye remember; ye never did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe: then ye could not give me a better proof that ye never yet believed in Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs ye were ſanctified early from the womb; for they that believe in Chriſt, know there was a time when they did not believe in Jeſus Chriſt. You ſay you love God with all your heart, ſoul, and ſtrength; if I were to aſk you, how long it is ſince ye loved God, ye would ſay, as long as ye can remember ye never hated God; ye know no time when there was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in your heart againſt God: then unleſs ye were ſanctified very early, ye never loved God in your life. My dear friends, I am more particular in this, becauſe it is a moſt deceitful deluſion, whereby ſo many people are carried away, that they believe already. Therefore it is remarkable of Mr. Marſhall giving account of his experiences, he had been working for life, he had ranged all his ſins under the ten commandments, and then coming to a miniſter, aſked him the reaſon why he could not get peace: the miniſter looked to the catalogue, <q>Away, ſays he, I do not find one word of the ſin of unbelief in all your catalogue.</q> It is the peculiar work of the Spirit of God to convince us
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:028079_0287_0FD695DE5CB8C0B0"/>
of our unbelief, that we have got no faith. Says Jeſus Chriſt, <q>I will ſend the Comforter; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of the ſin of unbelief: Of ſin, ſays Chriſt, becauſe they believe not on me.</q> Now, my dear friends, did God does ſhew you that ye had no faith?

be imputed to our ſouls. My dear friends, were ye ever married to Jeſus Chriſt? Did Jeſus Chriſt ever give himſelf to you? Did ye ever cloſe with Chriſt by a lively faith, ſo as to feel Chriſt in your heart, ſo as to hear him ſpeaking peace to your ſouls? Did peace ever flow in upon your heart like a river? Did ye ever feel that peace that Chriſt ſpoke to his diſciples? I pray God he may come, and ſpeak peace to you. Theſe things ye muſt experience. I am now talking of the inviſible realities of another world, of inward religion, of the work of God upon a poor ſinner's heart: I am now talking of a matter of great importance; my dear bearers, ye are all concerned in it; your ſouls are concerned in it; your eternal ſalvation is concerned in it. You may all be at peace, but perhaps the devil has lulled you aſleep into a carnal lethargy and ſecurity, and will endeavour to keep you there, till he get you to hell, and there ye will be awakened; but it will be dreadful to be awakened, and find yourſelves ſo fearfully miſtaken, when the great gulf is fixed when ye will be calling to all eternity for a drop of water to cool your tongue, and ſhall not obtain it.</p>

Can ye ſay ſo? Then I will ſalute you as the angels did the women the

firſt day of the week, All hail, fear not ye, my dear brethren; ye are happy ſouls; ye may lie down and be at peace indeed, for God has given you peace; ye may be content under all the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence; for nothing can happen to you now, but what ſhall be the effect of God's love to your ſoul; ye need not fear what fightings may be without, ſeeing there is peace within. Have ye cloſed with Chriſt? Is God your friend? Is Chriſt your friend? Then look up with comfort; all is yours, and ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's; every thing ſhall work together for your good; the very hairs of your head are numbered; he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of God's eye. But then, my dear friends, take care of reſting on your firſt converſion: ye that are young believers in Chriſt, ye ſhould be looking out for freſh diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt every moment: ye muſt not build upon your paſt experiences; ye muſt not build upon a work within you, but always come out of yourſelves to the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt without you: ye muſt be always coming as poor ſinners to draw water out of the wells of ſalvation; ye muſt be forgetting the things that are behind, and be continually preſſing forward to the things that are before. My dear friends, ye muſt keep up a tender cloſe walk with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Many of us loſe our peace by our untender walk. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other gets in betwixt Chriſt and us, and we fall into darkneſs; ſomething or other ſteals our heart from God, and this grieves the Holy Ghoſt, and the Holy Ghoſt leaves us to ourſelves. Let me, therefore, exhort you that have got peace with God, to take care that ye do not loſe this peace. It is true, if ye are once in Chriſt, ye cannot finally fall from God; <q>there is no condemnation to them that
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028079_0290_0FD695A06C66F180"/>
are in Chriſt Jeſus;</q> but if ye cannot fall finally, ye may full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and may go with broken bones all your days. Take care of backſliding for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake: Do not grieve the Holy Ghoſt; ye may never recover your comfort while ye live. O take care of going a gadding and wandering from God; after ye have cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt. My dear friends, I have paid dear for backſliding. Our hearts are ſo curſedly wicked, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>word ye take not care, if ye do not keep up a conſtant watch, your wicked hearts will deceive you, and draw you aſide. It will be ſad to be under the ſcourge of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting father; witneſs the viſitation of Job, David, and other ſaints in ſcripture. Let me, therefore, exhort you that have got peace to keep a cloſe walk with Chriſt. I am grieved with the looſe walk of thoſe that are Chriſtians, that have had diſcoveries of Jeſus Chriſt: there is ſo little differ not betwixt them and other people, that I can ſcarce know which is the true Chriſtian. Chriſtians are afraid to ſpeak for God; they run down with the ſtream; if they come into worldly company, they will talk of the world, as if they were in their element: This ye would not do when ye had the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Chriſt's love; ye could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then of Chriſt's love for ever, when the candle of the Lord ſhined upon your ſoul. The time has been when ye had ſomething to ſay for your dear Lord; but now ye can go into company, and hear others ſpeaking about the world bold enough, and ye are afraid of being laughed at, if ye ſpeak for Jeſus Chriſt. A great many people have grown conformiſts now in the worſt ſenſe of the word; they will cry out againſt the ceremonies of the church, as they may juſtly do; But then yet are mighty fond of ceremonies in your behaviour; ye will conform to the world, which is
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:028079_0291_0FD695E2135B7990"/>
a great deal worſe; many will ſtay till the devil bring up new faſhions. Take care then not to be conformed to the world: What have Chriſtians to do with the world? Chriſtians ſhould be ſingularly good, bold for their Lord, that all that are with you may take notice that ye have been with Jeſus. I would exhort you to come to a ſettlement in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as to have a continual abiding of God in your heart. We go a building on our faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, and loſe our comfort; but we ſhould be growing up to a faith of aſſurance, to know that we are God's, and ſo walk in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt and be edified. Jeſus Chriſt is now much wounded in the houſe of his friends. Excuſe me in being particular; for, my friends, it grieves me more that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be wounded by his friends as by his enemies. We cannot expect any thing elſe from Deiſts; but for ſuch as have felt his power to fall away, for them not to walk agreeably to the vocation wherewith they are called, by theſe means we bring our Lord's religion into contempt; to be a byword among the Heathens. For Chriſt's ſake, if ye know Chriſt keep cloſe by him; if God hath ſpoken peace, O keep that peace, by looking up to Jeſus Chriſt every moment. Such as have got peace with God if ye are under trials, fear not, all things ſhall work for your good; if ye are under temptations, fear not; if he has ſpoken peace to your heart, all theſe things ſhall be for your good.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay to you that have got no peace with God; and theſe are perhaps the moſt of this congregation; it makes me weep to hear of it. Moſt of you, if you examine your heart, muſt confeſs that God never yet ſpoke peace to you; ye are children of the devil if Chriſt is not in you; if God has not ſpoken peace to your heart, poor ſoul, what a curſed
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028079_0292_0FD695A222D432E0"/>
condition are you in! I would not be in your caſe for ten thouſand thouſand worlds! Why? Ye are juſt hanging over hell. What peace can ye have when God is your enemy, when the wrath of God is abiding upon your poor ſoul? Awake then, ye that are ſleeping in a falſe peace; awake, ye care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs profeſſors; ye hypocrites that go to church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacrament, read your bibles, and never felt the power of God upon your heart: ye that are formal profeſſors, ye that are baptized heathens, awake, awake, and do not reſt on a falſe bottom. Blame me not for addreſſing myſelf to you; indeed it is out of love to your ſoul. I ſee ye are lingering in your Sodom, and wanting to ſtay there: but I come to you as the angel did to Lot, to take you by the hand. Come away, my dear brethren, fly, fly, fly for your lives to Jeſus Chriſt: fly to a bleeding God, fly to a throne of grace; and beg of God to break your heart; beg of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your actual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine; beg of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your original ſin; beg of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your ſelf-righteouſneſs: beg of God to give you faith, and to enable you to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt. O ye that are ſecure, I muſt be a ſon of thunder to you; and O that God may awaken you, though it be with thunder. It is out of love indeed that I ſpeak to you. I know, by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, what it is to be lulled aſleep with a falſe peace. Long was I lulled aſleep; long did I think myſelf a Chriſtian, when I knew nothing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I went perhaps further than many of you do; I uſed to faſt twice a week; I uſed to pray ſometimes nine times a day; I uſed to receive the ſacrament conſtantly every Lord's day; and yet I knew nothing of Jeſus Chriſt in my heart. I knew not I muſt be a new creature: I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028079_0293_0FD695E2174AC4C0"/>
of inward religion in my ſoul. And perhaps many of you may be deceived, as I a poor creature was; and therefore it is out of love to you indeed that I ſpeak to you. O, if ye do not take care, a form of religion will deſtroy your ſoul: ye will reſt in it, and will not come to Jeſus Chriſt at all: whereas theſe things are only the means, and not the end of religion; Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all that believe. O then awake, ye that are ſettled on your le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; awake, ye church profeſſors; awake, ye that have got a name to live, that are rich and think ye want nothing, not conſidering that ye are poor and blind, and naked; I counſel you to come and buy of Jeſus Chriſt gold, white rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eye-ſalve. But I hope there are ſome that are a little wounded. I hope God does not intend to let me preach in vain. I hope God will reach ſome of your precious ſouls, and awaked ſome of you out of your carnal ſecurity. I hope there are ſome that are willing to come to Chriſt, and beginning to think that they have been building upon a falſe foundation. Perhaps the devil may ſtrike in, and may bid you deſpair of mercy; but fear not: what I have been ſpeaking to you, is only out of love to you, is only to awaken you, and let you ſee your danger. If any of you are willing to be reconciled to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt is willing to be reconciled to you. O then, though ye have no peace as yet, come away to Jeſus Chriſt; he is our peace; he is our peace-maker; he has made peace between God and offending man. Would you have peace with God? Away then to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, who has purchaſed peace. The Lord Jeſus hath ſhed his heart's blood for this; he died for this; he roſe again for this; he aſcended into the higheſt heavens, and is now interceding at
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:028079_0294_0FD695A548907970"/>
the right hand of God. Perhaps ye think there will be no peace for you: Why ſo? Becauſe ye are ſinners; becauſe ye have crucified Chriſt, ye have put him to open ſhame, ye have trampled under foot the blood of the Son of God. What of all this? yet there is peace for you. Pray, what did Jeſus Chriſt ſay to his diſciples, when he came to them the firſt day of the week? The firſt word he ſaid was <q>Peace be unto you. He ſhewed them his hands and his feet, and ſaid, Peace be unto you:</q> It is as much as if he had ſaid, fear not, my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> my hands and my feet, how they have been pierced for your ſake; therefore fear not. How did Chriſt ſpeak to his diſciples? Go tell my brethren, and tell broken hearted Peter in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that Chriſt is riſen: that he has aſcended unto his father and your father, to his God and your God. And after Chriſt roſe from the dead, he came preaching peace with an olive-branch of peace in his mouth as Noah's dove, <q>My peace I leave with you.</q> Who were obey? They were the enemies of Chriſt as well as we they were deniers of Chriſt once as well as we. Perhaps ſome of you have backſlidden and loſt your peace, and ye think ye deſerve no peace; and no more ye do: but then God will heal your backſlidings, he will love you freely. As for you that are wounded, if you are made willing to come to Chriſt, come away. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of you want to dreſs yourſelves in your duties, that are but rotten rags. No, ye had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come naked, as ye are; for ye muſt throw aſide your rags, and come in your blood. Some of you may ſay, we would come, but we have got a hard heart: but ye will never get it ſoft till you come to Chriſt; he will take away the heart of ſtone, and give you a heart of fleſh he will ſpeak peace to

And how will ye do if ye be not at peace with God! if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has not ſpoken peace to your heart. If God ſpeak not peace to you here, ye will be damned for ever. I muſt not flatter you; my dear friends, I will deal ſincerely with your ſouls. Some of you may think I carry things too far: but indeed when ye come to judgment, ye will find this true, either to your eternal damnation or comfort. May God influence your hearts to come to him! I am not willing to go away without perſuading you. I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded but God may make uſe of me as a mean of perſuading ſome of you to come to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

And I am ſure this is the way many of you take; if ye get into company, ye drive off convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ye had better go to the bottom at once; it muſt be done, your, wound muſt be ſearched, or ye muſt be damned. If it were a matter of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, I would not ſpeak one word about it: but ye will be damned without Chriſt; he is the way, he is the truth, and the life. I cannot think you ſhould go to hell without Chriſt. How can ye dwell with everlaſting burnings? How can ye abide the thought of living with the devil for ever; Is it not
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:028079_0296_0FD695ABDD46CBF8"/>
better to have ſome ſoul trouble here, than to be ſent to hell by Jeſus Chriſt hereafter? What is hell but to be abſent from Chriſt; If there were no other hell, that would be hell enough. It will be hell to be tormented with the devil for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver. Get acquaintance with God then, and be at peace. I beſeech you as a poor worthleſs ambaſſador of Jeſus Chriſt, that ye would be reconciled to him. My buſineſs this morning, the firſt day of the week, is to tell you that Chriſt is willing to be reconciled to you. Will any of you be reconciled to Jeſus Chriſt? Then, he will forgive you all your ſins; he will blot out all your tranſgreſſions. But if ye will go on and rebel againſt Chriſt, and ſtab him daily; if ye will go on and abuſe Jeſus Chriſt, the wrath of God, ye muſt expect, will fall upon you. God will not be mocked; that which a man ſoweth, that ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God. When the people came to apprehend Chriſt, they fell to the ground when Jeſus ſaid, I am he: and if they could not bear the fight of Chriſt when clothed with the rags of mortality, how will they bear the fight of him when he is on his Father's throne? Methinks I ſee the poor wretches dragged out of their graves by the devil, methinks I ſee them trembling, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to the hills and rocks to cover them. But the devil will ſay, Come, I will take you away; and then they will ſtand trembling before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt. They ſhall appear before him to ſee him once, and hear him pronounce that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable ſentence, "Depart from me, ye curſed." Methinks I hear the poor creatures ſaying, Lord, if we muſt be damned, let ſome angel pronounce
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:028079_0297_0FD695E526555EA8"/>
the ſentence. No, the God of love, Jeſus Chriſt, will pronounce it. Will ye not believe this? Do not think I am talking at random, but agreeable to the ſcriptures of truth. If ye do then ſhew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men, and this morning go away with full reſolution, in the ſtrength of God, to cleave to Chriſt. And may ye have no reſt in your ſoul till ye reſt in Jeſus Chriſt. I could ſtill go on, for it is ſweet to talk of Chriſt. Do ye not long for the time when ye ſhall have new bodies, when they ſhall be immortal, and made like Chriſt's glorious body, and then they will talk of Jeſus Chriſt for evermore. But it is time perhaps for you to go and prepare for your reſpective worſhip, and I would not hinder any of you. My deſign is to bring poor ſinners to Jeſus Chriſt. O that God may bring ſome of you to himſelf. May the Lord Jeſus now diſmiſs you with his bleſſing; and may the dear Redeemer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that are unawakened, and turn the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the evil of their way. And may the love of God that paſſeth all underſtanding fill your heart. Grant this, O Father, for Chriſt's ſake, to whom with thee and the bleſſed Spirit, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE apoſtle Paul, in his epiſtle to the Hebrews, informs us, <q>that it is appointed for all men once to die; after that in the judgment.</q> And I think, if any conſideration be ſufficient to awaken a ſleeping drowſy world, it muſt be this, that there will be a day wherein theſe heavens ſhall be wrapt up like a ſcroll, this element melt with fervent heat, the earth and all things therein be burnt up, and every ſoul, of every nation and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſummoned to appear before the dreadful tribunal of the righteous Judge of quick and dead, to receive rewards and puniſhments, according to the deeds done in their bodies. The great apoſtle juſt mentioned, when brought before Felix, could think of no better means to convert that ſinful man, than to reaſon of temperance, righteouſneſs, and more eſpecially of a judgment to come. The firſt might in ſome meaſure affect, but I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was the laſt conſideration, a judgment to come, that made him to tremble: and ſo bad as the world is now grown, yet there are few have their conſciences ſo far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eared, as to deny that there will
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028079_0299_0FD695FD0A5F74E0"/>
be a reckoning he eaſter. The promiſcuous diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of providence in this life, wherein we ſee good men afflicted, deſtitute, tormented, and the wicked permitted triumphantly to ride over their heads, has been always looked upon as an indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table argument, by the generality of men, that there will be a day in which God will judge the world in righteouſneſs, and adminiſter equity unto his people. Some indeed are ſo bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the purſuit of the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life; but follow them to their death-beds, aſk them, when their ſouls are ready to launch into eternity, what they then think of judgment to come? and they will tell you, they dare not give their conſciences the lie any longer. They feel a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation in their hearts. Since then theſe things are ſo, does it not highly concern each of us, my brethren, before we come on a bed of ſickneſs, ſeriouſly to examine how the account ſtands between God and our ſouls, and how it will fare with us in that day? As for the openly profane, the drunkard, the whoremonger, the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and ſuch like, there is no doubt of what will become of them; without repentence, they ſhall never enter into the kingdom of God and his Chriſt: No; their damnation ſlumbereth not: a burning fiery Tophet, kindled by the fury of God's eternal wrath, is prepared for their reception, wherein they muſt ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire. Nor is there the leaſt doubt of the ſtate of true believers. For though they are deſpiſed and rejected of natural men, yet being born again of God, they are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt. They have the earneſt of the promiſed inheritance in their hearts, and are aſſured, that
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:028079_0300_0FD628BC8E832DF0"/>
a new and living way is made open for them, into the holy of holies, by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, into which an abundant entrance ſhall be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to them at the great day of account. The only queſtion is, what will become of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtian, one that is content to go, as he thinks, in a middle way to heaven, without being profane on the one hand, or, as he falſely imagines, righteous over-much on the other? Many there are in every congregation, and conſequently ſome here preſent, of this ſtamp. And what is worſt of all, it is more eaſy to convince the moſt notorious pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners of their being out of a ſtate of ſalvation, than any of theſe. Notwithſtanding, if Jeſus Chriſt may be your judge, they ſhall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be rejected and diſowned by him at the laſt day, as though they lived in open defiance to all his laws.</p>
            <p>For, what ſays our Lord in the parable of which the words of the text are a concluſion, and which I intend to make the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe: "Then," at the day of judgment, which he had been diſcourſing of in the foregoing, and proſecutes in this chapter, "ſhall the kingdom of heaven," the ſtate of profeſſors in the goſpel-church, <q>be likened unto ten virgins, who took up their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</q> In which words, is a manifeſt alluſion to a cuſtom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in our Lord's time among the Jews, at marriage-ſolemnities which were generally at night and at which it was cuſtomary for the perſons of the bride-chamber to go out in proceſſion, with many lights, to meet the bridegroom.</p>
            <p>By the bridegroom, you are here to underſtand Jeſus Chriſt. The church, that is, true believers, are his ſpouſe; he is united to them by one ſpirit,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:028079_0301_0FD696021CC63600"/>
even in this life; but the ſolemnizing of theſe ſacred nuptials is reſerved till the day of judgment, when he ſhall come to take them home to himſelf, and preſent them before men and angels, as his purchaſe to his Father, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing. By the ten virgins we are to underſtand the profeſſors of Chriſtianity in general. Are all called virgins, becauſe all are called to be ſaints? Whoſoever names the name of Chriſt is obliged by that very profeſſion to depart from all iniquity. But the pure and chaſte in heart, are the only perſons that will be ſo bleſſed as to ſee God. As Chriſt was born of a virgin, ſo he can dwell in none but virgin ſouls, made pure and holy by the cohabitation of his Holy Spirit. What ſays the apoſtle? "All are not Iſraelites that are of "Iſrael," all are not Chriſtians that are called after the name of Chriſt: No, ſays our Lord in the 2d verſe, "Five of thoſe virgins were wiſe," true believers, "and five were fooliſh," formal hypocrites. But why are five <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid to be wiſe, and the other five fooliſh? Hear what our Lord ſays in the following verſes; <q>They that were fooliſh took their lamps, and took no oil with them; but the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e took oil in their veſſels with their lamps.</q> They that were fooliſh took their lamps of an outward profeſſion." They would go to church, ſay over many manuals of prayers, come perhaps even in a field to hear ſermon, give at a collection, and receive the ſacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, nay, oftener than once a month. But then here lay the miſtake; they had no oil in their lamps, no principle of grace, no living faith in their hearts, without which, though we ſhould give all our goods to feed the poor, and our bodies to be burned, it would profit us nothing. In ſhort,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028079_0302_0FD695E69920DC80"/>
they were exact, nay, perhaps ſuperſtitious bigots as to the form, but all the while they were ſtrangers to, and, in effect, denied the power of godlineſs in their hearts. They would go to church, but at the ſame time, think it no harm to go to a hall or an aſſembly, notwithſtanding they promiſed at their baptiſm to renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world. They were ſo exceedingly fearful of being righteous overmuch, that they would even perſecute thoſe that were truly devout, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted to go a ſtep farther than themſelves. In one word, they never effectually felt the power of the world to come. They thought they might be Chriſtians without ſo much inward feeling, and therefore, notwithſtanding their high pretenſions, had only a name to live.</p>
            <p>And now, ſirs, let me pauſe a while, and, in the name of God, whom I endeavour to ſerve in the goſpel of his dear Son, give me leave to aſk one queſtion. Whilſt I have been drawing, though in miniature, the character of theſe fooliſh virgins, have not many of your conſciences made the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and with a ſmall, ſtill, though articulate voice, ſaid, thou man, thou woman, art one of thoſe fooliſh virgins, for thy ſentiments and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice agree thereto? Stifle not, but rather encourrage theſe convictions; and, who knows but that Lord who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, may ſo work on you even now by this fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of preaching, as to make you wiſe virgins?</p>
            <p>What they were you ſhall know immediately: <q>But the wiſe took oil in their veſſels with their lamps.</q> Obſerve, the wiſe, the true believers, had their lamps as well as the fooliſh virgins; for Chriſtianity does not require us to caſt of all outward, forms; we may uſe forms and yet not be formal:
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:028079_0303_0FD628B8612CEB80"/>
For inſtance, it is poſſible to worſhip God in a ſet form of prayer, and yet worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. And therefore, brethren, let us not judge one another: The wiſe virgins had their lamps; herein then did not lie the difference between them and the fooliſh, that one worſhipped God with a form, and the other did not: No: as the Phariſee and Publican went up to the temple to pray, ſo theſe wiſe and fooliſh virgins might go to the ſame place of worſhip, and ſit under the ſame miniſtry; but then the wiſe took oil in their veſſels with their lamps: they kept up the form, but did not reſt in it: their words in prayer were the language of their hearts, and they were no ſtrangers to inward feelings; they had ſavingly taſted the good word of life, and felt or had an experimental knowledge of the power of the world to come; they were not afraid of ſearching doctrines, nor affronted when miniſters told them they by nature deſerved to be damned: they were not ſelf-righteous, but were willing that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have all the glory of their ſalvation; they were convinced that the merits of Jeſus Chriſt were to be apprehended only by faith; but yet were they as careful to maintain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> works, as though they were to be juſtified by them: In ſhort, their obedience flowed from love and gratitude, and was cheerful, conſtant, uniform, univerſal, like that obedience which the holy angels pay our Father in heaven.</p>
            <p>Here then let me exhort you to pauſe again; and if any of you can faithfully apply theſe characters to your hearts, give God the glory, and take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your own ſouls; you are not falſe but true believers. Jeſus Chriſt has been made of God to you wiſdom, even that wiſdom, whereby you ſhall be made wiſe unto ſalvation. God ſees a difference
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:028079_0304_0FD695E9C3B93388"/>
between you and fooliſh virgins, if natural men will not. You need not be uneaſy, though one chance and fate in this life may happen to you both. I ſay, one chance and fate: for verſe 5, "while the bridegroom tarried." in the ſpace of time which paſſeth between our Lord's aſcenſion and his coming again to judgment, "they all ſlumbered and ſlept." The wiſe as well as the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh died, for duſt we are, and to duſt we muſt return. It is no reflection at all upon the divine goodneſs that believers, as well as hypocrites, muſt paſs through the valley of the ſhadow of death; for Chriſt has taken away the ſting of death, ſo that we need fear no evil. It is to them a paſſage to everlaſting life: Death is only terrible to thoſe who have no hope, becauſe they live without faith, and therefore without God in the world. Whoſoever there are amongſt you, that have received the firſt fruits of the Spirit, I am perſuaded are ready to cry out, we would not live here always; we long to be diſſolved, that we may be with Jeſus Chriſt; and though worms muſt deſtroy our bodies as well as others, yet we are content, being aſſured that our Redeemer liveth, that he will ſtand at the latter days upon the earth, and that in our fleſh we ſhall ſee God.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſo with hypocrites and unbelievers beyond the grave; for what ſays our Lord? <q>And at midnight,</q> Obſerve at midnight, when all was huſhed and quiet, and no one dreaming of any ſuch thing, "a cry was made;" the voice of the archangel and the trump of God was heard ſounding this general alarm; to things in heaven, to things in earth, and to things in the waters under the earth, Behold! mark how this awful ſummons is uſhered in the word, Behold, to engage our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:028079_0305_0FD69606CE113240"/>
"Behold the bridegroom cometh?" even Jeſus Chriſt, the deſire of nations, the bridegroom of his ſpouſe, the church: Becauſe he tarried for a while to exerciſe the faith of ſaints, and give ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpace to repent, ſcoffers were apt to cry out, <q>Where is the promiſe of his coming? But the Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as theſe men account ſlackneſs.</q> For behold, he that was to come, now cometh, and will not tarry any longer: He cometh to be glorified in his ſaints, and to take vengeance on them that know not God, and have not obeyed his goſpel: He cometh not as a poor deſpiſed Galilean; not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a ſtinking manger; not to be deſpiſed and rejected of men; not to be blind-folded, ſpit upon, and buffetted; not to be nailed to an accurſed tree; he cometh not as the Son of man, but as he really was, the eternal Son of the eternal God: He cometh riding on the wings of the wind, in the glory of the Father and his holy angels, and to be had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of all that ſhall be round about him. Go ye forth to meet him; ariſe ye dead, ye fooliſh, as well as wiſe virgins, ariſe, and come to judgment. Multitudes, no doubt, that hear this awakening cry, would rejoice, if the rocks might fall on, and the hills cover them from the preſence of the Lamb: What would they give, if, as the lived as beaſts, they might now die like the beaſts that periſh? How would they rejoice, if thoſe ſame excuſes, which they made on this ſide eternity, for not attending on holy ordinances, would ſerve to keep them from appearing before the heavenly bridegroom! But as Adam, notwithſtanding his fig-leaves, and the trees of the garden, could not hide himſelf from God, when arreſted with an, <hi>Adam where art thou?</hi> So now the decree is gone forth, and the trump of God
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028079_0306_0FD695EB884460F8"/>
has given its laſt ſound; all tongues, people, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and languages, both wiſe and fooliſh virgins, muſt come into his preſence, and bow beneath his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas; even the proud perſecuting high prieſts and Phariſees of this generation, muſt appear before him: For ſays our Lord, Then (when the cry was made, behold the bridegroom cometh!) in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye, the graves were opened, the ſea gave up its dead and all thoſe virgins, both wiſe and fooliſh, <q>aroſe and trimmed their lamps,</q> or endeavoured to put themſelves in a proper poſture to meet the bridegroom.</p>
            <p>But how may we imagine the fooliſh virgins were ſurpriſed, when, notwithſtanding their high thoughts and proud imaginations of their ſecurity, they now find themſelves wholly naked, and void of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſs and purity of heart, without which no man living at that day ſhall comfortably meet the Lord. I doubt not but many of theſe fooliſh virgins, whilſt in this world, were clothed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Theſe were looked upon by them as enthuſiaſts and madmen, as perſons that were righteous overmuch, and who intended to turn the world upſide down: but now death hath opened their eyes, and convinced them to their eternal ſorrow, that he is not a true Chriſtian, who is only one outwardly. Now they find (though alas! too late) they, and not the wiſe virgins had been beſide themſelves. Now their proud hearts are made to ſtoop, their lofty looks are brought low; and as Dives intreated that Lazarus might dip the tip of his finger in water, and be ſent to cool his tongue,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:028079_0307_0FD6960889B39CB0"/>
ſo theſe fooliſh virgins, theſe formal hypocrites, are obliged to turn beggars to theſe whom they once deſpiſed: "Give us of your oil;" O! impart to us a little of that grace and holy ſpirit, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on which we fools accounted your lives mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for, alas! Our lamps are gone out; we had only the form of godlineſs; we were whited ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres; we were heart-hypocrites; we conſented ourſelves with deſiring to be good; and tho' confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of ſalvation while we lived, yet our hope is entirely gone, now God has entirely taken away our ſouls; give us therefore, O! give us, though we once deſpiſed you, give us of your oil for our lamps of an outward profeſſion, and tranſient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, are quite gone out. <q>Comfort ye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye, my people, ſaith the Lord.</q> My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to Chriſt, hear what the fooliſh ſay to the wiſe virgins, and learn in patience to poſſeſs your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, If you are true followers of the lowly Jeſus, I am perſuaded you have your names caſt out, and all manner of evil ſpoken falſely againſt you for his name's ſake. For no one ever did, or will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, without ſuffering perſecution; nay, I doubt not but your chief foes are thoſe of your own houſehold: Tell me, do not your carnal relations and friends vex your tender ſouls day by day, in bidding you ſpare yourſelves, and take heed leſt you go too far: and as you paſſed along to come and hear the word of God, have you not heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Phariſee cry out, here comes another troop of his followers! Brethren, be not ſurpriſed, Chriſt's ſervants were always the world's fools: you know it hated him before it hated you. Rejoice and be exceeding glad. Yet a little while, and behold the bridegroom cometh; then ſhall you hear theſe formal ſcoffing Phariſees ſaying unto you, <q>Give

            <p>The wiſe virgins, in the parable, no doubt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the ſame cruel mockings as you may do; but as the lamb before the ſhearers is dumb, ſo in this life opened they not their mouths; but now we find they can give their enemies an anſwer: <q>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q> Theſe words are not to be underſtood as tho' they were ſpoken in an inſulting manner; for true charity teaches us to uſe the worſt of ſinners, and our moſt bitter enemies, with the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt: Tho' Dives was in hell, yet Abraham does not ſay, Thou villain; but only, Son, remember; and I am perſuaded, had it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It was not then for want of love, but the fear of wanting a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for themſelves, that made them return this anſwer, <q>Not ſo, left there be not enough for us and you;</q> for they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thoſe who are truly wiſe are always moſt diſtruſtful of themſelves, preſſing forwards to the things that are before, and think it well if after they have done all, they can make their calling and election ſure. <q>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:028079_0309_0FD6960FDD91BB90"/>
for us and you; but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for yourſelves.</q> Theſe words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeem to be ſpoken in a triumphant, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they were uttered in the moſt compaſſionate manner; <q>Go ye to them that ſell, and buy for yourſelves:</q> Unhappy virgins! you accounted our lives folly. Whilſt with you in the body, how often have you condemned us for our zeal in running to hear the word of God, and looked on us as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, for affirming, that we muſt be led and walk by the Spirit, and feel the Spirit of God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing with our ſpirits, that we are his children? Now you would be glad to be partakers of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, but it is not ours to give. You contented yourſelves with ſeeking, when you ſhould have been ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate; and now go to them that ſell, "and buy for yourſelves."</p>
            <p>And what ſay you to this, ye fooliſh formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors? for I doubt not but curioſity and novelty have brought many ſuch, even to this deſpiſed place, to hear a ſermon. Can you hear this reply, and yet not tremble? Why yet a little while, and thus it ſhall be done to you.

               </gap>; endeavour to cover your nakedneſs with the fig-leaves of an outward profeſſion, and legal righteouſneſs, and deſpiſe the true ſervants or Chriſt as much as you pleaſe, yet know, that all your hopes will fall you when God brings you into judgment. For not he who commendeth himſelf is juſtified, but he whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
            <p>But to return; we do not hear of any reply the fooliſh virgins make: no, their conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them; like the perſon without a wedding-garment, they are ſtruck dumb, and are now filled with anxious thoughts how they ſhall buy oil, that
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:028079_0310_0FD695EEF18A8A78"/>
they may lift up their heads before the bridegroom. "But whilſt they went to buy," the bridegroom, the Lord Jeſus, the king, the huſband of his ſpouſe the church, cometh, attended with thouſands and twenty times ten thouſands of ſaints and angels, publicly to count up his jewels; and they that were ready, the wiſe virgins who had oil in their lamps, and were ſealed by his Spirit to the day of redemption, having on the wedding-garment of an imputed righteouſneſs, and a new nature, went in to the marriage.</p>
            <p>Who can expreſs the tranſports theſe wiſe virgins felt, when they were thus admitted, in holy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, into the preſence and full enjoyment of him, whom their ſouls hungered and thirſted after. No doubt they had taſted of his love, and by faith had often fed on him in their hearts, when ſitting down to commemorate his laſt ſupper here on earth; but how full may we think their hearts and tongues were of his praiſes, when they ſee themſelves ſeated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to eat bread in his heavenly kingdom. And what was beſt of all the door was ſhut, and ſhut them in, to enjoy the ever bleſſed God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of angels, and the ſpirits of juſt man-made perfect, for ever. I ſay, without interruption for in this life, their eyes often guſhed out with water, becauſe men kept not God's law; and they could never come to appear before the Lord, or to hear his word, but Satan and his emiſſaries would come alſo to diſturb them: but now the door is ſhut, now there is a perfect communion of ſaints, which they in vain longed for in this lower world, now tares no longer grow up with the wheat; no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite or unbeliever, can ſcreen himſelf among them. Now "the wicked ceaſe from troubling" and now their weary ſouls enjoy reſt.</p>

Once more, O believers, let me exhort you in patience to poſſeſs your ſouls. God, has ſealed you to be his, and has ſecured you, as ſurely as he did Noah, when he locked him in the ark. But though heirs of God, and joint-heirs of Chriſt, and neither men nor devils can pluck you out of your heavenly Father's hands, yet you muſt be toſſed about with manifold temptations; however, lift up your heads, the day of your perfect complete redemption draws nigh. Behold the bridegroom cometh to take you to himſelf; then you ſhall be ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>But I even tremble to tell you, O nominal Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians! that the door ſhall be ſhut, I mean the door of mercy, never to be opened to give you admiſſion, tho' you ſhould continue knocking to all eternity. For thus ſpeaks our Lord, "Afterwards," after thoſe that were ready went in, and the door was ſhut; after they had, to their ſorrow, ſound that no oil was to be bought, nor grace procured, <q>came alſo the other virgins;</q> and as Eſau, after Jacob had got the bleſſing, cried with an exceeding bitter cry, "Bleſs me, even me alſo, O my father;" ſo they came, ſaying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." Obſerve the importunity of theſe fooliſh virgins, implied in theſe words, Lord, Lord. Whilſt in the body, I ſuppoſe they only read, did not pray over their prayers. If you now tell them, they ſhould pray without ceaſing, they ſhould pray from their hearts, and feel the want of what they prayed for; they would anſwer, they could not tell what you mean by inward feelings; that God did not require us to be always on our knees; but if a man did juſtly, and loved mercy, and did as the church-forms required him, it was as much as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his hands.</p>
            <p>I fear, ſirs, too many among us are of this mind:
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:028079_0312_0FD695F04A741A08"/>
nay, I fear there are many ſo polite, ſo void of the love of God, as to think it too great a piece of ſelf-denial, to riſe early to offer up a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt. If any ſuch, by the good providence of God, are brought hither this morning, I beſeech you to conſider your ways, and remember, if you are not awakened out of your ſpiritual lethargy, and live a life of prayer here, you ſhall but in vain cry but with the fooliſh virgins, <q>Lord, Lord, open to us,</q> hereafter. Obſerve farther, the impudence, as well as importunity of theſe other virgins; Lord, Lord, ſay they, as though they were intimately acquainted with the holy Jeſus. Like numbers among us, who becauſe they go to church, repeat their creeds, and receive the bleſſed ſacrament, think they have a right to call Jeſus their Saviour, and dare call, God their Father, when they put up the Lord's prayer. But Jeſus is not your Saviour. The devil, not God, is your father, unleſs your hearts are purified by faith, and you are born again from above. It is not merely being baptized by water, but being born again of the Holy Ghoſt, that muſt qualify you for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it will do you no ſervice at the great day, to ſay unto Chriſt, Lord, my name is in the regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch and ſuch a pariſh. I am perſuaded, the fooliſh virgins could ſay this and more. But what anſwer did the bleſſed Jeſus make? He anſwered and ſaid, "Verily, I ſay unto you:" He puts the word verily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> aſſure them he was in earneſt. <q>I ſay unto you,</q> I who am truth itſelf, I whom you have owned in words, but in works denied, "verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not." Theſe words muſt not be underſtood literally; for whatever Arians and Socinians may ſay to the contrary, yet
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:028079_0313_0FD696145723A520"/>
we affirm, that Jeſus Chriſt is God, God bleſſed for ever, and therefore knoweth all things. He ſaw Nathaniel, when under the fig-tree. He ſees and is now looking down from heaven, his dwelling-place, upon us, to ſee how we behave in theſe fields. Brethren, I know nothing of the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of your hearts, in coming hither; but Jeſus knows who come like new-born babes, deſirous to be fed with the ſincere milk of the word; and he knows who come to hear what the babbler ſays, and to run away with part of a broken ſentence, that they may have whereof they may ridicule or accuſe him. This expreſſion then, "I know you not," muſt not be underſtood literally; no, it implies a knowledge of approbation, as though Chriſt had ſaid, <q>You call me Lord, Lord, but you have not done the things that I have ſaid;</q> you deſire me to open the door, but how can you come in hither not having on a wedding garment? Alas, you are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked! Where is my outward righteouſneſs imputed to you? Where is my inherent righteouſneſs wrought in you? Where is my divine image ſtamped upon your ſouls? How dare you call me Lord, Lord, when you have not received the Holy Ghoſt, whereby I real all that are truly mine? <q>Verily, I know you not; depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <q>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear</q> what manner of perſons theſe were, whom Jeſus Chriſt diſmiſſed with this anſwer. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I intreat you, they are not ſent away for being fornicators, ſwearers, ſabbath-breakers, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals. No, in all probability, they were, touching the outward obſervances of the moral law, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; they were conſtant as to the form of religion; and if they did no good yet no one could ſay they
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028079_0314_0FD695F2C9BB5928"/>
did any harm. The only thing for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they were condemned, and eternally baniſhed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord (for ſo much is implied in <q>I know you not</q>) was this, they had no oil in their lamps, no principle of a true living faith and holineſs in their hearts. And if perſons may go to church, receive the ſacrament, lead honeſt moral lives, and yet be ſent to hell at the laſt day, as they certainly will be if they advance no farther, where wilt thou, O drunkard? Where wilt thou, O ſwearer? Where wilt thou, O ſabbath-breaker? Where wilt thou that denieſt divine revelation, and even the form of godlineſs? Where will you and ſuch like ſinners appear? I know very well. You muſt appear before the dreadful tribunal of Jeſus Chriſt: However you may, like Felix, put off the proſecution of your convictions, yet you, as well as others, muſt ariſe after death, and appear in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you will then find, to your eternal ſorrow, that your damnation ſlumbers not: ſin has blinded your hearts and hardened your foreheads now, but yet a little while, and our Lord will eaſe him of his adverſaries. Methinks, by faith, I ſee the heavens opened, and the holy Jeſus coming with his face brighter than ten thouſand ſuns, darting fury upon you from his eyes! Methinks I ſee you riſing from your graves, trembling, aſtoniſhed, and crying out, who can abide this day of his coming!</p>
            <p>And now what inference ſhall I draw from what has been ſaid? Our Lord, in the text, has drawn one for me: <q>Watch therefore, for ye know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Watch, that is, be on your guard, and keep your graces in continual exerciſe; For, as when we are commanded to watch unto prayer, it ſignifies that
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:028079_0315_0FD69615CBD294B0"/>
we ſhould continue inſtant in that duty; ſo when we are required to watch in general, it means that we ſhould put on the whole armour of God, and live every day as though it were our laſt.</p>
            <p>And O that the Lord may now enable me to lift up my voice like a trumpet! for had I a thouſand tongues, or could I ſpeak ſo loud that the whole world might hear me, I could not ſound a more uſeful alarm than that which is contained in the text. Watch, therefore, my brethren, I beſeech you by the mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus, Watch; be on your guard; <q>Awake, ye that ſleep in the duſt; for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</q> Perhaps to day, perhaps this midnight, this cry may be made: for in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the trump is to ſound. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuppoſing the final day of judgment may yet be a great way off, the day of death is certainly near at hand. For what is our life? It is but a vapour, ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone. Bleſſed be God, we are all here well; but who, out of this great multitude, dare ſay, I ſhall go home to my houſe in ſafety! Who knows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whilſt I am ſpeaking God may commiſſion his miniſtering ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to call ſome of you away by a ſudden ſtroke, to give an account with what attention you have heard this ſermon.</p>
            <p>You know, my brethren, ſome ſuch inſtances we have lately had. And what angel or ſpirit has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, that ſome of you ſhall not be the next? <q>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man will come:</q> And it is chiefly for this reaſon, that God has hid the day of our deaths from us. For ſince I know not but I may die to-morrow, O my ſoul, wilt thou
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:028079_0316_0FD695F4EE79C038"/>
not watch to-day? Since I know not but I may die next moment, why wilt thou not prepare for dying this?</p>
            <p>Many ſuch reflections as theſe, my brethren, croud in on my mind. At preſent, bleſſed be the Lord, who delights to magnify his ſtrength in a poor worm's weakneſs, I am at a ſtand, not ſo much about what I ſhall ſay, as what I ſhall leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. My belly, like Elihu's, is, as it were, full of new wines; out of the abundance of my heart, my mouth ſpeaketh. A ſenſe of the infinite majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that God in whoſe name I preach, and before whom I as well as you muſt appear, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and the uncertainty there is whether I ſhall live another day, to ſpeak to you any more, are conſiderations, which furniſh me with ſo much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I ſcarce know where to begin, or end my application. However, for method's ſake, by the divine aſſiſtance, I will branch it into three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would remind you, that are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ungodly, of what our Lord ſays in the text: for, tho' I have ſaid your damnation ſlumbers not, whilſt you continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an impenitent ſtate; yet that was only to ſet you on your watch, to convince you of your danger, and excite you to cry out: <q>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</q> I appeal to all that hear me, whether I have ſaid the door of mercy ſhould be ſhut againſt you, if you believe on Jeſus Chriſt: No, if you are the chief of ſinners; if you are murderers of fathers, or of mothers; if you are emphatically the dung and offscouring of all things; yet if you believe on Jeſus Chriſt, and cry unto him with the ſame faith as the expiring thief, <q>Lord, remember me, now thou art in thy kingdom;</q> I will pawn my eternal ſalvation on it, that he will
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028079_0317_0FD696198E0E1D30"/>
ſhortly tranſlate you to his heavenly paradiſe. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at my ſpeaking with ſo much aſſurance, for I know <q>It is a faithful and true ſaying, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave (all truly affected and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving) ſinners:</q> Nay, ſo great is his love, that I am perſuaded, was it neceſſary, he would come again into the world, and die a ſecond time for them on the croſs. But, bleſſed be God, when our Lord bowed down his head, and gave up the ghoſt, our redemption was finiſhed. It is not our ſins, but our want of a lively faith in his blood, that will prove our condemnation: If you draw near to him by faith, tho' you are the worſt of ſinners, yet he will not ſay unto you, <q>Verily I know you not.</q> No, a door of mercy ſhall be opened to you. Look then, by an eye of faith, to that God man, whom ye have pierced. Behold him bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, panting, dying on the croſs, with arms ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ready to embrace you all. Hark! how he groans! See how all nature is in agony! The rocks rend, the graves open; the ſun withdraws its light, aſhamed as it were to ſee the God of nature ſuffer; and all this to uſher in man's great redemption. Nay, the holy Jeſus, in the bitter agonies and pangs of death, prays for his very murderers: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them, for they know not what they do. If then you have crucified the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame, yet do not deſpair, only believe, and even this ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. You have read, at leaſt you have heard, no doubt, how three thouſand were converted at Peter's preaching one ſermon, after our Lord's aſcenſion, and many of the crucifiers of the Lord of glory undoubtedly were among them; and why ſhould you deſpair? For Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:028079_0318_0FD695F647DABA18"/>
yeſterday, to-day, and for ever. The Holy Ghoſt ſhall be ſent down on you, as well as on them, if you do but believe; for Chriſt aſcended up on high to receive this gift even for the vileſt of men. Come then, all ye that are weary and heavy laden with a ſenſe of your ſins, lay hold on Chriſt by faith and he will give you reſt; for ſalvation is the free gift of God to all them that believe. And though you may think this too good news to be true, yet I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, this is the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, this is the glad tidings which we are commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to preach to every one. Be not faithleſs then, but believing. Let not the devil lead you captive at his will any longer; for all the wages he gives his ſervants in death, death often in this life, death everlaſting in the next: but the free gift of God is everlaſting life to all that believe in Jeſus Chriſt. Phariſees are and will be offended at my coming here, and offering your ſalvation on ſuch cheap terms: but the more they bid me hold my peace, the more will I cry out and proclaim to convicted ſinners, that Jeſus, David's ſon according to the fleſh, but David's Lord as he was God, will have mercy on all that by a living faith truly turn to him. If this is to be vile, I pray God I may be more vile. If they will not let me preach Chriſt crucified; and offer ſalvation to ſinners in a church, I will preach him in the lanes, ſtreets, highways and hedges; and nothing pleaſes me better, than to think I am now in one of the devil's ſtrongeſt holds. Surely the Lord has not ſent me and all you hither for nothing; no, bleſſed be God, <q>the fields are white, ready unto harveſt,</q> and many ſouls I hope will be gathered into his heavenly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is true, It is the midnight of the church, eſpecially the poor church of England; but God
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:028079_0319_0FD6961B112125A8"/>
has lately ſent forth his ſervants to cry, <q>Behold the bridegroom cometh:</q> I beſeech you, O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, hearken unto the voice! Let me eſpouſe you by faith to my dear maſter: and henceforward watch and pray, that you mad be ready to go forth to meet him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would apply to thoſe that are not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profane, but by depending on a formal round of duties, deceive your ſouls, and are fooliſh virgins.</p>
            <p>But I muſt ſpeak to your conviction, rather than comfort. My dear brethren, you have heard how far the fooliſh virgins went, and yet were anſwered with, "Verily I know you no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:" The reaſon is, becauſe none but ſuch as have a living faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and are truly born again, can poſſibly enter into the kingdom of heaven. You may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, live honeſt and outwardly moral lives, but if you depend on that morality, or join your works with your faith, in order to juſtify you before God, you have no lot or ſhare in Chriſt's redemption: For what is this but to deny the Lord that has bought you? What is this but making yourſelves your own Saviour? taking the crown from Chriſt, and putting it on your own heads? The crime of the devil, ſome have ſuppoſed, conſiſted in this, that he would not bow to Jeſus Chriſt, when the Father commanded all the angels to worſhip him: and what do you leſs? You will not own and ſubmit to his righteouſneſs; and though you pretend to worſhip him with your lips, yet your hearts are far from him; beſides you, in effect, deny the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his bleſſed Spirit, you miſtake common for effectual grace; you hope to be ſaved becauſe you have good deſires, and a few ſhort convictions; and what is this, but to give God, his word, and all his ſaints, the lie? A Jew, a Turk, has equally
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:028079_0320_0FD695FA0CB8AB08"/>
as good grounds whereon to build the hopes of his ſalvation. Need I not then to cry out to you, ye fooliſh virgins, watch. Beg of God to convince you of your ſelf-righteouſneſs, and the unbelief of your hearts; or otherwiſe when the cry ſhall be made, "Behold the bridegroom cometh," you will find yourſelves utterly unprepared to go forth to meet him: You may cry, Lord, Lord, but the anſwer will be, Verily I know you not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would ſpeak a word to you by way of exhortation to thoſe who are wiſe virgins and are aſſured they have on a wedding-garment. That there are many ſuch amongſt you, who by grace have renounced your own righteouſneſs, and know that the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus is imputed to you, I make no doubt. God has his ſecret ones in the worſt of times; and I am perſuaded he has not let ſo loud a goſpel-cry be made among his people, as of late has been heard, for nothing. No, I am confident, the Holy Ghoſt has been given to many at the preaching of faith, and has power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fallen on many, whilſt they have been hearing the word. You are now then no longer fooliſh, but wiſe virgins; notwithſtanding, I beſeech you alſo to ſuffer the word of exhortation; for wiſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins are too apt, whilſt the bridegroom tarries, to ſlumber and ſleep. Watch therefore, watch and pray, at this time eſpecially; for perhaps a time of ſuffering is at hand. The ark of the Lord begins already to be driven into the wilderneſs. Be ye therefore on your watch, and ſtill perſevere in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing your Lord, even without the camp, bearing his reproach: the cry that has been lately made; has awakened the devil and his ſervants; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to rage horribly: and well they may; for I hope their kingdom is in danger. Watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:028079_0321_0FD6961CB9172878"/>
for if we are not always on our guard, a time of trial may overtake us unawares; and, inſtead of owning, like Peter we may be tempted to deny our maſter. Set death and eternity often before you. Look to Jeſus, the author and finiſher of your faith, and conſider how little a while it will be, ere he comes to judgment; and then our reproach ſhall be wiped away; the accuſers of us and our brethren ſhall be caſt down, and we all ſhall be lodged in heaven for ever, with our dear Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What I ſay to you, I ſay to all, Watch: High and low, rich and poor, young and old, one with another, of whatever ſect or denomination, for I regard not that, I beſeech you, by the mercies of Jeſus, to be on your guard: Fly to Jeſus Chriſt that heavenly bridegroom; Behold he deſires to take you to himſelf, miſerable, poor, blind and naked as you are; he is willing to clothe you with his everlaſting righteouſneſs, and make you parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that glory, which he enjoyed with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the world began. Do not turn a deaf ear to me; do not reject the meſſage on account of the meanneſs of the meſſenger. I am a child; but the Lord has choſen me, that the glory might be all his own. Had he ſent to invite you by a learned rabbi, you might have ſuppoſed that the man had done ſomething; but now God has ſent a child, that the excellency of the power may be ſeen not to be of man, but of God. Let the learned Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees then deſpiſe my youth: I care not how vile I appear in the ſight of ſuch men; I glory in it. And I am perſuaded, if any of you ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Chriſt by this preaching, you will have no reaſon to repent, when you come to heaven, that God ſent a child to cry, <q>Behold the Bridegroom cometh!</q> O my brethren, the thought of being
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:028079_0322_0FD695FB8B51F300"/>
inſtrumental in bringing one of you to glory, fills me with freſh zeal. Once more, I entreat you, Watch, and pray; for the Lord Jeſus will receive all that call on him faithfully. Let that cry, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh," be continually ſounding in your ears; and begin now to live, as though you were aſſured, this night you were to go forth to meet him. May the Lord give you all an hearing ear, an obedient heart, and ſo cloſely unite you to himſelf by one ſpirit, that when he ſhall come in terrible majeſty, to judge mankind, you may be found having on a wedding-garment, and ready to go in with him to the marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's ſake, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. Amen! and Amen!</hi>
