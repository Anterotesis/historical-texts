            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC PUNISHMENTS UPON CRIMINALS, AND UPON SOCIETY.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of puniſhment is ſaid to be,—1ſt, to reform the perſon who ſuffers it,—2dly, to prevent the perpetration of crimes, by exciting terror in the minds of ſpectators; and,—3dly, to remove thoſe perſons from ſociety, who have manifeſted, by their tempers and crimes, that they are unfit to live in it.</p>
            <p>FROM the firſt inſtitution of governments, in every age and country (with only a few exceptions) legiſlators have thought that puniſhments ſhould be <hi>public,</hi> in order to produce the two firſt of theſe intentions. It will require ſome fortitude to combat opinions that have been ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſuch long and general prejudice, and ſupported by univerſal practice. But truth in government, as well as in philoſophy, is of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive growth. As in philoſophy, we often arrive at truth by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evidence of our ſenſes; ſo in government, we often arrive at it after divorcing our firſt thoughts. Reaſon, tho' depoſed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is the only juſt ſovereign of the human mind. Diſcoveries, it is true, have been made by accident; but they have derived their credit and uſefulneſs only from their according with the deciſions of reaſon.</p>
            <p>IN medicine, above every other branch of philoſophy, we perceive many inſtances of the want of relation between the apparent cauſe and effect. Who, by reaſoning a priori, would ſuppoſe, that the hot regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was not preferable to the cold, in the treatment of the ſmall-pox? But experience teaches us, that this is not the caſe. Cauſe and effect appear to be related in philoſophy, like the objects of chymiſtry. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020689_0003_0FB09E33676C9338"/>
bodies often repel each other, while bodies that are diſſimilar in figure, weight and quality, often unite together with impetuoſity. With our preſent imperfect degrees of knowledge of the properties of bodies, we can diſcover theſe chymical relations only by experiment. The ſame may be ſaid of the connection between <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> in many parts of government. This connection often accords with reaſon, while it is repugnant to our ſenſes—and when this is not the caſe, from our inability to perceive it, it forces our conſent from the teſtimony of experience and obſervation.</p>
            <p>IT has been remarked, that the profeſſion of arms owes its preſent rank, as a ſcience, to its having been reſcued, ſince the revival of letters, from the hands of mere ſoldiers, and cultivated by men acquainted with other branches of literature. The reaſon of this is plain. Truth is an unit. It is the ſame thing in war—philoſophy—medicine—morals—religion and government; and in proportion as we arrive at it in one ſcience, we ſhall diſcover it in others.</p>
            <p>AFTER this apology, for diſſenting from the eſtabliſhed opinions and practice, upon the ſubject of public puniſhments, I ſhall take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of declaring, that the great ends propoſed, are not to be obtained by them; and that, on the contrary, all <hi>public</hi> puniſhments tend to make bad men worſe, and to encreaſe crimes, by their influence upon ſociety.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE reformation of a criminal can never be effected by a public pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for the following reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, AS it is always connected with infamy, it deſtroys in him the ſenſe of ſhame, which is one of the ſtrongeſt out-poſts of virtue.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, IT is generally of ſuch ſhort duration, as to produce none of thoſe changes in body or mind, which are abſolutely neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form obſtinate habits of vice.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, EXPERIENCE proves, that public puniſhments have encreaſed propenſities to crimes. A man who has loſt his character at a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-poſt, has nothing valuable left to loſe in ſociety. Pain has begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inſenſibility to the whip; and ſhame to infamy. Added to his old habits of vice, he probably feels a ſpirit of revenge againſt the whole community, whoſe laws have inflicted his puniſhment upon him; and hence he is ſtimulated, to add to the number and enormity of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon ſociety. The long duration of the puniſhment, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, by encreaſing its infamy, ſerves only to encreaſe the evils that have been mentioned. The criminals, who were ſentenced to work in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020689_0004_0FB09E3545030CF0"/>
preſence of the city of London, upon the Thames, during the late war, were prepared, by it, for the perpetration of every crime, as ſoon as they were ſet at liberty from their confinement. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew, that public puniſhments, ſo far from preventing crimes by the terror they excite in the minds of ſpectators, are directly calculated to produce them.</p>
            <p>ALL men, when they ſuffer, diſcover either fortitude, inſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or diſtreſs. Let us enquire into the effects of each of theſe upon the minds of ſpectators.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, FORTITUDE is a virtue, that ſeizes ſo forcibly upon our eſteem, that wherever we ſee it, it never fails to weaken, or to obliterate, our deteſtation of the crimes with which it is connected in criminals. "I call upon you (ſaid major Andrè, at the place of his execution, to his attendants) to bear witneſs, gentlemen, that I die like a brave man." The effect of this ſpeech upon the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army is well known. The ſpy was loſt in the hero; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, every where, gave way to admiration and praiſe. But this is not all—the admiration which fortitude, under ſuffering, excites, has in ſome inſtances excited envy. In Denmark, uncommon pains are taken to prepare criminals for death, by the converſation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the clergy. After this they are conducted to the place of execution, with uncommon pomp and ſolemnity. The criminals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe circumſtances, ſuffer death with meekneſs—piety—and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with dignity. The effects of this, I have been well informed, have been, in ſeveral inſtances, to induce deluded people to feign or confeſs crimes, which they had never committed, on purpoſe to ſecure to themſelves a conſpicuous death and a certain entrance into future happineſs. There is ſomething, in the preſence of a number of ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which is calculated to excite and ſtrengthen fortitude in a ſufferer. "It is not ſo difficult a thing (ſaid Lewis the XIV. to his courtiers, who ſtood around his death-bed) to die, as I expected." No wonder, ſays Voltaire, who relates this anecdote "for all men die with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who die in company." The bravery of ſoldiers is derived, in a great degree, from the operation of this principle in the human mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, IF criminals diſcover <hi>inſenſibility</hi> under their puniſhments, the effect of it muſt be ſtill more fatal upon ſociety. It removes, inſtead of exciting terror. In ſome inſtances, I conceive it may excite a deſire in the minds of perſons whom debt or ſecret guilt have made miſerable, to ſeek an end of their diſtreſſes in the ſame enviable apathy to evil.—
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020689_0005_0FB09E366DFEA880"/>
Should this inſenſibility be connected with cheerfulneſs (which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe) it muſt produce ſtill more unfriendly effects upon ſociety. But terrible muſt be the conſequences of this inſenſibility and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they ſhould lead criminals to retaliate upon the inhuman curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpectators, by profane or indecent inſults or converſation.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, THE effects of <hi>diſtreſs</hi> in criminals, though leſs obvious, are not leſs injurious to ſociety, than fortitude or inſenſibility. By an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table law of our nature, diſtreſs of all kinds, when <hi>ſeen,</hi> produces ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and a diſpoſition to relieve it. This ſympathy in generous minds, is not leſſened by the diſtreſs being the offspring of crimes; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, even the crimes themſelves are often palliated by the reflection, that they were the unfortunate conſequences of extreme poverty—of ſeducing company—or of the want of a virtuous education, from the loſs or negligence of parents in early life. Now, as the diſtreſs which the criminals ſuffer, is the effect of a law of the ſtate, which cannot be reſiſted, the ſympathy of the ſpectator is rendered abortive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns empty to the boſom in which it was awakened. Let us briefly examine the conſequences of this abortive ſympathy in ſociety. It will not be neceſſary here to dwell upon all the advantages of this principle in human nature. It will be ſufficient to obſerve, that it is the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent of the divine benevolence in our world. It is intended to bind up all the wounds which ſin and death have made among mankind. It has founded hoſpitals—erected charity-ſchools, and connected the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of happineſs and miſery together, in every part of the globe.— Above all, ſenſibility is the ſentinel of the moral faculty. It decides upon the quality of actions before they reach that divine principle of the ſoul. It is of itſelf, to uſe the words of an elegant female poet<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs <hi>MOORE.</hi>
               </note>,
<q>"A haſty moral—a ſudden ſenſe of right."</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſuch are the advantages of ſenſibility, now what muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to ſociety, of extirpating or weakening it in the human breaſt? But public puniſhments are calculated to produce this effect. To prove this, I muſt borrow an analogy from the animal oeconomy.—The ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the human body is ſaid to be <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive.</hi> The firſt is connected with motion and ſenſation: the ſecond only with ſenſation. The firſt is encreaſed, the ſecond is diminiſhed, by the repetition of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The ſame phaenomena take place in the human mind. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility here is both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive.</hi> Paſſive ſenſibility is leſſened, while that which is active is encreaſed by habit. The paſſive ſenſibility of a phyſician, to the diſtreſs of his patients, is always diminiſhed, but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020689_0006_0FB09E38026AD1F8"/>
his active ſenſibility is always encreaſed by time; hence we find young phyſicians <hi>feel</hi> moſt—but old phyſicians, with leſs feeling, <hi>diſcover moſt</hi> ſympathy with their patients.</p>
            <p>IF ſuch be the conſtitution of our minds, then the effects of diſtreſs upon them will be, not only to deſtroy paſſive, but, to eradicate active ſenſibility from them. The principle of ſympathy, after being often oppoſed by the law of the ſtate, which forbids it to relieve the diſtreſs it commiſerates, will ceaſe to act altogether; and, from this defect of action, and the habit ariſing from it, will ſoon loſe its place in the human breaſt. Miſery of every kind will then be contemplated without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſympathy.—The widow and the orphan—the naked—the ſick, and the priſoner, will have no avenue to our ſervices or our charity— and what is worſe than all, when the ſentinel of our moral faculty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, there is nothing to guard the mind from the inroads of every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive vice.</p>
            <p>I PASS over the influence of this ſympathy in its firſt operation upon the government of the ſtate. While we pity, we ſecretly condemn the law which inflicts the puniſhment—hence ariſes a want of reſpect for laws in general, and a more feeble union of the great ties of government.</p>
            <p>I HAVE only to add, upon this part of my ſubject, that the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious effects of ſympathy, where it does not terminate in action, are happily provided againſt by the Jewiſh law. Hence we read of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition againſt it, where perſons ſuffer for certain crimes. To ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the voice of Heaven, under ſuch circumſtances, is, "thine eye ſhall not pity him."</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, BUT it is poſſible the characters or conduct of criminals may be ſuch, as to excite indignation or contempt, inſtead of pity, in the minds of ſpectators. Let us therefore enquire, briefly, into the effects of theſe paſſions upon the human mind. Every body acknowledges our obligations to <hi>univerſal</hi> benevolence. But theſe cannot be fulfilled, unleſs we love the whole human race, however diverſified they may be by weakneſs or crimes. The indignation or contempt which is felt for this unhappy part of the great family of mankind, muſt neceſſarily extinguiſh a large portion of this univerſal love. Nor is this all—the men, or perhaps the women, whoſe perſons we deteſt, poſſeſs ſouls and bodies compoſed of the ſame materials as thoſe of our friends and relations. They are bone of their bone, and were originally faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame ſpirits. What then muſt be the conſequence of a familiarity with ſuch objects of horror, upon our attachments and duties to our friends and connections, or to the reſt of mankind? If

a ſpectator ſhould give himſelf time to reflect upon ſuch a ſight of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity, he would naturally recoil from the embraces of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the endearments of domeſtic life, and perhaps ſay, with an unfortunate great man, after having experienced an inſtance of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in a friend, "Oh! that I were dog, that I might not call man my brother."—The Jewiſh law forbad more than nine and thirty laſhes, left the ſufferer ſhould afterwards become "vile" in the ſight of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. It is the prerogative of GOD alone, to contemplate the vices of bad men, without withdrawing from them the ſupport of his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Hence we find, when he appeared in the world in the perſon of his ſon, he did not exclude criminals from the benefits of his goodneſs. He diſmiſſed a woman caught in the perpetration of a crime, which was capital by the Jewiſh law, with a friendly admonition; and he opened the gates of paradiſe to a dying thief.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, BUT let us ſuppoſe, that criminals are viewed without ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy—indignation—or contempt. This will be the caſe either when ſpectators are themſelves hardened with vice, or when they are too young, or too ignorant, to connect the ideas of crimes and puniſhments toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here then a new ſource of injury to ſociety ariſes from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature of puniſhments. Every portion of them will appear, to ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of this deſcription, to be mere arbitrary acts of cruelty. Hence will ariſe a diſpoſition to exerciſe the ſame arbitrary cruelty over the feelings and lives of their fellow-creatures. To ſee blows, or a halter, impoſed in cold blood, upon a criminal, whoſe paſſive behaviour, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the ignorance of the ſpectators, indicates innocence more than vice, cannot fail of removing the natural obſtacles to violence and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the human mind.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, PUBLIC puniſhments make many crimes known to perſons, who would otherwiſe have paſſed through life in a total ignorance of them. They moreover produce ſuch a familiarity in the minds of ſpectators, with the crimes for which they are inflicted, that, in ſome inſtances, they have been known to excite a propenſity to them. It has been remarked, that a certain immorality has always kept pace with public admonitions in the churches in the eaſtern ſtates. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as this branch of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline has declined, fewer children have been born out of wedlock.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly, IGNOMINY is univerſally acknowledged to be a worſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than death. Let it not be ſuppoſed, from this circumſtance, that it operates more than the fear of death in preventing crimes. On the contrary, like the indiſcriminate puniſhment of death, it not only
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020689_0008_0FB09E3AE0BA5B60"/>
confounds and levels all crimes, but by <hi>encreaſing</hi> the diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween crimes and puniſhments, it creates a hatred of all law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thus diſpoſes to the perpetration of every crime. Laws can only be reſpected, and obeyed, while they bear an exact proportion to crimes. The law which puniſhes the ſhooting of a ſwan with death in England, has produced a thouſand murders. Not is this all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous influence which the puniſhment of ignominy has upon ſociety. While murder is puniſhed with death, the man who robs on the high way, or breaks open a houſe, muſt want the common feelings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which belong to human nature, if he does not add murder to theft, in order to ſcreen himſelf, if he ſhould be detected, from that puniſhment which is acknowledged to be more terrible than death.</p>
            <p>IT would ſeem ſtrange, that ignominy ſhould ever have been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a milder puniſhment than death, did we not know, that the human mind ſeldom arrives at truth upon any ſubject, till it has firſt reached the extremity of error.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly, BUT may not the benefit derived to ſociety by employing cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals to repair public roads, or to clean ſtreets, overbalance the evils that have been mentioned? I anſwer, by no means. On the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides operating in <hi>one,</hi> or in <hi>all</hi> the ways that have been deſcribed, the practice of employing criminals in public labour, will render labour of every kind diſreputable, more eſpecially that ſpecies of it which has for its objects the convenience or improvement of the ſtate. It is a well known fact, that white men ſoon decline labour in the Weſt-Indies, and in the ſouthern ſtates, only becauſe the agriculture, and mechanical em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of thoſe countries, are carried on chiefly by Negro ſlaves. But I object further to the employment of criminals on the high-ways and ſtreets, from the idleneſs they will create by alluring ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators from their buſineſs; and thereby depriving the ſtate of greater benefits from the induſtry of its citizens, that it can ever derive from the public labour of criminals.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of public puniſhments, in every age and country, is full of facts, which ſupport every principle that has been advanced.— What has been the operation of the ſeventy thouſand executions, that have taken place in Great-Britain from the year 1688, to the preſent day, upon the morals and manners of the inhabitants of that iſland? Has not every priſon door that has been opened, to conduct crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to public ſhame and puniſhment, unlocked, at the ſame time, the bars of moral obligation upon the minds of ten times the number of people? How often do we find pockets picked under a gallows, and highway-robberies committed within ſight of a gibbet? From whence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020689_0009_0FB09E3F247A2E38"/>
aroſe the conſpiracies, aſſaſſinations and poiſonings, which prevailed in the decline of the Roman empire? Were they not favoured by the public executions of the amphitheatre? It is therefore to the combined operation of indolence, prejudice, ignorance—and the defect of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the human heart, alone, that we are to aſcribe the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of public puniſhments, after ſuch long and multiplied experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their inefficacy to reform bad men, or to prevent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of crimes.</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET it not be ſuppoſed, from any thing that has been ſaid, that I wiſh to aboliſh puniſhments. Far from it—I wiſh only to change the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of inflicting them, ſo as to render them effectual for the reformation of criminals, and beneficial to ſociety. Before I propoſe a plan for this purpoſe, I beg leave to deliver the following general axioms.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, THE human mind is diſpoſed to exaggerate every thing that is removed at a diſtance from it, by <hi>time or place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, IT is equally diſpoſed to enquire after, and to magnify ſuch things as are <hi>ſecret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, IT always aſcribes the extremes in qualities, to things that are <hi>unknown;</hi> and an exceſs in duration, to <hi>indefinite</hi> time.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, CERTAIN, and <hi>definite evil,</hi> by being long contemplated, ceaſes to be dreaded or avoided. A ſoldier ſoon loſes, from habit, the fear of death from a bullet, but retains, in common, with other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the terror of death from ſickneſs or drowning.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, AN attachment to kindred and ſociety is one of the ſtrongeſt feelings in the human heart. A ſeparation from them, therefore, has ever been conſidered as one of the ſevereſt puniſhments that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon man.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, PERSONAL liberty is ſo dear to all men, that the loſs of it, for an indefinite time, is a puniſhment ſo ſevere, that death has often been preferred to it.</p>
            <p>THESE axioms being admitted (for they cannot be controverted) I ſhall proceed next to apply them, by ſuggeſting a plan, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of crimes, which I flatter myſelf will anſwer all the ends that have been propoſed by them.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, LET a large houſe, of a conſtruction agreeable to its deſign, be erected in a remote part of the ſtate. Let the avenue to this houſe be rendered difficult and gloomy by mountains or moraſſes. Let its
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020689_0010_0FB09E41D45ECC48"/>
doors be of iron; and let the grating, occaſioned by opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, be encreaſed by an echo from a neighbouring mountain, that ſhall extend and continue a ſound that ſhall deeply pierce the ſoul. Let a guard conſtantly attend at a gate that ſhall lead to this place of puniſhment, to prevent ſtrangers from entering it. Let all the officers of the houſe be ſtrictly forbidden ever to diſcover any ſigns of mirth, or even levity, in the preſence of the criminals. To encreaſe the horror of this abode of diſcipline and miſery, let it be called by ſome name that ſhall import its deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, LET the various kinds of puniſhment, that are to be inflicted on crimes, be defined and fixed by law. But let no notice be taken, in the law, of the puniſhment that awaits any particular crime. By theſe means we ſhall prevent the mind from accuſtoming itſelf to the view of theſe puniſhments, ſo as to deſtroy their terror by habit. The indifference and levity with which ſome men ſuffer the puniſhment of hanging, is often occaſioned by an inſenſibility that is contracted by the frequent anticipation of it, or by the appearance of the gallows ſuggeſting the remembrance of ſcenes of criminal feſtivity, in which it was the ſubject of humour or ridicule. Beſides, puniſhments ſhould always be varied in degree, according to the temper of criminals, or the progreſs of their reformation.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, LET the duration of puniſhments, for all crimes, be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but let this limitation be unknown. I conceive this ſecret to be of the utmoſt importance in reforming criminals, and preventing crimes. The imagination, when agitated with uncertainty, will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of connecting the longeſt duration of puniſhment, with the ſmalleſt crime.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT conceive any thing more calculated to diffuſe terror thro' a community, and thereby to prevent crimes, than the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the three circumſtances that have been mentioned in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Children will preſs upon the evening fire in liſtning to the tales that will be ſpread from this abode of miſery. Superſtition will add to its horrors, and romance will find in it ample materials for fiction, which cannot fail of encreaſing the terror of its puniſhments.</p>
            <p>LET it not be objected, that the terror produced by the hiſtory of theſe ſecret puniſhments, will operate like the abortive ſympathy I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. <hi>Active</hi> ſympathy can be fully excited only through the avenues of the eyes and the ears. Beſides, the recollection that the only deſign of puniſhment is the reformation of the criminal, will ſuſpend the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020689_0011_0FB09E432F6BC928"/>
of ſympathy altogether. We liſten with paleneſs to the hiſtory of a tedious and painful operation in ſurgery, without a wiſh to arreſt the hand of the operator. Our ſympathy, which in this caſe is of the <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> kind, is mixed with pleaſure, when we are aſſured, that there is a certainty of the operation being the means of ſaving the life of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.</p>
            <p>NOR let the expence of erecting and ſupporting a houſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the purpoſes that have been mentioned, deter us from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. It would be eaſy to demonſtrate, that it will not coſt one-fourth as much as the maintenance of the numerous jails that are now neceſſary in every well-regulated ſtate. But why ſhould receptacles be provided and ſupported at an immenſe expence, in every country, for the relief of perſons afflicted with bodily diſorders, and an objection be made to providing a place for the cure of the diſeaſes of the mind?</p>
            <p>THE nature—degrees—and duration of the puniſhments, ſhould all be determined beyond a certain degree, by a court properly conſtituted for that purpoſe, and whoſe buſineſs it ſhould be to viſit the receptacle for criminals once or twice a year.</p>
            <p>I AM aware of the prejudices of freemen, againſt entruſting power to a diſcretionary court. But let it be remembered, that no power is committed to this court, but what is poſſeſſed by the different courts of juſtice in all free countries; nor ſo much as is now wiſely and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily poſſeſſed by the ſupreme and inferior courts, in the execution of the penal laws of Pennſylvania. I ſhall ſpend no time in defending the conſiſtency of private puniſhments, with a ſafe and free government. Truth, upon this ſubject, cannot be divided. If public puniſhments are injurious to criminals and to ſociety, it follows, that crimes ſhould be puniſhed in private, or not puniſhed at all. There is no alternative. The oppoſition to private puniſhments, therefore, is founded altogether in prejudice, or in ignorance of the true principles of liberty.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety and advantages of private puniſhments, will appear further, when I add, that the beſt governed families and ſchools are thoſe, in which the faults of ſervants and children are rebuked private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and where confinement and ſolitude are preferred for correction, to the uſe of the rod.</p>
            <p>IN order to render theſe puniſhments effectual, they ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the conſtitutions and tempers of the criminals, and the peculiar nature of their crimes. Peculiar attention ſhould be paid, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020689_0012_0FB09E44C6EC9928"/>
in the nature, degrees and duration of puniſhments, to crimes, as they ariſe from paſſion, habit or temptation.</p>
            <p>THE puniſhments ſhould conſiſt of BODILY PAIN, LABOUR, WATCHFULNESS, SOLITUDE, and SILENCE. They ſhould all be joined with CLEANLINESS and a SIMPLE DIET. To aſcertain the nature, degrees and duration of the bodily pain, will require ſome knowledge of the principles of ſenſation, and of the ſympathies which occur in the nervous ſyſtem. The labour ſhould be ſo regulated and directed, as to be profitable to the ſtate. Beſides employing criminals in laborious and uſeful manufactures, they may be compelled to derive all their ſubſiſtence from a farm and a garden, cultivated by their own hands, adjoining the place of their confinement.</p>
            <p>THESE puniſhments may be uſed ſeparately, or more or leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, according to the nature of the crimes, or according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the conſtitution and temper of the criminal. In the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, the utmoſt poſſible advantages ſhould be taken of the laws of the aſſociation of ideas, of habit, and of imitation.</p>
            <p>TO render theſe phyſical remedies more effectual, they ſhould be accompanied by regular inſtruction in the principles, and obligations of religion, by perſons appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THUS far I am ſupported, in the application of the remedies I have mentioned, for the cure of crimes, by the facts that are contained in Mr. Howard's hiſtory of priſons, and by other obſervations. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet to preſcribe the <hi>ſpecific</hi> puniſhment that is proper for each <hi>ſpecific</hi> crime. Here my ſubject begins to oppreſs me. I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in moral and phyſical influence, than I have of the efficacy of the Peruvian bark in curing the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever. The only difficulty is, to find out the proper remedy or remedies for particular vices. Mr. Dufriche de Valazé, in his elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate treatiſe upon penal laws, has performed the office of a pioneer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this difficult ſubject. He has divided crimes into claſſes, and has affixed puniſhments to each of them, in a number of ingenious tables. Some of the connections he has eſtabliſhed between crimes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, appear to be juſt.—But many of his puniſhments are contrary to the firſt principles of action in man; and all of them are, in my opinion, improper, as far as he orders them to be infflicted in the <hi>eye</hi> of the <hi>public.</hi> His attempt, however, is laudable, and deſerves the praiſe of every friend to mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:020689_0013_0FB09E46AD889208"/>IF the invention of a machine for facilitating labour, has been repaid with the gratitude of a country, how much more will that man deſerve, that ſhall invent the moſt ſpeedy and effectual methods of reſtoring the vicious part of mankind to virtue and happineſs, and of extirpating a portion of vice from the world?—Happy condition of human affairs! when humanity, philoſophy and chriſtianity, ſhall unite their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to teach men, that they are bretheren; and to prevent their preying any longer upon each other! Happy citizens of the United States, whoſe governments permit them to adopt every diſcovery in the moral or intellectual world, that leads to theſe benevolent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes!</p>
            <p>LET it not be objected, that it will be impoſſible for men, who have expiated their offences by the mode of puniſhment that has been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to recover their former connections with ſociety. This objection ariſes from an unfortunate aſſociation of ideas. The infamy of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, is derived, not ſo much from the remembrance of their crimes, as from the recollection of the ignominy of their puniſhments. Crimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſtain, which may be waſhed out by reformation, and which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wears away by time: But public puniſhments leave ſcars, which disfigure the whole character; and hence perſons, who have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, are ever afterwards viewed with horror or averſion. If crimes were expiated by private diſcipline, and ſucceeded by reformation, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals would probably ſuffer no more in character from them, than men ſuffer in their reputation or uſefulneſs from the puniſhments they have undergone when boys at ſchool.</p>
            <p>I AM ſo perfectly ſatisfied of the truth of this opinion, that methinks I already hear the inhabitants of our villages and town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips counting the years that ſhall complete the reformation of one of their citizens. I behold them running to meet him on the day of his deliverance.—His friends and family bathe his cheeks with tears of joy; and the univerſal ſhout of the neighbourhood is, "This our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was loſt and is found—was dead, and is alive."—</p>
            <p>IT has long been a deſideratum in government, that there ſhould exiſt in it no pardoning power, ſince the <hi>certainty</hi> of puniſhment ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſo much more than its ſeverity, or infamy, in preventing crimes. But where puniſhments are exceſſive in degree, or infamous from being public, a pardoning power is abſolutely neceſſary. Remove their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and public infamy, and a pardoning power ceaſes to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a code of criminal juriſprudence.—Nay, further—it is ſuch a defect in penal laws, as in ſome meaſure defeats every invention to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020689_0014_0FB09E487AB64218"/>
prevent crimes, or to cure habits of vice. If puniſhments were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, juſt and private, they would exalt the feelings of public juſtice and benevolence ſo far above the emotions of humanity in witneſſes, juries and judges, that they would forget to conceal, or to palliate crimes; and the <hi>certainty</hi> of puniſhment, by extinguiſhing all hope of pardon in the criminal, would lead him to connect the beginning of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the laſt words of his ſentence of condemnation. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this great and ſalutary end, there ſhould exiſt <hi>certain</hi> portions of puniſhment, both in duration and degree, which ſhould be placed by law beyond the power of the diſcretionary court before mentioned, to ſhorten or mitigate.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid nothing upon the manner of inflicting death as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for crimes, becauſe I conſider it as an improper puniſhment for <hi>any</hi> crime. Even murder itſelf is propagated by the puniſhment of death for murder. Of this we have a remarkable proof in Italy. The Duke of Tuſcany, ſoon after the publication of the Marquis of Beccaria's excellent treatiſe upon this ſubject, aboliſhed death as a puniſhment for murder. A gentleman, who reſided five years at Piſa, informed me, that only five murders had been perpetrated in his dominions in twenty years. The ſame gentleman added, that after his reſidence in Tuſcany, he ſpent three months in Rome, where death is ſtill the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of murder, and where executions, according to Doctor Moore, are conducted with peculiar circumſtances of public parade. During this ſhort period, there were ſixty murders committed in the precincts of that city. It is remarkable, the manners, principles, and religion, of the inhabitants of Tuſcany and Rome, are exactly the ſame. The abolition of death alone, as a puniſhment for murder, produced this difference in the moral character of the two nations.</p>
            <p>I SUSPECT the attachment to death, as a puniſhment for murder, in minds otherwiſe enlightened, upon the ſubject of capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ariſes from a falſe interpretation of a paſſage contained in the old teſtament, and that is, "he that ſheds the blood of man, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed." This has been ſuppoſed to imply, that blood could only be expiated by blood. But I am diſpoſed to believe, with a late commentator<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reverend Mr. <hi>WILLIAM TURNER,</hi> in the ſecond Vol. of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philoſophical Society of Mancheſter.</note> upon this text of ſcripture, that it is rather a <hi>prediction,</hi> than a <hi>law.</hi> The language of it is ſimply, that ſuch will be the depravity and folly of man, that murder, in every age, ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020689_0015_0FB09E49F137F9C0"/>
beget murder. Laws, therefore, which inflict death for murder, are, in my opinion, as unchriſtian as thoſe which juſtify or tolerate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; for the obligations of chriſtianity upon individuals, to promote repentance, to forgive injuries, and to diſcharge the duties of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence, are equally binding upon ſtates.</p>
            <p>THE power over human life, is the ſolitary prerogative of HIM who gave it. Human laws, therefore, riſe in rebellion againſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, when they transfer it to human hands.</p>
            <p>IF ſociety can be ſecured from violence, by confining the murderer, ſo as to prevent a repetition of his crime, the end of extirpation will be anſwered. In confinement, he may be reformed—and if this ſhould prove impracticable, he may be reſtrained for a term of years, that will probably be coeval with his life.</p>
            <p>THERE was a time, when the puniſhment of captives with death or ſervitude, and the indiſcriminate deſtruction of peaceable huſbandmen, women and children, were thought to be eſſential to the ſucceſs of war, and the ſafety of ſtates. But experience has taught us, that this is not the caſe. And in proportion as humanity has triumphed over theſe maxims of falſe policy, wars have been leſs frequent and terrible, and nations have enjoyed longer intervals of internal tranquility. The vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are all parts of a circle. Whatever is humane, is wiſe—whatever is wiſe, is juſt—and whatever is wiſe, juſt, and humane, will be found to be the true intereſt of ſtates, whether criminals or foreign enemies are the objects of their legiſlation.</p>
            <p>I HAVE taken no notice of perpetual baniſhment, as a legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I conſider it the next in degree, in folly and cruelty, to the puniſhment of death. If the receptacle for criminals, which has been propoſed, is erected in a <hi>remote</hi> part of the ſtate, it will act with the ſame force upon the feelings of the human heart, as perpetual ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Exile, when perpetual, by deſtroying one of the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful principles of action in man, viz. the love of kindred, and country, deprives us of all the advantages, which might be derived from it, in the buſineſs of reformation. While certain paſſions are weakened, this noble paſſion is ſtrengthened by age; hence, by preſerving this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alive, we furniſh a principle, which, in time, may become an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match for thoſe vicious habits, which ſeparated criminals from their friends, and from ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:020689_0016_0FB09E4E31A0F0D8"/>NOTWITHSTANDING this teſtimony againſt the puniſhment of death and perpetual baniſhment, I cannot help adding, that there is more mercy to the criminal, and leſs injury done to ſociety, by both of them, than by <hi>public</hi> infamy and pain, without them.</p>
            <p>THE great art of ſurgery has been ſaid to conſiſt in ſaving, not in deſtroying, or amputating, the diſeaſed parts of the human body. Let governments learn to imitate, in this reſpect, the ſkill and humanity of the healing art. Nature knows no waſte in any of her operations. Even putrefaction itſelf, is the parent of uſeful productions to man. Human ingenuity, imitates nature in a variety of arts. Offal matters, of all kinds, are daily converted into the means of encreaſing the profits of induſtry, and the pleaſures of human life. The ſoul of man alone, with all its moral and intellectual powers, when miſled by paſſion, is abandoned, by the ignorance or cruelty of man, to unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable corruption, or extirpation.</p>
            <p>IF the foregoing reaſonings and facts, have been urged in vain, in favour of private puniſhments, I ſhall add one more argument, which I hope will be irreſiſtible. The puniſhments of wicked men, in the world of ſpirits, are inviſible; we have no knowledge of their reality, nature, degrees, or duration, but what was revealed to us near eighteen hundred years ago; and yet governments owe their ſtability, chiefly, to that morality, which the terror of theſe inviſible, remote, and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite puniſhments, excites in the human mind.</p>
            <p>A WORTHY prelate of the church of England once ſaid upon ſeeing a criminal led to execution, "There goes my wicked ſelf." Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vices to which the frailty of human nature expoſes whole families of every rank and claſs in life, it becomes us whenever we ſee a fellow-creature led to public infamy and pain, to add further, "There goes my unhappy father, my unhappy brother, or my unhappy ſon," and afterward to aſk ourſelves, whether <hi>private</hi> puniſhments are not to be preferred to <hi>public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the honour of humanity it can be ſaid, that in every age and country, there have been found perſons in whom uncorrupted nature has triumphed over cuſtom, and law. Elſe, why do we hear of houſes being abandoned near to places of public execution? Why do we ſee doors and windows ſhut on the days or hours of criminal exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and proceſſions? Why do we hear of aid being ſecretly afforded to criminals, to mitigate or elude the ſeverity of their puniſhments?—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020689_0017_0FB09E511BCC97A8"/>
Why is the public executioner of the law an object of ſuch general deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Theſe things are the latent ſtruggles of reaſon, or rather the ſecret voice of God himſelf, ſpeaking in the human heart, againſt the folly and cruelty of public puniſhments.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this enquiry by obſerving, that the ſame falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and philoſophy, which once kindled the fire on the altar of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, now doom the criminal to public ignominy and death. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the principles of philoſophy and chriſtianity are underſtood, they will agree in extinguiſhing the one, and deſtroying the other. If theſe principles continue to extend their influence upon government, as they have done for ſome years paſt, I cannot help entertaining a hope, that the time is not very diſtant, when the gallows, the pillory, the ſtocks, the whipping-poſt, and the wheel-barrow (the uſual engines of public puniſhments) will be connected with the hiſtory of the rack, and the ſtake, as marks of the barbarity of ages and countries, and as melancholy proofs of the feeble operation of reaſon, and religion, upon the human mind.</p>
