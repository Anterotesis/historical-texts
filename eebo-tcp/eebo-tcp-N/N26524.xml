            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THAT the following oration may lead to no miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the opinion I entertain, reſpecting the actual origin of our late epidemics, I beg leave to introduce it to the notice of my fellow-citizens, by a few preliminary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I do not believe that, either, in the years ninety three, ninety ſeven, or ninety eight, the American peſtilence was excluſively of domeſtic origin. I am perſuaded that, on each of thoſe occaſions, a very powerful cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, was introduced into Philadelphia, through the channel of commerce. I do not, however, with ſome phyſicians, conceive, that this cauſe was introduced in the form of <hi>human contagion,</hi> generated in the diſeaſed bodies of men, but in that of <hi>foul air,</hi> reſulting from the putrid ballaſt, or damaged cargoes of veſſels. Nor have I, on enquiry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nd reaſon to believe, that there exiſts, on record, a ſingle well authenticated inſtance, of the diſeaſe in queſtion, having, ever, in the former method, been introduced into any part
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035263_0005_1001B3DDD7D67E48"/>
of the United States. As often as commerce has borne a part in giving birth to this diſeaſe, in any of our ſeaports, it does not appear to have been through the inſtrumentality of <hi>human contagion,</hi> imported from the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, from the Levant, or the ſhores of Africa; but, as lately in this place, through that of peſtiferous air, generated by the putrefactive diſſolution of the cargoes or ballaſt of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at ſea. Nor is it a matter of the ſmalleſt import, from what quarter of the globe theſe cargoes come. Provided, they be of a putrefiable nature, and arrive in our ports, during the intenſity of our ſummer heats, (but, particularly, between the middle of July and laſt of September,) it is wholly immaterial whether they be the native productions of Europe, of Aſia, of Africa, or of the Weſt India Iſlands. And it is equally immaterial, from which of theſe places they are immediately imported. The ſuſpenſion, therefore, of commercial intercourſe, during certain months in the year, with the Weſt India Iſlands alone, would be a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wholly inadequate to the prevention of this diſeaſe. Were ſuch ſuſpenſion adopted by the Government of the Union, it ſhould, unqueſtionably, extend to all parts of the globe, from which putrefiable cargoes may be imported. But ſuch an impolitic meaſure, ſuggeſts at once ſufficient cauſe for its immediate rejection, as it is evidently pregnant with nothing leſs than abſolute ruin to the commerce of our country.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I have not found ſufficient cauſe to believe, that, without the co-operation of foul air, from the veſſels at our wharves, the American peſtilence would have become
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035263_0006_1001B3E580F45E98"/>
               <hi>epidemic,</hi> in our city, in either of the years, to which I have alluded. I have even gone ſo far as to flatter myſelf, with a belief, that, in the preſent ſtate of our city, ſuch co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is abſolutely neceſſary to its epidemic prevalence. In this belief, however, I am, by no means, confirmed. Perhaps, even now, the filth of our city and ſuburbs has accumulated to a ſufficient height, to give to peſtilence an epidemic rage. In ninety three, I had not completed my medical ſtudies, and can, therefore, ſay nothing reſpecting the immediate ſource of particular caſes, that might have occurred in the city during that year. But I heſitate not to ſay, with as much confidence, as I ought to uſe, in ſpeaking on any ſpeculative ſubject in phyſics, that, in ninety ſeven and ninety eight, I ſaw, myſelf, ſeveral caſes of the diſeaſe in queſtion, which muſt have neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the operation of domeſtic cauſes. I am further confident, that many caſes of a ſimilar nature, were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of my medical friends. If, then, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſources of our city, ſolitary, or (to ſpeak in medical language) ſporadic caſes of peſtilence may now occur, how melancholy is our proſpect, ſhould the filth in our city and ſuburbs, be ſuffered to accumulate with the progreſs of time! Of ſuch an accumulation muſt not an epidemic be finally the offspring?</p>
            <p>But let us, even, for a moment, admit, that not a ſingle caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the epidemics of ninety three, ninety ſeven, or nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight, originated from the excluſive operation of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic cauſes. Still, it is a poſition, which no one will venture
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035263_0007_1001B3EDB501FDF8"/>
to deny, that their rapid and extenſive propagation, was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſome peculiarity in the atmoſphere of our city. This inference we draw from the <hi>very few</hi> inſtances, in which, the peſtilence, under conſideration, was propagated by contagion when taken from the city to the unadulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated atmoſphere of the country.</p>
            <p>Were the atmoſphere of Philadelphia preſerved in purity, by a due degree of attention to domeſtic cleanlineſs, and by preventing veſſels, charged with foul air, from entering our port, peſtilence, as an epidemic, would never again occur, to ſwell the catalogue of our future misfortunes.— In ſuch a ſtate of things, ſporadic caſes of the diſeaſe might, <hi>possibly,</hi> originate with ourſelves, and might, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, be introduced from diſtant places; but the evil would terminate with the death or recovery of thoſe firſt attacked, and would never ſpread, to the diſtreſs of our citizens, and the depopulation of our city. The baleful plant, though fairly ingrafted on our ſyſtems, would lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, wither, and die for want of nouriſhment!</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thus, whatever principles, I may advocate, with reſpect to the practicability of peſtilence originating and exiſting, as an epidemic, in our city, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, from the excluſive operation of domeſtic cauſes, I believe this to be an event, which has never yet occurred, Commerce appears to have been, at all times, juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with part of the calamity, that has never failed, to accompany this worſt of evils. The epidemic train would ſeem to have been, always, laid in our atmoſphere, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035263_0008_1001AE61C30A07C8"/>
of the ſummer-ſun on the filth of our city and ſuburbs, while immenſe volumes of foul air, diſcharged from the holds of veſſels at our wharves, ſerved as the ſpark to rouſe it into flame. Had not the train exiſted, the ſpark would have expired without effect, and had not the ſpark been applied, the train would have lain dormant, and, perhaps never burſt into actual exploſion—If, then, by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either of theſe, we might acquire an exemption from the inevitable effects of their co-operation, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the one, and the prevention of the other, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come doubly ſecure againſt the calamities, to which they give origin.</p>
            <p>I hope I will be indulged in attempting, by another ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, a farther illuſtration of the above intricate and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting ſubject. With this view, I would compare the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer atmoſphere of our city, deeply contaminated by putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from domeſtic ſources, to a maſs of paſte or dough, duly kneaded, and prepared to undergo the proceſs of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In this ſtate of things, the yeaſt, or leven, calculated and intended to give actual birth to this proceſs, not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents the foul air iſſuing from the holds of veſſels at our wharves, and mixing, in abundance, with our viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated atmoſphere. As the operation of the ferment is well known to be, that of aſſimilating to itſelf, the maſs into which it is introduced, ſuch would ſeem to be the effect of the deleterious air diſcharged along our wharves. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to the atmoſphere of our city, <hi>perhaps,</hi> by a peculiar ſpecies of fermentation, its own peſtilential and
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035263_0009_1001B3FA0136D638"/>
deſtructive properties. Or, like the matter of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, introduced into a ſyſtem prediſpoſed to its reception, it inoculates our atmoſphere with effect, and thus, <hi>possibly,</hi> by an indeſcribable ſpecies of ſympathetic action, approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to its own nature, the air that ſurrounds us.</p>
            <p>If we pay due attention to all the branches of domeſtic cleanlineſs, and keep foul veſſels at a diſtance from our wharves, war may rage in the Weſt-Indies,<note n="*" place="bottom">Of all the explications, which have been hitherto given for the exiſtence of our late epidemics, none has appeared to me, ſo completely the child of fancy, as that, which attributes it to the prevalence of war in the Weſt Indies. For my own part, I muſt confeſs, I am not able to diſcover any more neceſſary phyſical connection between war in the Weſt Indies, and peſtilence in America, than between coach-making in Philadelphia, and button-making in London!</note> till the paſſions of man begin to languiſh, and the ambition of nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exhauſted, and the yellow-fever may there ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from iſland to iſland, yet, ſtill, amid this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wreck and confuſion, will our city remain exempt from an epidemic peſtilence! Whereas, on the other hand, if theſe requiſites be not attended to,—if our city and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs be ſuffered to continue immerſed in their preſent filth, and veſſels be allowed to diſembogue their peſtilential va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours along our wharves, though the Weſt Indies ſhould be converted into an Eden of peace, fragrance, and healthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and though the ſeeds of peſtilence, ſhould be, for ever, blaſted along the ſhores of Aſia, and Africa, yet ſtill, will Philadelphia—hapleſs Philadelphia, remain ſubject to a rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the melancholy ſcenes of ninety three, ninety ſeven, and ninety eight!</p>

            <p>IN riſing to addreſs you on the preſent occaſions my feelings impel me to a two-fold acknowledgment—An acknowledgment for the unexpected honour, with which I have been diſtinguiſhed, in your appointing me to prepare and deliver the firſt of the ſemiannual addreſſes enjoined by our conſtitution; and a moſt cordial acknowledgment for the liberal indulgence, which I experienced from you, on a former occaſion, when indiſpoſition interfered, and, by fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating my attempt to comply with my engagement, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, for the time, the expectations of the Academy.</p>
            <p>Would that I could ſuffer my exordium to terminate here! But circumſtances forbid that this ſhould be the caſe. The pleaſure of <hi>acknowledgment</hi> I muſt now exchange for the taſk of <hi>apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035263_0011_1001B409580D3DE8"/>In behalf of the following performance, I would addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to that rigid, unaccommodating juſtice in criticiſm, which I have reaſon to believe moſt of you have at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but to that forbearance and clemency, of which, I, am well aſſured, you are all poſſeſſed. I muſt ſolicit you to extend to the ſubſequent oration, ſome ſhare of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, with which, on various occaſions, you have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Orator. Let me not be diſappointed in flattering myſelf, that the uſual benevolence of your natures will throw, at leaſt, ſome ſhadow of palliation over ſuch faults as the clearneſs of your underſtandings will inevitably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and the juſtneſs of your ſentiments oblige you to condemn.</p>
            <p>Suffer it to operate in mitigation of your impending ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when I aſſure you, that the following addreſs was prepared and numerous avocations, of a nature more than uſually unfavourable to ſucceſs in compoſition. But ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I have more—much more, to expect from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous liberality of your minds, than from the humble me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of my own defence, I will no longer addreſs you in the language of apology. Part of the imperfections of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am about to deliver, ariſe no leſs from want of abilities, than from want of leiſure. A portion of the cenſure muſt, therefore, in juſtice, reſt on yourſelves, for not having been more circumſpect in your choice of an orator.</p>
            <p>It was my intention to have paid in this place, a paſſing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the memory of our two deceaſed friends and fellow-members, Dr. Sayre and Dr. Cooper. I had even prepared
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035263_0012_1001B40DED818940"/>
myſelf for the diſcharge of this mournful duty. Impreſſed by reſpect for the talents and learning, and by ſentiments of eſteem and friendſhip for the numerous virtues of thoſe two medical philoſophers, I was unwilling to neglect ſo fair an opportunity of expreſſing my ſenſe of their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed worth. Being ſuperceded however, in this duty, by a very judicious and reſpectful appointment of the Academy, for the expreſs purpoſe of doing juſtice to their memories, I ſhall paſs in ſilence over the melancholy ſubject. But when the name of Cooper, in particular, is mentioned, to ſuffer oblivious ſilence to uſurp the place of deſcriptive and juſt eulogium, is, with me, no inconſiderable effort of ſelf-reſtraint. On ſuch an occaſion my feelings would prompt me to a far different conduct. As I have ever ranked the acquiſition of the friendſhip of this gentleman among the moſt fortunate occurrences of my life, it will not be thought ſtrange, that I ſhould feel an inclination to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute my mite to the immenſe treaſure of reſpect, which his numerous acquaintance will pay to his memory. But an indulgence of my feelings on this occaſion, would lead to an unwarrantable digreſſion from what I propoſe as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubject of my addreſs.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of attempting, therefore, to cheriſh in your breaſts a kind, but unavailing ſorrow for the dead, allow me to ſolicit your attention to a few general obſervations relative to the origin of peſtilential diſeaſes. I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confine my remarks and ſpeculations more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the origin of that diſeaſe, whoſe ravages and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035263_0013_1001B4140F9E0818"/>
terrors, have thrice, of late, reduced the gay and crouded ſtreets of our city to a diſmal ſcene of deſolation and ſolitude.</p>
            <p>As my ſubject is, evidently, very extenſive and copious, ſhould I even engroſs a little more of your time than you at preſent anticipate, I hope you will bear, with a patient indulgence, the unintentional but unavoidable treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>It is, in this place, worthy of remark, that <hi>Pestilence</hi> has been, at all times, treated by the world, as an illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate child, without an acknowledged parent—in other words, as a plant perfectly exotic as to every inhabited ſoil and climate—or as a phyſical evil, exiſting in almoſt every region, yet (ſtrange inconſiſtency!) originating in none!</p>
            <p>It is a fact not more ſingular than true, that, there is not to be found in the whole range of the globe, a ſingle country, which is acknowledged by its own inhabitants, to be the immediate birth-place of peſtilence. When this dreadful ſcourge makes its appearance in any place, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver favourable, from climate and local cauſes, to its domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic generation, its exiſtence never fails to be attributed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>introduction</hi> by land, or <hi>importation</hi> by ſea, from ſome foreign country. As it, for the moſt part, appears firſt in large commercial cities, the latter of theſe is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conſidered as the channel of its conveyance. Hence the evils of peſtilence have been generally charged to the account of commerce. Thus, when the plague prevails in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035263_0014_1001B41A971F9228"/>
any part of Europe, it is uniformly aſſerted to have been imported in merchandize from Aſia. When it breaks out in the latter place, where it not unfrequently depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates towns and villages, and, occaſionally, lays even whole countries waſte, it is always traced, or what, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent and unthinking natives, amounts to the ſame thing, is ſuppoſed to be traced to ſome communication with the continent of Africa. But the hardy ſons of this burning climate, ſpurn, with indignation, what they conſider not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an inſult to the healthfulneſs, but alſo as an injury to the proſperity of their country, and contend, that the plague is never generated with them, but is always intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from ſome diſtant quarter. Nor is this obſtinate ſpirit of reluctance in the human race to admit peſtilence to be a native of the ſame ſoil and climate with themſelves, confined to the continent of the old world. But five years ago, the ſame thing might have been ſaid with reſpect to moſt of the inhabitants of the United States. Few of them could then be induced to believe, that the weſtern ſhores of the Atlantic could poſſibly give birth to a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diſeaſe. They ſeemed to ſuppoſe, that a phyſical evil of ſuch a magnitude, muſt neceſſarily be the growth of a foregn climate, not ſo highly favoured by heaven as their own.</p>
            <p>To you, Gentlemen, it is ſcarcely neceſſary for me to obſerve, that this unwillingneſs in mankind to acknowledge peſtilence to be a native of the ſame country with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould be viewed as an inveterate prejudice, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035263_0015_1001B422472BA9B0"/>
like all other prejudices, by the two gothic pillars of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>error.</hi> It requires no uncommon depth of logic to prove, that peſtilential diſeaſes, having an exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, muſt have alſo a place of origin; and, that this place, muſt be in ſome of the inhabited parts of the earth. But ſo extraordinary and abſurd is the prejudice, of which I have ſpoken, that it literally denies theſe diſeaſes to have originated in any place. Taking the ſentiments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, on this ſubject, for our guide, we would find a ſearch after the real birth-place of peſtilence equally abortive with the poet's ſearch after the North, which he ſo energetically repreſents in the following lines.
<q>
                  <l>But where th' extreme of vice was ne'er agreed;</l>
                  <l>Aſk, Where's the North? at York 'tis on the Tweed;</l>
                  <l>In Scotland, at the Orcades, and there,</l>
                  <l>At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where!</l>
               </q>
So it is with reſpect to the birth-place of peſtilence. In America it is in the Weſt-Indies; in the Weſt-Indies, it is, at one time, at Siam in the Eaſt-Indies; and again at Boulam in Africa; while, at theſe places, it is ſtill farther to the <hi>east</hi> as if the riſing was capable of exalting the poiſon of putrefaction to higher malignity than even the mid-day ſun. Were not the ſubject too ſerious to be treated as a jeſt, I would farther ſay, that this ſingular abſurdity, in moſt men, with reſpect to the birth-place of peſtilence, brings to my recollection the humourous ſtory of Goldſmith's pauper, who, in queſt of the real or acknowledged place of his birth,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035263_0016_1001AEA3CB61FC78"/>
(the place where, by the municipal regulations of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he was entitled to a ſubſiſtance for life,) was carted about from pariſh to pariſh, till, to uſe the poor fellow's own words, he "thought in his ſoul, they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he had been born in any pariſh at all."</p>
            <p>Let us, for a moment, trace this prejudice through all its windings to its fountain head. It ſprings from the boſom of <hi>self-love.</hi> This real though ſecret principle of all our ſentiments, opinions, and actions, will not ſuffer us to admit, that we ourſelves can be the ſource of any thing evil, or of any thing diſaſtrous. From ourſelves we are inclined to extend this favourable opinion to our friends, acquaintance, and countrymen; and from them, to the air which we breathe, the ſoil which gave us birth, and even to the waters which variegate the landſcapes that ſurround us. The ſame ſelfiſh principles—the ſame contracted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which led the reprobate Jews of old to exclaim, "Can any thing good come out of Galilee" induces the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but, in ſome reſpects, not much more enlightened, moderns to aſk, can any thing evil originate in our beloved country?</p>
            <p>This prejudice, reſpecting the origin of peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, derives no inconſiderable ſupport from the operation of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but powerful principle of ſelf-intereſt. We are apprehenſive, that ſhould our country be characterized as the birth-place of peſtilence, ſuch an opinion would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035263_0017_1001AE92E918A140"/>
prove injurious to its population and proſperity, and that, conſequently our intereſts as individuals muſt ſuffer. This however, is a miſtaken fear. General <hi>truth</hi> and general <hi>utility</hi> are ſworn friends, and inſeparable companions. Nor are they more ſo, in any inſtance, than in that which claims our preſent attention. The ſame enlightened views in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which declare, that peſtilence may originate among ourſelves, afford us, at the ſame time, the moſt firm and conſolatory aſſurance, that we have in our own hands the means of prevention and ſafety. Nor is this our only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Were phyſical truth, on this ſubject, fully evolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would ſet moſt, if not all countries and climates, nearly on a level with reſpect to the origin of peſtilential diſeaſes. For I am perſuaded that there exiſts not a ſpot on the ſurface of the globe, which may not, under certain, circumſtances, become capable of giving birth to theſe waſteful epidemics.</p>
            <p>I beg it may not, from the foregoing obſervations, be underſtood, that I mean, on the ſubject of the origin of peſtilential diſeaſes, to accuſe the whole human race of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and error. Far from it—There have, at all times, exiſted many diſtinguiſhed inſtances of exemption from ſuch a charge. There have, in all ages, and in all countries, exiſted men, who, in oppoſition to an overbearing torrent of popular prejudice and indignation, have boldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the diſeaſes in queſtion to have been the offspring of the places where they have ſpread deſolation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035263_0018_1001B434AD602A48"/>This is well known to have been formerly the caſe, in London and Marſeilles, during the unparalelled calamities inflicted by peſtilence on thoſe two ancient and populous cities. Nor was it of late, leſs remarkably the caſe in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the United States, but more particularly in the city of Philadelphia. When the Yellow Fever (which might with more propriety have been denominated the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican pestilence)</hi> made its appearance in this city in the autumn of ninety three, to have ſaid that it was a diſeaſe of domeſtic origin, was conſidered as an unfounded ſlander on our climate, and the man, who dared to advocate ſuch an opinion, was viewed in the light of an enemy to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Almoſt every mind was then big with the idea of importation, and almoſt every eye fixe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on a tropical region, as the only place capable of giving birth to ſuch an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable malady. To this blindfold ſtate of the public mind, there fortunately exiſted ſome degree of exception. Amid the general gloom of ignorance and error, by which we were overſhadowed, there appeared, even then, a few twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtars, the joyous harbingers of a brighter day. The dawn of that day has already reached us, and we have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon to believe, that we will very ſhortly be wrapt in its full meridian.</p>
            <p>The opinion, that our late epidemic muſt be neceſſarily imported to us from a tropical climate, will ſoon become as unpopular as it was once extenſive. Already is it greatly circumſcribed in its limits—Already is it confined almoſt entirely to thoſe, who were originally active and clamorous
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035263_0019_1001B43948CD18F8"/>
in its ſupport. By ſuch characters we are not to expect that it will be immediately abandoned. They have already pledged themſelves to the world for its ſupport, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, therefore, its fate as in ſome meaſure interwoven with the fate of their own characters, as philoſophers in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Like a parent, with all his tenderneſs awakened by the approaching diſſolution of a beloved child, they will cling to it with the greater fondneſs, the more nearly they ſee it about to expire. But expire it will, nor can all the partial and ſtudied efforts of its ſupporters prolong its fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exiſtence. Like the <hi>old</hi> ſyſtem of chemiſtry tottering before the <hi>new,</hi> it muſt finally ſink beneath the doctrine of domeſtic generation, nor will it find, among all its advocates, a Prieſtly to appear great and unſhaken in the midſt of its ruins!</p>
            <p>We have already obſerved, that in all parts of the world, and in all periods of ſociety, mankind, in general, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and exhibited a moſt profound hoſtility againſt the opinion of their own country being, under any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the birth-place of peſtilence. Nor has the matter end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. They have been ſolicitous and active to defend, not only their own immediate country, but even our whole globe, from the charge of giving origin to an evil of ſuch magnitude. Whenever this diſeaſe has appeared, they have, like many phyſicians and citizens of the United States, been extremely anxious and induſtrious to trace it to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecies of importation. It may not be altogether uſeleſs nor unintereſting, to trace the many ſingular and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035263_0020_1001AEA241386C78"/>
modifications, through which this opinion, of the <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign importation</hi> of peſtilential diſeaſes, has ſucceſſively paſſed.</p>
            <p>In the earlieſt ages of the world, when ignorance and ſuperſtition led men to attribute all extraordinary pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena to the direct agency of ſupernatural beings, peſtilence was ſuppoſed to be imported immediately from Heaven. This is the opinion which appears to have prevailed among the ancient Hebrews, and may be ranked at the head of the catalogue of abſurdities on this ſubject. The domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prejudice over the minds of that ignorant and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people, appears in this inſtance particularly ſtriking. Such was the depth of their blind bigotry in favour of the healthfulneſs of the globe they inhabited, that they would ſeem to have conſidered it as even ſuperior to that of the celeſtial regions. Hence, unwilling, to believe that their favourite earth could give origin to an evil ſo dreadful as peſtilence, they imported the ſeeds of this calamity from the more unhealthful climate of heaven!!</p>
            <p>Another ſpecies of <hi>importation</hi> no leſs extraordinary than the former, is that which derived peſtilential diſeaſes from the ſun. An opinion of this kind appears to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, reſpecting the origin of that peſtilence, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated the Grecian camp before the walls of Troy.</p>
            <p>Another deſcription of importation from diſtant worlds remains yet to be mentioned. During that period of error,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035263_0021_1001B44596CCF5B8"/>
in which the ſcience of medicine, in common with moſt other branches of ſcience, was deeply perverted by aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical notions, not one of the planets (our own perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted!) eſcaped the charge of giving origin to peſtilential diſeaſes. Thus Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, may all be found arraigned in the dark catalogue. Nor did the moon herſelf eſcape. Even the celebrated, but fanciful Paracelſus, boldly accuſed this fair luminary, as being the parent of deadly peſtilence.—Had nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to this period of intellectual perverſion, by a happy effort, raiſed up a Herſchel, to ſoar, an aſtronomical Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, through the immenſity of ſpace, there is little doubt, but that the orb, which now bears his name, would, even from its diſtant bourne, have been called to the narrow bar of human prejudice, to anſwer to the charge of having been the birth-place and nurſery of the ſame diſeaſe!</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the foregoing opinions, however irrational and abſurd in the view of a more enlightened age, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote anceſtors appear to have acted in concert. Such was their blind partiality in favour of the world they inhabited, that they could not, for a moment, admit the belief of its ever giving riſe to true peſtilence. At length, however, were they forced to abandon the ground they had originally taken—At length was this extraordinary metaſtiſis of error obliged to relinquiſh entirely the heavenly bodies, and fix on earth as its final retreat. At this period men became divided in their opinion, reſpecting the origin of the evil in queſtion. Obliged to acknowledge it as a native of our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035263_0022_1001AEB4A255EAC0"/>
own globe, they commenced a zealous ſearch for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſoil and climate from which it ſprang. Here it was that their opinions became hoſtile. Each one deſirous of preſerving, in purity, the character of his own country, charged the birth of peſtilence to the country of another. Nor has the controverſy as yet ſubſided. We have ſeen very evident traces of it in the reſearches of men after the origin of that malignant peſtilence, by which we have, lately, been three times viſited. Thus, in America, the Weſt India Iſlands were, at firſt, conſidered as its birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. Some phyſicians, in the Weſt Indies, on the other hand, attribute its prevalence there to importation from the coaſt of Africa. While, no doubt, the hardy African will retort the charge, and ſay, that they are indebted, for this diſeaſe, to the lawleſs intruſion of white men on their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhores. Thus we ſee that the ſame illiberal ſpirit of prejudice which, in the earlier ages of the world, induced our forefathers to attribute the origin of peſtilence to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the ſun, the moon, and the various planetary bodies, ſtill continues, though under a different form, among their more highly favoured poſterity. They went to diſtant worlds in queſt of the origin of this diſeaſe, whereas we reſt ſatisfied with ſhorter excurſions, and travel only to diſtant countries!</p>
            <p>I have called that prejudice, which leads to remote parts of the globe, in queſt of the origin of peſtilential diſeaſes, an illiberal one; nor am I at all inclined to retract the epithet. I think it narrow and illiberal, becauſe it frequently urges
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035263_0023_1001B454F2AA0050"/>
men on to defend the character of their own climate and country, at the expence of that of other places, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has favoured with equal advantages. As formerly obſerved, the very ſame principle of illiberality which leads us to deny, to other portions of the globe, the poſſeſſion of advantages and excellencies which they undoubtedly hold, induces us alſo to load them with the imputation of evils, from which they an wholly exempt. This is a principle which the enlightened Americans ſhould indignantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. From its undue operation, in the minds of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, they themſelves have already ſuffered much. There was a time when America was conſidered, by moſt Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, as capable of giving birth to but little that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable. And ſhall we, now, actuated by the ſame narrow principle, and governed by the ſame circumſcribed views, contend, that it can give origin to nothing embraced in the catalogue of evils? I flatter myſelf with a confidence that we never will. For though proud and happy in the belief, that the wiſdom and ſpirit of Americans will be at all times competent and prompt to defend our country and its character from every deſcription of inſult and injuſtice, I ſhould yet be ſorry and humiliated at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſelfiſh national ſpirit, inclining us to the defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other countries, for the illiberal purpoſe of adding a ſuperior luſtre to our own!</p>
            <p>From arguments to be laid before you in a ſubſequent part of this addreſs, it will I truſt appear, that America is,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035263_0024_1001B45B16C5A6A0"/>
equally with other parts of the world, capable of giving birth to the worſt of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the opinion, that our late peſtilence is neceſſarily imported from the Weſt Indies, it is with pleaſure I obſerve, that its relinquiſhment has already very evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commenced. Even ſome of its moſt ſtrenuous advocates have found it neceſſary, in attempting its defence, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don entirely their original ground. They, at firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the ſeeds of this diſeaſe were imported to us in the form of <hi>human contagion</hi> only, adhering to the clothes or bodies of ſeamen or paſſengers, or to the timbers, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or contents of veſſels. This however, conſtitutes no longer an article in their medical creed. They are now willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the ſeeds of the diſeaſe may be brought, not only under the form of <hi>human contagion,</hi> but alſo under that of <hi>foul air,</hi> produced by a high ſtate of putrefaction in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's ballaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r cargo. This muſt be granted by all, to be a very <hi>material,</hi> and you will indulge me in adding, a very <hi>auspicious</hi> change of opinion. But the change will not ſtop here. Having ſo far relinquiſhed their original ground as to allow, that the <hi>American Pestilence</hi> can originate from putrefaction in the hold of a veſſel at ſea, they will next accede to the propoſition, that it may, under certain circumſtances, reſult from a ſimilar proceſs on ſhore. Hence the warmer regions of North America will, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, be next ſuſpected of giving birth to the formidable diſeaſe in queſtion. But at this point opinion will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtationary. The change will ſtill continue to progreſs,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035263_0025_1001B46134B6B0A0"/>
till, at length, when the ſhades of error and prejudice ſhall have been entirely diſſipated, each citizen of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia will ſee the principal cauſe of the peſtilence that afflicts him, not in the immediate hand of a benevolent Deity—not in the malign aſpect of the ſun, the moon, or the planetary bodies—not on the burning ſhores of Africa or the Weſt Indies, but in the very centre of his own city!</p>
            <p>Indulge me, for a few moments, in a detail of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments, which induce me to conſider our peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſeaſes as the genuine offspring of our own country.</p>
            <p>Peſtilence can become epidemic only, when aided by a concurrent conſtitution of Atmoſphere. This poſition is founded on the collective experience of ages. Where ſuch a conſtitution does not prevail, ſporadic caſes of peſtilence may indeed occur, but they will again diſappear, and leave ſurrounding individuals unhurt. The nature of that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtate of atmoſphere, favourable to the propagation of peſtilential diſeaſes, has hitherto eluded the reſearches of philoſophers. The reality of its exiſtence, however, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently eſtabliſhed from the obvious effects to which it gives riſe. Though ridiculed, of late, by ſome phyſicians, under the denomination of an <hi>occult</hi> quality, reaſon and obſervation ſtill declare it to be a quality reſting, for the certainty of its exiſtence, on evidence as ſubſtantial, as that which ſupports the great Newtonian principle, the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all terreſtrial bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035263_0026_1001B46756B00B60"/>A peſtilential conſtitution of atmoſphere may be either <hi>general</hi> or <hi>local.</hi> The general is that which extends over whole countries, ſometimes even over entire continents, and, for the moſt part, prolongs its duration for ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive years. The local is confined to particular ſpots, moſt commonly to large commercial cities, and terminates with the diſappearance of certain topical cauſes, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally poſſeſs but a ſhort lived exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Various opinions have been entertained, by philoſophers, reſpecting the cauſe of this general peſtilential conſtitution. By ſo me, it has been attributed to a general and permanent exhalation, perhaps of a mineral nature, reſulting from the action of ſubterraneous fires; by others, to an immenſe volume of poiſonous gas, forcibly diſcharged from the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, during the dreadful con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſions of an earth-quake; and by others again, to torrents of peſtiferous air eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the atmoſphere from the craters of Volcanos. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe two latter opinions, ſome degree of evidence is derived from the circumſtance of the prevalence of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, being very often either preceded or accompanied by the occurrence of earth-quakes, or by repeated and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful volcanic eruptions. Of the frequent and ſtriking coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence, both in point of time and place, between the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of peſtilence and the occurrence of earth-quakes and eruptions from volcanos, the records of medicine afford am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proof. An unanſwerable argument in favour of the reality of this general conſtitution of atmoſphere, is derived from the frequent (I had almoſt ſaid uniform) cotemporary
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035263_0027_1001B46BECF961C8"/>
prevalence of peſtilential diſeaſes, in different and diſtant parts of the globe.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a general conſtitution of atmoſphere may exiſt in America, as well as in other places, is a poſition, which, abſtractly conſidered, we have no reaſon to doubt. And that it even does actually prevail, at this time, is an opinion entertained by many reſpectable characters, and ſupported by various phyſical phenomena. On a full and minute ſtatement of theſe phenomena, time will not ſuffer me, at preſent, to enter. I flatter myſelf, however, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing facts, relative to this curious and intereſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, will not be deemed unworthy the attention of the Academy.</p>
            <p>For ſome years paſt, ſeveral ſpecies of inſects, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence is known no be intimately connected with the ſtate of the atmoſphere, have been more than uſually abundant in our country. Of the truth of this, our farmers are able to furniſh us with but too many unequivocal and, to them, expenſive teſtimonies. It will require many years to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate from the memory of this uſeful and reſpectable claſs of our fellow-citizens, the injuries they have ſuſtained from the invaſion and ravages of the <hi>Hessian Fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The origin of this deſtructive inſect has, like that of our late epidemic, conſtituted a ſubject of ſpeculation and doubt, among the literary characters of the United States. While ſome have traced it to foreign importation, others have contended that it is a native of our own country. Were I to lay
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035263_0028_1001B473973200E8"/>
before you the reſult of my own enquiries and reflection on this point of natural hiſtory, I ſhould be inclined to advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the latter opinion. I am rather diſpoſed to believe, that what is vulgarly denominated the Heſſian Fly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates entirely with ourſelves. There is reaſon to ſuſpect, that our fields and foreſts contain, perhaps, at all times, this inſect in certain members, and that it ſuperabounds, and, depredates on the labours of the huſbandman in thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, during which there prevails a ſtate or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of atmoſphere, more peculiarly favourable to its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and exiſtence. For it is a fact well known to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, that no leſs in the oeconomy of inſects than in that of plants, certain ſeaſons are favourable, and others unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to their generation and growth.</p>
            <p>Again, it is a fact, with which men of obſervation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unacquainted, that for ſeveral years paſt, but more particularly during the laſt and preceding autumns, muſki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos were more than uſually abundant in thoſe ſituations which they generally infeſt—Nor is this all—Theſe inſects, not willing to be confined, during the two laſt ſeaſons, to their former limits, made their way into many places, which, before, had been almoſt wholly exempt from their invaſion. But from the well known circumſtance, that muſkitos uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly abound at the ſame time, and in the ſame places, with epidemic bilious fevers, we are very fairly authorized to conclude, that theſe noxious inſects depend, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, on an inſalubrious ſtate and conſtitution of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. Nor muſt I here omit to obſerve, that the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035263_0029_1001B47B405E3530"/>
of graſs-hoppers, which infeſted our country, during laſt ſummer, beſpoke a condition of atmoſphere different from what uſually prevails at that ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>If then our country has, of late, been characterized by an unuſual prevalence of inſects and of diſeaſe in different places, and if theſe inſects and diſeaſe have, in moſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prevailed, not only at the ſame time, but alſo in the ſame ſituations, (both of which facts are unqueſtionably true) have we not, at leaſt, a very oſtenſible ground of belief, that theſe unuſual and cotemporary phenomena proceed from the ſame cauſe, and that this cauſe is no other than a ſtate and conſtitution of our atmoſphere, different from thoſe that uſually characterize the atmoſphere of our country?</p>
            <p>In corroboration of the preceding inference, namely, that the ſame conſtitution of atmoſphere, which favours the prevalence of peſtilential diſeaſes, is, in like manner, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the exiſtence of inſects, I beg leave to give a brief ſtatement and explanation of an intereſting fact, which, we learn from the hiſtory of former ages. For more than fifty years, during the reign of the emperor Juſtinian, the plague raged in Europe, Aſia and Africa, with ſuch unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelled violence and malignity, as ſometimes to threaten, in appearance, even the depopulation of the whole earth. Throughout this period of devaſtation and calamity, ſuch was the immenſity of locuſts which infeſted the countries where the peſtilence prevailed, that many were diſpoſed to attribute the exiſtence of this diſeaſe to the death and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035263_0030_1001B47FD6C452C8"/>
of theſe deſtructive inſects. This latter opinion, however, we conceive to be founded, in a great meaſure, in error. For although the peſtilential conſtitution of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere was, no doubt, ſtrengthened by the deleterious gas, ariſing from the putrefactive diſſolution of ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe volume of animal matter, it is by no means likely that it reſulted from this as its primary cauſe. There ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts certain facts which render it much more probable, that the ſame conſtitution of atmoſphere, reſulting originally from ſome more powerful ſource, proved favourable, at once, to the generation of locuſts, and to the birth and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peſtilence of the age.</p>
            <p>Might not a like phyſical explanation be given of the cauſe of ſeveral of the plagues, which ſacred writ declares to have viſited, in ancient times, the incorrigible Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and which were then ſuppoſed, to have been inflicted by the immediate hand of the Deity? I allude particularly to the deſtructive ſwarms of locuſts, and flies, and to the peſtilence among men, and the murrain among cattle, two diſeaſes, which appear to be intimately connected. Is it not, I ſay, at leaſt, an admiſſible conjecture, that there prevailed, at that time, a certain peſtilential conſtitution of atmoſphere, which operated as the leading phyſical cauſe of all theſe evils? The profound darkneſs which, ſhortly afterwards, overſhadowed, for a time, the dominions of the impious and tyrannical Pharaoh, was probably nothing more than a natural concomitant of the ſame conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035263_0031_1001B4846CEFA598"/>That there was ſomething peculiar and uncommon, in the general ſtate and condition of the air, during our epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics of ninety three, ninety ſeven, and ninety eight, we would deduce from the vaſt number of fiery meteors, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly denominated falling or ſhooting ſtars) which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our atmoſphere during thoſe periods. I think it highly probable, that theſe blazing meteors, always abound during the exiſtence of a peſtilential conſtitution of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and that on their uniform appearance, ſuperſtition has erected a belief, that certain ſtrange and ſupernatural phenomena in the heavens, never fail to give premonition of the approach of peſtilence.</p>
            <p>As a farther evidence in favour of the exiſtence of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar conſtitution of atmoſphere, particularly during the years ninety three and ninety eight, it deſerves to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that, in thoſe years, the fruits of our country, in general, ripened and rotted with much more than their uſual rapidity. And that, on many of our fruit trees, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond crops of bloſſoms appeared early in the autumn of the ſame years, and, on ſome of them, even ſecond crops of fruit made conſiderable advances toward maturity. Nor could the occurrence of theſe phenomena be fairly deduced from the exiſtence of any peculiarity in the ſenſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the atmoſphere. Seaſons as warm and dry as thoſe, to which I have referred, are not uniformly productive of ſimilar effects. To the agency, therefore, of ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible cauſe in our atmoſphere, muſt we attribute the ſeveral phenomena in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:035263_0032_1001B48C167B8DE0"/>Another unanſwerable argument in favour of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional exiſtence of a general morbid conſtitution of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere in our country, is derived from the extenſive preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the catarrhal fever (commonly denominated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza) in the years eighty eight and eighty nine. This diſeaſe, which I believe is acknowledged by all to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from a certain deleterious conſtitution or ſtate of the air we inſpired, was ſo general, as to pervade every part of the United States. But the conſtitution, from which it originated, muſt have been, in like manner, general, being neceſſarily co-extenſive with the diſeaſe itſelf. During part of the continuance of this catarrhal conſtitution, a deep duſkineſs, or want of due tranſparency in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, conſiderably obſcured the ſun, in many, if not moſt, parts of our country, thus conſtituting an approach toward Egyptian darkneſs, which, as formerly obſerved, was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, nothing more than a natural effect or concomitant of the then exiſting peſtilential conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The cauſes, which give riſe to that <hi>local constitution</hi> of atmoſphere, favourable to the generation and propagation of peſtilence, are by far more obvious in their nature, operate on a much leſs entenſive ſcale, and poſſeſs an exiſtence by no means ſo durable. They are principally confined to large cities, camps, and garriſons, where multitudes of people are crowded together, and where perſonal and other deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of cleanlineſs do not receive the attention they merit. They may be ſaid, in general, to be, all ſuch cauſes as tend, in the above deſcriptions of places, to generate foul air, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035263_0033_1001B48F2562A5F0"/>
thus produce a vitiated ſtate of atmoſphere. The principal of theſe ſhall hereafter become ſubjects of particular ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This local conſtitution of atmoſphere extends, frequently, beyond the immediate confines of cities, camps and garriſons, and, ſometimes, even pervades conſiderable tracts of country, particularly ſuch as are low and marſhy. It is an evil, which may be ſaid to owe its origin, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to that <hi>indolence</hi> and <hi>inattention,</hi> which unfortunately, conſtitute ſuch predominant traits in the character of the human race. This peculiar conſtitution, of which we have ſpoken, is nothing elſe than a prediſpoſition or capability in the atmoſphere to generate and propagate peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. It would ſeem to conſiſt, either in the actual admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of peſtilential effluvia with the air which we breathe, or in the preſence of ſome aeriform ſubſtance, which favours the exiſtence and conveyance of ſuch effluvia, and prevents their action from being deſtroyed by the influence of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</p>
            <p>Your attention, for a few moments, is next ſolicited to the remote cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes. It need ſcarcely be obſerved, that this ſubject is very nearly allied to that of which we have laſt treated. So intimate, indeed, is their connection, that they might, without any impropriety, have been both ſpoken of under the ſame head. This remote cauſe may be defined, a gas of a highly poiſonous nature, which, when brought into contact with the human body, renders it liable, if expoſed at the ſame time to the action of exciting cauſes, to an attack of the diſeaſe denominated peſtilence.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035263_0034_1001B493C065DE20"/>
A knowledge of the peculiar phyſical properties of this gas has hitherto remained, and, I fear, will very long continue to remain, an important deſideratum in the ſcience of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. Even the reality of its exiſtence is, as yet, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, only, by its unparalelled ravages on the ſyſtem of man, and on the ſyſtems of a few ſpecies of inferior animals. So extremely ſubtle and evaneſcent is its nature, that we have not been able to ſeparate it from ſurrounding matter, to embody it together, and thus ſubject it to the teſt of obſervation and experiment.</p>
            <p>A knowledge of the actual ſource of this peſtilential va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour is equally intereſting to phyſical ſcience, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the welfare of the human race. Though it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it may occaſionally ariſe, in the form of exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in conſequence of the action of ſubterraneous fires; and though it be probable that it has, in ſome inſtances, been thrown from the bowels of the earth, during the convulſion of an earthquake, or the eruption of a volcano, yet theſe are by no means its moſt frequent ſources. It appears to be now reduced to a certainty, as deciſive as any exiſting in phyſical ſcience, that organized bodies, in a high and long continued ſtate of putrefaction, conſtitute the legitimate parent of peſtilential effluvia.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I have not thought proper to attempt a minute detail of all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that might be collected in favour of the above poſition. It is, by far, too extenſive to be embodied within the neceſſary limits of my addreſs. It maybe found moſt copiouſly diffuſed through the works of all philoſophical phyſicians, who have written expreſſly on the ſubject of peſtilence. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed ſtatement of it here, would be nothing more than a needleſs repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what muſt be familiar to the mind of every one, who has attended to the cultivation of the ſcience of medicine. Ever ſince peſtilence was firſt acknowledged to be a native of our globe, it has been uniformly derived, by phyſicians of obſervation, from the poiſonous gas reſulting from the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive diſſolution of organized bodies. This would lead me to a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the ſubject of poiſons.</p>
                  <p>This deſtructive claſs of ſubſtances has been, generally, divided into the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, the vegetable and the mineral, to which ſhould be added, that much more formidable deſcription of poiſon, derived originally from the proceſs of putrefaction. Under theſe four denomination, are embraced all the ſpecies and varieties of poiſons, that have hitherto attracted the notice of philoſophers. That peſtilential and infectious diſeaſes are the reſult of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous effluvia, operating on the ſyſtem of man, is a truth, to which medical characters have long given their aſſent. An intereſting queſtion would ſeem to ariſe here, namely, to what denomination of poiſons, do theſe effluvia appear to belong? It cannot be ſuppoſed to be to the animal, the vegetable, or the mineral poiſons, becauſe theſe deleterious ſubſtances have never been known, nor even ſuſpected, to be capable of propagating themſelves. Thus, a perſon under the painful operation of an over-proportion of arſenic, or of opium, or agonized by the bite of the rattle-ſnake, is incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his diſeaſe to any of his attendants. The ſame thing may be ſaid reſpecting the morbid affections, reſulting from any ſpecies of either of the three foregoing genera of poiſons. I believe it to be a truth, that they have never been known to be, in any inſtance, communicable. The poiſon, therefor, giving birth to peſtilential and infectious diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that genus, which derives its origin from the putrefactive proceſs.</p>
                  <p>Putrefaction I would conſider as a <hi>generic</hi> term, embracing ſeveral <hi>ſpecific</hi> or at leaſt <hi>various</hi> modes, in which organized bodies undergo diſſolution, and recombination into gaſeous reſults, ſome of them of a delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or poiſonous nature. Theſe poiſonous reſult would ſeem to differ from each other, according to the varieties of the proceſs by which they were produced. Thus for example, from one particular deſcription or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the putrefactive proceſs, or, if the reader be more pleaſed with the hypotheſis, from the putrefaction of a particular deſcription of matter, originated the poiſonous offluvia or ſeeds of peſtilence; from another, thoſe of ſmall-pox, from another, thoſe of meaſles, from another, thoſe of lues venerea, &amp;c. From the foregoing principles it would appear, that all infectious diſeaſes, as the ſmall-pox and lues venerea, inſtead of being, as they have been generally ſuppoſed, the ſpecific and excluſive growth of the Eaſt, the Weſt, or of any particular climate or ſituation, may, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, originate in any inhabited portion of our globe. Nor do I conſider our own country as by any means exempt from this general charge. I believe, that the ſmall pox may originate in America or Europe, as well as in Aſia, and that the venereal diſeaſe may originate in Aſia or Europe, as well as in America. I am perſuaded that the great and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible principles, by which, the decompoſition and recompoſition of matter are governed, operate uniformly in all places, and that no ſpot on the globe is privileged with a ſpecial exemption from their influence.</p>
                  <p>I am aware, that, by ſome phyſicians, this note will be conſidered as nothing elſe than the mere child of fancy, or as the airy effuſion of a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative mina—Be it ſo—I will, however, moſt ſincerely thank ſuch ſolid and ſagacious characters, to point out to me a more probable ſource of peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential and infectious diſeaſes, than the putrefactive diſſolution of organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized bodies!</p>

and ſpread in places, where cleanlineſs has been attended to in all its branches. Whereas, on the other hand, moſt large cities, and even conſiderable tract of country, where pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying filth has been ſuffered to abound, have repeatedly experienced this ſcourge in all its malignity. Thus the plague of Egypt, unqueſtionably derives its birth from the filth ſpread around by the waters of the Nile. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of putrefying animal and vegetable ſubſtances, with which the ſtreets and ſuburbs of Conſtantinople abound, afford origin to the peſtilence, which ſo frequently viſits that unfortunate city. And the Yellow Fever or plague of the Weſt Indies, appears to be indebted, for its birth and exiſtence, entirely to the extenſive putrefactive diſſolution of organized bodies, produced by the fervors of a topical ſun.</p>
            <p>From a ſimilar ſource, namely, the filth of a crouded garriſon city, muſt we deduce the celebrated plague of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, which, to the eye of fancy, ſeems ſtill to live and rage with conſummate malignity, in the deſcriptive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Thucidides: And to cauſes preciſely ſimilar, muſt we attribute that dreadful peſtilence, which before the walls of Syracuſe, made greater havoc among the Roman legions, than even the ſtupendous engines of Archimedes— To what cauſes, I would beg leave to aſk, are we to aſcribe the more frequent and general prevalence of peſtilential diſeaſes in camps, garriſons, and other places of military eſtabliſhment? Is it not to a want of cleanlineſs?—To the immenſity of putrefying filth, with which ſuch places, for the moſt part, abound? A want of cleanlineſs, and a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035263_0038_1001B4B265880840"/>
greater expoſure of men to actual hardſhip and fatigue, are the two only circumſtances, relative to health and diſeaſe, in which military ſituations differ materially from others. To theſe circumſtances, therefore, are we bound to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the more frequent viſitations of peſtilence, to which ſuch places are unfortunately ſubjected. The former of theſe, namely, a want of cleanlineſs, gives riſe to the remote, and the other, viz. expoſure to hardſhips, acts as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſe of the malady. Let me me not, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, fail to obſerve, that when peſtilence breaks out in any place, it never fails to make its appearance about that period, when, from the uſual co-operation of phyſical cauſes, the proceſs of general putrefaction, has arrived to its ſummit.—Thus may peſtilential effluvia be generated in every ſpot on the ſurface of the globe, where the ſoil gives birth to organized bodies, and the climate affords a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of heat and moiſture, to give riſe to a high putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proceſs. There exiſt numerous proofs, ſacred, I had almoſt ſaid, as thoſe of holy writ, of peſtilence having been the native growth of many places on the continent of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Even beneath the frozen ſky of Ruſſia, has this De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon of putrefaction burſt into exiſtence, from domeſtic cauſes, and called up death and deſolation, as the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of his career.!</p>
            <p>If the foregoing propoſitions and aſſertions be true,— and confident I am, they are ſuch, as reſt on a baſis, no leſs ſecure than the experience and obſervation of ages, cemented by the faireſt deductions of reaſon—If it be true,

I ſay, that peſtilence can originate from the putrefaction of organized bodies in Europe, Aſia and Africa, what ſhadow of reaſon have we to ſuppoſe America privileged with an exemption from a ſimilar misfortune?

But to relinquiſh, for a moment, our views in theology, and addreſs you in language more ſtrictly philoſophical.—Are the atmoſphere, the waters and the organized productions of the new world, exempt from the government of the great phyſical principles, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of which, thoſe of the old are uniformly and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſubjected? Have we not, within ourſelves, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of the requiſites neceſſary for carrying putrefaction to the higheſt ſtage? When advanced to ſuch ſtage, will not this proceſs produce, with us, the very ſame deleterious effluvia to which it gives birth in other quarters of the globe? And, when once evolved, will not this effluvia ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035263_0040_1001B4C33B6A3098"/>
and propagate peſtilence here, with as much readineſs, and with as much malignity, as in countries ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Atlantic? To anſwer thoſe propoſitions in the negative, would be to deny, that the ſame phyſical cauſes, when uncontrouled in their operation, will always be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the ſame effects. As well may we ſay, that the ſame animals which propagate their likeneſs in Europe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in America; or that the ſame ſun which wakes to life the ſleeping bloſſom there, cannot rouſe it from its wintry ſlumbers here!</p>
            <p>Let not chemiſts, in the pride of their knowledge, deny, that peſtilential effluvia can be the offspring of putrefaction, becauſe they are unable to produce it in their laboratories. Let them remember, that they are not yet able to operate, in all reſpects, as nature does, nor are they poſſeſſed of any chemical teſts to aſcertain, with deciſion, where theſe efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via do and where they do not prevail. Their effects on the human body conſtitute the only indubitable teſtimony of their exiſtence; and theſe, as mentioned before, never occur to any extent, except in places abounding with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in a ſtate of putrefaction.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper, on the preſent occaſion, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that of all animal ſubſtances, the matter of human perſpiration is by no means the leaſt liable to putrefaction. After its diſcharge from the pores of the body, it would ſeem to run, with much rapidity, into this offenſive ſtate. Nor is it the moſt innocent, in its nature, when under the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035263_0041_1001B4C7D6386E48"/>
actual influence of this proceſs. There is reaſon to believe, that, from the putrefaction of the perſpirable gas, in places where numbers have been unduly crouded in ſmall, unven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated apartments, diſeaſes of a peſtilential nature have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. But, unleſs when vitiated by means of putrefaction or actual diſeaſe, I believe the matter of perſpiration to be perfectly unnoxious.</p>
            <p>The relationſhip between the <hi>American pestilence,</hi> the <hi>yellow fever,</hi> or <hi>pestilence of the West Indies,</hi> and the <hi>plague of Asia,</hi> ſhall now conſtitute the ſubject of a few remarks.</p>
            <p>From all the information I have been able to collect from obſervation, books, or converſation, reſpecting thoſe three diſeaſes, I have not been able to perceive that there exiſts between them any radical or eſſential difference. They ſeem evidently to originate from the ſame ſource, they are alike influenced by the uſual viciſitudes of the ſeaſons, they invade the human ſyſtem in the ſame manner, and are charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized, in their courſe, by the ſame train of general ſymptoms. They appear, in fact, to be the very ſame diſeaſe, modified, to a certain degree, by various cauſes, of which the moſt powerful is that of <hi>climate.</hi> This is, indeed, a cauſe, the operation of which but few things are able to reſiſt. It is well known that climate poſſeſſes a power of changing the aſpect of plants, the appearance of inferior animals, and even the figure, complexion, and countenance of the human race. Thus, how different, in all theſe reſpects, is the appearance of an Aſiatic from that of a native of Africa,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035263_0042_1001B4D10EA4EE90"/>
of Europe or America? May we not then, very rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that the ſame cauſe, which poſſeſſes ſuch an immenſe influence over plants and animals, is, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, fully competent to the modification of diſeaſe? I will venture to affirm, that there exiſts a much greater differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the general appearance of an Aſiatic, and that of an American, than between the ſymptoms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the American, and thoſe of the Aſiatic peſtilence. But the men of Aſia and America are held to be nothing more than varieties in the human race, reſulting from a difference of climate and of the ſtate of ſociety. When any inconſiderable difference, then, is diſcovered in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appearances of the peſtilential diſeaſes, by which the two countries are occaſionally invaded, it may doubtleſs be attributed to the ſame cauſes.</p>
            <p>With regard to the peſtilence of the Weſt Indies, it might, at firſt ſight, appear to be, in one reſpect, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different from the other two. Thus, we learn from phyſicians, on whoſe report we may, moſt confidently, rely, that the former diſeaſe is never, in any inſtance, known to be contagious, whereas there is, perhaps, reaſon to believe, that the caſe is different with reſpect to the two latter. That they are occaſionally propagated by contagion, is a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the truth of which phyſicians of the higheſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence have, at all times, afforded the teſtimony of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. On farther reflection, however, it will be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceived, that this trait in the character of the Weſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035263_0043_1001B4D5A4F94560"/>
India peſtilence reſults entirely from the influence of a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climate. For it is a fact, well known to phyſicians of experience and information, that a high and uniform temperature of atmoſphere, is decidedly hoſtile to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of peſtilential diſeaſes. Such a temperature, continued for ſome time, arreſts the progreſs of even the deſolating peſtilence of Aſia. It is a truth, which muſt be alike familiar to you all, that, at Conſtantinople, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer no leſs than the winter ſolſtice beſtows on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants a temporary reſpite from the ravages of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calamity.—As, then, the men of Europe, Aſia, Africa and America, are held, by our moſt eminent philoſophers, to belong to the ſame ſpecies, and to owe the diverſities in their appearance, principally, to the influence of climate and manner of life, would not a ſimilar obſervation appear to be admiſſible, with reſpect to the peſtilential epidemics of thoſe four diviſions of the globe? May not theſe diſeaſes be, very rationally, viewed as the ſame in their nature, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly modified by climate, and by the habits and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the human race?</p>
            <p>From ſubjects of ſpeculation, let us now turn our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an object, which claims, from its ſituation, the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude of us all. Let us look around on Philadelphia, which has ſo lately exhauſted the cup of calamity, and whoſe agonies, from the bitter draught, no friendly opiate has yet entirely lulled to reſt.—Let us, I ſay, ſurvey this opulent mart, this once fair and flouriſhing metropolis, and ſay, can it, or can it not, from cauſes within itſelf, give
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035263_0044_1001B4DBC739F1F0"/>
birth to a genuine peſtilential diſeaſe? To you, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have conſidered the matter with ſo much delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I need hardly obſerve, that on the juſt deciſion of this queſtion, and the ſubſequent meaſures eſtabliſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depends little leſs than the future exiſtence of our city. It merits, therefore, the moſt profound attention of every American, who is a friend to his country, or who wiſhes well to the intereſt of the human race.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the origin of our late and preceding epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics, has been already ſo amply diſcuſſed, that thoſe who take it up, at this period, can be conſidered as little elſe than gleaners in the field of controverſy. I cannot, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, cloſe my addreſs, without laying before you the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks. To ſtrike, by their novelty, is not my intention, becauſe I am ſure they are already familiar to you all. To gain your aſſent to their truth and juſtice, conſtitutes, at preſent, the height of my ambition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conſiderably remote from the breezes of the ocean, and ſtanding on a ſcite of but a moderate elevation, Philadelphia is by no means favourably ſituated for free ventilation. Theſe diſadvantages, co-operating with thoſe of numerous, lofty, and crouded buildings, produce a ſtagnation in the air of moſt parts of the city, unknown in places exempt from ſuch obſtructions. This ſtagnation is very ſenſibly, and even oppreſſively, experienced, by our citizens, during the warmth of the ſummer months. It is unneceſſary to obſerve, that an atmoſphere, ſuch as this, is in a fit ſtate
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035263_0045_1001B4E4F904B5D0"/>
for the reception and retention of noxious effluvia. Nor does it, under this evident want of motion, appear, by any means, well calculated to dilute or weaken ſuch effluvia, and thus obviate their pernicious influence on the human ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Philadelphia, though ſituated in the latitude of forty, is, notwithſtanding, annually ſubjected to all the fervors of a tropical climate, for the ſucceſſive ſpace of, at leaſt, eighty or ninety days. Suffering, during this lengthy period, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſuperior, by three or four degrees, to that of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diſeaſe. Granting, therefore, that peſtilence is the more native offspring of a tropical ſky, and that it is even incapable of ſpringing ſpontaneouſly beneath the natural temperature of a milder climate, yet ſtill, may it riſe and flouriſh luxuriantly in the hot-bed of a city as large and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as that of Philadelphia. Thus, the plants of the tropics are reared in hot-houſes by the curious, beneath the higheſt and moſt rigorous latitudes inhabited by man. In like manner may peſtilence, (though poſſibly the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural product of a tropical climate,) be reared to perfection in the hot-bed of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The two evils, which I have juſt ſpecified, are, in ſome meaſure, neceſſarily attendant on our unfortunate ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Though, by wiſdom and induſtry, they may be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, to remove them, entirely, is beyond the limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of man. Their foundation is laid in the works of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:035263_0046_1001B4EB1D682ED8"/>
and <hi>art</hi> is, therefore, incompetent to their removal. Its utmoſt extent is to obviate the miſchiefs which they tend to produce. We cannot countermand the exceſſive heats of our climate, we are unable to elevate the ground on which Philadelphia ſtands; nor can we invoke, with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the breezes of the Atlantic, to ſhed refreſhment through our oppreſſive ſtreets!<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding the above obſervations, I am perſuaded, that, by a due attention to domeſtic cleanlineſs, co-operating with ſuch port regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as will prevent veſſels containing foul air from entering our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the city of Philadelphia may be rendered as perfectly exempt from peſtilential epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ics, as any commercial city in the the world.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another evil remains yet to be mentioned, very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in its nature, from the preceding two. It is altogether of artificial birth, and art and induſtry are, therefore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to its extinction. I allude to the immenſity of filth, with which the different parts of our city and ſuburbs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. Nor is this an evil of inferior magnitude. It may be conſidered as the hydra, whoſe malignant breath, gave birth to the calamities we have three times ſuffered. The ſeverities of the ſeaſon have paraliſed it, for the preſent, and reduced it to its cuſtomary ſtate of hybernation. But unleſs prevented, by an adoption of the moſt wiſe and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic meaſures, there is but too much reaſon to apprehend, that it will be again awakened to life and action, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning warmth of the ſummer ſun! Before the arrival of that eventful period, may ſome favoured champion—ſome
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035263_0047_1001B4F2C70C90C0"/>
enterpriſing Hercules ariſe, and ſtrike from exiſtence this inſatiate monſter!</p>
            <p>In taking a ſurvey of many parts of our city and ſuburbs, our ſenſes are ſtruck by the offenſive and dangerous ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, of an accumulation of the filth of nearly a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. In paſſing, in ſeveral directions, to a conſiderable diſtance from the pavements of our ſtreets, we are not even ſuffered to tread on the ſoil of nature. We travel over artificial ground, made up of a fermenting aſſemblage of the moſt noxious materials. Here, to the depth of ſeveral inches beneath the ſurface, is promiſcuouſly blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, animal and vegetable matter, in a ſtate of high putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, while the ſame ſubſtances, in a ſimilar ſtate, are moſt plenteouſly ſtrewn over the ſurface itſelf. Nor is moiſture wanting to give vigour to the proceſs.—During the exceſſive heats of our ſummer ſolſtice, what, I would aſk, muſt be the effected of the poiſonous exhalation, ariſing from ſo extenſive a ſource, added to that proceeding from numerous other domeſtic cauſes? Muſt it not be, (to uſe the language of the poet,) the converſion of the whole atmoſphere of our city into a "foul and peſtilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of vapours?" During this portentous ſeed-time of peſtilence, we are not privileged to breathe the untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air, prepared for our ſyſtems by the operations of nature, but are obliged to inhale a mixture of deleterious exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceeding from the indolence, ignorance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention—I had almoſt ſaid, from the criminality of man.— Nor is the experience of time deviſing meaſures for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035263_0048_1001AF314F9902F0"/>
of this enormous evil, nor erecting any barriers to check its growth. Even the melancholy reverſe of this is true. Notwithſtanding the numerous declarations we hear, in favour of the cleanlineſs of our ſtreets, at preſent, compared to what exiſted ſome years ago, it is an unqueſtionable truth, that, in the exiſting ſtate of things, as year ſucceeds to year, the aggregate maſs of filth in our city and ſuburbs encreaſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">The filth taken up from our ſtreets, not excepting even that which is removed from our neceſſaries themſelves, is, at preſent, conveyed to ſuch an inconſiderable diſtance from the city, that it might almoſt as well, be ſuffered to remain in its original ſituation. Inſtead of employing ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for filling up ponds, and levelling the ground, in the ſouth-weſtern part of the city, would it not be much more wiſe and economical, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to the purpoſe of fertilizing the ground, under cultivation in the neighbourhood, where, inſtead of proving deſtructive to the life of man, the effluvia which they emit, might contribute, to rear up vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for his ſuſtenance and comfort?</note> Should our civic police, (as far as it reſpects the prevention of diſeaſe,) continue ſupine and feeble, as it is, at preſent, what a dark and gloomy proſpect is opened to our view! With the future progreſs of time, danger would ſeem to accumulate on danger, and diſtreſs to blacken over diſtreſs, till imagination becomes bewildered, in attempting to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the melancholy reſult.</p>
            <p>Owing to ſuch a ſtate of domeſtic filth, as now prevails in and around the city of Philadelphia, was the plague, in former times, the ſcourge of London, and other populous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Europe; and, owing to a ſimilar ſtate, does it ſtill
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035263_0049_1001B5021D51E3D0"/>
continue, occaſionally, to rage in Conſtantinople, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other devoted places in the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>However painful the proſpect, and however unpopular the idea, may, at preſent, be with many, it is, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of things, a truth which ought not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that unleſs the misfortune be averted, by the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and energetic meaſures of domeſtic cleanlineſs, the the large commercial cities of America will, in, perhaps, leſs than a century, become as remarkable for giving birth to peſtilence, as any ever have been in Europe, or as any are now on the continent of Aſia.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the ſources of our domeſtic filth, is not my preſent object. This has already been ably done, in ſeveral memorials from the Academy of medicine. There exiſt, however, two ſources in particular, to which, I will be pardoned for thinking, that the public attention has not been directed, in a manner ſufficiently forcible. Theſe are, the vaſt quantity of putrid and putrefying timber, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the formation of our docks and wharves, and the immenſity of animal and vegetable ſubſtances, ſtrewn, in a putrefactive ſtate, along the commons, in a ſouth-weſtern direction from the city.</p>
            <p>From the former of theſe ſources, an incalculable volume of deleterious air muſt be diſcharged, to the great annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the crews of veſſels in our harbour, and of all whoſe buſineſs demands their attendance along ſhore. For this evil the remedy is eaſy and obvious. The timbers ought to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035263_0050_1001AF4E705A47D8"/>
be removed, as much as poſſible, from the docks and wharves, and their place ſupplied by brick or ſtone.</p>
            <p>From the latter ſource, namely, the abundance of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſubſtances, diſperſed over the commons, in a <hi>south wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> direction, the air of the city moſt be deeply contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. To have a due ſenſe of the propriety and weight of this obſervation, it is neceſſary to recollect, that, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, during the months of July, Auguſt, and September, our prevailing winds are from that quarter. Whatever noxious effluvia, therefore, may be evolved from thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by the proceſs of putrefaction, is wafted, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, into the heart of our city, and mingled with the air of the ſtreets which we breathe. There is certainly reaſon to believe, that, to theſe effluvia, we were indebted, in no inconſiderable degree, for that local conſtitution of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, ſo highly favourable to the propagation of our late epidemic.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that the remedy for this evil is the immediate and entire removal of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubſtances. If the places, which thoſe matters now occupy, were planted with trees or ſhrubbery, or, even, put under a crop of inferior vegetation, the effect, on the city, would be both pleaſant and ſalutary. Vegetables are known to emit, during their wakeful and active ſtate, large quantities of pure reſpirable air. Were the above regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, therefore, adopted, inſtead of the offenſive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious vapour of putrefaction, this fluid of life, would,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035263_0051_1001AF40A2C6CD30"/>
in conſequence of the ſouth-weſtern winds of ſummer and autumn, glide through our ſtreets, and diffuſe both health and vigour from its wings.</p>
            <p>To the two preceding ſources of the vitiation of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, let me not omit to ſubjoin that which is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by our public burying grounds. To a mind eying, with deep ſolicitude, the apparently dubious balance of fate, with reſpect to the future proſperity of our city, theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive reſervoirs, fraught with the mouldering relicts of the dead, preſent themſelves, as objects of painful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They appear equally <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> and, in neither reſpect, is the degree inconſiderable. Situated, as ſome of them are, in the very centre of our city, theſe ſpacious incloſures, a great part of the ſoil of which, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of human exuviae, cannot do otherwiſe than aid in contaminating the air of our ſtreets, and the water of our pumps. That the water of our city is injured, by the immenſity of dead bodies, depoſited in our grave-yards, we would infer, from the very conſiderable diſtance, to which the putrid effluvia, from the contents of a grave, have been known to make their way, through the bowels of the earth. And, that the ſame cauſe, has a tendency to vitiate our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, we would conclude, in particular, from certain phyſical phenomena, for which ancient grave-yards have been always remarkable. The phenonema, to which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude are, a kind of burning meteors, that ſweep along the ſurface of the ground, and which are known, under the vulgar denomination of Will-with-the-wiſp, or Jack-with-the-lanthern.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035263_0052_1001B512FB99F328"/>
Theſe would ſeem to owe their exiſtence, principally, to an inflammable gas, diſcharged, through the pores of the earth, from the putrefying contents of the graves, and have, probably, aided much, in giving origin to the ſuperſtitious legends of the ignorant, reſpecting church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards being haunted, by goblins and ghoſts.</p>
            <p>For this evil, I need hardly obſerve, that the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, the removal of our burying grounds, to a diſtance from the city. Nor let an attachment and veneration, however natural and amiable, for the relicts of our friends, prevent the adoption of ſuch a ſalutary meaſure! If we painfully feel and deplore the loſs of our <hi>friends deceased,</hi> why diſpoſe of their bodies, in ſuch a way, as to ſow the ſeeds of peſtilence and death, among thoſe that ſurvive, and thus, voluntarily, ſubject ourſelves to additional ſorrow? To a feeling and reflecting mind, it is, doubtleſs, a much more eligible alternative, to have a portion of our relatives and friends ſtill living, and thoſe that are dead, buried in a diſtant ſituation, and, even, in what ſome might conſider as unhallowed ground, than to have them all ſwept off, though buried in the immediate vicinity of our dwellings, and in ground duly conſecrated for the purpoſe of interment.</p>
            <p>On taking the preceding general view of the ſituation and circumſtances of Philadelphia—On conſidering it as a large and populous city, deprived of the advantage of free ventilation, ſubjected, during the ſummer months, to a heat equal, at leaſt, to that of the tropics, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exhalation, from the putrefactive diſſolution of organized bodies.—On ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely weighing, I ſay the foregoing conſiderations, and, at the ſame time, recollecting, that, under ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, peſtilential diſeaſes have, unqueſtionably, arisen in other places, what ſhadow of reaſon have we to doubt the practicability of peſtilence originating in our city, from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic cauſes alone? As well may we aſſert, that the ſame ſun, which promotes vegetation, in the eaſtern, has no ſuch influence in the weſtern hemiſphere, as deny to cauſes, which are known and acknowledged to give birth to peſtilence, in the cities of Aſia, the power of producing the ſame diſeaſe, when operating, with equal force, in the cities of America. Could I be perſuaded, that, under ſimilar circumſtances, the ſame cauſes, do not, uniformly and neceſſarily, produce the ſame effects in Aſia and America, I would, immediately, ſubſcribe to the Pagan belief of Polytheiſm. In ſuch a ſtate of things, I would be conſtrained to believe, that the God of the old world, was not, in like manner, the God of the new, but that the two hemiſpheres of our globe, were governed by diſtinct Deities, through the medium of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent phyſical laws!</p>
            <p>I have, hitherto, treated my ſubject in a manner rather abſtract and general, and have indulged myſelf, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in diſcuſſive ſpeculation. I have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, on principles long ſince known and eſtabliſhed, the practicability of peſtilential diſeaſes originating on the weſtern ſhores of the Atlantic. from general reaſoning,

Thus, might I advert to the hiſtory of a far diſtant period, and ſhew, from authentic records, that, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to the eſtabliſhment of any commercial intercourſe, between America and the Weſt Indies, even the depth of our foreſts were unable to ſhelter the aborigines of our own country, from the invaſion of peſtilence. I might point to our extenſive north weſtern lakes, and the country adjacent, where peſtilential epidemics not unfrequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with high malignity, and where, at the ſame time, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intercourſe is altogether unknown. But leaving former times, and remote places, I might proceed to ſhew, that, within a few years paſt, and, in places not far diſtant, numerous inſtances of the American peſtilence have appeared, which could not poſſibly be traced to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with a foreign climate or infected ſource, and which muſt have, therefore, originated in the very place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before concluding my addreſs, allow me, Gentlemen, to congratulate you on the ſucceſs, I had almoſt ſaid, the <hi>triumph</hi> of the principles, which the Academy advocates, reſpecting the origin of the late epidemics of America. To ſay, that theſe diſeaſes are of domeſtic growth, is no longer denounced as medical hereſy, nor as a ſpecies of blaſphemy againſt our

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Of thoſe phyſicians, who advocate the opinion, that the diſeaſe, in queſtion, is neceſſarily of foreign origin, there are but very few, who are not conſiderably advanced in years. This, on firſt view, might appear to be an evidence, of ſome degree of reſpectability, in favour of the authenticity and truth of the opinion. The force of this evidence, however, will be much diminiſhed, when we recollect, that almoſt the only medical charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in Great Britain, who oppoſed the truth of Harvey's diſcovery of the circulation of the blood, and blindly adhered to the antiquated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd error of its flux and reflux through the ſame channels, were ſuch as bad, at the time of the diſcovery, paſſed the fortieth year of their age.
