            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THAT the following oration may lead to no mi≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the opinion I entertain, re≈øpecting the actual origin of our late epidemics, I beg leave to introduce it to the notice of my fellow-citizens, by a few preliminary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I do not believe that, either, in the years ninety three, ninety ≈øeven, or ninety eight, the American pe≈øtilence was exclu≈øively of dome≈øtic origin. I am per≈øuaded that, on each of tho≈øe occa≈øions, a very powerful cau≈øe of this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, was introduced into Philadelphia, through the channel of commerce. I do not, however, with ≈øome phy≈øicians, conceive, that this cau≈øe was introduced in the form of <hi>human contagion,</hi> generated in the di≈øea≈øed bodies of men, but in that of <hi>foul air,</hi> re≈øulting from the putrid balla≈øt, or damaged cargoes of ve≈ø≈øels. Nor have I, on enquiry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nd rea≈øon to believe, that there exi≈øts, on record, a ≈øingle well authenticated in≈øtance, of the di≈øea≈øe in que≈øtion, having, ever, in the former method, been introduced into any part
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035263_0005_1001B3DDD7D67E48"/>
of the United States. As often as commerce has borne a part in giving birth to this di≈øea≈øe, in any of our ≈øeaports, it does not appear to have been through the in≈øtrumentality of <hi>human contagion,</hi> imported from the Ea≈øt or We≈øt Indies, from the Levant, or the ≈øhores of Africa; but, as lately in this place, through that of pe≈øtiferous air, generated by the putrefactive di≈ø≈øolution of the cargoes or balla≈øt of ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels at ≈øea. Nor is it a matter of the ≈ømalle≈øt import, from what quarter of the globe the≈øe cargoes come. Provided, they be of a putrefiable nature, and arrive in our ports, during the inten≈øity of our ≈øummer heats, (but, particularly, between the middle of July and la≈øt of September,) it is wholly immaterial whether they be the native productions of Europe, of A≈øia, of Africa, or of the We≈øt India I≈ølands. And it is equally immaterial, from which of the≈øe places they are immediately imported. The ≈øu≈øpen≈øion, therefore, of commercial intercour≈øe, during certain months in the year, with the We≈øt India I≈ølands alone, would be a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure wholly inadequate to the prevention of this di≈øea≈øe. Were ≈øuch ≈øu≈øpen≈øion adopted by the Government of the Union, it ≈øhould, unque≈øtionably, extend to all parts of the globe, from which putrefiable cargoes may be imported. But ≈øuch an impolitic mea≈øure, ≈øugge≈øts at once ≈øufficient cau≈øe for its immediate rejection, as it is evidently pregnant with nothing le≈øs than ab≈øolute ruin to the commerce of our country.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I have not found ≈øufficient cau≈øe to believe, that, without the co-operation of foul air, from the ve≈ø≈øels at our wharves, the American pe≈øtilence would have become
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035263_0006_1001B3E580F45E98"/>
               <hi>epidemic,</hi> in our city, in either of the years, to which I have alluded. I have even gone ≈øo far as to flatter my≈øelf, with a belief, that, in the pre≈øent ≈øtate of our city, ≈øuch co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to its epidemic prevalence. In this belief, however, I am, by no means, confirmed. Perhaps, even now, the filth of our city and ≈øuburbs has accumulated to a ≈øufficient height, to give to pe≈øtilence an epidemic rage. In ninety three, I had not completed my medical ≈øtudies, and can, therefore, ≈øay nothing re≈øpecting the immediate ≈øource of particular ca≈øes, that might have occurred in the city during that year. But I he≈øitate not to ≈øay, with as much confidence, as I ought to u≈øe, in ≈øpeaking on any ≈øpeculative ≈øubject in phy≈øics, that, in ninety ≈øeven and ninety eight, I ≈øaw, my≈øelf, ≈øeveral ca≈øes of the di≈øea≈øe in que≈øtion, which mu≈øt have nece≈ø≈øarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted from the operation of dome≈øtic cau≈øes. I am further confident, that many ca≈øes of a ≈øimilar nature, were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ≈øome of my medical friends. If, then, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent ≈øources of our city, ≈øolitary, or (to ≈øpeak in medical language) ≈øporadic ca≈øes of pe≈øtilence may now occur, how melancholy is our pro≈øpect, ≈øhould the filth in our city and ≈øuburbs, be ≈øuffered to accumulate with the progre≈øs of time! Of ≈øuch an accumulation mu≈øt not an epidemic be finally the offspring?</p>
            <p>But let us, even, for a moment, admit, that not a ≈øingle ca≈øe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> the epidemics of ninety three, ninety ≈øeven, or nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight, originated from the exclu≈øive operation of dome≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic cau≈øes. Still, it is a po≈øition, which no one will venture
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035263_0007_1001B3EDB501FDF8"/>
to deny, that their rapid and exten≈øive propagation, was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ≈øome peculiarity in the atmo≈øphere of our city. This inference we draw from the <hi>very few</hi> in≈øtances, in which, the pe≈øtilence, under con≈øideration, was propagated by contagion when taken from the city to the unadulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated atmo≈øphere of the country.</p>
            <p>Were the atmo≈øphere of Philadelphia pre≈øerved in purity, by a due degree of attention to dome≈øtic cleanline≈øs, and by preventing ve≈ø≈øels, charged with foul air, from entering our port, pe≈øtilence, as an epidemic, would never again occur, to ≈øwell the catalogue of our future misfortunes.‚Äî In ≈øuch a ≈øtate of things, ≈øporadic ca≈øes of the di≈øea≈øe might, <hi>possibly,</hi> originate with our≈øelves, and might, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtionably, be introduced from di≈øtant places; but the evil would terminate with the death or recovery of tho≈øe fir≈øt attacked, and would never ≈øpread, to the di≈øtre≈øs of our citizens, and the depopulation of our city. The baleful plant, though fairly ingrafted on our ≈øy≈øtems, would lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh, wither, and die for want of nouri≈øhment!</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thus, whatever principles, I may advocate, with re≈øpect to the practicability of pe≈øtilence originating and exi≈øting, as an epidemic, in our city, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, from the exclu≈øive operation of dome≈øtic cau≈øes, I believe this to be an event, which has never yet occurred, Commerce appears to have been, at all times, ju≈øtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with part of the calamity, that has never failed, to accompany this wor≈øt of evils. The epidemic train would ≈øeem to have been, always, laid in our atmo≈øphere, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035263_0008_1001AE61C30A07C8"/>
of the ≈øummer-≈øun on the filth of our city and ≈øuburbs, while immen≈øe volumes of foul air, di≈øcharged from the holds of ve≈ø≈øels at our wharves, ≈øerved as the ≈øpark to rou≈øe it into flame. Had not the train exi≈øted, the ≈øpark would have expired without effect, and had not the ≈øpark been applied, the train would have lain dormant, and, perhaps never bur≈øt into actual explo≈øion‚ÄîIf, then, by the de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either of the≈øe, we might acquire an exemption from the inevitable effects of their co-operation, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the one, and the prevention of the other, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come doubly ≈øecure again≈øt the calamities, to which they give origin.</p>
            <p>I hope I will be indulged in attempting, by another ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, a farther illu≈øtration of the above intricate and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øting ≈øubject. With this view, I would compare the ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer atmo≈øphere of our city, deeply contaminated by putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from dome≈øtic ≈øources, to a ma≈øs of pa≈øte or dough, duly kneaded, and prepared to undergo the proce≈øs of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In this ≈øtate of things, the yea≈øt, or leven, calculated and intended to give actual birth to this proce≈øs, not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repre≈øents the foul air i≈ø≈øuing from the holds of ve≈ø≈øels at our wharves, and mixing, in abundance, with our viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated atmo≈øphere. As the operation of the ferment is well known to be, that of a≈ø≈øimilating to it≈øelf, the ma≈øs into which it is introduced, ≈øuch would ≈øeem to be the effect of the deleterious air di≈øcharged along our wharves. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to the atmo≈øphere of our city, <hi>perhaps,</hi> by a peculiar ≈øpecies of fermentation, its own pe≈øtilential and
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035263_0009_1001B3FA0136D638"/>
de≈øtructive properties.

            <opener>
               <signed>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,</signed>
            </opener>
            <p>IN ri≈øing to addre≈øs you on the pre≈øent occa≈øions my feelings impel me to a two-fold acknowledgment‚ÄîAn acknowledgment for the unexpected honour, with which I have been di≈øtingui≈øhed, in your appointing me to prepare and deliver the fir≈øt of the ≈øemiannual addre≈ø≈øes enjoined by our con≈øtitution; and a mo≈øt cordial acknowledgment for the liberal indulgence, which I experienced from you, on a former occa≈øion, when indi≈øpo≈øition interfered, and, by fru≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating my attempt to comply with my engagement, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, for the time, the expectations of the Academy.</p>
            <p>Would that I could ≈øuffer my exordium to terminate here! But circum≈øtances forbid that this ≈øhould be the ca≈øe. The plea≈øure of <hi>acknowledgment</hi> I mu≈øt now exchange for the ta≈øk of <hi>apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035263_0011_1001B409580D3DE8"/>In behalf of the following performance, I would addre≈øs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, not to that rigid, unaccommodating ju≈øtice in critici≈øm, which I have rea≈øon to believe mo≈øt of you have at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but to that forbearance and clemency, of which, I, am well a≈ø≈øured, you are all po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed. I mu≈øt ≈øolicit you to extend to the ≈øub≈øequent oration, ≈øome ≈øhare of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, with which, on various occa≈øions, you have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Orator. Let me not be di≈øappointed in flattering my≈øelf, that the u≈øual benevolence of your natures will throw, at lea≈øt, ≈øome ≈øhadow of palliation over ≈øuch faults as the clearne≈øs of your under≈øtandings will inevitably di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and the ju≈øtne≈øs of your ≈øentiments oblige you to condemn.</p>
            <p>Suffer it to operate in mitigation of your impending ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when I a≈ø≈øure you, that the following addre≈øs was prepared and numerous avocations, of a nature more than u≈øually unfavourable to ≈øucce≈øs in compo≈øition. But ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I have more‚Äîmuch more, to expect from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous liberality of your minds, than from the humble me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of my own defence, I will no longer addre≈øs you in the language of apology. Part of the imperfections of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am about to deliver, ari≈øe no le≈øs from want of abilities, than from want of lei≈øure. A portion of the cen≈øure mu≈øt, therefore, in ju≈øtice, re≈øt on your≈øelves, for not having been more circum≈øpect in your choice of an orator.</p>
            <p>It was my intention to have paid in this place, a pa≈ø≈øing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the memory of our two decea≈øed friends and fellow-members, Dr. Sayre and Dr. Cooper. I had even prepared
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035263_0012_1001B40DED818940"/>
my≈øelf for the di≈øcharge of this mournful duty. Impre≈ø≈øed by re≈øpect for the talents and learning, and by ≈øentiments of e≈øteem and friend≈øhip for the numerous virtues of tho≈øe two medical philo≈øophers, I was unwilling to neglect ≈øo fair an opportunity of expre≈ø≈øing my ≈øen≈øe of their di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed worth. Being ≈øuperceded however, in this duty, by a very judicious and re≈øpectful appointment of the Academy, for the expre≈øs purpo≈øe of doing ju≈øtice to their memories, I ≈øhall pa≈øs in ≈øilence over the melancholy ≈øubject. But when the name of Cooper, in particular, is mentioned, to ≈øuffer oblivious ≈øilence to u≈øurp the place of de≈øcriptive and ju≈øt eulogium, is, with me, no incon≈øiderable effort of ≈øelf-re≈øtraint. On ≈øuch an occa≈øion my feelings would prompt me to a far different conduct. As I have ever ranked the acqui≈øition of the friend≈øhip of this gentleman among the mo≈øt fortunate occurrences of my life, it will not be thought ≈øtrange, that I ≈øhould feel an inclination to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute my mite to the immen≈øe trea≈øure of re≈øpect, which his numerous acquaintance will pay to his memory. But an indulgence of my feelings on this occa≈øion, would lead to an unwarrantable digre≈ø≈øion from what I propo≈øe as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ≈øubject of my addre≈øs.</p>
            <p>In≈øtead of attempting, therefore, to cheri≈øh in your brea≈øts a kind, but unavailing ≈øorrow for the dead, allow me to ≈øolicit your attention to a few general ob≈øervations relative to the origin of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes. I ≈øhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confine my remarks and ≈øpeculations more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the origin of that di≈øea≈øe, who≈øe ravages and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035263_0013_1001B4140F9E0818"/>
terrors, have thrice, of late, reduced the gay and crouded ≈øtreets of our city to a di≈ømal ≈øcene of de≈øolation and ≈øolitude.</p>
            <p>As my ≈øubject is, evidently, very exten≈øive and copious, ≈øhould I even engro≈øs a little more of your time than you at pre≈øent anticipate, I hope you will bear, with a patient indulgence, the unintentional but unavoidable tre≈øpa≈øs.</p>
            <p>It is, in this place, worthy of remark, that <hi>Pestilence</hi> has been, at all times, treated by the world, as an illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate child, without an acknowledged parent‚Äîin other words, as a plant perfectly exotic as to every inhabited ≈øoil and climate‚Äîor as a phy≈øical evil, exi≈øting in almo≈øt every region, yet (≈øtrange incon≈øi≈øtency!) originating in none!</p>
            <p>It is a fact not more ≈øingular than true, that, there is not to be found in the whole range of the globe, a ≈øingle country, which is acknowledged by its own inhabitants, to be the immediate birth-place of pe≈øtilence. When this dreadful ≈øcourge makes its appearance in any place, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver favourable, from climate and local cau≈øes, to its dome≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic generation, its exi≈øtence never fails to be attributed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>introduction</hi> by land, or <hi>importation</hi> by ≈øea, from ≈øome foreign country. As it, for the mo≈øt part, appears fir≈øt in large commercial cities, the latter of the≈øe is mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly con≈øidered as the channel of its conveyance. Hence the evils of pe≈øtilence have been generally charged to the account of commerce. Thus, when the plague prevails in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035263_0014_1001B41A971F9228"/>
any part of Europe, it is uniformly a≈ø≈øerted to have been imported in merchandize from A≈øia. When it breaks out in the latter place, where it not unfrequently depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates towns and villages, and, occa≈øionally, lays even whole countries wa≈øte, it is always traced, or what, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent and unthinking natives, amounts to the ≈øame thing, is ≈øuppo≈øed to be traced to ≈øome communication with the continent of Africa. But the hardy ≈øons of this burning climate, ≈øpurn, with indignation, what they con≈øider not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an in≈øult to the healthfulne≈øs, but al≈øo as an injury to the pro≈øperity of their country, and contend, that the plague is never generated with them, but is always intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from ≈øome di≈øtant quarter. Nor is this ob≈øtinate ≈øpirit of reluctance in the human race to admit pe≈øtilence to be a native of the ≈øame ≈øoil and climate with them≈øelves, confined to the continent of the old world. But five years ago, the ≈øame thing might have been ≈øaid with re≈øpect to mo≈øt of the inhabitants of the United States. Few of them could then be induced to believe, that the we≈øtern ≈øhores of the Atlantic could po≈ø≈øibly give birth to a pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential di≈øea≈øe. They ≈øeemed to ≈øuppo≈øe, that a phy≈øical evil of ≈øuch a magnitude, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be the growth of a foregn climate, not ≈øo highly favoured by heaven as their own.</p>
            <p>To you, Gentlemen, it is ≈øcarcely nece≈ø≈øary for me to ob≈øerve, that this unwillingne≈øs in mankind to acknowledge pe≈øtilence to be a native of the ≈øame country with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, ≈øhould be viewed as an inveterate prejudice, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035263_0015_1001B422472BA9B0"/>
like all other prejudices, by the two gothic pillars of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>error.</hi> It requires no uncommon depth of logic to prove, that pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, having an exi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, mu≈øt have al≈øo a place of origin; and, that this place, mu≈øt be in ≈øome of the inhabited parts of the earth. But ≈øo extraordinary and ab≈øurd is the prejudice, of which I have ≈øpoken, that it literally denies the≈øe di≈øea≈øes to have originated in any place. Taking the ≈øentiments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, on this ≈øubject, for our guide, we would find a ≈øearch after the real birth-place of pe≈øtilence equally abortive with the poet's ≈øearch after the North, which he ≈øo energetically repre≈øents in the following lines.
<q>
                  <l>But where th' extreme of vice was ne'er agreed;</l>
                  <l>A≈øk, Where's the North? at York 'tis on the Tweed;</l>
                  <l>In Scotland, at the Orcades, and there,</l>
                  <l>At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where!</l>
               </q>
So it is with re≈øpect to the birth-place of pe≈øtilence. In America it is in the We≈øt-Indies; in the We≈øt-Indies, it is, at one time, at Siam in the Ea≈øt-Indies; and again at Boulam in Africa; while, at the≈øe places, it is ≈øtill farther to the <hi>east</hi> as if the ri≈øing was capable of exalting the poi≈øon of putrefaction to higher malignity than even the mid-day ≈øun. Were not the ≈øubject too ≈øerious to be treated as a je≈øt, I would farther ≈øay, that this ≈øingular ab≈øurdity, in mo≈øt men, with re≈øpect to the birth-place of pe≈øtilence, brings to my recollection the humourous ≈øtory of Gold≈ømith's pauper, who, in que≈øt of the real or acknowledged place of his birth,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035263_0016_1001AEA3CB61FC78"/>
(the place where, by the municipal regulations of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he was entitled to a ≈øub≈øi≈øtance for life,) was carted about from pari≈øh to pari≈øh, till, to u≈øe the poor fellow's own words, he "thought in his ≈øoul, they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he had been born in any pari≈øh at all."</p>
            <p>Let us, for a moment, trace this prejudice through all its windings to its fountain head. It ≈øprings from the bo≈øom of <hi>self-love.</hi> This real though ≈øecret principle of all our ≈øentiments, opinions, and actions, will not ≈øuffer us to admit, that we our≈øelves can be the ≈øource of any thing evil, or of any thing di≈øa≈øtrous. From our≈øelves we are inclined to extend this favourable opinion to our friends, acquaintance, and countrymen; and from them, to the air which we breathe, the ≈øoil which gave us birth, and even to the waters which variegate the land≈øcapes that ≈øurround us. The ≈øame ≈øelfi≈øh principles‚Äîthe ≈øame contracted ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which led the reprobate Jews of old to exclaim, "Can any thing good come out of Galilee" induces the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but, in ≈øome re≈øpects, not much more enlightened, moderns to a≈øk, can any thing evil originate in our beloved country?</p>
            <p>This prejudice, re≈øpecting the origin of pe≈øtilential di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes, derives no incon≈øiderable ≈øupport from the operation of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> but powerful principle of ≈øelf-intere≈øt. We are apprehen≈øive, that ≈øhould our country be characterized as the birth-place of pe≈øtilence, ≈øuch an opinion would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035263_0017_1001AE92E918A140"/>
prove injurious to its population and pro≈øperity, and that, con≈øequently our intere≈øts as individuals mu≈øt ≈øuffer. This however, is a mi≈øtaken fear. General <hi>truth</hi> and general <hi>utility</hi> are ≈øworn friends, and in≈øeparable companions. Nor are they more ≈øo, in any in≈øtance, than in that which claims our pre≈øent attention. The ≈øame enlightened views in ≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which declare, that pe≈øtilence may originate among our≈øelves, afford us, at the ≈øame time, the mo≈øt firm and con≈øolatory a≈ø≈øurance, that we have in our own hands the means of prevention and ≈øafety. Nor is this our only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation. Were phy≈øical truth, on this ≈øubject, fully evolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would ≈øet mo≈øt, if not all countries and climates, nearly on a level with re≈øpect to the origin of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes. For I am per≈øuaded that there exi≈øts not a ≈øpot on the ≈øurface of the globe, which may not, under certain, circum≈øtances, become capable of giving birth to the≈øe wa≈øteful epidemics.</p>
            <p>I beg it may not, from the foregoing ob≈øervations, be under≈øtood, that I mean, on the ≈øubject of the origin of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, to accu≈øe the whole human race of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and error. Far from it‚ÄîThere have, at all times, exi≈øted many di≈øtingui≈øhed in≈øtances of exemption from ≈øuch a charge. There have, in all ages, and in all countries, exi≈øted men, who, in oppo≈øition to an overbearing torrent of popular prejudice and indignation, have boldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the di≈øea≈øes in que≈øtion to have been the offspring of the places where they have ≈øpread de≈øolation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035263_0018_1001B434AD602A48"/>This is well known to have been formerly the ca≈øe, in London and Mar≈øeilles, during the unparalelled calamities inflicted by pe≈øtilence on tho≈øe two ancient and populous cities. Nor was it of late, le≈øs remarkably the ca≈øe in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the United States, but more particularly in the city of Philadelphia. When the Yellow Fever (which might with more propriety have been denominated the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican pestilence)</hi> made its appearance in this city in the autumn of ninety three, to have ≈øaid that it was a di≈øea≈øe of dome≈øtic origin, was con≈øidered as an unfounded ≈ølander on our climate, and the man, who dared to advocate ≈øuch an opinion, was viewed in the light of an enemy to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               </gap> on a tropical region, as the only place capable of giving birth to ≈øuch an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtable malady. To this blindfold ≈øtate of the public mind, there fortunately exi≈øted ≈øome degree of exception. Amid the general gloom of ignorance and error, by which we were over≈øhadowed, there appeared, even then, a few twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ≈øtars, the joyous harbingers of a brighter day. The dawn of that day has already reached us, and we have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rea≈øon to believe, that we will very ≈øhortly be wrapt in its full meridian.</p>
            <p>The opinion, that our late epidemic mu≈øt be nece≈ø≈øarily imported to us from a tropical climate, will ≈øoon become as unpopular as it was once exten≈øive. Already is it greatly circum≈øcribed in its limits‚ÄîAlready is it confined almo≈øt entirely to tho≈øe, who were originally active and clamorous
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035263_0019_1001B43948CD18F8"/>
in its ≈øupport. By ≈øuch characters we are not to expect that it will be immediately abandoned. They have already pledged them≈øelves to the world for its ≈øupport, and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, therefore, its fate as in ≈øome mea≈øure interwoven with the fate of their own characters, as philo≈øophers in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Like a parent, with all his tenderne≈øs awakened by the approaching di≈ø≈øolution of a beloved child, they will cling to it with the greater fondne≈øs, the more nearly they ≈øee it about to expire. But expire it will, nor can all the partial and ≈øtudied efforts of its ≈øupporters prolong its fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exi≈øtence. Like the <hi>old</hi> ≈øy≈øtem of chemi≈øtry tottering before the <hi>new,</hi> it mu≈øt finally ≈øink beneath the doctrine of dome≈øtic generation, nor will it find, among all its advocates, a Prie≈øtly to appear great and un≈øhaken in the mid≈øt of its ruins!</p>
            <p>We have already ob≈øerved, that in all parts of the world, and in all periods of ≈øociety, mankind, in general, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and exhibited a mo≈øt profound ho≈øtility again≈øt the opinion of their own country being, under any circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the birth-place of pe≈øtilence. Nor has the matter end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. They have been ≈øolicitous and active to defend, not only their own immediate country, but even our whole globe, from the charge of giving origin to an evil of ≈øuch magnitude. Whenever this di≈øea≈øe has appeared, they have, like many phy≈øicians and citizens of the United States, been extremely anxious and indu≈øtrious to trace it to ≈øome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ≈øpecies of importation. It may not be altogether u≈øele≈øs nor unintere≈øting, to trace the many ≈øingular and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035263_0020_1001AEA241386C78"/>
modifications, through which this opinion, of the <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign importation</hi> of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, has ≈øucce≈ø≈øively pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>In the earlie≈øt ages of the world, when ignorance and ≈øuper≈øtition led men to attribute all extraordinary pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena to the direct agency of ≈øupernatural beings, pe≈øtilence was ≈øuppo≈øed to be imported immediately from Heaven. This is the opinion which appears to have prevailed among the ancient Hebrews, and may be ranked at the head of the catalogue of ab≈øurdities on this ≈øubject. The domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prejudice over the minds of that ignorant and ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people, appears in this in≈øtance particularly ≈øtriking. Such was the depth of their blind bigotry in favour of the healthfulne≈øs of the globe they inhabited, that they would ≈øeem to have con≈øidered it as even ≈øuperior to that of the cele≈øtial regions. Hence, unwilling, to believe that their favourite earth could give origin to an evil ≈øo dreadful as pe≈øtilence, they imported the ≈øeeds of this calamity from the more unhealthful climate of heaven!!</p>
            <p>Another ≈øpecies of <hi>importation</hi> no le≈øs extraordinary than the former, is that which derived pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes from the ≈øun. An opinion of this kind appears to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, re≈øpecting the origin of that pe≈øtilence, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolated the Grecian camp before the walls of Troy.</p>
            <p>Another de≈øcription of importation from di≈øtant worlds remains yet to be mentioned. During that period of error,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035263_0021_1001B44596CCF5B8"/>
in which the ≈øcience of medicine, in common with mo≈øt other branches of ≈øcience, was deeply perverted by a≈øtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical notions, not one of the planets (our own perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted!) e≈øcaped the charge of giving origin to pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes. Thus Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, may all be found arraigned in the dark catalogue. Nor did the moon her≈øelf e≈øcape. Even the celebrated, but fanciful Paracel≈øus, boldly accu≈øed this fair luminary, as being the parent of deadly pe≈øtilence.‚ÄîHad nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øly to this period of intellectual perver≈øion, by a happy effort, rai≈øed up a Her≈øchel, to ≈øoar, an a≈øtronomical Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, through the immen≈øity of ≈øpace, there is little doubt, but that the orb, which now bears his name, would, even from its di≈øtant bourne, have been called to the narrow bar of human prejudice, to an≈øwer to the charge of having been the birth-place and nur≈øery of the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe!</p>
            <p>In ≈øupport of the foregoing opinions, however irrational and ab≈øurd in the view of a more enlightened age, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ance≈øtors appear to have acted in concert. Such was their blind partiality in favour of the world they inhabited, that they could not, for a moment, admit the belief of its ever giving ri≈øe to true pe≈øtilence. At length, however, were they forced to abandon the ground they had originally taken‚ÄîAt length was this extraordinary meta≈øti≈øis of error obliged to relinqui≈øh entirely the heavenly bodies, and fix on earth as its final retreat. At this period men became divided in their opinion, re≈øpecting the origin of the evil in que≈øtion. Obliged to acknowledge it as a native of our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035263_0022_1001AEB4A255EAC0"/>
own globe, they commenced a zealous ≈øearch for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ≈øoil and climate from which it ≈øprang. Here it was that their opinions became ho≈øtile. Each one de≈øirous of pre≈øerving, in purity, the character of his own country, charged the birth of pe≈øtilence to the country of another. Nor has the controver≈øy as yet ≈øub≈øided. We have ≈øeen very evident traces of it in the re≈øearches of men after the origin of that malignant pe≈øtilence, by which we have, lately, been three times vi≈øited. Thus, in America, the We≈øt India I≈ølands were, at fir≈øt, con≈øidered as its birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. Some phy≈øicians, in the We≈øt Indies, on the other hand, attribute its prevalence there to importation from the coa≈øt of Africa. While, no doubt, the hardy African will retort the charge, and ≈øay, that they are indebted, for this di≈øea≈øe, to the lawle≈øs intru≈øion of white men on their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ≈øhores. Thus we ≈øee that the ≈øame illiberal ≈øpirit of prejudice which, in the earlier ages of the world, induced our forefathers to attribute the origin of pe≈øtilence to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the ≈øun, the moon, and the various planetary bodies, ≈øtill continues, though under a different form, among their more highly favoured po≈øterity. They went to di≈øtant worlds in que≈øt of the origin of this di≈øea≈øe, whereas we re≈øt ≈øatisfied with ≈øhorter excur≈øions, and travel only to di≈øtant countries!</p>
            <p>I have called that prejudice, which leads to remote parts of the globe, in que≈øt of the origin of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, an illiberal one; nor am I at all inclined to retract the epithet. I think it narrow and illiberal, becau≈øe it frequently urges

men on to defend the character of their own climate and country, at the expence of that of other places, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has favoured with equal advantages. As formerly ob≈øerved, the very ≈øame principle of illiberality which leads us to deny, to other portions of the globe, the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of advantages and excellencies which they undoubtedly hold, induces us al≈øo to load them with the imputation of evils, from which they an wholly exempt. This is a principle which the enlightened Americans ≈øhould indignantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. From its undue operation, in the minds of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, they them≈øelves have already ≈øuffered much. There was a time when America was con≈øidered, by mo≈øt Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, as capable of giving birth to but little that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable. And ≈øhall we, now, actuated by the ≈øame narrow principle, and governed by the ≈øame circum≈øcribed views, contend, that it can give origin to nothing embraced in the catalogue of evils? I flatter my≈øelf with a confidence that we never will. For though proud and happy in the belief, that the wi≈ødom and ≈øpirit of Americans will be at all times competent and prompt to defend our country and its character from every de≈øcription of in≈øult and inju≈øtice, I ≈øhould yet be ≈øorry and humiliated at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ≈øelfi≈øh national ≈øpirit, inclining us to the defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other countries, for the illiberal purpo≈øe of adding a ≈øuperior lu≈øtre to our own!</p>
            <p>From arguments to be laid before you in a ≈øub≈øequent part of this addre≈øs, it will I tru≈øt appear, that America is,

equally with other parts of the world, capable of giving birth to the wor≈øt of di≈øea≈øes.</p>
            <p>With re≈øpect to the opinion, that our late pe≈øtilence is nece≈ø≈øarily imported from the We≈øt Indies, it is with plea≈øure I ob≈øerve, that its relinqui≈øhment has already very evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commenced. Even ≈øome of its mo≈øt ≈øtrenuous advocates have found it nece≈ø≈øary, in attempting its defence, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don entirely their original ground.

This however, con≈øtitutes no longer an article in their medical creed. They are now willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the ≈øeeds of the di≈øea≈øe may be brought, not only under the form of <hi>human contagion,</hi> but al≈øo under that of <hi>foul air,</hi> produced by a high ≈øtate of putrefaction in the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel's balla≈øt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Indulge me, for a few moments, in a detail of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments, which induce me to con≈øider our pe≈øtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al di≈øea≈øes as the genuine offspring of our own country.</p>
            <p>Pe≈øtilence can become epidemic only, when aided by a concurrent con≈øtitution of Atmo≈øphere. This po≈øition is founded on the collective experience of ages. Where ≈øuch a con≈øtitution does not prevail, ≈øporadic ca≈øes of pe≈øtilence may indeed occur, but they will again di≈øappear, and leave ≈øurrounding individuals unhurt. The nature of that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ≈øtate of atmo≈øphere, favourable to the propagation of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, has hitherto eluded the re≈øearches of philo≈øophers. The reality of its exi≈øtence, however, is ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently e≈øtabli≈øhed from the obvious effects to which it gives ri≈øe. Though ridiculed, of late, by ≈øome phy≈øicians, under the denomination of an <hi>occult</hi> quality, rea≈øon and ob≈øervation ≈øtill declare it to be a quality re≈øting, for the certainty of its exi≈øtence, on evidence as ≈øub≈øtantial, as that which ≈øupports the great Newtonian principle, the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all terre≈øtrial bodies.</p>

In ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the≈øe two latter opinions, ≈øome degree of evidence is derived from the circum≈øtance of the prevalence of pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, being very often either preceded or accompanied by the occurrence of earth-quakes, or by repeated and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful volcanic eruptions. Of the frequent and ≈øtriking coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence, both in point of time and place, between the exi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of pe≈øtilence and the occurrence of earth-quakes and eruptions from volcanos, the records of medicine afford am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proof. An unan≈øwerable argument in favour of the reality of this general con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere, is derived from the frequent (I had almo≈øt ≈øaid uniform) cotemporary

prevalence of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, in different and di≈øtant parts of the globe.</p>
            <p>That ≈øuch a general con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere may exi≈øt in America, as well as in other places, is a po≈øition, which, ab≈øtractly con≈øidered, we have no rea≈øon to doubt. And that it even does actually prevail, at this time, is an opinion entertained by many re≈øpectable characters, and ≈øupported by various phy≈øical phenomena. On a full and minute ≈øtatement of the≈øe phenomena, time will not ≈øuffer me, at pre≈øent, to enter. I flatter my≈øelf, however, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing facts, relative to this curious and intere≈øting ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, will not be deemed unworthy the attention of the Academy.</p>
            <p>For ≈øome years pa≈øt, ≈øeveral ≈øpecies of in≈øects, who≈øe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence is known no be intimately connected with the ≈øtate of the atmo≈øphere, have been more than u≈øually abundant in our country. Of the truth of this, our farmers are able to furni≈øh us with but too many unequivocal and, to them, expen≈øive te≈øtimonies. It will require many years to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate from the memory of this u≈øeful and re≈øpectable cla≈øs of our fellow-citizens, the injuries they have ≈øu≈øtained from the inva≈øion and ravages of the <hi>Hessian Fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The origin of this de≈øtructive in≈øect has, like that of our late epidemic, con≈øtituted a ≈øubject of ≈øpeculation and doubt, among the literary characters of the United States. While ≈øome have traced it to foreign importation, others have contended that it is a native of our own country. Were I to lay
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035263_0028_1001B473973200E8"/>
before you the re≈øult of my own enquiries and reflection on this point of natural hi≈øtory, I ≈øhould be inclined to advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the latter opinion. I am rather di≈øpo≈øed to believe, that what is vulgarly denominated the He≈ø≈øian Fly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates entirely with our≈øelves. There is rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect, that our fields and fore≈øts contain, perhaps, at all times, this in≈øect in certain members, and that it ≈øuperabounds, and, depredates on the labours of the hu≈øbandman in tho≈øe ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons only, during which there prevails a ≈øtate or con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of atmo≈øphere, more peculiarly favourable to its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and exi≈øtence. For it is a fact well known to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali≈øts, that no le≈øs in the oeconomy of in≈øects than in that of plants, certain ≈øea≈øons are favourable, and others unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to their generation and growth.</p>
            <p>Again, it is a fact, with which men of ob≈øervation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unacquainted, that for ≈øeveral years pa≈øt, but more particularly during the la≈øt and preceding autumns, mu≈øki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos were more than u≈øually abundant in tho≈øe ≈øituations which they generally infe≈øt‚ÄîNor is this all‚ÄîThe≈øe in≈øects, not willing to be confined, during the two la≈øt ≈øea≈øons, to their former limits, made their way into many places, which, before, had been almo≈øt wholly exempt from their inva≈øion. But from the well known circum≈øtance, that mu≈økitos uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly abound at the ≈øame time, and in the ≈øame places, with epidemic bilious fevers, we are very fairly authorized to conclude, that the≈øe noxious in≈øects depend, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence, on an in≈øalubrious ≈øtate and con≈øtitution of atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. Nor mu≈øt I here omit to ob≈øerve, that the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035263_0029_1001B47B405E3530"/>
of gra≈øs-hoppers, which infe≈øted our country, during la≈øt ≈øummer, be≈øpoke a condition of atmo≈øphere different from what u≈øually prevails at that ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>If then our country has, of late, been characterized by an unu≈øual prevalence of in≈øects and of di≈øea≈øe in different places, and if the≈øe in≈øects and di≈øea≈øe have, in mo≈øt in≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prevailed, not only at the ≈øame time, but al≈øo in the ≈øame ≈øituations, (both of which facts are unque≈øtionably true) have we not, at lea≈øt, a very o≈øten≈øible ground of belief, that the≈øe unu≈øual and cotemporary phenomena proceed from the ≈øame cau≈øe, and that this cau≈øe is no other than a ≈øtate and con≈øtitution of our atmo≈øphere, different from tho≈øe that u≈øually characterize the atmo≈øphere of our country?</p>
            <p>In corroboration of the preceding inference, namely, that the ≈øame con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere, which favours the prevalence of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, is, in like manner, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the exi≈øtence of in≈øects, I beg leave to give a brief ≈øtatement and explanation of an intere≈øting fact, which, we learn from the hi≈øtory of former ages. For more than fifty years, during the reign of the emperor Ju≈øtinian, the plague raged in Europe, A≈øia and Africa, with ≈øuch unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelled violence and malignity, as ≈øometimes to threaten, in appearance, even the depopulation of the whole earth. Throughout this period of deva≈øtation and calamity, ≈øuch was the immen≈øity of locu≈øts which infe≈øted the countries where the pe≈øtilence prevailed, that many were di≈øpo≈øed to attribute the exi≈øtence of this di≈øea≈øe to the death and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035263_0030_1001B47FD6C452C8"/>
of the≈øe de≈øtructive in≈øects. This latter opinion, however, we conceive to be founded, in a great mea≈øure, in error. For although the pe≈øtilential con≈øtitution of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øphere was, no doubt, ≈øtrengthened by the deleterious gas, ari≈øing from the putrefactive di≈ø≈øolution of ≈øuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe volume of animal matter, it is by no means likely that it re≈øulted from this as its primary cau≈øe. There ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øts certain facts which render it much more probable, that the ≈øame con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere, re≈øulting originally from ≈øome more powerful ≈øource, proved favourable, at once, to the generation of locu≈øts, and to the birth and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pe≈øtilence of the age.</p>
            <p>Might not a like phy≈øical explanation be given of the cau≈øe of ≈øeveral of the plagues, which ≈øacred writ declares to have vi≈øited, in ancient times, the incorrigible Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and which were then ≈øuppo≈øed, to have been inflicted by the immediate hand of the Deity? I allude particularly to the de≈øtructive ≈øwarms of locu≈øts, and flies, and to the pe≈øtilence among men, and the murrain among cattle, two di≈øea≈øes, which appear to be intimately connected. Is it not, I ≈øay, at lea≈øt, an admi≈ø≈øible conjecture, that there prevailed, at that time, a certain pe≈øtilential con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere, which operated as the leading phy≈øical cau≈øe of all the≈øe evils? The profound darkne≈øs which, ≈øhortly afterwards, over≈øhadowed, for a time, the dominions of the impious and tyrannical Pharaoh, was probably nothing more than a natural concomitant of the ≈øame con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035263_0031_1001B4846CEFA598"/>That there was ≈øomething peculiar and uncommon, in the general ≈øtate and condition of the air, during our epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics of ninety three, ninety ≈øeven, and ninety eight, we would deduce from the va≈øt number of fiery meteors, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly denominated falling or ≈øhooting ≈øtars) which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our atmo≈øphere during tho≈øe periods. I think it highly probable, that the≈øe blazing meteors, always abound during the exi≈øtence of a pe≈øtilential con≈øtitution of atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and that on their uniform appearance, ≈øuper≈øtition has erected a belief, that certain ≈øtrange and ≈øupernatural phenomena in the heavens, never fail to give premonition of the approach of pe≈øtilence.</p>
            <p>As a farther evidence in favour of the exi≈øtence of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere, particularly during the years ninety three and ninety eight, it de≈øerves to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that, in tho≈øe years, the fruits of our country, in general, ripened and rotted with much more than their u≈øual rapidity.

Nor could the occurrence of the≈øe phenomena be fairly deduced from the exi≈øtence of any peculiarity in the ≈øen≈øible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the atmo≈øphere. Sea≈øons as warm and dry as tho≈øe, to which I have referred, are not uniformly productive of ≈øimilar effects.

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:035263_0032_1001B48C167B8DE0"/>Another unan≈øwerable argument in favour of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øional exi≈øtence of a general morbid con≈øtitution of atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere in our country, is derived from the exten≈øive preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the catarrhal fever (commonly denominated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza) in the years eighty eight and eighty nine. This di≈øea≈øe, which I believe is acknowledged by all to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted from a certain deleterious con≈øtitution or ≈øtate of the air we in≈øpired, was ≈øo general, as to pervade every part of the United States. But the con≈øtitution, from which it originated, mu≈øt have been, in like manner, general, being nece≈ø≈øarily co-exten≈øive with the di≈øea≈øe it≈øelf. During part of the continuance of this catarrhal con≈øtitution, a deep du≈økine≈øs, or want of due tran≈øparency in the atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, con≈øiderably ob≈øcured the ≈øun, in many, if not mo≈øt, parts of our country, thus con≈øtituting an approach toward Egyptian darkne≈øs, which, as formerly ob≈øerved, was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, nothing more than a natural effect or concomitant of the then exi≈øting pe≈øtilential con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>The cau≈øes, which give ri≈øe to that <hi>local constitution</hi> of atmo≈øphere, favourable to the generation and propagation of pe≈øtilence, are by far more obvious in their nature, operate on a much le≈øs enten≈øive ≈øcale, and po≈ø≈øe≈øs an exi≈øtence by no means ≈øo durable. They are principally confined to large cities, camps, and garri≈øons, where multitudes of people are crowded together, and where per≈øonal and other de≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of cleanline≈øs do not receive the attention they merit. They may be ≈øaid, in general, to be, all ≈øuch cau≈øes as tend, in the above de≈øcriptions of places, to generate foul air, and

thus produce a vitiated ≈øtate of atmo≈øphere. The principal of the≈øe ≈øhall hereafter become ≈øubjects of particular ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This local con≈øtitution of atmo≈øphere extends, frequently, beyond the immediate confines of cities, camps and garri≈øons, and, ≈øometimes, even pervades con≈øiderable tracts of country, particularly ≈øuch as are low and mar≈øhy. It is an evil, which may be ≈øaid to owe its origin, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to that <hi>indolence</hi> and <hi>inattention,</hi> which unfortunately, con≈øtitute ≈øuch predominant traits in the character of the human race. This peculiar con≈øtitution, of which we have ≈øpoken, is nothing el≈øe than a predi≈øpo≈øition or capability in the atmo≈øphere to generate and propagate pe≈øtilential di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes. It would ≈øeem to con≈øi≈øt, either in the actual admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pe≈øtilential effluvia with the air which we breathe, or in the pre≈øence of ≈øome aeriform ≈øub≈øtance, which favours the exi≈øtence and conveyance of ≈øuch effluvia, and prevents their action from being de≈øtroyed by the influence of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øphere.</p>
            <p>Your attention, for a few moments, is next ≈øolicited to the remote cau≈øe of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes. It need ≈øcarcely be ob≈øerved, that this ≈øubject is very nearly allied to that of which we have la≈øt treated. So intimate, indeed, is their connection, that they might, without any impropriety, have been both ≈øpoken of under the ≈øame head. This remote cau≈øe may be defined, a gas of a highly poi≈øonous nature, which, when brought into contact with the human body, renders it liable, if expo≈øed at the ≈øame time to the action of exciting cau≈øes, to an attack of the di≈øea≈øe denominated pe≈øtilence.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035263_0034_1001B493C065DE20"/>
A knowledge of the peculiar phy≈øical properties of this gas has hitherto remained, and, I fear, will very long continue to remain, an important de≈øideratum in the ≈øcience of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. Even the reality of its exi≈øtence is, as yet, e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed, only, by its unparalelled ravages on the ≈øy≈øtem of man, and on the ≈øy≈øtems of a few ≈øpecies of inferior animals. So extremely ≈øubtle and evane≈øcent is its nature, that we have not been able to ≈øeparate it from ≈øurrounding matter, to embody it together, and thus ≈øubject it to the te≈øt of ob≈øervation and experiment.</p>
            <p>A knowledge of the actual ≈øource of this pe≈øtilential va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour is equally intere≈øting to phy≈øical ≈øcience, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the welfare of the human race.

A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den≈øed ≈øtatement of it here, would be nothing more than a needle≈øs repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what mu≈øt be familiar to the mind of every one, who has attended to the cultivation of the ≈øcience of medicine. Ever ≈øince pe≈øtilence was fir≈øt acknowledged to be a native of our globe, it has been uniformly derived, by phy≈øicians of ob≈øervation, from the poi≈øonous gas re≈øulting from the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive di≈ø≈øolution of organized bodies. This would lead me to a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations on the ≈øubject of poi≈øons.</p>
                  <p>This de≈øtructive cla≈øs of ≈øub≈øtances has been, generally, divided into the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, the vegetable and the mineral, to which ≈øhould be added, that much more formidable de≈øcription of poi≈øon, derived originally from the proce≈øs of putrefaction. Under the≈øe four denomination, are embraced all the ≈øpecies and varieties of poi≈øons, that have hitherto attracted the notice of philo≈øophers. That pe≈øtilential and infectious di≈øea≈øes are the re≈øult of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonous effluvia, operating on the ≈øy≈øtem of man, is a truth, to which medical characters have long given their a≈ø≈øent. An intere≈øting que≈øtion would ≈øeem to ari≈øe here, namely, to what denomination of poi≈øons, do the≈øe effluvia appear to belong? It cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed to be to the animal, the vegetable, or the mineral poi≈øons, becau≈øe the≈øe deleterious ≈øub≈øtances have never been known, nor even ≈øu≈øpected, to be capable of propagating them≈øelves. Thus, a per≈øon under the painful operation of an over-proportion of ar≈øenic, or of opium, or agonized by the bite of the rattle-≈ønake, is incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his di≈øea≈øe to any of his attendants. The ≈øame thing may be ≈øaid re≈øpecting the morbid affections, re≈øulting from any ≈øpecies of either of the three foregoing genera of poi≈øons. I believe it to be a truth, that they have never been known to be, in any in≈øtance, communicable. The poi≈øon, therefor, giving birth to pe≈øtilential and infectious di≈øea≈øes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that genus, which derives its origin from the putrefactive proce≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Putrefaction I would con≈øider as a <hi>generic</hi> term, embracing ≈øeveral <hi>≈øpecific</hi> or at lea≈øt <hi>various</hi> modes, in which organized bodies undergo di≈ø≈øolution, and recombination into ga≈øeous re≈øults, ≈øome of them of a delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or poi≈øonous nature. The≈øe poi≈øonous re≈øult would ≈øeem to differ from each other, according to the varieties of the proce≈øs by which they were produced. Thus for example, from one particular de≈øcription or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the putrefactive proce≈øs, or, if the reader be more plea≈øed with the hypothe≈øis, from the putrefaction of a particular de≈øcription of matter, originated the poi≈øonous offluvia or ≈øeeds of pe≈øtilence; from another, tho≈øe of ≈ømall-pox, from another, tho≈øe of mea≈øles, from another, tho≈øe of lues venerea, &amp;c. From the foregoing principles it would appear, that all infectious di≈øea≈øes, as the ≈ømall-pox and lues venerea, in≈øtead of being, as they have been generally ≈øuppo≈øed, the ≈øpecific and exclu≈øive growth of the Ea≈øt, the We≈øt, or of any particular climate or ≈øituation, may, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circum≈øtances, originate in any inhabited portion of our globe. Nor do I con≈øider our own country as by any means exempt from this general charge. I believe, that the ≈ømall pox may originate in America or Europe, as well as in A≈øia, and that the venereal di≈øea≈øe may originate in A≈øia or Europe, as well as in America. I am per≈øuaded that the great and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øible principles, by which, the decompo≈øition and recompo≈øition of matter are governed, operate uniformly in all places, and that no ≈øpot on the globe is privileged with a ≈øpecial exemption from their influence.</p>

Whereas, on the other hand, mo≈øt large cities, and even con≈øiderable tract of country, where pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying filth has been ≈øuffered to abound, have repeatedly experienced this ≈øcourge in all its malignity. Thus the plague of Egypt, unque≈øtionably derives its birth from the filth ≈øpread around by the waters of the Nile. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øity of putrefying animal and vegetable ≈øub≈øtances, with which the ≈øtreets and ≈øuburbs of Con≈øtantinople abound, afford origin to the pe≈øtilence, which ≈øo frequently vi≈øits that unfortunate city. And the Yellow Fever or plague of the We≈øt Indies, appears to be indebted, for its birth and exi≈øtence, entirely to the exten≈øive putrefactive di≈ø≈øolution of organized bodies, produced by the fervors of a topical ≈øun.</p>
            <p>From a ≈øimilar ≈øource, namely, the filth of a crouded garri≈øon city, mu≈øt we deduce the celebrated plague of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, which, to the eye of fancy, ≈øeems ≈øtill to live and rage with con≈øummate malignity, in the de≈øcriptive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Thucidides: And to cau≈øes preci≈øely ≈øimilar, mu≈øt we attribute that dreadful pe≈øtilence, which before the walls of Syracu≈øe, made greater havoc among the Roman legions, than even the ≈øtupendous engines of Archimedes‚Äî To what cau≈øes, I would beg leave to a≈øk, are we to a≈øcribe the more frequent and general prevalence of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes in camps, garri≈øons, and other places of military e≈øtabli≈øhment?

greater expo≈øure of men to actual hard≈øhip and fatigue, are the two only circum≈øtances, relative to health and di≈øea≈øe, in which military ≈øituations differ materially from others.

The former of the≈øe, namely, a want of cleanline≈øs, gives ri≈øe to the remote, and the other, viz. expo≈øure to hard≈øhips, acts as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cau≈øe of the malady. Let me me not, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent occa≈øion, fail to ob≈øerve, that when pe≈øtilence breaks out in any place, it never fails to make its appearance about that period, when, from the u≈øual co-operation of phy≈øical cau≈øes, the proce≈øs of general putrefaction, has arrived to its ≈øummit.‚ÄîThus may pe≈øtilential effluvia be generated in every ≈øpot on the ≈øurface of the globe, where the ≈øoil gives birth to organized bodies, and the climate affords a ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of heat and moi≈øture, to give ri≈øe to a high putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proce≈øs. There exi≈øt numerous proofs, ≈øacred, I had almo≈øt ≈øaid, as tho≈øe of holy writ, of pe≈øtilence having been the native growth of many places on the continent of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.

and propagate pe≈øtilence here, with as much readine≈øs, and with as much malignity, as in countries ≈øituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Atlantic?

            <p>Let not chemi≈øts, in the pride of their knowledge, deny, that pe≈øtilential effluvia can be the offspring of putrefaction, becau≈øe they are unable to produce it in their laboratories. Let them remember, that they are not yet able to operate, in all re≈øpects, as nature does, nor are they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of any chemical te≈øts to a≈øcertain, with deci≈øion, where the≈øe efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via do and where they do not prevail.

            <p>It may not be improper, on the pre≈øent occa≈øion, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that of all animal ≈øub≈øtances, the matter of human per≈øpiration is by no means the lea≈øt liable to putrefaction.

actual influence of this proce≈øs. There is rea≈øon to believe, that, from the putrefaction of the per≈øpirable gas, in places where numbers have been unduly crouded in ≈ømall, unven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated apartments, di≈øea≈øes of a pe≈øtilential nature have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted.

            <p>From all the information I have been able to collect from ob≈øervation, books, or conver≈øation, re≈øpecting tho≈øe three di≈øea≈øes, I have not been able to perceive that there exi≈øts between them any radical or e≈ø≈øential difference. They ≈øeem evidently to originate from the ≈øame ≈øource, they are alike influenced by the u≈øual vici≈øitudes of the ≈øea≈øons, they invade the human ≈øy≈øtem in the ≈øame manner, and are charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized, in their cour≈øe, by the ≈øame train of general ≈øymptoms. They appear, in fact, to be the very ≈øame di≈øea≈øe, modified, to a certain degree, by various cau≈øes, of which the mo≈øt powerful is that of <hi>climate.</hi> This is, indeed, a cau≈øe, the operation of which but few things are able to re≈øi≈øt. It is well known that climate po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes a power of changing the a≈øpect of plants, the appearance of inferior animals, and even the figure, complexion, and countenance of the human race. Thus, how different, in all the≈øe re≈øpects, is the appearance of an A≈øiatic from that of a native of Africa,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035263_0042_1001B4D10EA4EE90"/>
of Europe or America? May we not then, very rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that the ≈øame cau≈øe, which po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes ≈øuch an immen≈øe influence over plants and animals, is, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, fully competent to the modification of di≈øea≈øe? I will venture to affirm, that there exi≈øts a much greater differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the general appearance of an A≈øiatic, and that of an American, than between the ≈øymptoms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs of the American, and tho≈øe of the A≈øiatic pe≈øtilence. But the men of A≈øia and America are held to be nothing more than varieties in the human race, re≈øulting from a difference of climate and of the ≈øtate of ≈øociety. When any incon≈øiderable difference, then, is di≈øcovered in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appearances of the pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes, by which the two countries are occa≈øionally invaded, it may doubtle≈øs be attributed to the ≈øame cau≈øes.</p>
            <p>With regard to the pe≈øtilence of the We≈øt Indies, it might, at fir≈øt ≈øight, appear to be, in one re≈øpect, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different from the other two. Thus, we learn from phy≈øicians, on who≈øe report we may, mo≈øt confidently, rely, that the former di≈øea≈øe is never, in any in≈øtance, known to be contagious, whereas there is, perhaps, rea≈øon to believe, that the ca≈øe is different with re≈øpect to the two latter.

On farther reflection, however, it will be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceived, that this trait in the character of the We≈øt

India pe≈øtilence re≈øults entirely from the influence of a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climate. For it is a fact, well known to phy≈øicians of experience and information, that a high and uniform temperature of atmo≈øphere, is decidedly ho≈øtile to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of pe≈øtilential di≈øea≈øes. Such a temperature, continued for ≈øome time, arre≈øts the progre≈øs of even the de≈øolating pe≈øtilence of A≈øia.

May not the≈øe di≈øea≈øes be, very rationally, viewed as the ≈øame in their nature, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly modified by climate, and by the habits and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the human race?</p>

            <p>The ≈øubject of the origin of our late and preceding epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics, has been already ≈øo amply di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, that tho≈øe who take it up, at this period, can be con≈øidered as little el≈øe than gleaners in the field of controver≈øy.

            <p n="1">I. Con≈øiderably remote from the breezes of the ocean, and ≈øtanding on a ≈øcite of but a moderate elevation, Philadelphia is by no means favourably ≈øituated for free ventilation.

            <p>In taking a ≈øurvey of many parts of our city and ≈øuburbs, our ≈øen≈øes are ≈øtruck by the offen≈øive and dangerous ≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, of an accumulation of the filth of nearly a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. In pa≈ø≈øing, in ≈øeveral directions, to a con≈øiderable di≈øtance from the pavements of our ≈øtreets, we are not even ≈øuffered to tread on the ≈øoil of nature. We travel over artificial ground, made up of a fermenting a≈ø≈øemblage of the mo≈øt noxious materials. Here, to the depth of ≈øeveral inches beneath the ≈øurface, is promi≈øcuou≈øly blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, animal and vegetable matter, in a ≈øtate of high putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, while the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtances, in a ≈øimilar ≈øtate, are mo≈øt plenteou≈øly ≈øtrewn over the ≈øurface it≈øelf.

of this enormous evil, nor erecting any barriers to check its growth. Even the melancholy rever≈øe of this is true. Notwith≈øtanding the numerous declarations we hear, in favour of the cleanline≈øs of our ≈øtreets, at pre≈øent, compared to what exi≈øted ≈øome years ago, it is an unque≈øtionable truth, that, in the exi≈øting ≈øtate of things, as year ≈øucceeds to year, the aggregate ma≈øs of filth in our city and ≈øuburbs encrea≈øes.<note n="*" place="bottom">The filth taken up from our ≈øtreets, not excepting even that which is removed from our nece≈ø≈øaries them≈øelves, is, at pre≈øent, conveyed to ≈øuch an incon≈øiderable di≈øtance from the city, that it might almo≈øt as well, be ≈øuffered to remain in its original ≈øituation. In≈øtead of employing ≈øuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for filling up ponds, and levelling the ground, in the ≈øouth-we≈øtern part of the city, would it not be much more wi≈øe and economical, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to the purpo≈øe of fertilizing the ground, under cultivation in the neighbourhood, where, in≈øtead of proving de≈øtructive to the life of man, the effluvia which they emit, might contribute, to rear up vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for his ≈øu≈øtenance and comfort?</note> Should our civic police, (as far as it re≈øpects the prevention of di≈øea≈øe,) continue ≈øupine and feeble, as it is, at pre≈øent, what a dark and gloomy pro≈øpect is opened to our view! With the future progre≈øs of time, danger would ≈øeem to accumulate on danger, and di≈øtre≈øs to blacken over di≈øtre≈øs, till imagination becomes bewildered, in attempting to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the melancholy re≈øult.</p>
            <p>Owing to ≈øuch a ≈øtate of dome≈øtic filth, as now prevails in and around the city of Philadelphia, was the plague, in former times, the ≈øcourge of London, and other populous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Europe; and, owing to a ≈øimilar ≈øtate, does it ≈øtill

continue, occa≈øionally, to rage in Con≈øtantinople, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other devoted places in the Ea≈øt.</p>
            <p>However painful the pro≈øpect, and however unpopular the idea, may, at pre≈øent, be with many, it is, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of things, a truth which ought not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that unle≈øs the misfortune be averted, by the mo≈øt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and energetic mea≈øures of dome≈øtic cleanline≈øs, the the large commercial cities of America will, in, perhaps, le≈øs than a century, become as remarkable for giving birth to pe≈øtilence, as any ever have been in Europe, or as any are now on the continent of A≈øia.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the ≈øources of our dome≈øtic filth, is not my pre≈øent object. This has already been ably done, in ≈øeveral memorials from the Academy of medicine. There exi≈øt, however, two ≈øources in particular, to which, I will be pardoned for thinking, that the public attention has not been directed, in a manner ≈øufficiently forcible. The≈øe are, the va≈øt quantity of putrid and putrefying timber, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the formation of our docks and wharves, and the immen≈øity of animal and vegetable ≈øub≈øtances, ≈øtrewn, in a putrefactive ≈øtate, along the commons, in a ≈øouth-we≈øtern direction from the city.</p>
            <p>From the former of the≈øe ≈øources, an incalculable volume of deleterious air mu≈øt be di≈øcharged, to the great annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the crews of ve≈ø≈øels in our harbour, and of all who≈øe bu≈øine≈øs demands their attendance along ≈øhore. For this evil the remedy is ea≈øy and obvious. The timbers ought to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035263_0050_1001AF4E705A47D8"/>
be removed, as much as po≈ø≈øible, from the docks and wharves, and their place ≈øupplied by brick or ≈øtone.</p>
            <p>From the latter ≈øource, namely, the abundance of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ≈øub≈øtances, di≈øper≈øed over the commons, in a <hi>south wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> direction, the air of the city mo≈øt be deeply contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. To have a due ≈øen≈øe of the propriety and weight of this ob≈øervation, it is nece≈ø≈øary to recollect, that, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, during the months of July, Augu≈øt, and September, our prevailing winds are from that quarter. Whatever noxious effluvia, therefore, may be evolved from tho≈øe ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, by the proce≈øs of putrefaction, is wafted, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, into the heart of our city, and mingled with the air of the ≈øtreets which we breathe. There is certainly rea≈øon to believe, that, to the≈øe effluvia, we were indebted, in no incon≈øiderable degree, for that local con≈øtitution of atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, ≈øo highly favourable to the propagation of our late epidemic.</p>
            <p>It is ≈øcarcely nece≈ø≈øary to ob≈øerve, that the remedy for this evil is the immediate and entire removal of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive ≈øub≈øtances. If the places, which tho≈øe matters now occupy, were planted with trees or ≈øhrubbery, or, even, put under a crop of inferior vegetation, the effect, on the city, would be both plea≈øant and ≈øalutary. Vegetables are known to emit, during their wakeful and active ≈øtate, large quantities of pure re≈øpirable air. Were the above regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, therefore, adopted, in≈øtead of the offen≈øive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious vapour of putrefaction, this fluid of life, would,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035263_0051_1001AF40A2C6CD30"/>
in con≈øequence of the ≈øouth-we≈øtern winds of ≈øummer and autumn, glide through our ≈øtreets, and diffu≈øe both health and vigour from its wings.</p>
            <p>To the two preceding ≈øources of the vitiation of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øphere, let me not omit to ≈øubjoin that which is con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by our public burying grounds. To a mind eying, with deep ≈øolicitude, the apparently dubious balance of fate, with re≈øpect to the future pro≈øperity of our city, the≈øe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive re≈øervoirs, fraught with the mouldering relicts of the dead, pre≈øent them≈øelves, as objects of painful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. They appear equally <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> and, in neither re≈øpect, is the degree incon≈øiderable. Situated, as ≈øome of them are, in the very centre of our city, the≈øe ≈øpacious inclo≈øures, a great part of the ≈øoil of which, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of human exuviae, cannot do otherwi≈øe than aid in contaminating the air of our ≈øtreets, and the water of our pumps. That the water of our city is injured, by the immen≈øity of dead bodies, depo≈øited in our grave-yards, we would infer, from the very con≈øiderable di≈øtance, to which the putrid effluvia, from the contents of a grave, have been known to make their way, through the bowels of the earth. And, that the ≈øame cau≈øe, has a tendency to vitiate our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øphere, we would conclude, in particular, from certain phy≈øical phenomena, for which ancient grave-yards have been always remarkable. The phenonema, to which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude are, a kind of burning meteors, that ≈øweep along the ≈øurface of the ground, and which are known, under the vulgar denomination of Will-with-the-wi≈øp, or Jack-with-the-lanthern.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035263_0052_1001B512FB99F328"/>
The≈øe would ≈øeem to owe their exi≈øtence, principally, to an inflammable gas, di≈øcharged, through the pores of the earth, from the putrefying contents of the graves, and have, probably, aided much, in giving origin to the ≈øuper≈øtitious legends of the ignorant, re≈øpecting church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards being haunted, by goblins and gho≈øts.</p>
            <p>For this evil, I need hardly ob≈øerve, that the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, the removal of our burying grounds, to a di≈øtance from the city. Nor let an attachment and veneration, however natural and amiable, for the relicts of our friends, prevent the adoption of ≈øuch a ≈øalutary mea≈øure! If we painfully feel and deplore the lo≈øs of our <hi>friends deceased,</hi> why di≈øpo≈øe of their bodies, in ≈øuch a way, as to ≈øow the ≈øeeds of pe≈øtilence and death, among tho≈øe that ≈øurvive, and thus, voluntarily, ≈øubject our≈øelves to additional ≈øorrow? To a feeling and reflecting mind, it is, doubtle≈øs, a much more eligible alternative, to have a portion of our relatives and friends ≈øtill living, and tho≈øe that are dead, buried in a di≈øtant ≈øituation, and, even, in what ≈øome might con≈øider as unhallowed ground, than to have them all ≈øwept off, though buried in the immediate vicinity of our dwellings, and in ground duly con≈øecrated for the purpo≈øe of interment.</p>
