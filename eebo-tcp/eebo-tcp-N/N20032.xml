            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FINALLY, BRETHREN, FAREWEL: BE PERFECT; BE OF GOOD COMFORT; BE OF ONE MIND; LIVE IN PEACE; AND THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE SHALL BE WITH YOU.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE occaſion, which has now brought us together, my beloved hearers, is one of the moſt ſolemn and affecting that can take place on this ſide eternity. The parting farewel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a miniſter and people, who have been long connected in the bonds of ſo endearing and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a union, is like tearing aſunder the ſtrings which twine around our hearts. But as it is now determined, that we muſt ſoon part from each other, let us endeavor to fortify our minds for the trying ſcene; that we may, by divine grace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and improve the pangs of ſeparation, in a manner becoming our character as men, and our profeſſion as chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026243_0004_0FCFAABBD391B460"/>I know of no paſſage in the whole book of God, which is better adapted to ſuch an occaſion, than the words juſt read; in which, the Apoſtle Paul, who had been a religious inſtructor and ſpiritual father to the Corinthians, cloſes his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to them with an affectionate and ſolemn fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel; every word of which is full of pathos and energy; and the whole ſentence moſt powerfully calculated to excite, direct, and encourage them to a right temper and behaviour in their preſent ſituation. <hi>Finally, Brethren, farewel: Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhall be the buſineſs of this diſcourſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the meaning of the ſeveral branches of this valedictory exhortation, and to apply the ſubject to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>The firſt clauſe in the text, <hi>Brethren farewel,</hi> requires very little illuſtration. It is a common expreſſion of kindneſs, or mode of civility, by which acquaintance and friends take their leave of each other; and it imports a hearty deſire of the welfare of thoſe to whom it is addreſſed. The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026243_0005_0FCFAABA5FECB2F0"/>
very formation of the word holds up this idea. It is compounded of <hi>fare</hi> and <hi>well;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſe of it, on occaſion of parting with our friends, evidently expreſſes a wiſh, that they may <hi>fare well</hi> in our abſence, or enjoy the ſweets of health and proſperity. When it is uſed by <hi>chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> friends, it implies a devout wiſh of each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſpiritual welfare. This was undoubtedly the leading ſentiment of the Apoſtle, when he took this affectionate leave of his ſpiritual children of Corinth. In order to attain this deſired end, their ſpiritual proſperity, he proceeds to direct and urge them to ſeveral important and ſeaſonable duties.</p>
            <p>He, firſt, exhorts them to <hi>be perfect.</hi> This may be conſidered as pointing out the duty of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member, or of the ſociety at large. Firſt, let each member of the church be <hi>perfect,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and correcting his own errors, filling up his own defects, puſhing forward and completing his own graces and virtues. Let every one look to himſelf, that he be evangelically perfect, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and impartial, in his regard to truth and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that he have his head and heart, his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice, as nearly conformed as poſſible to the great patern and rule of perfection. This
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026243_0006_0FCFAAB881031050"/>
is the ſure, the only method to reform and perfect the whole ſociety: This is the way to have a pure and glorious church. Which leads to the other idea; <hi>be perfect</hi> in your collective capacity as a chriſtian ſociety. In order to this, return to your former pure, united and happy ſtate. Revive that mutual chriſtian charity which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which, like the joints, veins and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the natural body, conveys nouriſhment and vigour, unity and perfection, to the whole church or ſpiritual body of Chriſt; which draws the affections and efforts of all the members to one point, the edification and completion of the whole. In one word, grow in divine love, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection to Chriſt your Head, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his ſake. This will at once perfect your character as individuals, and complete the union, beauty and happineſs of your ſociety.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Be of good comfort:</hi> that is, in the way of earneſt endeavors after reformation and chriſtian perfection, take the courage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which a conſciouſneſs of your own ſincerity, and the aſſurance of the divine aſſiſtance and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ought to inſpire. Let no preſent or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difficulties or dangers, attending your ſituation,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026243_0007_0FCF8B90A7268988"/>
be permitted to overwhelm your minds. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the way of duty is the road of ſafety; that God is with you, while you are with Him; and that ſo long as you keep in this path, he ſtands engaged, by promiſe, to guide, protect, and proſper you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be of one mind.</hi> The import of the original is, think, mind, or reliſh the ſame thing. It may, therefore, include a union or harmony of ſentiment, affection and practice. Firſt, it implies a union of ſentiment reſpecting the great eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of religion, thoſe which conſtitute or exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the foundation of the ſinner's hope, the neceſſary cauſes, conditions, or means of ſalvation. I grant there is an abſurdity in exhorting or requiring all men to think alike in every punctilio of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinion. For in the preſent imperfect ſtate, many things operate to hinder even wiſe and good men from adopting the ſame modes of thought and expreſſion on every religious ſubject. Beſides, a union of ſentiment among rational beings, is not to be effected by authoritative precept or pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic exhortation; much leſs by violent or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory meaſures; but by convincing light or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſented to their underſtandings. But
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026243_0008_0FCFAAB38EFDE018"/>
ſtill, when ſufficient means of light are afforded to men (which is the caſe with thoſe who enjoy the goſpel, with reſpect to every important arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith and duty) they may be properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to think the ſame thing; that is, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and hold faſt the ſame eſſential points; at leaſt to adhere to the ſubſtance, the ſpirit, the practical deſign of theſe truths, though they ſhould differ in ſome ſpeculative niceties in the mode of ſtating or explaining them. A total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of any plain and important doctrine of chriſtianity, under ſufficient means of light, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry criminal and dangerous. For it proclaims an unfair and diſhoneſt, a wilfully blind and deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart. In ſhort, if it be the duty of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a religious ſociety, to love the truth, to harmonize with it in their governing taſte and diſpoſition, to keep their minds ever open and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the evidence of it, and eager to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it whenever duly preſented; and if right views of religion are important to right temper and practice; if goſpel truths admitted into the mind are the foundation of goſpel holineſs in the heart and life; and if the united adherence of a chriſtian church to theſe truths is an important mean of preſerving and increaſing true godlineſs,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026243_0009_0FCFAAB2C415FD70"/>
charity and peace in the ſociety; then it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important duty in the members of ſuch a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, carefully to maintain truth and unanimity in their religious principles. In order to this, it becomes them with united diligence, impartiality and zeal, to attend to the word of God, as the great fountain of orthodoxy, and the true center of chriſtian unity.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, the precept before us includes <hi>union of affection.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, let your hearts be one in chriſtian love, though about matters of leſs moment your opinions and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be divided. This is evidently the meaning of the ſame original words in Romans 12.16.—and 15.5. <hi>Be of the ſame mind one toward another. Now the God of patience and conſolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another, that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God. Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us.</hi> The general ſpirit of theſe texts is this: Though your religious ideas in ſome circumſtantial points be different; yet I deſire and pray, that you may all have that mutual charity, which ſhall form in you one mind and ſoul, and influence you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame candour, eſteem, and beneficence towards one another, which each of you manifeſts and wiſhes for himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026243_0010_0FCF8B8DAC5FAE20"/>In order to this, thirdly, be <hi>one in your practice,</hi> or purſuit. Let vital practical chriſtianity, which is the principal thing, be the great object of your united attention and zeal; and let your agreement in this be an effectual band of union and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among all the members of your ſociety. Such a harmony of practical judgment and holy activity on the ſide of the chriſtian cauſe, is a much better foundation for mutual charity, and is far more conducive to the edification and glory of a church, than the moſt zealous and united attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to orthodox opinions, where a correſpondent union of practice is wanting, Agreeably, this ſame apoſtle, in the third chapter of his epiſtle to the Philippians, having related to them his own views and exerciſes, having told them, <hi>this one thing I do—I preſs towards the mark of perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for the prize of eternal life,</hi> proceeds to urge them to a united purſuit of the ſame courſe. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſs, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule; let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> As if he had ſaid, we have all attained to this great point, to ſet up Chriſt, holineſs and heaven, as our mark
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026243_0011_0FCFAAAFD64FF5B8"/>
and our all. Let it, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be our main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to walk by this rule, to mind this one thing: And if in any leſſer matter you have a diverſity of ſentiment, you muſt candidly bear with one another, and patiently wait and hope for the time when God ſhall give you a better and united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in theſe controverted points. In the mean-time, let us go hand in hand; let us join all our forces together, in promoting theſe great and weightier things in which we <hi>are</hi> agreed, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the kingdom of our common Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which conſiſts, not in meat and drink, but in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But this brings us to the next clauſe of the text,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Live in peace.</hi> Let each one cultivate a pacif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic temper in his own breaſt: let him manifeſt it in his whole deportment: let him labor to the utmoſt to diffuſe and promote it through the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Let all the members endeavor to introduce and maintain that chriſtian concord, which grows out of a union of ſentiment, affection and practice in the cauſe of pure, vital and ſaying religion. In order to this, let each one mortify and guard againſt thoſe corrupt paſſions in his own heart,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026243_0012_0FCFAAAE4AC71438"/>
which tend to diſturb the peace, and to kindle the flame of contention; ſuch as pride, ſelfiſhneſs, anger, envy, a ſpirit of party, of jealouſy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Let every one religiouſly abſtain from all unfriendly, injurious, provoking language or behaviour. Let each one ſee that his own heart be formed to a truly kind, meek, and humble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to a temper of ſupreme love to God, and cordial benevolence to his neighbour. This will make it eaſy to deny ourſelves, our own intereſts and wills, for the peace and edification of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This will prompt a gentle deportment towards all. This will make it our ſtudious and delightful employment to contrive, to adviſe, to proſecute the things which make for peace; to uſe the beſt methods for reconciling differences, for healing diviſions, for ſtilling tumults, for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing chriſtian love and harmony. This will make it eaſy to obſerve the fair and equitable rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Saviour, for reſtoring peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ourſelves and others, whenever it has been interrupted by any real or ſuppoſed offence, either on our part, or on theirs. When the members of a chriſtian ſociety habitually profeſs and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh this ſpirit, and purſue this train of conduct, they live in peace, in the true and noble ſenſe of our text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:026243_0013_0FCFAAACDF9B08B0"/>The remaining part of the verſe enforces our compliance with the preceding directions, by a moſt encouraging and glorious motive; <hi>And the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi> The Supreme Being is ſtiled the God of love and peace, becauſe he is the prime ſource, the perfect exemplar, and the great patron of them. Love and peace conſtitute the beauty and felicity of his own nature: they are the native element in which he dwells. He has eminently diſplayed theſe qualities in his works; eſpecially in that of redemption, which is at once an aſtoniſhing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of love, and an unparalleled ſcheme of reconciliation and peace. Agreeably, love and peace are the ſpirit and breath of the goſpel, of its doctrines, precepts, examples, motives, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. They are peculiarly congenial to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and undertaking, the reſpective offices and works of God's Son and Spirit, the conſtituted Redeemer and Sanctifier of men. On theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Moſt High is properly and emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called the God of love and peace. As ſuch, he muſt approve and delight in theſe qualities in his creatures: He muſt take complacency in them, both as his own production and his own image. Thoſe, therefore, who poſſeſs theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026243_0014_0FCF8B8C30160348"/>
have all poſſible ſecurity of the ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and everlaſting favour of the Almighty: For he can no more diſregard his own image, than he can deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>What noble encouragement is here for a people ſtudiouſly to practiſe the duties here enjoined; and what a ſource of comfort to thoſe who are found purſuing this path! To be the conſcious favorites of the infinite God! to be ſure of his gracious preſence ſtatedly reſiding among them, as the pillar and the Schekinah did with his ancient Iſrael, to guide, protect, invigorate and comfort them! to walk daily in the light of his approving, ſmiling countenance! to be viſited with tokens of his love in frequent ſhowers of temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings, like the refreſhing dews on the ancient mountains of Hermon and Zion, where the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life forevermore! Surely happy is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is in ſuch a caſe; yea, happy is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is the Lord!</p>
            <p>And now, what greater happineſs can I wiſh for you, my beloved friends of this ſociety, than that you may unitedly follow the directions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſe of this excellent text! How
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026243_0015_0FCFAAABA506A340"/>
would it ſooth the anguiſh of my heart in parting with you, if I had the pleaſing aſſurance that the God of love and peace would ſtatedly reſide among you! It gives me unſpeakable joy to find <hi>ſo much</hi> of a prudent, pacific, condeſcending ſpirit reigning among you at this critical juncture. I rejoice to hear that this ſpirit appeared in your meeting ſometime ſince for ſupplying the Desk; that it viſibly guided your election of a committee for that purpoſe; and that the members of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee in general, are engaged in diſcharging their important truſt, in ſo united, diſcreet and faithful a manner. So far as I can learn, there ſeems to be a general diſpoſition both in them, and in the ſociety at large, to forget the things which are behind, to throw the mantle of charitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion over any differences of opinion, or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of temper and expreſſion, which may have taken place during the late ſcene of trial and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. With regard to myſelf, I feel that I am conſtantly ſubject to imperfections; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that many of you have witneſſed more or leſs of infirmity in ſome of my language or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, in managing the late very delicate and intereſting affair between you and me. So far as this has been the caſe, I publicly ask that candor
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026243_0016_0FCF8B8A09A14560"/>
and forgiveneſs, which I am ready, in return, to exerciſe towards any ſimilar imperfections in you. But as to the main part which I have acted, and the leading motives which have influenced me in this great buſineſs, you will allow me to leave with you this ſolemn parting declaration; a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which, I think, I could confidently make, if I were now addreſſing you from my dying bed:—I ſolemnly declare, that my acceptance of the reſult of the late Council, and of the invitation of the College, proceeded, not from any want of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my people, or of a deep ſenſe of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſacred engagements to them; not from an inordinate deſire of worldly ſplendor or wealth, eaſe or gratification; but from a clear conviction of conſcience, that the ſame King of Zion, who formerly placed me in this part of his dominions, now called me to a different and more important department in the ſame great moral kingdom. And I feel great comfort in the thought, that this glorious King, who will ſhortly be my Judge, has ſeen all the inward ſprings, and leading ſteps of my conduct, in the whole proceſs of this tranſaction; in particular, that he is my witneſs, that I did not form my judgment on this great queſtion in a blind, haſty, ſelf-ſufficient manner; but threw my
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026243_0017_0FCFAAA965FCD2B0"/>
mind open to every ray of light from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſought the beſt directions both from Heaven and Earth, and exerciſed a patient, candid and mature deliberation on the ſubject for a ſeries of months. It alſo gives me comfort that the ſame Omniſcient Being knows the falſehood of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which ignorance, prejudice or paſſion have circulated; ſuch as, that I ſought the new ſtation to which I am choſen; that I ſecretly acted in concert with ſome of the Electors, and alſo with the late Council previouſly to their reſult: The reverſe of which all thoſe gentlemen know to be the truth. Theſe facts, connected with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable unanimity of both thoſe very reſpectable bodies, greatly ſupport my ſpirits in this trying, parting ſcene. I mention them in this ſolemn manner, at this affecting moment, hoping they may leave a favorable impreſſion on the minds of ſome of the Brethren of this Church, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the final queſtion differed from my own. I confeſs it would be a very comfortable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to me, to go from you in a ſtate of entire mutual charity and union with all my former friends in this place. The more united you are in ſentiment and feelings reſpecting your late Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his diſmiſſion from you, the more fair and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026243_0018_0FCF8B886E300538"/>
encouraging will be the proſpect of entire affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and unanimity in year future proceedings. It is chiefly on this account that I have touched on this delicate ſtring. I have not felt, nor meant to expreſs any anxiety for my own reputation; for I bleſs God that I do not find <hi>this</hi> has ſuffered by the late tranſactions: Much leſs have I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publicly to boaſt of my own conduct and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or to reflect blame upon thoſe who have thought and acted in a different manner. For the former character and friendſhip of my diſſenting Brethren both in Church and Pariſh, have in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral been ſuch, as to entitle them to my eſteem and grateful remembrance. Therefore, without making any invidious diſtinctions, let me affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately apply the ſubject to all.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, my friends, ſtudy to <hi>be perfect.</hi> Let each individual rectify what is amiſs in his own temper and conduct; and then let him labor to reform, to edify and to perfect the whole body, of which he is member. While you are thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, <hi>be of good comfort.</hi> Though a dark cloud ſhould long hang over your affairs, yet in the way of duty, cheerfully and reſolutely truſt in Him, who is Head over all things to his Church.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026243_0019_0FCFAAA654FB0478"/>
Labor to <hi>be of one mind.</hi> Carefully maintain that union of religious ſentiments, which has ſo long been your honor and happineſs. Be on your guard againſt new and ſtrange doctrines, which would turn you aſide from the <hi>good old way.</hi> Be not too haſtily carried away with <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> on account of their popular talents, their flowing eloquence, or apparent religious zeal. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there have been inſtances of agreeable pulpit gifts and fervor, yea, of excellent evangelical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, where there has been but little ſolid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſound knowledge and learning; or where the private character of the preachers has been very imprudent, unſtable and vain, yea, perhaps directly immoral; or where dangerous principles have been artfully concealed or varniſhed, until the ſpeakers have gained a large and firm intereſt in the people's affections, or have ſecured a good ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement among them; and then they have aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage to bring forward their obnoxious pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities. Theſe notorious facts admoniſh you, my friends, to exerciſe the greateſt care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in the trial of candidates; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to inſiſt upon authentic written teſtimonials from ſome approved miniſters, in favor of ſuch as come to you from any diſtant part of the country.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026243_0020_0FCFAAA2B34A7E40"/>
Let me further entreat you, in your probation of preachers, to direct your principal attention to the <hi>matter</hi> of their diſcourſes, and to compare this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their private converſation and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the form of ſound words contained in the bible, and with the ſcriptural characters of a good miniſter or goſpel biſhop. If you find, on ſuch examination, that you have a candidate, who in a good meaſure comes up to this ſtandard, be ready with one mind to embrace him. Let not an unbounded deſire of novelty, or an over-nice and difficult taſte, or any conſideration of mere fancy prevent you from peaceably uniting in the choice of ſuch a preacher.</p>
            <p>But though you ſhould not agree in every punctilio reſpecting either preachers or doctrines, yet be of one mind, with regard to mutual chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian affection. In order to keep alive this union, be very cautious againſt ſplitting into parties, and ſetting up particular favorite preachers at the head of ſeveral contending factions. In ſhort, let your united zeal be mainly employed in reviving and promoting the power and practice of true godlineſs in yourſelves and in one another. Be of one mind in this great cauſe, in which all good
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026243_0021_0FCF8B86E1899A10"/>
men are agreed. This will divert your zeal from thoſe leſſer matters, which are ſo apt to divide chriſtian brethren: It will operate as a powerful cement of chriſtian union and fellowſhip; and it will happily conduce to rectify and harmonize your ſentiments upon all matters of importance, For if any man or body of men will do his will, they ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſtudy <hi>to live in peace.</hi> Extinguiſh and forever bury every thing, which might tend to blow up the coal of diſcord. Think and ſpeak of nothing but what may conduce to ſweeten your minds and ſtrengthen the cords of unity. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to peace every thing but eſſential truth and duty. Abhor the thought of making chriſtianity itſelf a ball of contention; of quarrelling about the houſe, or the preachers, the doctrines or inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of that religion, which breathes nothing but love and peace, which was wholly intended to make men one with each other, and with their God. Think how inconſiſtent and monſtrous a ſpectacle this would be! Think, on the other hand, of the beauty, the pleaſure, the advantages of chriſtian concord! How does it embalm the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026243_0022_0FCFAAA01B875D00"/>
name, and recommend the character of a religious ſociety! What an alluring charm does it preſent to preachers of the beſt deſcription to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch a people, and to breathe in their frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and delightful atmoſphere! How does it cement, invigorate, and fortify them, like a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or a city that is firmly compacted together! Above all, how does it aſſimilate them to the God of love and peace, engage his directing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting preſence with them, and ripen them for his heavenly kingdom, that region of pure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, everlaſting friendſhip and peace!</p>
            <p>Some of the motives, now ſuggeſted, ought to have peculiar weight with <hi>this</hi> flock. For you, my brethren, know, by long experience, the value and ſweetneſs of a united and peaceful ſtate, and have enjoyed a diſtinguiſhed reputation on this account, through the whole vicinity. I hope, therefore, none of you will lightly throw away ſo precious a jewel. If by loſing your Paſtor, you ſhould loſe the ornament of brotherly affection and unity, will not the ſurrounding world be apt to aſcribe your former harmony and peace, not to any real prudence or goodneſs in you, but to ſome other cauſe; and will they not reaſonably
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026243_0023_0FCF8B85751DA030"/>
conclude, that a people who had been ſo long and ſo cloſely linked together, need not, and would not have broken in pieces, had it not been for their own criminal inattention, folly, or perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! I hope and pray that your future conduct may be ſuch, as to give no occaſion for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable remarks.</p>
            <p>I cannot prevail upon myſelf to cloſe, without ſome more particular addreſſes, ſuited to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and occaſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let me direct my brotherly and chriſtian farewel to the members of this church. It is with a mournful pleaſure that my mind runs over the many ſolemn and endearing ſcenes, in which you and I have been jointly concerned, during my paſtoral connexion with you. A great part of the members of this church, who were active in my ſettlement here, are now fallen aſleep. But our eccleſiaſtical records give us the comforting information, that ſince that date a much larger number has been added to the church, than death has taken from it. Let us, my beloved Brethren and Siſters, look back, on this affecting occaſion, to the many weekly Sabbaths and monthly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which have rolled over us during that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026243_0024_0FCFAA9DCA771B90"/>
long period; and if you have formerly attended my miniſtrations in the ſanctuary or at the table of the Lord, with any ſpiritual delight or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, thankfully aſcribe the glory to God, and favor the unworthy inſtrument with your good wiſhes and prayers. However your judgments may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reſpecting the lately decided queſtion of my removal, yet ſo far as you have the ſpirit of Chriſt, your profeſſed Maſter, you will certainly feel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed tenderly to pity and pray for one who has been intimately united to you ſo many years, and to beſeech the great Fountain of wiſdom and grace to give him a right diſcernment of his duty, and a hearty practical conformity to it, and to aid and proſper him in all his laudable views and purſuits. Such prayers I ſhall eſteem a precious token of your chriſtian love; and ſhall not fail to return them, ſo long as my powers of thought, affection, or utterance remain. In the mean time, permit me to leave with you one word of brotherly counſel and admonition. Remember your high and holy profeſſion. Think how many eyes are upon you. Conſider how much the credit and intereſt of religion in this place, and among your own poſterity, will, under God, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. To you it belongs to lead in the reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026243_0025_0FCFAA9C78398E00"/>
of the goſpel miniſtry and ordinances in this Society. Let me then conjure you by all that is ſacred, to go before the congregation in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, meek, condeſcending, exemplary deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In taking my leave of this church, I bid farewel to that ſacred table, where I have ſo often ſtood and adminiſtered the bleſſed memorials of my Redeemer's dying love. It is very unlikely that we, who have ſurrounded that divine board, ſhall all meet again in that ordinance here below. Let us then part with a ſolemn reſolution of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to meet each other at the marriage ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb, where we ſhall eat bread and drink wine new with our heavenly Bridegroom, in his Father's kingdom.</p>
            <p>Let me now addreſs ſeveral claſſes of perſons in the Congregation. Firſt, thoſe of you who are <hi>heads of families</hi> will accept my beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the reſpect and hoſpitality, with which you have ever received me at your houſes; and will permit me to bring to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection the ſolemn ſcenes of ſickneſs and mourning, which have called me to moſt of your habitations during my miniſterial relation to you; and to inquire how you have improved theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026243_0026_0FCF8B840055CCD8"/>
admonitions. I muſt alſo ask you, how you have entertained the many counſels and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I have given you on the important ſubject of family-worſhip, inſtruction and government. What a happineſs ſhould I eſteem it, to be able to leave you with the agreeable aſſurance, that each of your houſes contained an altar to Jehovah, and a nurſery for Heaven! I beſeech thoſe of you, who have reſiſted all former preſſing calls to theſe great domeſtic duties, to revolve the ſubject once more in your ſerious deliberation, and to ask yourſelves, how you will meet the eye of your Judge, and of your poor neglected chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in the day of retribution. I entreat ſuch as have hitherto neglected the baptiſmal dedication of their offspring to God, to conſider whether their excuſes for this omiſſion will bear the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the final judgment. I once more call upon thoſe, who, having viſibly devoted themſelves and their houſes to God, yet neglect a religious care both of themſelves and their baptized off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, or do not ſeriouſly preſs forward, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their ſolemn vows, towards the mark of complete preparation for, and attendance on all divine inſtitutions: I beg ſuch to realize how they will account at laſt for this inconſiſtent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026243_0027_0FCFAA98A83DE910"/>
or how they can expect to be owned as Chriſt's friends, when they have not been careful to do whatſoever he has commanded.</p>
            <p>You, who are heads of families in this place, will remember, that the removal of your Paſtor leaves a double weight of duty upon you. To you it belongs to ſupply, as far as poſſible, the want of a public Shepherd, by taking ſpecial care of the Lambs of the flock; by adminiſtering to them the beſt perſonal inſtruction and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; by providing for them the beſt ſchools of education, and by endeavouring to the utmoſt to guard them againſt thoſe evils, which are too apt to ſpring-up in the ſoil of a deſtitute Pariſh, at leaſt among the young and unthinking; I mean more eſpecially a ſpirit of indifference, forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contempt reſpecting religion in general; particularly the Sabbath and its public ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the preachers and miniſters of the goſpel; or elſe an itching, unſettled, diſtracted habit, in reference to theſe matters. Theſe evils will be more l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ely to infect the riſing generation, if their parents and ſuperiors countenance them by their example. I hope therefore, that every governor of a family here, will be peculiarly watchful over his own lips and actions, from a tender regard to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026243_0028_0FCF8B830A03D7C0"/>
the many children and youth of this flock, as well as to the general order and peace of the Society.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I now turn myſelf to the <hi>younger part</hi> of the congregation. I want words, my dear young friends to expreſs my tender feelings for you at this affecting moment. My mind flies back to thoſe ſolemn and endearing ſeaſons, when I publicly adminiſtered to many of you the ordinance of baptiſm; called over you the ſacred name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and ſet you apart to be God's children. The yearly catechizing ſeaſons too, in which I have with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure attempted to convey divine knowledge and pious impreſſions into your opening minds; theſe ruſh with peculiar force upon my memory and heart. And now, what can I ſay to you in this farewel addreſs, but what I have often repeated both in public and private? Remember your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Redeemer in the golden days of your youth: Reverence his name, his worſhip, his ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, his miniſters: Honor and obey your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and teachers: Flee all youthful luſts and vanities: Pray and give thanks to God every day for your daily mercies; and eſpecially, pray earneſtly that God would give you another miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026243_0029_0FCFAA928EDFA5D0"/>
much better and more ſucceſsful than he has been, who is about to leave you. At the ſame time be aſſured, that your late Paſtor leaves you, not becauſe he does not love you; but becauſe he thinks his Maſter calls him to a place where he may do much greater good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope, therefore, you will ſtill love him, and pray for his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and alſo continue to love and reſpect all the worthy miniſters around you. Let me particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caution you againſt diſaffection to thoſe miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who have adviſed my diſmiſſion from you. Though their judgment in this inſtance croſſes your feelings, yet you will always find them your faithful friends. If you treat them, and all preachers of good character with reſpect, this will have great influence to encourage ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man to come and ſettle among you as your Paſtor. And let me remind you, my dear youths, that your own intereſt for time and eternity, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly depends upon your obtaining ſuch a miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Finally, it will always give me great joy to hear that the children of this beloved ſociety are walking in the truth. I ſhall ever welcome any of you or your parents, as viſitants to my new habitation; and ſhall take peculiar pleaſure in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting thoſe of you, who may repair to that ſeat
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026243_0030_0FCFAA9111273470"/>
of learning, with which I am connected, for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic education. And ſince I know not that I ſhall ever addreſs you again, let me adopt and leave with you the parting, dying charge of David to his Son Solomon; <hi>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind: If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cloſe with taking my ſolemn leave of thoſe two great claſſes of people, into which this, and all our religious ſocieties are divided; I mean ſinners and ſaints, Thoſe of you, who belong to the former claſs, have to this moment oppoſed, in your hearts and practice, all the ſolemn and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate inſtructions, warnings, entreaties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſives, which have been uſed by your late Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and other Ambaſſadors of Jeſus: And though you have generally profeſſed to eſteem and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the public miniſtrations which you have enjoyed in this place; yet they have only pleaſed your ears and your fancies, or at beſt made but a ſuperficial and tranſient impreſſion upon your conſciences and natural affections, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any hearty abiding love and obedience to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026243_0031_0FCF8B7F861CF4E8"/>
the truth. The thought of leaving any of you in ſo melancholy a ſituation, is truly painful; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I look forward to that awful day, when you and your late miniſter muſt meet again at the tribunal of our common Judge. Then it will be known to all worlds how I have preached, and how you have heard and treated the meſſages I brought you. If it ſhall then appear that I have in the main (though I am ſenſible with very great and ſinful imperfections) delivered and enforced the important ſaving truths of the goſpel, what conſcious guilt, what ſhivering horror muſt ſeize thoſe of you, who have ungratefully and finally rejected theſe truths; who have trampled under foot all the tender reiterated offers of infinite grace and everlaſting ſalvation! With regard to ſuch perſons, every prayer, ſermon, exhortation, yea, every mean of religion which they have at any time attended and enjoyed, will be a freſh witneſs againſt them, and fall like a weighty mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone on their guilty heads! But, what a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, what a rapturous meeting will that be to thoſe of you, who have not only profeſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and friendſhip for your late unworthy, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al guide, but have loved and obeyed the divine
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026243_0032_0FCFAA8F8CA35230"/>
truths which he has imparted to you; have truly reliſhed and fed upon a preached goſpel, and have found it ſweeter and more nouriſhing to your ſpiritual natures, than honey, or the honey-comb is to your animal. If I ſhould be ſo happy as to be found in the ſame claſs with you in that day, how endearing, how tranſporting will be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview! how complete our union and fellowſhip! how high will our mutual congratulations and thankſgivings riſe! If our affection to each other is ſo great in this imperfect ſtate; if the pleaſure of meeting together in religious and even civil communion has been ſo ſweet; what will be the friendſhip, the reciprocal endearments and joys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a faithful miniſter and his pious ſaved people, in the world of perfect everlaſting love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment! O may theſe great ideas and proſpects have their full effect both upon you and me! May they ſooth the anguiſh of our preſent ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!
