            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is merely in compliance with cuſtom I ſit down to write a Preface. Dr. <hi>Goldſmith'</hi>s writings need not an eulogium at this hour: they may be compared to the invaluable paintings of <hi>Raphael;</hi> the longer they are in the world, their eſtimation becomes more extenſive. Time has drawn the veil of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion over the works of many writers, once renowned (if we may credit tradition) for every perfection that captivates. Nature was certainly wanting to enrich thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. What ſhe has had a hand in, Time reverences, and a final diſſolution can only deſtroy. How happy, then, muſt the hallowed ſpirit of <hi>Goldſmith</hi> be, whoſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wear the ſimple brilliancy of Nature,

            <head>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.</head>
            <p>FAME, the only inflexible friend of Genius, has been ſingularly kind to the Author whoſe life I with much pleaſure ſit down to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. She has ſounded the praiſes of her favourite to the extremities of taſte and literary refinement. The Court and the Cottage ſhare with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant ſtudies! The ſmalleſt memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and ſimplicity, or a balm for the wounded ſoul of the comfortleſs! Hence the lovers of human excellence have been ſedulous in eſtabliſhing our writer's reputation on the baſis of immortality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goldſmith'</hi>s biographers have been many; their opinions, in ſome meaſure, different; but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius, unbounded philanthropy, and poſſeſſing the milk
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148"/>
of human kindneſs in a ſupereminent degree. I have their ſeveral accounts before me; and, upon an impartial ſurvey, Dr. <hi>Glover'</hi>s ſtands higheſt in my eſtimation. He was <hi>Goldſmith'</hi>s intimate friend, a companion in many of his literary purſuits, and his enthuſiaſtic admirer! What ſuch a writer ſays, as far as relates to facts, muſt be liſtened to with more pleaſure than a mere work of fiction, however elaborate, or ſplendidly ſet off. It gives me pleaſure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion, for many particulars relative to Dr. <hi>Goldſmith.</hi> I ſhall give his account entire, marked with double commas,</p>
            <p>"<hi>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</hi> was born at <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the year 1731. His father, who poſſeſſed a ſmall eſtate in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had nine ſons, of which <hi>Oliver</hi> was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well inſtructed in the claſſics, was, with his brother the Rev. <hi>Henry Goldſmith,</hi> placed in <hi>Trinity</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, <hi>Dublin,</hi> about the latter end of the year 1749. In this ſeminary of learning he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few years, when he took a Bachelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, <hi>Oliver,</hi> by the advice of Dean <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> of <hi>Cork,</hi> turned his thoughts to the profeſſion of phyſic, and,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148"/>
after attending ſome courſes of anatomy in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> proceeded to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the year 1751, where he ſtudied the ſeveral branches of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine under the different Profeſſors in that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which was deſervedly ranked among the firſt ſchools of phyſic in <hi>Europe.</hi> His benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent diſpoſition ſoon involved him in unexpected difficulties, and he was obliged precipitately to leave <hi>Scotland,</hi> in conſequence of engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to pay a conſiderable ſum of money for a fellow-ſtudent.</p>
            <p>"A few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at <hi>Sunderland,</hi> near <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where he was arreſted at the ſuit of one <hi>Barclay,</hi> a taylor in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to whom he had given ſecurity for his friend. By the good graces of <hi>Laughlin Maclane,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> and Dr. <hi>Sleigh,</hi> who were then in the college, he was ſoon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his paſſage on board a <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhip to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> whence, after a ſhort ſtay, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> He then viſited great part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and, after paſſing ſome time at <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and <hi>Lovain,</hi> where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Phyſic, he accompanied an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> gentleman to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"It is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, unfortunate man, made moſt part of his tour on foot! He had left <hi>England</hi> with very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and, being of a philoſophical turn, and at
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030"/>
that time poſſeſſing a body capable of ſuſtaining every fatigue, and a heart not eaſily terrified at danger, he became an enthuſiaſt to the deſign he had formed of ſeeing the manners of different countries. He had ſome knowledge of the <hi>French</hi> language, and of muſic; he played tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well on the <hi>German</hi> flute; which, from an amuſement, became at ſome times the means of ſubſiſtence. His learning produced him an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable reception at moſt of the religious houſes, and his muſic made him welcome to the peaſants of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> 'Whenever I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached a peaſant's houſe towards night-fall,' he uſed to ſay, 'I played one of my moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but ſubſiſtence for the next day: but in truth,' (his conſtant expreſſion) 'I muſt own, whenever I attempted to entertain perſons of a higher rank, they always thought my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance odious, and never made me any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for my endeavours to pleaſe them.'</p>
            <p>"On his arrival at <hi>Geneva,</hi> he was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as a proper perſon for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a conſiderable ſum of money by his uncle, Mr. <hi>S</hi>—. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſee the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a proviſo, that he ſhould be permitted to govern himſelf; and our
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030"/>
traveller ſoon found his pupil underſtood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing paſſion</p>
            <p>"During <hi>Goldſmith'</hi>s continuance in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he aſſiduouſly cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given ſome ſtriking proofs at the college of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It was from hence he ſent the firſt ſketch of his delightful epiſtle, called <hi>The Traveller,</hi> to his bother, the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who, giving up fame and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, had retired, with an amiable wife, to happineſs and obſcurity, on an income of only 401. a year.</p>
            <p>"From <hi>Geneva,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goldſmith</hi> and his pupil viſited the South of <hi>France,</hi> where the young man, upon ſome diſagreement with his preceptor, paid him the ſmall part of his ſalary which was due, and embarked at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and paſſed through a number of difficulties in traverſing the greateſt part of <hi>France.</hi> At length, his curioſity being grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he bent his courſe towards <hi>England,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Dover,</hi> the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</p>
            <p>"His finances were ſo low on his return to <hi>England,</hi> that he with difficulty got to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, his whole ſtock of caſh amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>London,</hi> his mind was filled with the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0"/>
moſt gloomy reflections, in conſequence of his embarraſſed ſituation! He applied to ſeveral apothecaries, in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman; but his broad <hi>Iriſh</hi> accent, and the uncouthneſs of his appearance, occaſioned him to meet with inſult from moſt of the medicinal tribe. The next day, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a chymiſt near <hi>Fiſh-ſtreet,</hi> ſtruck with his forlorn condition, and the ſimplicity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he diſcovered his old friend Dr. <hi>Sleigh</hi> was in <hi>London.</hi> This gentleman received him with the warmeſt affection, and liberally invited him to ſhare his purſe till ſome eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be procured for him. <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> unwilling to be a burthen to his friend, a ſhort time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him, to aſſiſt the late Rev. Dr. <hi>Milner,</hi> in inſtructing the young gentlemen at the academy at <hi>Peckham;</hi> and acquitted himſelf greatly to the Doctor's ſatisfaction for a ſhort time; but, having obtained ſome reputation by the criticiſms he had written in the <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffiths,</hi> the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, reſolving to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the profeſſion of writing, he returned to <hi>London,</hi> as the mart where abilities of every kind were ſure of meeting diſtinction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the ſtricteſt oeconomy, and took lodgings in
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0"/>
               <hi>Green-Arbour Court,</hi> in the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> where he wrote ſeveral ingenious pieces. The late Mr. <hi>Newbery,</hi> who at that time gave great encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him as one of the writers in the <hi>Public Ledger,</hi> in which his <hi>Citizen of the World</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally appeared, under the title of '<hi>Chineſe Letters.</hi>'</p>
            <p>"<hi>Fortune</hi> now ſeemed to take ſome notice of a man ſhe had long neglected. The ſimplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of reſpectable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and he emerged from his ſhabby apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments near the <hi>Old-Bailey</hi> to the politer air of the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he took handſome chambers, and lived in a genteel ſtyle. The publication of his <hi>Traveller,</hi> his <hi>Vicar of Wakefield,</hi> and his <hi>Letters on the Hiſtory of England,</hi> was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the performance of his comedy of <hi>The Good-natured Man,</hi> at <hi>Covent-garden</hi> theatre, and placed him in the firſt rank of the poets of the preſent age.</p>
            <p>"Our Doctor, as he was now univerſally call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had a conſtant levee of his diſtreſſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; whoſe wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave himſelf even without a guinea, in order to ſupply the neceſſities of others!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="unknown:032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550"/>
"Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <hi>Deſerted Village,</hi> the bookſeller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy; which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it was a very great ſum for ſo ſhort a performance. 'In truth,' replied <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> 'I think ſo too; it is much more than the honeſt man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been eaſy ſince I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;' which he abſolutely did, and left it entirely to the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to pay him according to the profits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſale of the poem, which turned out very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>"During the laſt rehearſal of his comedy, intitled, <hi>She Stoops to Conquer,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had no opinion would ſucceed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of <hi>Tony Lampkin'</hi>s ſpeeches, being apprehenſive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenneſs replied, 'Pſha, my dear Doctor, do not be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>ſquibs,</hi> when we have been ſitting almoſt theſe two hours upon a <hi>barrel of gunpowder!</hi>' The piece, however, contrary to Mr. <hi>Colman'</hi>s expectation, was received with uncommon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe by the audience; and <hi>Goldſmith'</hi>s pride was ſo hurt by the ſeverity of the above obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550"/>
that it entirely put an end to his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the gentleman who made it.</p>
            <p>"Notwithſtanding the great ſucceſs of his pieces, by ſome of which, it is aſſerted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800l. in one year, his circumſtances were by no means in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſituation! partly owing to the liberality of his diſpoſition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and conſequently became the prey of thoſe who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</p>
            <p>"Juſt before his death, he had formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for executing an <hi>Univerſal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,</hi> the proſpectus of which he actually printed, and diſtributed among his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. In this work, ſeveral of his literary friends (particularly Sir <hi>Joſhua Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beauclerc,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>) had engaged to furniſh him with articles upon differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubjects. He had entertained the moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations from the ſucceſs of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the bookſellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive; and he uſed to lament this circumſtance almoſt to the laſt hour of his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>"He had been for ſome years afflicted, at different times, with a violent ſtrangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78"/>
of his life; and which, united with the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſuffered upon other occaſions, brought on a kind of habitual deſpondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in his diſſolution on the 4th day of <hi>April,</hi> 1774, in the forty-third year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had determined to bury him in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Lord <hi>Shelburne,</hi> Lord <hi>Louth,</hi> Sir <hi>Joſhua Reynolds,</hi> the Hon. Mr. <hi>Beauclerc,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edmund Burke,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Garrick;</hi> but, from ſome unaccountable circumſtances, this deſign was dropped, and his remains were privately depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Temple</hi> burial-ground.</p>
            <p>"As to his character, it is ſtrongly illuſtrated by Mr. <hi>Pope'</hi>s line;
<q>
                  <l>'In wit a man, ſimplicity a child.'</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"The learned leiſure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by diſtreſſes which aroſe from the openneſs of his temper, and which ſometimes threw him into loud fits of paſſion; but this impetuoſity was corrected upon a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reflection; and his ſervants have been known, upon theſe occaſions, purpoſely to throw themſelves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78"/>
fortune to be reproved, was certain of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for it. His diſappointments at other times made him peeviſh and ſullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood over his misfortunes: a circumſtance which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the increaſe of his malady.</p>
            <p>"The univerſal eſteem in which his poems are held, and the repeated pleaſure they give in the peruſal, is a ſtriking teſt of their merit. He was a ſtudious and correct obſerver of nature, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the ſelection of his images, in the choice of his ſubjects, and in the harmony of his verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, though his embarraſſed ſituation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from putting the laſt hand to many of his productions, his <hi>Hermit,</hi> his <hi>Traveller,</hi> and his <hi>Deſerted Village,</hi> bid fair to claim a place among the moſt finiſhed pieces in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language.</p>
            <p>"The writer of theſe anecdotes cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without declaring, that, as different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts have been given of this ingenious man, theſe are all founded upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the moſt friendly footing for a great number of years, and who nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er felt any ſorrow more ſenſibly than that which was occaſioned by his death."</p>
            <p>Let it be turned to what theme it will, the opinion of an elevated literary character will ſucceed beſt with the million. Let us hear what

Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſays of our author, in his Life of <hi>Parnell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE Life of Dr. <hi>Parnell</hi> is a taſk which I ſhould very willingly decline, ſince it has been lately written by <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> a man of ſuch variety of powers, and ſuch felicity of performance, that he always ſeemed to do beſt that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediouſneſs, and general without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whoſe language was copious without exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernace, exact without conſtraint, and eaſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakneſs.</p>
            <p>"What ſuch an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an abſtract from his larger nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and ſhall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius."</p>
            <p>The moſt intereſting part of the account which Mr. <hi>Davies</hi> has given of our author, in his Life of <hi>Garrick,</hi> deſerves the reader's attention. The latter part of it exhibits to mankind, feelings of the firſt quality in nature.</p>
            <p>"EVERY thing of <hi>Goldſmith</hi> ſeems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter; no man took leſs pains, and yet produced ſo powerful an effect; the great beauty of his compoſition conſiſts in a clear, copious, and expreſſive ſtyle.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Goldſmith</hi> was ſo ſincere a man, that he could not conceal what was uppermoſt in his mind: ſo far from deſiring to appear in the eye of the
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:032200_0009_0FF183621F3E98A0"/>
world to the beſt advantage, he took more pains to be eſteemed worſe than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.</p>
            <p>"His diſpoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mind was tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate; no unhappy perſon ever ſued to him for relief, without obtaining it, if he had any thing to give; and, rather than not relieve the diſtreſſed, he would borrow. The poor woman, with whom he had lodged, during his obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeveral years in <hi>Green-Arbour Court,</hi> by his death loſt an excellent friend; for the Doctor often ſupplied her with food from his table, and viſited her frequently with the ſole purpoſe to be kind to her. He had his diſlike, as moſt men have, to particular people, but unmixed with rancour. He, leaſt of all mankind, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Baretti'</hi>s converſation; he conſidered him as an inſolent, over-bearing foreigner; as <hi>Baretti,</hi> in his turn, thought him an unpoliſhed man, and an abſurd companion: but, when this unhappy <hi>Italian</hi> was charged with murder, and afterwards ſent by Sir <hi>John Fielding</hi> to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Goldſmith</hi> opened his purſe, and would have given him every ſhilling it contained; he, at the ſame time, inſiſted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement."</p>
            <p>A handſome Monument was erected to his Memory, ſome time ſince, in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> in the Poets' Corner, between <hi>Gay'</hi>s and the Duke of <hi>Argyle'</hi>s.</p>

               <head>STORY OF MISS SYLVIA S—.</head>
               <p>MISS SYLVIA S—was deſcended from one of the beſt families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her ſiſter's deceaſe. She had early in life been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into company, and contracted a paſſion for elegance and expence. It is uſual to make the heroine of a ſtory very witty, and very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and ſuch circumſtances are ſo ſurely expected, that they are ſcarce attended to. But whatever the fineſt poet could conceive of wit, or the moſt celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this young lady. Her ſuperiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had ſeen her. She was naturally gay, generous to a fault, good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to the higheſt degree, affable in converſation;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0"/>
and ſome of her letters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> other writings, as well in verſe as proſe, would have ſhone amongſt thoſe of the moſt celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been publiſhed.</p>
               <p>But theſe great qualifications were marked by another, which leſſened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honor ſuffered by her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence; I only mean, ſhe had no knowledge of the uſe of money; ſhe relieved diſtreſs, by putting herſelf into the circumſtances of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whoſe wants ſhe ſupplied.</p>
               <p>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new flattery, had taught her to think ſhe could never be forſaken, and never poor. Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of ſucceſs, from a number of lovers; and yet I have ſeldom ſeen a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an huſband in any. Before the choice is fixed, ſhe has either loſt her reputation, or her good ſenſe; and the loſs of either is ſufficient to conſign her to perpetual virginity.</p>
               <p>Among the number of this young lady's lovers, was the celebrated <hi>S</hi>—, who, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0"/>
pity, his generoſity, and even his friendſhips, were all in exceſs: he was unable to make head againſt any of his ſenſations or deſires; but they were in general worthy wiſhes and deſires; for he was conſtitutionally virtuous. This gentleman, who at laſt died in a gaol, was, at that time, this lady's envied favourite.</p>
               <p>It is probable that he, thoughtleſs creature! had no other proſpect from this amour, but that of paſſing the preſent moments agreeably. He only courted diſſipation; but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happineſs. At length, however, his debts amounting to a conſiderable ſum, he was arreſted, and thrown into priſon. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured at firſt to conceal his ſituation from his beautiful miſtreſs; but ſhe ſoon came to a knowledge of his diſtreſs, and took a fatal reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of freeing him from confinement by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all the demands of his creditors.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Then Maſter of the Ceremonies at Bath.</hi>
                  </note> was at that time in <hi>London,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the thoughtleſs young lady, that ſuch a meaſure would effectually ruin both; that ſo warm a concern for the intereſts of Mr <hi>S</hi>—, would, in the firſt place, quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our ſex, and, what was worſe, leſſen her reputation in thoſe of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <hi>S</hi>—from priſon, would be only a temporary relief; that a mind ſo
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0"/>
generous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and, inſtead of improving in friendſhip or affection, he would only ſtudy to avoid a creditor he could never repay: that, though ſmall favours produce good-will, great ones deſtroy friendſhip. Theſe admonitions, however, were diſregarded; and ſhe too late found the prudence and truth of her adviſer. In ſhort, her fortune was by this means exhauſted; and, with all her attractians, ſhe found her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance began to diſeſteem her, in proportion as ſhe became poor.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation ſhe accepted Mr. <hi>Naſh'</hi>s invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of returning to <hi>Bath.</hi> He promiſed to introduce her to the beſt company there; and he was aſſured that her merit would do the reſt. Upon her very firſt appearance, ladies of the higheſt diſtinction courted her friendſhip and eſteem; but a ſettled melancholy had taken poſſeſſion of her mind, and no amuſements that they could propoſe were ſufficient to divert it. Yet ſtill, as if from habit, ſhe followed the crowd in its levities, and frequented thoſe places where all perſons endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forget themſelves in the buſtle of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſhow.</p>
               <p>Her beauty, her ſimplicity, and her unguarded ſituation, ſoon drew the attention of a deſigning wretch, who at that time kept one of the Rooms at <hi>Bath,</hi> and who thought that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0"/>
This woman's name was Dame <hi>Lindſey,</hi> a creature, who, though vicious, was in appearance ſanctified; and, though deſigning, had ſome wit and humour. She began, by the humbleſt aſſiduity, to ingratiate herſelf with Miſs <hi>S</hi>—; ſhewed that ſhe could be amuſing as a companion, and, by frequent offers of money, proved that ſhe could be uſeful as a friend. Thus, by degrees, ſhe gained an entire aſcendant over this poor, thoughtleſs, deſerted girl; and, in leſs than one year, namely, about 1727, Miſs <hi>S</hi>—, without ever tranſgreſſing the laws of virtue, had entirely loſt her reputation. Whenever a perſon was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame <hi>Lindſey's, Sylvia,</hi> as ſhe was then familiarly called, was ſent for, and was obliged to ſuffer all thoſe ſlights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their in feriors in point of fortune.</p>
               <p>In moſt, even the greateſt minds, the heart at laſt becomes level with the meanneſs of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but in this charming girl it ſtruggled hard with adverſity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with ſullen reluctance.</p>
               <p>But though in the courſe of three years ſhe was in the very eye of public inſpection, yet Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the ſtricteſt obſervations, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of ſuffering herſelf to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and, at her own hazard, playing for the amuſement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408"/>
of others. Her friend, Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and to rent part of Mr. <hi>Wood's</hi> houſe, in <hi>Queen-ſquare,</hi> where ſhe behaved with the utmoſt complaiſance, regularity, and virtue.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, her deteſtation of life ſtill continued; ſhe found, that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions, and that continual ſolicitude would impair the reſt. With theſe reflections ſhe would frequently entertain herſelf, and an old faithful maid, in the vales of <hi>Bath,</hi> whenever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even ſometimes ſtart queſtions in company, with ſeeming unconcern, in order to know what act of ſuicide was eaſieſt, and which was attended with the ſmalleſt pain. When tired with exerciſe, ſhe generally retired to meditation; and ſhe became habituated to early hours of ſleep and reſt. But when the weather prevented her uſual exerciſe, and her ſleep was thus more difficult, ſhe made it a rule to riſe from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till ſhe began to find an inclination for repoſe.</p>
               <p>This cuſtom made it neceſſary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room: and the maid uſually, when ſhe withdrew, locked the chamber door; and, puſhing the key under it beyond reach; her miſtreſs, by that conſtant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, lay undiſturbed until ſeven o'clock in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408"/>
morning; then ſhe aroſe, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a ſignal for the maid to return.</p>
               <p>This ſtate of ſeeming piety, regularity, and prudence continued for ſome time, till the gay, celebrated, toaſted Miſs <hi>Sylvia</hi> was ſunk into an houſekeeper to the gentleman at whoſe houſe ſhe lived. She was unable to keep company, for want of the elegancies of dreſs, that are the uſual paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port among the polite; and ſhe was too haughty to ſeem to want them. The faſhionable, the amuſing, and the polite, in ſociety, now ſeldom viſited her; and, from being once the object of every eye, ſhe was now deſerted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> and part of of his family, were gone to <hi>London.</hi> Miſs <hi>Sylvia</hi> was left with the reſt, as a governeſs, at <hi>Bath.</hi> She ſometimes ſaw Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> and acknowledged the friendſhip of his admonitions, though ſhe refuſed to accept any other marks of his generoſity than that of advice. Upon the cloſe of the day in which Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> was expected to return from <hi>London,</hi> ſhe expreſſed ſome uneaſineſs at the diſappointment of not ſeeing him; took particular care to ſettle the affairs of his family; and then, as uſual, ſat down to meditation. She now caſt a retroſpect over her paſt miſconduct, and her approaching miſery; ſhe ſaw, that even affluence gave her no real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from indigence ſhe thought nothing could
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230"/>
be hoped but lingering calamity. She at length conceived the fatal reſolution of leaving a life, in which ſhe could ſee no corner for comfort, and terminating a ſcene of imprudence in ſuicide.</p>
               <p>Thus reſolved, ſhe ſat down at her dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room window, and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window:
<q>
                     <l>O Death! thou pleaſing end of human woe!</l>
                     <l>Thou cure for life! Thou greateſt good below!</l>
                     <l>Still may'ſt thou fly the coward, and the ſlave,</l>
                     <l>And thy ſoft ſlumbers only bleſs the brave.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She then went into company with the moſt cheerful ſerenity; talked of indifferet ſubjects till ſupper, which ſhe ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There ſhe ſpent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <hi>Wood's</hi> children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber, ſhe went into the nurſery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay ſleeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the conſciouſneſs of her meditated guilt, ſhe could not avoid burſting into tears, and hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it in her arms; ſhe then bid her old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a good night, for the firſt time ſhe had ever done ſo, and went to bed as uſual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230"/>
It is probable ſhe ſoon quitted her bed, and was ſeized with an alternation of paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe yielded to the impulſe of deſpair. She dreſſed herſelf in clean linen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her breaſt, juſt as a nurſe pins the ſwaddling cloaths of an infant. A pink ſilk girdle was the inſtrument with which ſhe reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to terminate her miſery, and this was length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by another made of gold thread. The end of the former was tied with a nooſe, and the latter with three knots, at a ſmall diſtance from one another.</p>
               <p>Thus prepared, ſhe ſat down again, and read; for ſhe left the book open at that place, in the ſtory of <hi>Olympia,</hi> in the <hi>Orlando Furioſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſto,</hi> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her boſom friend, ſhe was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event gave her freſh ſpirits to go through her fatal purpoſe; ſo ſtanding upon a ſtool, and fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a cloſet-door that opened into her chamber, ſhe remained ſuſpended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor deſpairer fell upon the floor with ſuch violence, that her fall awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a workman that lay in the houſe, about half an hour after two o'clock.</p>

               <p>What they want, however, in gaiety, they make up in politeneſs.

But I muſt ſtill repeat it, the Engliſh ſeem more polite than any of their neighbours: their great art in this reſpect lies in endeavouring, while they oblige, to leſſen the force of the favour. Other countries are fond of obliging a ſtranger; but ſeem deſirous that he ſhould be ſenſible of the obligation. The Engliſh confer their kindneſs with an appearance of indifference, and give away benefits with an air as if they deſpiſed them.</p>

               <p>ALL things rare and brilliant will ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be faſhionable, while men derive greater advantage from opulence than virtue; while the means of appearing conſiderable are more eaſily acquired than the title to be conſidered. The firſt impreſſion we generally make, ariſes from our dreſs; and this varies in conformity to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and the manner in which we deſire to be conſidered. The modeſt man, or he who would wiſh to be thought ſo, deſires to ſhew the ſimplicity of his mind by the plainneſs of his dreſs: the vain man, on the contrary, takes a pleaſure in diſplaying his ſuperiority, "and is willing to incur the ſpectator's diſlike, ſo he does but excite his attention."</p>

               <p>OF all virtues Juſtice is the moſt difficult to be practiſed by a king who has a power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. All men, even tyrants themſelves, lean to mercy when unbiaſſed by paſſions or intereſt.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032200_0026_0FF183938384ECB8"/>
we are led to prefer our private ſatisfaction to public utility. What a thorough love for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, what a ſtrong command over the paſſions, what a finely conducted judgment muſt he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, who oppoſes the dictates of reaſon to thoſe of his heart, and prefers the future intereſt of his people to his own immediate ſatisfaction!</p>
               <p>If ſtill to a man's own natural biaſs for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we add the numerous ſolicitations made by a criminal's friends for mercy; if we ſurvey a king not only oppoſing his own feelings, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing thoſe he regards, and this to ſatisfy the public, whoſe cries he may never hear, whoſe gratitude he may never receive; this ſurely is true greatneſs! Let us fancy ourſelves for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this juſt old man's place, ſurrounded by numbers, all ſoliciting the ſame favour, a favour that nature diſpoſes us to grant, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to pity are laid before us in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light, ſuppliants at our feet, ſome ready to reſent a refuſal, none oppoſing a compliance; let us, I ſay, ſuppoſe ourſelves in ſuch a ſituation, and I fancy we ſhould find ourſelves more apt to act the character of good-natured men than of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>What contributes to raiſe juſtice above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingly virtues, is, that it is attended ſeldom with a due ſhare of applauſe, and thoſe who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it muſt be influenced by greater motives than empty fame. The people are generally well

pleaſed with a remiſſion of puniſhment, and all that wears the appearance of humanity; it is the wiſe alone who are capable of diſcerning that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice is the trueſt mercy: they know it to be difficult, very difficult, at once to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and yet condemn an object that pleads for tenderneſs.</p>

               <p>WHEN men arrive at a certain ſtation of greatneſs, their regards are diſſipated on too great a number of objects to feel parental affection: the ties of nature are only ſtrong with thoſe who have but few friends, or few dependants.</p>

               <p>TO rejoice at the deſtruction of our enemies, is a foible grafted upon human nature, and we muſt be permitted to indulge it: the true way of atoning for ſuch an ill-founded pleaſure, is thus to turn our triumph into an act of benevolence, and to teſtify our own joy by endeavouring to baniſh anxiety from others.</p>

The lantern, with ten thouſand tapers, was not yet brought forth; the fire-works, which uſually covered the city walls, were not yet lighted: the people once more began to murmur at this delay; when in the midſt of their impatience, the palace gates flew open, and the emperor himſelf appeared, not in ſplendor or magnificence, but in an ordinary habit, followed by the blind, the maimed, and the ſtrangers of the city, all in new clothes, and each carrying in his hand money enough to ſupply his neceſſities for the year.

               <p>ASSUMING IGNORANCE is, of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the moſt ridiculous: for, in the ſame proportion as the real man of wiſdom is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the unlettered ruſtic, ſo much is the ruſtic ſuperior to him, who without learning imagines himſelf learned. It were better that ſuch a man had never read; for then he might have been conſcious of his weakneſs: but the half-learned man, relying upon his ſtrength, ſeldom perceives his wants till he finds his deception paſt a cure.</p>

               <head>UTILITY OF NEW BOOKS.</head>
               <p>IN proportion as ſociety refines, new books muſt ever become more neceſſary. Savage ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is reclaimed by oral admonition alone: but the elegant exceſſes of refinement are beſt corrected by the ſtill voice of ſtudious enquiry. In a polite age, almoſt every perſon becomes a reader, and receives more inſtruction from the preſs than the pulpit. The preaching Bonſe may inſtruct the illiterate peaſant; but nothing leſs than the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating addreſs of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. Books are neceſſary to correct the vices of the polite; but thoſe vices are ever changing, and the antidote ſhould be changed accordingly,—ſhould ſtill be new.</p>
               <p>Inſtead, therefore, of thinking the number of new publications too great, I could wiſh it ſtill greater, as they are the moſt uſeful inſtruments of reformation. Every country muſt be inſtructed either by <hi>writers</hi> or <hi>preachers;</hi> but as the number of readers increaſes, the number of hearers is proportionably diminiſhed,—the writer becomes more uſeful, and the preaching Bonſe leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Inſtead, therefore, of complaining that writers are overpaid, when their works procure them a

               <p>Women, it has been obſerved, are not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally formed for great cares themſelves, but to ſoften ours. Their tenderneſs is the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the dangers we undergo for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and the eaſe and cheerfulneſs of their converſation, our deſirable retreat from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of intenſe application. They are confined within the narrow limits of domeſtic aſſiduity; and when they ſtray beyond them, they move beyond their ſphere, conſequently without grace.</p>

Her father being dead, ſhe lived with her aged mother, in their cottage covered with ſtraw; and both, though very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands ſhe ſupported her parent, who was now incapable of ſupporting herſelf. While <hi>Catharina</hi> ſpun, the old woman would ſit by, and read ſome book of devotion; thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would ſit down contentedly by the fire-ſide, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant feſtivity.</p>
               <p>Though her face and perſon were models of perfection, yet her whole attention ſeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old <hi>Lutheran</hi> miniſter inſtructed her in the maxims and duties of religion.

                  <hi>Catharina</hi> was fifteen when her mother died: ſhe now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> miniſter, by whom ſhe had been inſtructed from her childhood. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are ever moſt heavy upon the poor; wherefore <hi>Catharina,</hi> though poſſeſſed of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accompliſhments, experienced all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hopeleſs indigence.

With her ſcanty wardrobe, packed up in a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſhe ſet out on her journey, on foot. She was to walk through a region miſerable by nature, but rendered ſtill more hideous by the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who, as each happened to become maſters, plundered it at diſcretion; but hunges had taught her to deſpiſe the dangers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the way.</p>
               <p>One evening, upon her journey, as ſhe had entered a cottage by the way-ſide, to take up her lodging for the night, ſhe was inſulted by two <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſoldiers, who inſiſted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <hi>to follow the camp.</hi> They might, probably, have carried their inſults into violence, had not a ſubaltern officer, accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſing by, come in to her aſſiſtance. Upon his appearing, the ſoldiers immediately deſiſted; but her thankfulneſs was hardly greater than her ſurpriſe, when ſhe inſtantly recollected, in her deliverer, the ſon of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> miniſter, her former inſtructor, benefactor and friend.</p>
               <p>This was an happy interview for <hi>Catharina.</hi> The little ſtock of money ſhe had brought from home was by this time quite exhauſted; her cloaths were gone, piece by piece, in order to ſatisfy thoſe who had entertained her in their houſes: her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could ſpare, to buy her clothes, furniſhed her with an horſe, and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr. <hi>Gluck,</hi> a faithful friend of his father's, and ſuperintendant of <hi>Marienburgh.</hi>

Our beautiful ſtranger had only to appear, to be well received: ſhe was immediately admitted into the ſuperintendant's family, as governeſs to his two daughters; and though yet but ſeventeen, ſhewed herſelf capable of inſtructing her ſex, not only in virtue, but politeneſs. Such was her good ſenſe and beauty, that her maſter himſelf in a ſhort time offered her his hand, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o his great ſurpriſe ſhe thought proper to refuſe. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, ſhe was reſolved to marry her deliver only, even though he had loſt an arm, and was otherwiſe disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by wounds, in the ſervice.</p>
               <p>In order, therefore, to prevent further ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from others, as ſoon as the officer came to town upon duty, ſhe offered him her perſon, which he accepted with tranſport; and their nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials were ſolemnized as uſual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be ſtriking: the very day on which they were married, the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> laid ſiege to <hi>Marienburgh.</hi> The unhappy ſoldier had now no time to enjoy the well-carned pleaſures of matrimony; he was called off, before conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to an attack, from which he was never after ſeen to return.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the ſiege went on with fury, aggravated on one ſide by obſtinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent peaſant and the harmleſs virgin often ſhared
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032200_0042_0FF183BF9713DA28"/>
ſhe fate of the ſoldier in arms. <hi>Marienburgh</hi> was taken by aſſault; and ſuch was the fury of the aſſailants, that not only the garriſon, but almoſt all the inhabitants, men, women, and children, were put to the ſword. At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, <hi>Catharina</hi> was found hid in an oven.</p>
               <p>She had been hitherto poor, but ſtill was free; ſhe was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a ſlave: in this ſituation, however, ſhe behaved with piety and humility; and, though misfortunes had abated her vivacity, yet ſhe was chearful. The fame of her merit and reſignation reached even Prince <hi>Menzikoff,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> General: he deſired to ſee her, was ſtruck with her beauty, bought her from the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, her maſter, and placed her under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his own ſiſter. Here ſhe was treated with all the reſpect which her merit deſerved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</p>
               <p>She had not been long in this ſituation, when <hi>Peter the Great</hi> paying the Prince a viſit, <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> happened to come in with ſome dry fruits, which ſhe ſerved round with peculiar modeſty. The mighty monarch ſaw, and was ſtruck with her beauty. He returned the next day, called for the beautiful ſlave, aſked her ſeveral queſtions, and found her underſtanding even more perfect than her perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:032200_0043_0FF183C27185E6F8"/>
He had been forced, when young, to many from motives of intereſt; he was now reſolved to marry purſuant to his own inclinations. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enquired the hiſtory of the fair <hi>Livonian,</hi> who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of obſcurity, through all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanneſs of her birth was no obſtruction to his deſign; their nuptials were ſolemniſed in private; the Prince aſſuring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the propereſt ladder to a throne.</p>
               <p>We now ſee <hi>Catharina,</hi> from the low, mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled cottage, Empreſs of the greateſt kingdom upon earth. The poor ſolitary wanderer is now ſurrounded by thouſands, who find happineſs in her ſmile. She, who formerly wanted a meal, is now capable of diffuſing plenty upon whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To her fortune ſhe owed a part of this pre-eminence, but to her virtues more.</p>
               <p>She ever after retained thoſe great qualities which firſt placed her on a throne; and while the extraordinary prince, her huſband, laboured for the reformation of his male ſubjects, ſhe ſtudied, in her turn, the improvement of her own ſex. She altered their dreſſes, introduced mixed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, inſtituted an order of female knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and, at length, when ſhe had greatly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the ſtations of empreſs, friend, wife, and

               <p>IF you are fond of hearing <hi>hair-breadth' ſapes,</hi> my hiſtory muſt certainly pleaſe; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of ſtarving, without ever being ſtarved.</p>
               <p>My father, the younger ſon of a good family, was poſſeſſed of a ſmall living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers ſtill poorer than himſelf; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in praiſe; and this was all he wanted. The ſame ambition that actuates a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch at the head of an army, influenced my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the head of his table: he told the ſtory of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the jeſt of the two ſcholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the ſtory of Taffy in the ſedan chair were ſure to ſet the table in a roar. Thus his pleaſure increaſed, in proportion to the pleaſure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.</p>
               <p>As his fortune was but ſmall, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032200_0046_0FF183CD0946FC18"/>
leaving his children money, for that was droſs he was reſolved they ſhould have learning, for learning, he uſed to obſerve, was better than ſilver or gold. For this purpoſe he undertook to inſtruct us himſelf; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to improve our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We were told that univerſal benevolence was what firſt cemented ſociety: we were taught to conſider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <hi>human face divine</hi> with affection and eſteem: he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of withſtanding the lighteſt impulſe made either by real or ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſtreſs; in a word, we were perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the art of <hi>giving away</hi> thouſands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were taught the more neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>getting</hi> a farthing.</p>
               <p>I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his leſſons out of all my ſuſpicion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of even all the little cunning which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had given me, I reſembled, upon my firſt entrance into the buſy and inſidious world, one of thoſe gladiators who were expoſed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, however, who had only ſeen the world on one ſide, ſeemed to triumph in my ſuperior diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; though my whole ſtock of wiſdom conſiſted in being able to talk like himſelf upon ſubjects that once were uſeful, becauſe they were then topics of the buſy world, but that now were
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032200_0046_0FF183CD0946FC18"/>
utterly uſeleſs, becauſe connected with the buſy world no longer.</p>
               <p>The firſt opportunity he had of finding his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations diſappointed, was at the very middling figure I made in the Univerſity: he had flattered himſelf that he ſhould ſoon ſee me riſing into the foremoſt rank in literary reputation, but was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His diſappointment might have been partly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to his having over-rated my talents, and partly to my diſlike of mathematical reaſonings at a time when my imagination and memory, yet unſatisfied, were more eager after new objects, than deſirous of reaſoning upon thoſe I knew This did not, however, pleaſe my tutors, who obſerved, indeed, that I was a little dull; but at the ſame time allowed, that I ſeemed to be <hi>very good-natured,</hi> and had no harm in me.</p>
               <p>After I had reſided at college ſeven years, my father died, and left me—his bleſſing. Thus ſhoved from ſhore without ill-nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper ſtores to ſubſiſt me in ſo dangerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-two. But, in order to ſettle in life, my friends <hi>adviſed</hi> (for they always adviſe when they begin to deſpiſe us) they adviſed me, I ſay, to go into orders.</p>
               <p>To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a ſhort one, or a black coat, when I generally dreſſed in brown, I thought was ſuch a reſtraint
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10"/>
upon my liberty, that I abſolutely rejected the propoſal. A prieſt in England is not the ſame mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that faſts beſt, but eats beſt, is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt liver: yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence, and eaſe, from no other conſideration but that boyiſh one of dreſs; ſo that my friends were now perfectly ſatisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the leaſt harm in him, and was ſo very good-natured.</p>
               <p>Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At firſt I was ſurpriſed, that the ſituation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: there was no great trouble in liſtening at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively when his lordſhip ſpoke, and laughing when he looked round for applauſe. This even good-manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too ſoon, that his lordſhip was a greater dunce than myſelf; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at ſetting him right, than at receiving his abſurdities with ſubmiſſion. To flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe we do not know, is an eaſy taſk; but to flatter our intimate acquaintances, all whoſe foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gly in our eye, is drudgery inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. Every time I now opened my lips in praiſe, my falſhood went to my conſcience: his lordſhip ſoon perceived me to be unfit for ſervice; I was therefore diſcharged; my patron at the ſame time being graciouſly pleaſed to obſerve,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10"/>
that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the leaſt harm in me.</p>
               <p>Diſappointed in ambition, I had recourſe to love. A young lady, who lived with her aunt, and was poſſeſſed of a pretty fortune in her own diſpoſal, had given me, as I fancied, ſome reaſons to expect ſucceſs. The ſymptoms by which I was guided were ſtriking: ſhe had always laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; ſhe always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that a man of ſenſe would make a better huſband than a fool, and I as conſtantly applied the obſervation in my own favour. She conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually talked in my company of friendſhip, and the beauties of the mind, and ſpoke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd ſhoes with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe were circumſtances which I thought ſtrongly in my favour; ſo, after reſolving, and re-reſolving I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Miſs heard my propoſal with ſerenity, ſeeming at the ſame time to ſtudy the figures of her fan. Out at laſt it came. There was but one ſmall objection to complete our happineſs, which was no more than—that ſhe was married three months before to Mr. Shrimp with high-heel'd ſhoes! By way of conſolation, however, ſhe obſerved, that, though I was diſappointed in her, my addreſſes to her aunt would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably kindle her into ſenſibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350"/>
and not to have the leaſt ſhare of harm in me.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill I had friends, numerous friends; and to them I was reſolved to apply. O Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! thou fond ſoother of the human breaſt, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched ſeek for ſuccour; on thee the care-tired ſon of miſery fondly relies; from thy kind aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the unfortunate always hopes relief, and may be ever ſure of—diſappointment! My firſt application was to a city ſcrivener, who had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently offered to lend me money, when he knew I did not want it. I informed him, that now was the time to put his friendſhip to the teſt; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occaſion, and was reſolved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed, I never wanted it more, returned I. I am ſorry fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that, cries the ſcrivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways want money when they ſhould come to pay.</p>
               <p>From him I flew with indignation to one of the beſt friends I had in the world, and made the ſame requeſt. Indeed, Mr. Dry-bone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, Sir, I would not adviſe you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the higheſt degree, and ſome of your acquaintance always thought you a very ſilly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350"/>
Let me ſee—you want two hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, Sir, exactly? To confeſs a truth, returned I, I ſhall want three hundred; but then I have another friend, from whom I can borrow the reſt. Why then, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my friend, if you would take my advice—and you know I ſhould not preſume to adviſe you but for your own good—I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole ſum from that other friend; and then one note will ſerve for all, you know.</p>
               <p>Poverty now began to come faſt upon me; yet inſtead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and ſimple. A friend was arreſted for fifty pounds; I was unable to extricate him, except by becoming his bail. When at liberty, he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In priſon I expected greater ſatisfaction than I had enjoyed at large. I hoped to converſe with men in this new world, ſimple and believing like myſelf; but I found them as cunning and as cautious as thoſe in the world I had left behind. They ſpunged up my money whilſt it laſted; borrowed my coal, and never paid them; and che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> me when I played at cribbage. All this was done becauſe they believed me to be very good-natured, and knew that I had no harm in me.</p>
               <p>Upon my firſt entrance into this manſion which is to ſome the abode of diſpair; I felt no
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032200_0049_0FF183D70D771CF0"/>
ſenſations different from thoſe I experienced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. I was now on one ſide the door, and thoſe who were unconfined were on the other; this was all the difference between us. At firſt, indeed, I felt ſome uneaſineſs, in conſidering how I ſhould be able to provide this week for the wants of the week enſuing; but after ſome time, if I found myſelf ſure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied another. I ſeized every precarious meal with the utmoſt good-humour, indulged no rants of ſpleen at my ſituation, never called down heaven and all the ſtars to behold me dining upon an half-penny-worth of radiſhes; my very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were taught to believe, that I liked ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad better than mutton. I contented myſelf with thinking, that all my life I ſhould either eat white bread or brown; conſidered that all that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was beſt, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world as it went, and read Tacitus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for want of more books and company.</p>
               <p>How long I might have continued in this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſtate of ſimplicity, I cannot tell, had I not been rouſed by ſeeing an old acquaintance, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032200_0049_0FF183D70D771CF0"/>
and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, undeſigning deportment, I put on that of cloſeneſs, prudence and oeconomy. One of the moſt heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I ſhall praiſe myſelf as long as I live, was the refuſing half a crown to an old acquaintance, at the time when he wanted it, and I had it to ſpare; for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I deſerve to be decreed an ovation.</p>
               <p>I now, therefore, purſued a courſe of uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted frugality, ſeldom wanted a dinner, and was conſequently invited to twenty. I ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to get the character of a ſaving hunks that had money; and inſenſibly grew into eſteem. Neighbours have aſked my advice in the diſpoſal of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have contracted a friendſhip with an alderman, only by obſerving, that if we take a farthing from a thouſand pound, it will be a thouſand pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table, by pretending to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with a rich widow, for only having obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that bread was riſing.

               <head>EDUCATING CHILDREN.</head>
               <p>I HAVE ever found it a vain taſk to try to make a child's learning its amuſement; nor do I ſee what good end it would anſwer, were it actually attained. The child ought to have its
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032200_0053_0FF183E2ADE72110"/>
ſhare of play, and it will be benefited thereby; and for every reaſon, alſo, it ought to have its ſhare of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus accuſtomed to fatigue and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whatever be the perſon's future employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it, he will be thus enabled to ſupport the drudgeries of office with content, or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, ſhould by times be put to its duty; and we taught to know, that the taſk is to be done, or the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be endured. I do not object againſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring it to duty by reward; but we well know, that the mind will be more ſtrongly ſtimulated by pain; and both may, upon ſome occaſions, take their turn to operate. In this manner a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with them at ſchool, will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wing of any ſpeculative ſyſtem-maker; and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true, indeed, that, when educated in this manner, the boy may not be ſo ſeemingly ſenſible and forward as one bred up under ſolitary inſtruction and, perhaps, this early forwardneſs is more engaging than uſeful. It is well known, that many of thoſe children who are ſuch prodigies of literature before ten, have not made an adequate progreſs to twenty. It ſhould ſeem, that they only began learning
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032200_0054_0FF183E6C5C74B38"/>
manly things before their time; and, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were buſied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their age and curioſity, theſe were forced upon ſubjects unſuited to their years; and, upon that account alone, appearing extraordinary. The ſtock of knowledge in both may be equal; but with this difference, that each is yet to learn what the other knows.</p>

Their love was ſo great, that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in ſome meaſure, diminiſhed the huſbands aſſurance of his wife's fidelity; for love ſo refined as his, was ſubject to a thouſand little diſquietudes.</p>
               <p>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at ſome diſtance from his houſe, he there perceived a lady dreſſed in the deepeſt mourning, (being cloathed all over in white) fanning the wet clay that was raiſed over one of the graves with a large fan, which ſhe held in her hand. <hi>Choang,</hi> who had early been taught wiſdom in the ſchool of <hi>Lao,</hi> was unable to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a cauſe for her preſent employment; and, coming up, civilly demanded the reaſon, "Alas!," replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears, "how is it poſſible to ſurvive the loſs of my huſband, who li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave ſhould take up four days in drying."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choang,</hi> who was ſtruck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid ſmiling at

her haſte to be maried; but, concealing the cauſe of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſome conſolation. As ſoon as he and his gueſt were returned, he imparted to <hi>Hanſi</hi> in private what he had ſeen, and could not avoid expreſſing his uneaſineſs, that ſuch might be his own caſe, if his deareſt wife ſhould one day happen to ſurvive him.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe <hi>Hanſi'</hi>s reſentment at ſo unkind a ſuſpicion. As her paſſion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, ſhe employed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to chide his ſuſpicions: the widow herſelf was inveighed againſt; and <hi>Hanſi</hi> declared ſhe was reſolved never to ſleep under the ſame roof with a wretch, who, like, her, could be guilty of ſuch barefaced inconſtancy. The night was cold and ſtormy; however, the ſtranger was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeek another lodging, for <hi>Choang</hi> was not diſpoſed to reſiſt, and <hi>Hanſi</hi> would have her way.</p>
               <p>The widow had ſcarce been gone an hour, when an old diſciple of <hi>Choang'</hi>s whom he had not ſeen for many years, come to pay him a viſit. He was received with the utmoſt ceremony, plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt honourable feat at ſupper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ang</hi> and <hi>Hanſi</hi> exhibited open marks of mutual tenderneſs and unfeigned reconciliation: nothing could equal their apparant happineſs; ſo found
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032200_0057_0FF183EE74D3C208"/>
an huſband, ſo obedient a wife, few could behold without regreting their own infelicity; when lo! their happineſs was at once diſturbed by a moſt fatal accident. <hi>Choang</hi> fell lifeleſs in an apoplec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fit upon the floor. Every method was uſed, but in vain, for his recovery. <hi>Hanſi</hi> was at firſt inconſolable for his death: after ſome hours, however, ſhe found ſpirits to read his laſt will. The enſuing day ſhe began to moralize and talk wiſdom; the next day ſhe was able to comfort the young diſciple; and, on the third, to ſhorten a long ſtory, they both agreed to be married.</p>
               <p>There was no longer mourning in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the body of <hi>Choang</hi> was now thruſt into on old coffin, and placed in one of the meaneſt rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by law for his interment. In the mean time, <hi>Hanſi,</hi> and the young diſciple, were array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt magnificent habits; the bride wore in her noſe a jewel of immenſe price, and her lover was dreſſed in all the finery of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maſter, together with a pair of artificial whiſkers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nuptials was arrived; the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſympathiſed with their approaching happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffuſed the moſt exquiſite perfume, and a luſtre more bright than noon-day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with impatience; when his ſervant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032200_0058_0FF183F1523E1310"/>
with terror in his countenance, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that his maſter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unleſs the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his breaſt. She ſcarce waited to hear the end of his ſtory, when, tucking up her clothes, ſhe run with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where <hi>Choang</hi> lay, reſolving to apply the heart of her dead huſband as a cure for the living. She therefore ſtruck the lid with the utmoſt violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move, Terrified at the ſight, <hi>Hanſi</hi> dropped the mattock, and <hi>Choang</hi> walked out, aſtoniſhed at his own ſituation, his wife's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual magnificence, and here more amazing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cauſe of ſo much ſplendour. He was not long in ſuſpence, before his domeſtics informed him of every tranſaction ſince he firſt became inſenſible. He could ſcarce believe what they told him, and went in purſuit of <hi>Hanſi</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But ſhe prevented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood for ſhe had ſtabbed herſelf to the heart, being unable to ſurvibe her ſhame and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choang,</hi> being a philoſopher, was too wiſe to make any loud lamentations; he thought it beſt to bear his loſs with ſerenity; ſo mending up the

old coffin where he had lain himſelf, he placed his faithleſs ſpouſe in his room; and, unwilling that ſo many nuptial preparations ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in vain, he the ſame night maried the widow with the large fan.</p>
               <p>As they both were appriſed of the foibles of each other before-hand, they knew how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquility, and not expecting rapture, made a ſhift to find contentment.</p>

               <p>THERE are few ſubjects which have been more written upon, and leſs underſtood, than that of Friendſhip. To follow the dictates of ſome, this virtue, inſtead of being the aſſuager of pain, becomes the ſource of every inconvenience.

It is certain, the beſt method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it in ſome meaſure, make itſelf; a ſimilitude of minds or ſtudies, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a diverſity of purſuits, will produce all the pleaſures that ariſe from it.

                  <hi>Plautinus</hi> was a man who thought that every good was brought from riches; and as he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of great wealth, and had a mind naturaly formed for virtue, he reſolved to gather a circle of the beſt men round him. Among the number of his dependants was <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> with a mind juſt as fond of virtue, yet not leſs proud than his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. His circumſtances, however, were ſuch as forced him to ſtoop to the good offices of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032200_0062_0FF183FA3A053DB0"/>
and he ſaw himſelf daily among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others loaded with benefits and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friendſhip. Theſe, in the uſual courſe of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while he gave his eſteem, he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the moſt trifling inſtances, and <hi>Plautinus</hi> had ſkill enough to obſerve the minuteſt actions of the man he wiſhed to make his friend. In theſe he ever found his aim diſappointed; for <hi>Muſidorus</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an exchange of hearts which <hi>Plautinus,</hi> ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a variety of claims, could never think of beſtowing.</p>
               <p>It may be eaſily ſuppoſed, that the reſerve of our poor proud man, was ſoon conſtrued into ingratitude: and ſuch, indeed, in the common acceptation of the world it was. Wherever <hi>Muſidorus</hi> appeared, he was remarked as the ungrateful man; he had accepted favours, it was ſaid, and had ſtill the inſolence to pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance. The event, however, juſtified his conduct. <hi>Plautinus,</hi> by miſplaced liberality, at length became poor; and it was then that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidorus</hi> firſt thought of making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune, with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with aſſiduity; and by uniting their talents, both were at length placed in that ſtate of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</p>

To this ſtory, taken from modern life, I ſhall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:—'Two Jewiſh ſoldiers, in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> had made many campaigns together; and a participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts. They were remarked through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they felt and fought for each other. Their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous John, who headed a particular party of the Jewiſh male-contents.</p>
               <p>From this moment their former love was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the moſt inveterate enmity. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached themſelves to oppoſite factions, and ſought each other's lives in the conflict of adverſe party. In this manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge, and animated with an unconquerable ſpirit of averſion. At length, however, that party of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to which the mean ſoldier belonged, joining with the <hi>Romans,</hi> it became victorious, and drove <hi>John,</hi> with all his adherents, into the Temple. Hiſtory has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that ſuperb edifice. The <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiers were gathered round it; the whole <hi>Temple</hi> was in flames, and thouſands were ſeen amidſt them within its ſacred circuit. It
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032200_0063_0FF183FFD3111A80"/>
was in this ſituation of things, that the now-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful ſoldier ſaw his former friend upon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of the higheſt tower, looking round with horror, and juſt ready to be conſumed with flames. All his former tenderneſs now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he ſaw the man of his boſom juſt going to periſh; and, unable to withſtand the impulſe, he ran ſpreading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from the top, and find ſafety with him. The Centurion from above heard and obeyed, and, caſting himſelf from the top of the tower, into his fellow-ſoldiers's arms, both fell a ſacrifice on the ſpot; one being cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other daſhed to pieces by the greatneſs of his fall.'</p>

               <head>SABINUS AND OLINDA.</head>
               <p>IN a fair, rich, flouriſhing country, whoſe cliffs are waſhed by the German ocean, lived <hi>Sabinus,</hi> a youth formed by Nature to make a conqueſt wherever he thought proper; but the conſtancy of his diſpoſition fixed him only with <hi>Olinda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was, indeed, ſuperior to her in fortune; but that defect on her ſide was ſo amply ſupplied by her merit, that none was thought more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his regards than ſhe. He loved her, he was beloved by her; and, in a ſhort time, by joining hands publicly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, however fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, however happy, are exempt from the ſhafts of envy, and the malignant effects of ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed appetite. How unſafe, how deteſtable are they who have this fury for their guide! How certainly will it lead them from themſelves, and plunge them in errors they would have ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, even in apprehenſion! <hi>Ariana,</hi> a lady of many amiable qualities, very nearly allied to <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and highly eſteemed by him, imagined herſelf ſlighted, and injuriouſly treated, ſince his marriage with <hi>Clinda.</hi> By incautiouſly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering this jealouſly to corrode in her breaſt, ſhe began to give a looſe to paſſion; ſhe forgot thoſe many virtues, for which ſhe had been ſo long,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032200_0064_0FF184018939DCB8"/>
and ſo juſtly applauded. Cauſeleſs ſuſpicion, and miſtaken reſentment, betrayed her into all the gloom of diſcontent: ſhe ſighed without ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the happineſs of others give her intolerable pain: ſhe thought of nothing but revenge. How unlike what ſhe was, the chearful, the prudent, the compaſſionate <hi>Ariana!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She continually laboured to diſturb an union ſo firmly, ſo affectionately founded, and planned every ſcheme which ſhe thought moſt likely to diſturb it.</p>
               <p>Fortune ſeemed willing to promote her unjuſt intentions; the circumſtances of <hi>Sabinus</hi> had been long embarraſſed by a tedious law-ſuit, and the court determining the cauſe unexpectedly in favour of his opponent, it ſunk his fortune to the loweſt pitch of penury from the higheſt afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>From the nearneſs of relationſhip, <hi>Sabinus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Ariana</hi> thoſe aſſiſtances his preſent ſituation required; but ſhe was inſenſible to all his entreaties, and the juſtice of every remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, unleſs he firſt ſeparated from <hi>Olinda,</hi> whom ſhe regarded with deteſtation. Upon a compliance with her deſires in this reſpect, ſhe promiſed her fortune, her intereſt, and her all, ſhould be at his command. <hi>Sabinus</hi> was ſhocked at the propoſal; he loved his wife with inexpreſſible tenderneſs, and refuſed thoſe offers with indignation which were to be purchaſed at
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032200_0065_0FF184034CAEB828"/>
ſo high a price: <hi>Ariana</hi> was no leſs diſpleaſed to find her offers rejected, and give a looſe to all that warmth which ſhe had long endavoured to ſuppreſs.</p>
               <p>Reproach generally produces recrimination; the quarrel roſe to ſuch a height, that <hi>Sabinus</hi> was marked for deſtruction; and the very next day, upon the ſtrength of an old family debt, he was ſent to jail, with none but <hi>Olinda</hi> to comfort him in his miſeries. In this manſion of diſtreſs they lived together with reſignation, and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of domeſtic concern. Their fellow-priſoners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a deſire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying thoſe little comforts that a priſon affords, <hi>Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Olinda</hi> were ſure to be of the party. Inſtead of reproaching each for their mutual wretchedneſs, they both lightened it, by bearing each a ſhare of the load impoſed by providence. Whenever <hi>Sabinus</hi> ſhewed the leaſt concern on his dear partner's account, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him by the love he bore her; by thoſe tender ties which now united them for ever, not to diſcompoſe himſelf: that ſo long as his affection laſted, ſhe defied all the ills of fortune, and every loſs of fame or friendſhip: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could make her miſerable, but his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032200_0065_0FF184034CAEB828"/>
to want happineſs; nothing pleaſed but his ſympathiſing with her pleaſure.</p>
               <p>A continuance in priſon ſoon robbed them of the little the had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>A propoſal of ſo baſe a nature filled our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy couple with horror; they ordered the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>This lady, though warped by wrong paſſions, was naturally kind, judicious and friendly. She found that all her attempts to ſhake the conſtancy or the integrity of <hi>Sabinus</hi> were ineffectual. She had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032200_0066_0FF1840773B3F640"/>
how ſhe could, ſo long and ſo unprovoked, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>She had, from the next room, herſelf heard the reception given to the meſſenger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of ſuperior vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſhe therefore reaſſumed her former goodneſs of heart; ſhe came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the ſeverity of her former treatment. She beſtowed her firſt care in providing them all the neceſſary ſupplies, and acknowledged them as the moſt deſerving heirs of her fortune. From this moment <hi>Sabinus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an uninterrupted happineſs with <hi>Olinda,</hi> and both were happy in the friendſhip and aſſiſtance of <hi>Ariana,</hi> who, dying ſoon after, left them in poſſeſſion of a large eſtate; and in her laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confeſſed, that virtue, was the only path to true glory; and that, however Inocence may for a time be depreſſed a ſtudy preſeverance will in a time lead it to a certain victory.</p>

               <p>CHINVANG the Chaſte, aſcending the throne of <hi>China,</hi> commanded that all who were unjuſtly detained in priſon, during the preceding reigns, ſhould be ſet free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there appeared a majeſtic old man, who, falling at the emperor's feet, addreſſed him as follows: "Great father of <hi>China,</hi> behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was ſhut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was impriſoned, though a ſtranger to crime, or without being even confronted by my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. I have now lived in ſolitude and darkneſs for more than fifty years, and am grown familiar with diſtreſs. As yet dazzled with the ſplendor of that ſun to which you have reſtored me, I have been wandering the ſtreets, to find ſome friend that would aſſiſt, or relieve, or remember me; but my friends, my family, and relations,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032200_0069_0FF1840F84594418"/>
are all dead, and I am forgotten. Permit me then, O <hi>Chinvang,</hi> to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former priſon: the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleaſing than the moſt ſplendid palace; I have not long to live, and ſhall be unhappy except I ſpend the reſt of my days where my youth was paſſed; in that priſon from whence you were pleaſed to releaſe me."</p>
               <p>The old man's paſſion for confinement is ſimilar to that we all have for life. We are habituated to the priſon, we look round with diſcontent, are diſpleaſed with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only increaſes our fondneſs for the cell. The trees we have planted, the houſes we have built, or the poſterity we have begotten, all ſerve to bind us cloſer to earth, and embitter our parting. Life ſues the young like a new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the companion, as yet unexhuſted, is at once inſtructive and amuſing; its company pleaſes yet, for all this, it is but little regarded. To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its jeſts have been anticipated in former converſation; it has no new ſtory to make us ſmile, no new improvement with which to ſurpriſe; yet ſtill we love it: deſtitute of every agreement, ſtill we love it; huſband the waſting treaſure with increaſed frugality, and feel all the poignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of anguiſh in the fatal ſeparation.</p>

               <p>MY friends, my children, and fellow-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when I reflect on the diſtribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet ſtill more to ſuffer. Though we ſhould examine the whole world, we ſhall not find one man ſo happy as to have nothing left to wiſh for; but we daily ſee thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, who, by ſuicide, ſhew us they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to hope. In this life, then, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that we cannot be entirely bleſt; but yet we may be completely miſerable!</p>
               <p>Why man ſhould thus feel pain; why our wretchedneſs ſhould be requiſite in the formation of univerſal felicity; why, when all other ſyſtems are made perfect only by the perfection of their ſubordinate parts, the great ſyſtem ſhould require for its perfection, parts that are not only ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to others, but imperfect in themſelves!—
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268"/>
Theſe are queſtions that never can be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and might be uſeleſs if known. On this ſubject, Providence has thought fit to elude our curioſity, ſatisfied with granting us motives to conſolation.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, man has called in the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſtance of Philoſophy; and Heaven, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the incapacity of that to conſole him, has given him the aid of Religion. The conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philoſophy are very amuſing, but often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. It tells us, that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and, on on the other hand, that though we unavoidable have miſeries here, life is ſhort, and they will ſoon be over. Thus do theſe conſolations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy each other; for if life is a place of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, its ſhortneſs muſt be miſery; and, if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher ſtrain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and prepairing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himſelf a heaven of happineſs here; while the wretch that has been maimed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated by his vices, ſhrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengence of Heaven. To Religion, then, we muſt hold, in every circumſtance of life, for our trueſt comfort; for, if already we are happy,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268"/>
it is a pleaſure to think that we can make that happineſs unending; and, if we are miſerable, it it very conſoling to think that there is a place of reſt. Thus, to the fortunate, Religion holds out a continuance of bliſs: to the wretched, a change from pain.</p>
               <p>But, though Religion is very kind to all men, it has promiſed peculiar rewards to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; the ſick, the naked, the houſeleſs, the heavy-laden, and the priſoner, have ever moſt frequent promiſes in our ſacred law. The Author of our Religion every where profeſſes himſelf the wretch's friend; and, unlike the falſe ones of this world, beſtows all his careſſes upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn. The unthinking have cenſured this as a partiality, as a preference without merit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; but they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven itſelf to make the offer of unceaſing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miſerable. To the firſt, eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but a ſingle bleſſing, ſince, at moſt, it but increaſes what they already poſſeſs. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it diminiſhes their pain here, and rewards them with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bliſs hereafter.</p>
               <p>But Providence is in another reſpect kinder to the poor than the rich; for, as it thus makes the life after death more deſirable, ſo it ſmooths the paſſage there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110"/>
of ſorrow lays himſelf quietly down; he has no poſſeſſions to regret, and but few ties to ſtop his departure; he feels only Nature's pang in the final ſeparation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the conſtitution, nature kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covers with inſenſibility.</p>
               <p>Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and, in Heaven, all the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of pleaſure which ariſes from contraſted enjoyment. And this ſuperiority, my friends, is no ſmall advantage, and ſeems to be one of the pleaſures of the poor man in the parable; for, though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as an addition to his happineſs, that he had once been wretched, and now was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; that he had known what it was to be miſerable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</p>
               <p>Thus, my friends, you ſee Religion does what Philoſophy could never do: it ſhews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and levels all human enjoyments to near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame ſtandard. It gives to both rich and poor the ſame happineſs hereafter, and equal hopes to aſpire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleaſure here, the poor have the endleſs ſatisfaction of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110"/>
what it was once to be miſerable, when crowned with endleſs felicity hereafter; and even though this ſhould be called a ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, yet, being an eternal one, it muſt make up, by duration, what the temporal happineſs of the great may have exceeded by intenſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are, therefore, the conſolations which the wretched have peculiar to themſelves, and in which they are above the reſt of mankind; in other reſpects they are below them. They who would know the miſeries of the poor, muſt ſee life and endure it. To declaim on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believed or practiſe. The men who have the neceſſaries of living are not poor, and they who want them muſt be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yes, my friends, we muſt be miſerable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can ſoothe the wants of nature, can give elaſtic ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or eaſe to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the Philoſopher from his couch of ſoftneſs tell us that we can reſiſt all theſe. Alas! the effort by which we reſiſt them is ſtill the greateſt pain! Death is ſlight, and any man may ſubſtain it; but torments are dreadful, and theſe no man can endure.</p>
               <p>To us, then, my friends, the promiſes of happineſs in Heaven ſhould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:032200_0075_0FF1842402005058"/>
then, indeed, of all men the moſt miſerable. When I look round theſe gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only ſerves to ſhew the horrors of the place, thoſe ſhackles that tyranny has impoſed, or crimes made neceſſary; when I ſurvey theſe emaciated looks, and hear thoſe groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would Heaven be for theſe! To fly through regions unconfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as air; to baſk in the ſunſhine of eternal bliſs; to carol over endleſs hymns of praiſe; to have no maſter to threaten or inſult us, but the form of Goodneſs himſelf for ever in our eyes; when I think of theſe things, Death becomes the meſſenger of very glad tidings; when I think of theſe things, his ſharpeſt arrow becomes the ſtaff of my ſupport; when I think of theſe things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of theſe things, what is there that ſhould not be ſpurned away? Kings in their palaces ſhould groan for ſuch advantages; but we, humbled as we are, ſhould yearn for them.</p>
               <p>And ſhall theſe things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are ſhut up from many temptations that would retard our purſuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and, what is ſtill a comfort, ſhortly too; for, if we look back on paſt life, it appears but a very ſhort ſpan; and, whatever we may think
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032200_0075_0FF1842402005058"/>
of the reſt of life, it will yet be found of leſs duration: as we grow older, the days ſeem to grow ſhorter, and our intimacy with time ever leſſens the perception of his ſtay. Then let us take comfort now, for we ſhall ſoon be at our journey's end; we ſhall ſoon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and, like his horizon, ſtill flies before him; yet the time will certainly and ſhortly come, when be ſhall ceaſe from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world ſhall no more tread us to the earth; when we ſhall think with pleaſure on our ſufferings below; when we ſhall be ſurrounded with all our friends, or ſuch as deſerved our friendſhip; when our bliſs ſhall be unutterable, and ſtill, to crown all, unending.</p>

His own fortune, however was a trifle, when compared to the elegance of his expence; and his imprudence at laſt was ſo great that it oblidged him to ſell an

annuity, ariſing from his commiſſion, to keep up his ſplendor a little longer.</p>
               <p>However thoughtleſs he might be, he had the happineſs of gaining the affections of Miſs <hi>L</hi>—, whoſe father deſigned her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion; but ſhe refuſed his addreſſes, reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice. The intrigue went on ſucceſsfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Colonel, and they both would certainly have been married, and been undone, had not Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> appriſed her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <hi>Bath,</hi> and offered Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> a very conſiderable preſent, for the care he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which he refuſed.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Col. <hi>M</hi>—had an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation how his intrigue came to be diſcovered; and by taxing Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> found that his ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not without foundation. A challenge was the immediate conſequence; which the King of <hi>Bath,</hi> conſcious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear ſwords at <hi>Bath,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel found no opportunity of gratifying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and waited with impatience to find Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> in town, to require proper ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>During this interval, however, he found his creditors became too importunate for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main longer at <hi>Bath;</hi> and his finances and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

She thought herſelf now diſengaged from her former paſſion. An abſence of two years had in ſome meaſure abated her love for the Colonel; and the aſſiduity, the merit, and real regard, of the gentleman who ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſolicit her, were almoſt too powerful for her conſtancy, Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> in the mean time, took every opportunity of enquiring after Col, <hi>M</hi>—, and found that he had for ſome time been returned to <hi>England,</hi> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and that he was entered into a company of ſtrolling players, who were at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting at <hi>Peterborough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He now therefore thought he owed the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, in juſtice, an opportunity of promoting his fortune, as he had once deprived him of an occaſion of ſatsfying his love. Our Beau, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

invited the lady to be of a party to <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the moſt elegant in <hi>England,</hi> to conduct her there. The propoſal being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> arrived in town juſt as the players were going to begin.</p>
               <p>Col. <hi>M</hi>—, who uſed every means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>incognito,</hi> and who was too proud to make his diſtreſſes known to any of his former acquaintances, was now degraded into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Tom</hi> in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers.</hi> Miſs <hi>L</hi>—was placed in the foremoſt row of the ſpectators, her lord on one ſide, and the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Naſh</hi> on the other, when the unhappy youth appeared in that deſpicable ſituation upon the ſtage. The moment he came on, his former miſtreſs ſtruck his view; but his amazement was increaſed, when he ſaw her fainting away in the arms of thoſe who ſat behind her. He was incapable of proceeding; and, ſcarce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he did, he flew and caught her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"Colonel," cried <hi>Naſh,</hi> when they were in ſome meaſure recovered, "you once thought me your enemy, becauſe I endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent you both, from ruining each other; you were then wrong, and you have long had my forgiveneſs.

               <p>THE character of a poet is in every country the ſame; fond of enjoying the preſent, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the future; his converſation that of a man of ſenſe, his actions thoſe of a fool!

               <p>The poets of the Weſt are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius; and yet, among the numerous hoſpitals deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the poor, I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors.

If we turn to <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall there find even ſtronger inſtances of the ingratitude of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. <hi>Vaugelas,</hi> one of the politeſt writers, and one of the honeſteſt men, of his time, was ſurnamed <hi>the Owl,</hi> from his being obliged to keep within all day, and venture out only by night, through fear of his creditors. His laſt will is very remarkable: after having bequeathed all his worldly ſubſtance to the diſcharging his debts, he goes on thus: But as there ſtill may remain ſome creditors unpaid, even after all that I have ſhall be diſpoſed of, in ſuch a caſe, it is my laſt will, that my body ſhould be ſold to the ſurgeons, to the beſt advantage, and that the purchaſe ſhould go to the diſcharging thoſe debts which I owe to ſociety; ſo that if I could not while living, at leaſt when dead, I may be uſeful.</p>

Being by degrees driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into an hatred of all mankind, from the little pity he found amongſt them, he even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at laſt ungratefully to impute his calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Providence. In his laſt agonies, when the prieſt intreated him to rely on the juſtice of heaven, and aſk mercy from him that made him; <hi>If God,</hi> replies he, <hi>has ſhewn me no juſtice here, what reaſon have I to expect any from him hereafter?</hi> But being anſwered, that a ſuſpenſion

of juſtice was no argument that ſhould induce us to doubt of its reality; let me intreat you, continued his confeſſor, by all that is dear, to be reconciled to God, your father, your maker, and friend. <hi>No,</hi> replied the exaſperated wretch, <hi>you know the manner in which he left me to live;</hi> (and pointing to the ſtraw on which he was ſtretched) <hi>and you ſee the manner in which he leaves me to die!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſufferings of the poet in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is nothing when compared to his diſtreſſes here: the names of <hi>Spenſer</hi> and <hi>Otway, Butler</hi> and <hi>Dryden,</hi> are every day mentioned as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reproach; ſome of them lived in a ſtate of precarious indigence, and others literally died of hunger.</p>
               <p>At preſent, the few poets in <hi>England</hi> no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er depend on the Great for ſubſiſtence; they have now no other patrons but the public; and the public, collectively conſidered, is a good and a generous maſter. It is, indeed, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the miſtaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour; but, to make amends, it is never miſtaken long. A performance, indeed, may be forced for a time into reputation; but, deſtitute of real merit, it ſoon ſinks: time, the touchſtone of what is truly valuable, will ſoon diſcover the fraud; and an author ſhould never arrogate to himſelf any ſhare of ſucceſs,

till his works have been read at leaſt ten years with ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>A man of letters, at preſent, whoſe works are valuable, is perfectly ſenſibly of their value. Every polite member of the community, by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he writes, contributes to reward him.

               <p>The fortitude of ſages is but a dream; for where lies the merit in being inſenſible to the ſtrokes of fortune, or in diſſembling our ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?

If we diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our feelings, we only artificially endeavour to perſuade others that we enjoy privileges which we actually do not poſſeſs. Thus, while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to appear happy, we feel at once all the pangs of internal miſery, and all the ſelf-reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciouſneſs of endeavouing to deceive.</p>

               <p>THE enthuſiaſm of pleaſure charms only by intervals. The higheſt rapture laſts only for a moment, and all the ſenſes ſeem ſo combined, as to be ſoon tired into languor by the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one of them. It is only among the Poets we hear of men changing to one delight, when ſatiated with another. In nature, it is very different; the glutton, when ſated with the full meal, is unqualified to feel the real pleaſure of drinking; the drunkard, in turn, finds few of thoſe tranſports which lovers boaſt in enjoyment; and the lover, when cloyed, finds a diminution of every other appetite. Thus, after a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of any one ſenſe, the man of pleaſure finds a langour in all, is placed in a chaſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween paſt and expected enjoyment, preceives an interval which muſt be filled up. The preſent
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032200_0085_0FF18441CAD94860"/>
can give no ſatisfaction, becauſe he has already robbed it of every charm. A mind thus left without immediate employment, naturally recurs to the paſt or the future: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be ſo now; he ſees that he may yet be happy, and wiſhes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is miſerable, except that very ſhort one of immediate gratification. Inſtead of a life of diſſipation, none has more frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations with diſagreeable <hi>ſelf</hi> than he: his enthuſiaſms are but few and tranſient; his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, like angry creditors, continually making fruitleſs demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater his former pleaſure, the more ſtrong his regret, the more impatient his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. A life of pleaſure is, therefore, the moſt unpleaſing life in the world.</p>
               <p>Habit has rendered the man of buſineſs more cool in his deſires; he finds leſs regret for paſt pleaſures, and leſs ſolicitude for theſe to come. The life he now leads, though tainted in ſome meaſure with hope, is yet not afflicted ſo ſtrongly with regret, and is leſs divided between ſhort-lived rapture and laſting anguiſh. The pleaſures he has enjoyed are not ſo vivid, and thoſe he has to expect cannot conſequently create ſo much anxiety.</p>
               <p>The philoſopher, who extends his regard to all mankind, muſt have ſtill a ſmaller concern for
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032200_0085_0FF18441CAD94860"/>
what has already affected, or may hereafter affect himſelf; the concerns of others make his whole ſtudy, and that ſtudy is his pleaſure; and this pleaſure is continuing in its nature, becauſe it can be changed at will, leaving but few of theſe anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intervals which are employed in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or anticipation. The philoſopher, by this means, leads a life of almoſt continued diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and reflection, which makes the uneaſineſs and miſery of others, ſerves as a companion and inſtructor to him.</p>
               <p>In a word, poſitive happineſs is conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and incapable of increaſe; miſery is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and generally proceeds from our folly. Philoſophy can add to our happineſs in no other manner, but by diminiſhing our miſery: it ſhould not pretend to increaſe our preſent ſtock, but make us oeconomiſts of what we are poſſeſſed of. The great ſource of calamity lies in regret or anticipation: he, therefore, is moſt wiſe, who thinks of the preſent alone, regardleſs of the paſt or the future. This is impoſſible to the man of pleaſure; it is difficult to the man of buſineſs; and is, in ſome meaſure, attainable by the philoſopher. Happy were we all born philoſophers, all born with a talent of thus diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating our own cares, by ſpreading them upon all mankind!</p>

               <p>IT is uſually ſaid by grammarians, that the uſe of language is to expreſs our wants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but men who know the world, hold, and I think with ſome ſhew of reaſon, that he who beſt knows how to keep his neceſſities private, is the moſt likely perſon to have them redreſſed; and that the true uſe of ſpeech is not ſo much to expreſs our wants as to conceal them.</p>
               <p>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſomething ſo attractive in riches, that the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138"/>
large heap generally collects from the ſmaller: and the poor find as much pleaſure in increaſing the enormous maſs of the rich, as the miſer, who owns it, ſees happineſs in its increaſe. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality. <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf allows, that in confering benefits, the preſent ſhould always be ſuited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large preſents, and are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for accepting them. Men of middling ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are obliged to be content with preſents ſomething leſs; while the beggar, who may be truly ſaid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmeſt ſolicitations.</p>
               <p>Every man who has ſeen the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expreſſion is, muſt have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and muſt know, that to have much, or to ſeem to have it, is the only way to have more. <hi>Ovid</hi> finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it ſinks, the greater is that weight it is obliged to ſuſtain. Thus, when a man's circumſtances are ſuch that he has no occaſion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, ſhould his wants be ſuch that he ſues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be truſted with the ſmalleſt ſum. A certain young fellow, whom I knew, whenever he had occaſion to aſk his friend for a guinea, uſed to prelude his requeſt as if he
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138"/>
wanted two hundred; and talked ſo familiarly of large ſums, that none could ever think he wanted a ſmall one. The ſame gentleman, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he wanted credit for a ſuit of clothes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the propoſal in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared ſhabby on theſe occaſions, his tailor had taken an oath againſt truſting; or, what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and ſhould not be at home for ſome time</p>
               <p>There can be no inducements to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and, by this means, relief; but before a poor man opens his mind in ſuch circumſtances, he ſhould firſt conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is contented to loſe the eſteem of the perſon he ſolicits, and whether he is willing to give up friendſhip to excite compaſſion. Pity and Friendſhip are paſſions incompatible with each other; and it is impoſſible that both can reſide in any breaſt for the ſmalleſt ſpace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impairing each other. Friendſhip is made up of eſteem and pleaſure; Pity is compoſed of ſorrow and contempt; the mind may, for ſome time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</p>
               <p>In fact, Pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at beſt, a ſhort-lived paſſion, and ſeldom affords diſtreſs more than a tranſitory aſſiſtance: with ſome it ſcarce laſts from the firſt impulſe till the hand can be put into the pocket; with
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032200_0089_0FF1844C2A788F00"/>
others, it may continue for twice that ſpace; and on ſome, of extraordinary ſenſibility, I have ſeen it operate for half an hour together: but ſtill, laſt as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five farthings, from others, we give pounds. Whatever be our feelings from the firſt impulſe of diſtreſs, when the ſame diſtreſs ſolicits a ſecond, we then feel with diminiſhed ſenſibility; and, like the repetition of an echo, every ſtroke becomes weaker; 'till, at laſt, our ſenſations loſe all mixture of ſorrow, and degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate into downright contempt.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpeculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-houſe, and his father dying juſt as he was out of his time, left him an handſome fortune, and many friends to adviſe with. The reſtraint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which ſome regarded as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and, from ſuch conſiderations, he had every day repeated offers of friendſhip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their aſſiſtance that way; and they who had daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circumſtances; he wanted neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, friends, nor a wife; and, therefore, modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declined their propoſals.</p>

As a man, therefore, confident of not being refuſed, he requeſted the uſe of a hundred guineas for a few days, as he juſt then had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for money. <q>And pray, Sir, replied the ſcrivener, do you want all this money?</q> 
                  <q>Want it, Sir? ſays the other, If I did not want it, I ſhould not have aſked it.</q> 
                  <q>I am ſorry for that, ſays the friend; for thoſe who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they ſhould come to pay. To ſay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and, I believe, it is all ſunk in the bottom of the ſea, for my part; he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got.</q>

who he knew was the very beſt friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addreſſed, received his propoſal with all the affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that could be expected from generous friendſhip. <q>Let me ſee—you want an hundred guineas—and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty anſwer?</q> 
                  <q>If you have but fifty to ſpare, Sir, I muſt be contented.</q> 
                  <q>Fifty to ſpare! I do not ſay that; for, I believe, I have but twenty about me.</q> 
                  <q>Then I muſt borrow the other thirty from ſome other friend.</q> 
                  <q>And pray, replied the friend, would it not be the beſt way to borrow the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from that other friend, and then one note will ſerve for all, you know?—You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and, when you chuſe a bit of dinner, or ſo—You, Tom! ſee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble ſervant.</q>

               <p>Diſtreſſed, but not diſcouraged, at this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was at laſt reſolved to find that aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from love, which he could not have from friendſhip. A young lady, a diſtant relation by the mother's ſide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as ſhe had already made all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that her ſex's modeſty would permit, he made his propoſal with confidence.

found the fair-one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</p>
               <p>Every day now began to ſtrip my poor friend of his former finery; his cloaths flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he ſeemed, at length, equipped in the genuine livery of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.

                  </gap>ad received to dine, even after his loſſes, were yet unanſwered: he was therefore now reſolved to accept of a dinner, becauſe he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week, without being openly affronted. The laſt place I ſaw him in, was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, juſt nicked the time of dinner; for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being deſired, and talked for ſome time without being attended to. He aſſured the company, that nothing procured ſo good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and praiſed the figure of the damaſk table-cloth; talked of a feaſt where he had been the day before, but that the veniſon was over-done: but all this procured him no invitation. Finding, therefore, the gentleman of the houſe inſenſible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at laſt, to retire,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032200_0091_0FF1849161086008"/>
and mend his appetite by a ſecond walk in the Park.</p>
               <p>You, then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in <hi>Kent-ſtreet</hi> or the <hi>Mall;</hi> whether at the <hi>Smyrna</hi> or St. <hi>Giles'</hi>s; might I be permitted to adviſe as a friend, never ſeem to want the favour which you ſolicit. Apply to every paſſion but human pity for redreſs: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from ſelf-intereſt, or from avarice; but from compaſſion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is diſguſting; and that mouth which is opened even by wiſdom, is ſeldom expected to cloſe without the horrors of a petition.</p>
               <p>To ward off the gripe of poverty, you muſt pretend to be a ſtranger to her, and ſhe will at leaſt uſe you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of peaſe-ſoup and potatoes, praiſe the wholeſomeneſs of your frugal repaſt: you may obſerve that Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi> has preſcribed peaſe-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of thoſe who are always making a deity of your belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear flimſy ſtuff in the midſt of winter, be the firſt to remark, that ſtuffs are very much worn at <hi>Paris;</hi> or, if there be found ſome irreparable defects in any part of your equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of ſitting croſslegged, coaxing, or darning, ſay, that neither you nor <hi>Sampſon Gideon</hi> were ever

very fond of dreſs. If you be a philoſopher, hint that <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Seneca</hi> are the taylors you chooſe to employ; aſſure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering; ſince what now is ſo much his pride was formerly his ſhame. In ſhort, however caught, never give out; but aſcribe to the frugality of your diſpoſition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowneſs of your circumſtances. To be poor, and to ſeem poor, is a certain method never to riſe: pride in the great is hateful; in the wiſe, it is ridiculous; but beggarly pride is a rational vanity, which I have been taught to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and excuſe.</p>

               <p>NO obſervation is more common, and at the ſame time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble ſufferers: the great, under the preſſure of calamity, are conſcious of ſeveral others ſympathizing with their diſtreſſes; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</p>

                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:032200_0092_0FF18453290C6858"/>
There is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: man in ſuch circumſtances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of obſcurity, can brave adverſity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and indifference, is truly great: whether peaſant or courtier, he deſerves admiration, and ſhould be held up for our imitation and reſpect.</p>
               <p>While the ſlighteſt inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities, while Tragedy mouths out their ſufferings in all the ſtrains of eloquence, the miſeries of the poor are entirly diſregarded; and yet ſome of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardſhips in one day, than thoſe of a more exalted ſtation ſuffer in their whole lives. It is inconceivable what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties the meaneſt of our common ſailors and ſoldiers endure, without murmuring or regret; without paſſionately declaiming againſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

earth, to which they had fooliſhly attached an idea of happineſs! Their diſtreſſes were pleaſures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They ate, drink, and ſleep; they have ſlaves to attend them, and were ſure of ſubſiſtence for life: while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or aſſiſt them, and even without ſhelter from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>I have been led into theſe reflections, from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally meeting, ſome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dreſſed in a ſailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been honeſt and induſtrous when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his preſent ſituation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I deſired to know the hiſtory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his preſent diſtreſs. The diſabled ſoldier, for ſuch he was, though dreſſed in a ſailor's habit, ſcratching his head, and leaning on his cruch, put himſelf into an attitude to comply with my requeſt, and gave me his hiſtory, as follows.</p>
               <p>"AS for my misfortune, maſter, I can't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the loſs of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

thank Heaven, that I have to complain; there is <hi>Bill Tibbs,</hi> of our regiment, he has loſt both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, it is not ſo bad with me yet.</p>
               <p>"I was born in <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; ſo I was put upon the pariſh. As he had been a wandering ſort of a man, the pariſhioners were not able to tell to what pariſh I belonged, or where I was born; ſo they ſent me to another pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and that pariſh ſent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept ſending me about ſo long, that they would not let me be born in any pariſh at all; but, at laſt, however, they fixed me. I had ſome diſpoſition to be a ſcholar, and was reſolved, at leaſt, to know my letters; but the maſter of the work houſe put me to buſineſs as ſoon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an eaſy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not ſuffered to ſtir out of the houſe, for fear, as they ſaid, I ſhould run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole houſe, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my buſineſs well enough, till he died, when I was obliged
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032200_0093_0FF18454CF95CEA0"/>
to provide for myſelf; ſo I was reſolved to go ſeek my fortune.</p>
               <p>"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a juſtice of peace, I ſpied a hare croſſing the path juſt before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my ſtick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away, when the juſtice himſelf met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laring me deſired I would give an account of myſelf. I fell upon my knees, begged his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, ſeed, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; but, though I gave a very true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the juſtice ſaid I could give no account; ſo I was indicted at the ſeſſions, found guilty of being poor, and ſent up to <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> in order to be tranſported as a vagabond.</p>
               <p>"People may ſay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found <hi>Newgate</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to laſt for ever; ſo I was taken out of priſon, after five months, put on board a ſhip, and ſent, off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent paſſage; for, being
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032200_0094_0FF18457F01F4278"/>
all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of ſweet air; and thoſe that remained were ſickly enough, God knows. When we came a-ſhore, we were ſold to the planters, and I was bound for ſeven years more. As I was no ſcholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes; and I ſerved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</p>
               <p>"When my time was expired, I worked my paſſage home; and glad I was to ſee <hi>Old England</hi> again, becauſe I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I ſhould be indicted for a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond once more, ſo did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</p>
               <p>"I was very happy in this manner for ſome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then deſired me to ſtand. They belonged to the preſs-gang. I was carried before the juſtice, and, as I could give no account of myſelf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or liſt for a ſoldier. I choſe the latter; and, in this poſt of gentleman, I ſerved two campaigns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> was at the battles of <hi>Val</hi> and <hi>Fontenoy,</hi> and received but one wound, through the breaſt here; but the doctor of our regiment ſoon made me well again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:032200_0094_0FF18457F01F4278"/>
"When the peace came on, I was diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, as I could not work, becauſe my wound was ſomtimes troubleſome, I liſted for a landſman in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> company's ſervice. I have fought the <hi>French</hi> in ſix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our Captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I ſoon fell ſick, and ſo got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocked. This was at the beginning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war, and I hoped to be ſet on ſhore, and to have the pleaſure of ſpending my money; but the government wanted men, and ſo I was preſſed for a ſailor before ever I could ſet foot on ſhore.</p>
               <p>"The boatſwain found, as he ſaid, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate fellow: he ſwore he knew that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my buſineſs well, but that I ſhammed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to be idle; but God knows, I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſea-buſineſs, and he beat me without conſidering what he was about. I had ſtill, however, my forty pounds, and that was ſome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ſhip was taken by the French, and ſo I loſt all.</p>
               <p>"Our crew was carried into <hi>Breſt,</hi> and many of them died, becauſe they were not uſed to live in jail; but for my part, it was nothing to
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032200_0095_0FF1845C5335E090"/>
me, for I was ſeaſoned. One night, as I was aſleep on my bed of boards, with a warm blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boatſwain, who had a dark lantern in his hand. <q>
                     <hi>Jack,</hi> ſays he to me, will you knock out the <hi>French</hi> centry's brains?</q> "I don't care," ſays I, ſtriving to keep myſelf awake "if I lend a hand." <q>Then follow me, ſays he, and I hope we ſhall do buſineſs.</q> So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to ſight the <hi>Frenchman.</hi> I hate the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they are all ſlaves, and wear wooden ſhoes.</p>
               <p>"Though we had no arms, one <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is able to beat five <hi>French</hi> at any time; ſo we went down to the door, where both the centries were poſted, and, ruſhing upon them, ſeized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and ſeizing the firſt boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to ſea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the <hi>Dorſet</hi> privateer, who were glad of ſo many good hands; and we conſented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the <hi>Pompadour</hi> privater, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; ſo to it we went yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:032200_0095_0FF1845C5335E090"/>
and yard-arm. The fight laſted for three hours, and I verily believe we ſhould have taken the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> had we but had ſome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we loſt all our men juſt as we were going to get the victory.</p>
               <p>"I was once more in the power of the <hi>French,</hi> and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to <hi>Breſt;</hi> but, by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that, in that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I was wounded in two places: I loſt four fingers off the left hand, and my leg was ſhot off. If I had had the good fortune to have loſt my leg and uſe of my hand on board a king's ſhip, and not a board a privateer, I ſhould have been entitled to clothing and maintenance during the reſt of my life, but that was not my chance: one man is born with a ſilver ſpoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, bleſſed be God! I enjoy good health, and will, for ever, love liberty and Old England. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, property, and Old England, for ever, huzza!"</p>
               <p>Thus ſaying, he limped off, leaving me in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid acknowledging, that an habitual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with miſery ſerves better than philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to teach us to diſpiſe it.</p>

               <p>THOUGH not very fond of ſeeing a pageant myſelf, yet I am generally pleaſed with being in the crowd which ſees it; it is amuſing to obſerve the effect which ſuch a ſpectacle has upon the variety of faces; the pleaſure it excites in ſome, the envy in others, and the wiſhes it raiſes in all. With this deſign I lately went to ſee the entry of a foreign ambaſſador, reſolved to make one in the mob, to ſhout as they ſhouted, to fix with earneſtneſs upon the ſame frivolous objects, and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032200_0097_0FF184625F5A88F8"/>
participate, for a while, the pleaſures and the wiſhes of the vulgar.</p>
               <p>Struggling here for ſome time, in order to be firſt to ſee the cavalcade as it paſſed, ſome one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my ſhoe, and tore it in ſuch a manner, that I was utterly unqualified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> march forward with the main body, and oblidged to fall back in the rear, Thus rendered incapable of being a ſpectator of the ſhew myſelf, I was at leaſt willing to obſerve the ſpectators, and limped behind like one of the invalids which follow the march of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> army.</p>
               <p>In this plight, as I was conſidering the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that appeared on every face, how ſome buſtled to get foremoſt, and others contented themſelves with taking a traſient peep when they could; how ſome praiſed the four black ſervants that were ſtuck behind one of the equipages, and ſome the ribbons that decorated the horſes' necks in another; my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that I had yet ſeen: A poor Cobler ſat in his ſtall by the way ſide, and continued to work while the crowd paſſed by, without teſtifying the ſmalleſt ſhare of curioſity. I own his want of attention excited mine; and, as I ſtood in need of his aſſiſtance, I thought it beſt to employ a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic Cobler on this occaſion: perceiving my buſineſs, therefore, he deſired me to enter and
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032200_0097_0FF184625F5A88F8"/>
ſit down, took my ſhoe in his lap, and began to mend it with his uſual indifference and taciturnity.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How, my friend, ſaid I to him, can you continue to work while all thoſe fine things are paſſing by your door?</q> 
                  <q>Very fine they are, maſter, returned the cobler, for thoſe that like them, to be ſure; but what are all thoſe fine things to me? You don't know what it is to be a cobler, and ſo much the better for yourſelf. Your bread is baked; you may go and ſee ſights the whole day, and eat a warm ſupper when you come home at night; but for me, if I ſhould run hunting after all theſe fine folk, what ſhould I get by my journey but an appetite? and, God help me, I have too much of that at home <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ready, without ſtirring out for it. Your people who may eat four meals a day, and ſupper at night are but a bad example to ſuch a one as I. No, maſter, as God has called me into this world in order to mend old ſhoes, I have no buſineſs with fine folk, and they no buſineſs with me.</q> I here interrupted him with a ſmile. <q>See this laſt, maſter, continues he, and this ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; this laſt and hammer are the two beſt friends I have in this world; nobody elſe will be my friend, becauſe I want a friend. The great folks you ſaw paſs by juſt now have five hundred friends, becauſe they have no ocaſion
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032200_0098_0FF18465482BE370"/>
for them. Now, while I ſtick to my good friends here, I am very contented; but, when I ever ſo little run after ſights and fine things, I begin to hate my work, I grow ſad, and have no heart to mend ſhoes any longer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This diſcourſe only ſerved to raiſe my curioſity to know more of a man whom Nature had thus formed into a Philoſopher. I therefore inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly led him into an hiſtory of his adventures:—<q>I have lived, ſaid he, a wandering life, now five-and-fifty years, here to-day and gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow; for it was my misfortune, when I was young, to be fond of changing.</q> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>You have been a traveller, then, I preſume?</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted I.</q> 
                  <q>I can't boaſt much of travelling, continued he, for I have never left the pariſh in which I was born but three times in my life, that I can remember; but then there is not a ſtreet in the whole neighbourhood that I have not lived in, at ſome time or another. When I began to ſettle, and to take to my buſineſs in one ſtreet, ſome unforeſeen misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or a deſire of trying my luck elſewhere, has removed me, perhaps, a whole mile away from my former cuſtomers, while ſome more lucky cobler would come into my place, and make a handſome fortune among friends of my making: there was one who actually died in a ſtall that I had left, worth ſeven pounds
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032200_0098_0FF18465482BE370"/>
ſeven ſhillings, all in hard gold, which he had quilted into the waiſtband of his breeches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I could not but ſmile at theſe migrations of a man by the fire-ſide, and continued to aſk if he had ever been married. <q>Ay, that I have, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, replied he, for ſixteen long years; and a weary life I had of it, Heaven knows. My wife took it into her head, that the only way to thrive in this world was to ſave money; ſo, though our comings-in was but about three ſhillings a week, all that ever ſhe could lay her hands upon ſhe uſed to hide away from me, though we were obliged to ſtarve the whole week for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The firſt three years we uſed to quarrel about this every day, and I always got the better; but ſhe had a hard ſpirit, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to hide as uſual; ſo that I was at laſt tired of quarrelling, and geting the better; and ſhe ſcraped and ſcraped at pleaſure, 'till I was almoſt ſtarved to death. Her conduct drove me, at laſt, in diſpair to the alehouſe; here I uſed to ſit with people who hated home like myſelf, drank while I had money left, and run in ſcore while any body would truſt me; 'till at laſt the landlady, coming one day with a long bill when I was from home, and putting it into my wife's hands, the length of it effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually broke her heart. I ſearched the whole ſtall, after ſhe was dead, for money; but ſhe
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032200_0099_0FF184681E2A4E28"/>
had hidden it ſo effectually, that, with all my pains, I could never find a farthing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this time my ſhoe was mended, and, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the poor artiſt for his trouble, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him beſides for his information, I took my leave, and returned home to lengthen out the amuſement his converſation afforded, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it to my friend.</p>

               <p>WHILE I ſometimes lament the cauſe of humanity, and the depravity of human nature, there now and then appear gleams of greatneſs that ſerve to relieve the eye oppreſſed with the hideous proſpect, and reſemble thoſe cultivated ſpots that are ſometimes found in the midſt of an Aſiatic wilderneſs. I ſee many ſuperior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide: I ſee virtues which, in other countries, are known only to a few, practiſed here by every rank of people.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it proceeds from their ſuperior opulence, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable than the reſt of mankind; whether, by being poſſeſſed of all the conveniencies of life themſelves, they have more leiſure to perceive

               <p>In other countries, the giver is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the immediate impulſe of pity; his generoſity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneaſy ſenſations, as to comfort the object in diſtreſs: in <hi>England,</hi> benefactions are of a more general nature; ſome men of fortune and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence propoſe the proper objects; the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvaſſed by the people; neither paſſion or pity find a place in the cool diſcuſſion; and charity is then only exerted, when it has received the approbation of reaſon.</p>

               <p>THE poor of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderneſs; their own miſeries are too apt to engroſs all their pity; and, perhaps too, they give but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:032200_0100_0FF18469B44DD0F8"/>
as they find but little from others. But, in <hi>England,</hi> the poor treat each other, upon every occaſion, with more than ſavage animoſity, and as if they were in a ſtate of open war by nature. In <hi>China,</hi> if two porters ſhould meet in a narrow ſtreet, they would lay down their burthens, make a thouſand excuſes to each other for the accidental interruption, and beg pardon on their knees. If two men of the ſame occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation ſhould meet here, they would firſt begin to ſcold, and, at laſt, to beat each other. One would think they had miſeries enough reſulting from penury and labour, not to increaſe them by ill-nature among themſelves, and ſubjection to new penalties; but ſuch conſiderations never weigh with them.</p>
               <p>But to recompence this ſtrange abſurdity, they are, in the main, generous, brave, and enterpriſing. They feel the ſlighteſt injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience, but reſiſt the greateſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities with ſurpriſing fortitude. Thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries under which any other people in the world would ſink, they have often ſhewed they were capable of enduring: if accidently caſt upon ſome deſolate coaſt, their perſeverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of ſuſtaining; if impriſoned for crimes, their efforts to eſcape are greater than among others. The peculiar ſtrength of their priſons, when compared to thoſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, argues their hardineſs; even the ſtrongeſt

               <p>IT were highly to be wiſhed, that legiſlative power would direct the law rather to reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than ſeverity; that it would appear convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the work of eradicating crimes, is not by making puniſhments familiar, but formidable. Inſtead of our preſent priſons, which find or make men guilty, which incloſe wretches for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of one crime, and return them, if return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alive, fitted for the perpetration of thouſands, it were to be wiſhed we had, as in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> places of penitence and ſolitude, where the accuſed might be attended by ſuch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives of virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhments, is the way to mend a ſtate: nor can I avoid even queſtioning the validity of that right, which ſocial combinations have aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032200_0102_0FF18470EBAEF3F0"/>
of capitally puniſhing offences of a ſlight nature. In caſes of murder, their right is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; as it is the duty of us all, from the law of ſelf-defence, to cut off that man who has ſhewn a diſregard for the life of another. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch, all nature riſes in arms; but it is not ſo againſt him who ſteals my property. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horſe he ſteals is as much his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as mine. If then, I have any right, it muſt be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his horſe ſhall die. But this is a falſe compact; becauſe no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away; as it is not his own. And, next, the compact is inadequate, and would be ſet a ſide, even is a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience; ſince it is far better that two men ſhould live, than that one man ſhould ride. But a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact that is falſe between two men, is equally ſo between an hundred, or an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a ſquare, ſo the united voice of myriads cannot lend the ſmalleſt foundation to falſehood. It is thus that Reaſon ſpeaks; and untutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature ſays the ſame thing. Savages, that are directed nearly by natural law alone, are very tender of the lives of each other; they ſeldom ſhed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</p>

Our <hi>Saxon</hi> anceſtors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commenceing governments that have the print of nature ſtill ſtrong upon them, ſcarce any crime is held capital.</p>
               <p>It is among the citizens of a refined commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that penal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, ſeems to acquire the moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of age; and as if our poſſeſſions were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dearer in proportion as they increaſed, as if the more enormous our wealth the more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive our fears, our poſſeſſions are paled with new-edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to ſcare every invader.</p>
               <p>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiouſneſs of our people, that this country ſhould ſhew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is owing to both; for they mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce each other. When by indiſcriminate penal laws a nation beholds the ſame puniſhment affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſſimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no diſtinction in the penalty, the people are led to loſe all ſenſe of diſtinction in the crime, and this diſtinction is the bulwark of all morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for freſh reſtraints.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed, then, that power inſtead of contriving new laws to puniſh vice, inſtead

               <p>DEATH is not that terrible thing which we ſuppoſe it to be; it is a ſpectre which frights us at; diſtance, but which diſappears when we come to approach it more cloſely. Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dreſſed up by fancy; we regard it not only as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt misfortune, but alſo as an evil accompanied
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032200_0104_0FF1847564C1BAA0"/>
with the moſt excruciating tortures: we have even increaſed our apprehenſions, by reaſoning on the extent of our ſufferings. It muſt be dreadful, ſay ſome, ſince it is ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the ſoul from the body; it muſt be long, ſince our ſufferings are proportioned to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our ideas; and theſe being painful, muſt ſucceed each other with extreme rapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this manner has falſe philoſophy labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to augment the miſeries of our nature, and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with inſenſibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can ſuffer theſe calamities; the mind is, at that time, moſtly without ideas; and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain produces either death, or fainting, which is a ſtate ſimilar to death: the body can luffer but to a certain degree; if the torture becomes exceſſive, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys itſelf; and the mind ceaſes to perceive, when the body can no longer endure.</p>
               <p>In this manner exceſſive pain admits of no reflection; and, wherever there are are any ſigns of it, we may ſure that the ſufferings of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient are no greater than what we ourſelves may have remembered to endure.</p>
               <p>But, in the article of death, we have many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which the dying perſon has ſhewn that very reflection which pre-ſuppoſes an abſence of the greateſt pain; and, conſequently, that

pang which ends life cannot even be ſo great as thoſe which have preceded. Thus, when <hi>Charles</hi> XII. was ſhot at the ſiege of <hi>Frederick ſhall,</hi> he was ſeen to clap his hand on the hilt of his ſword; and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the boldeſt and braveſt lives in the world, yet it was not painful enough to deſtroy reflection. He perceived himſelf attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he reflected that he ought to defend himſelf, and his body obeyed the impulſe of his mind, even in the laſt extremity. Thus it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of perſons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us ſuffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, contracted an habit of making our exceſſive pleaſures and pains; and nothing but repeated experience ſhews us how ſeldom the one can be ſuffered, or the other enjoyed, to the utmoſt. If there be any thing neceſſary to confirm what we have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gradual ceſſation of life, or the inſenſible approaches of our end, nothing can more effc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prove it than the uncertainty of the ſigns of death. If we conſult what <hi>Winſlow</hi> or <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier</hi> have ſaid upon this ſubject, we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that between life and death, the ſhade is ſo very undiſtinguiſhable, that even all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of art can ſcarcely determine where the one ends, and the other begins. The colour of the viſage, the warmth of the body, the ſuppleneſs of the joints, are but uncertain ſigns of life ſtill

ſubſiſting; while, on the contrary, the paleneſs of the complexion, the coldneſs of the body, the ſtiffneſs of the extremities, the ceſſation of all motion, and the total inſenſibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the ſame manner, alſo, with regard to the pulſe, and the breathing, theſe motions are often ſo kept under, that it is impoſſible to perceive them. By approaching a lookingglaſs to the mouth of the perſon ſuppoſed to be dead, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple often expect to find whether he breathes or not; but this is a very uncertain experiment: the glaſs is frequently ſullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the perſon is ſtill alive, although the glaſs is no way tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the ſame manner, neither burning, nor ſcarifying; neither noiſes in the ears, nor pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſpirits applied to the noſtrils, give certain ſigns of the diſcontinuance of life; and there are many inſtances of perſons who have endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external aſſiſtance, to the aſtoniſhment of the ſpectators. How careful, therefore, ſhould we be, before we commit thoſe who are deareſt to us to the grave, to be well aſſured of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture!—Experience, juſtice, humanity, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us not to haſten the funerals of our friends, but to keep their bodies unburied, until we have certain ſigns of their real deceaſe.</p>

               <head>THE STROLING PLAYER.</head>
               <p>I AM fond of amuſement, in whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it is to be found; and wit, though dreſſed in rags, is ever pleaſing to me. I went ſome days ago to take a walk in <hi>St. James' Park,</hi> about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and thoſe who ſtaid, ſeemed, by their looks, rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one. I ſat down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man in very ſhabby cloaths.</p>
               <p>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as uſual upon ſuch occaſions; and, at laſt, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon converſation. "I beg pardon, Sir," cried I, "but I think I have ſeen you before; your face is familiar to me." "Yes, Sir," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, "I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me. I am as well known in every town in <hi>England</hi> as the dromedary, or live cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile.
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032200_0106_0FF1847CC0CF7178"/>
You muſt underſtand, Sir, that I have been theſe ſixteen years <hi>Merry Andrew</hi> to a pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petſhow; laſt <hi>Bartholomew</hi> fair my maſter and I quarrelled, beat each other, and parted; he to fell his puppets to the pincuſhion-makers in <hi>Roſemary-lane,</hi> and I to ſtarve in <hi>St. James' Park.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry, Sir, that a perſon of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſhould labour under any difficulties." "O, Sir," returned he, "my appearance is very much at your ſervice; but though I cannot boaſt of eating much, yet there are few that are merrier: if I had twenty thouſand a year, I ſhould be very merry; and, thank the Fates, though not worth a groat, I am very merry ſtill. If I have three pence in my pocked, I never refuſe to be my three halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never ſcorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay for my reckoning. What think you, Sir, of a ſteak and a tankard? You ſhall treat me now, and I will treat you again when I find you in the <hi>Park</hi> in love with eating, and without money to pay for a dinner."</p>
               <p>As I never refuſed a ſmall expence for the ſake of a merry companion, we inſtantly adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a neighbouring alehouſe; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteak, ſpread on the table before us. It is impoſſible to expreſs how much the ſight of ſuch good cheer improved my companion's vivacity.
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50"/>
"I like this dinner, Sir," ſays he, "for three reaſons: firſt, becauſe I am naturally fond of beef; ſecondly, becauſe I am hungry; and, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laſtly, becauſe I get it for nothing: no meat eats ſo ſweet as that for which we do not pay."</p>
               <p>He therefore now fell to, and his appetite ſeemed to correſpond with his inclination. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner was over, he obſerved that the ſteak was tough; "and yet, Sir," returns he, "bad as it was, it ſeemed a rump-ſteak to me. O the delights of poverty and a good appetite! We beggars are the very fondlings of Nature: the rich ſhe treats like an errant ſtep-mother; they are pleaſed with nothing: cut a ſteak from what part you will and it is inſupportably tough; dreſs it up with pickles,—even pickles cannot procure them an appetite. But the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is filled with good things for the beggar; <hi>Calvert'</hi>s butt out-taſtes champaigne, and <hi>Sedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley'</hi>s home-brewed excels tokay. Joy, joy, my blood! though our eſtates lie no where, we have fortunes wherever we go. If an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſweeps away half the grounds of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> I am content; I have no lands there: if the ſtocks ſink, that gives me no uneaſineſs; I am no <hi>Jew.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The fellow's vivacity, joined to his poverty, I own, raiſed my curioſity to know ſomething of his life and circumſtances; and I intreated,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50"/>
that he would indulge my deſire.—"That I will, Sir," ſaid he, "and welcome; only let us drink to prevent our ſleeping; let us have another tankard while we are awake; let us have another tankard; for, ah! how charming a tank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard looks when full!</p>
               <p>"You muſt know, then, that I am very well deſcended: my anceſtors have made ſome noiſe in the world; for my mother cried oyſters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had ſome trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman cannot ſhew ſo reſpectful a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father deſigned to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-ſhew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to <hi>Punch</hi> and King <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of inſtructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progreſs, becauſe I naturally had no ear for muſic; ſo, at the age of fifteen, I went and liſted for a ſoldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, ſo I ſoon found that I diſliked carrying a muſket alſo; neither the one trade nor the other were to my taſte, for I was by nature fond of being a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: beſides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very reaſonably concluded, that
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768"/>
it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</p>
               <p>"The life of a ſoldier ſoon therefore gave me the ſpleen: I aſked leave to quit the ſervice; but, as I was tall and ſtrong, my captain thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for my kind intention, and ſaid, becauſe he had a regard for me, we ſhould not part. I wrote to my father a very diſmal penitent letter, and deſired that he would raiſe money to pay for my diſcharge; but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was (Sir, my ſervice to you), and thoſe who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's diſcharges: in ſhort, he never anſwered my letter. What could be done? If I have not money, ſaid I to myſelf, to pay for my diſcharge, I muſt find an equivalent ſome other way; and that muſt be by running away. I deſerted, and that anſwered my purpoſe every bit as well as if I had bought my diſcharge.</p>
               <p>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment: I ſold my ſoldier's clothes, bought worſe, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the moſt unfrequented roads poſſible. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the pariſh, thrown from his horſe in a miry road, and almoſt ſmothered in the mud. He deſired my aſſiſtance; I gave it, and drew him out with ſome difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off, but I followed
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768"/>
him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate aſked an hundred queſtions; as, whoſe ſon I was; from whence I came; and whether I would be faithful? I anſwered him greatly to his ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and gave myſelf one of the beſt characters in the world for ſobriety (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health), diſcretion, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To make a long ſtory ſhort, he wanted a ſervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other: I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat; I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-ſervant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to ſtarve me between them, I made a pious reſolution to prevent their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting murder: I ſtole the eggs as ſoon as they were laid; I emptied every unfiniſhed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was ſure to diſappear: in ſhort, they found I would not do; ſo I was diſcharged one morning, and paid three ſhillings and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for two months wages.</p>
               <p>"While my money was getting ready, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed myſelf in making preparations for my departure: two hens were hatching in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; I went and habitually took the eggs, and, not to ſeparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knapſack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0"/>
and, with my knapſack on my back, and a ſtaff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the houſe, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop thief! but this only increaſed my diſpatch; it would have been fooliſh to ſtop, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold—I think I paſſed thoſe two months at the curate's without drinking. Come, the times are dry; and may this be my poiſon, if ever I ſpent two more pious, ſtupid months in all my life!</p>
               <p>"Well, after travelling ſome days, whom ſhould I light upon but a company of ſtrolling players? The moment I ſaw them at a diſtance, my heart warmed to them; I had a ſort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love for every thing of the vagabond order; they were employed in ſettling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way. I offered my aſſiſtance, which they excepted; and we ſoon became ſo well acquainted, that they took me as a ſervant. This was a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to me; they ſung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the ſame time. By the blood of the <hi>Mirabels,</hi> I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every word that was ſpoken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure as you ſee; and, though I was poor, I was not modeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0"/>
"I love a ſtraggling life above all things in the world; ſometimes good, ſometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when (the tank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard is out) it ſtands before me. We arrived that evening at <hi>Tenderten,</hi> and took a large room at the <hi>Greyhound;</hi> where we reſolved to exhibit <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet,</hi> with the funeral proceſſion, the grave and the garden ſcene. <hi>Romeo</hi> was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in <hi>Drury-lane; Juliet</hi> by a lady who never appeared on any ſtage before; and I was to ſnuff the candles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dreſs them. The ſame coat that ſerved <hi>Romeo</hi> turned with the blue lining outwards, ſerved for his friend <hi>Mercutio:</hi> a large piece of crape ſufficed at once for <hi>Juliet'</hi>s petticoat and pall: a peſtle and morter, from a neighbouring apothecary's anſwered all the purpoſes of a bell; and our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's own family, wrapped in white ſheets ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſill up the proceſſion. In ſhort, there were but three figures among us that might be ſaid to be dreſſed with any propriety: I mean the nurſe, the ſtraved apothecary, and myſelf. Our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance gave univerſal ſatisfaction: the whole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were enchanted with our powers; and <hi>Tenterden</hi> is a town of taſte.</p>
               <p>There is one rule by which a ſtrolling-player may be ever ſecure of ſucceſs; that is, in our the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032200_0110_0FF1848872282A08"/>
way of expreſſing it, to make a great deal of the character. To ſpeak and act as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, is not playing; nor is it what people come to ſee: natural ſpeaking, like ſweet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and ſcarce leaves any taſte behind it: but being high in a part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles vinegar, which grates upon the taſte, and one feels it while he is drinking. To pleaſe the town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the emphaſis, ſlap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling ſickneſs; that is the way to work for applauſe, that is the way to gain it.</p>
               <p>"As we received much reputation for our ſkill on this firſt exhibition, it was but natural for me to aſcribe part of the ſucceſs to myſelf. I ſnuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-ſnuffer, the piece would loſe half its embelliſhments. In this manner we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a fortnight, and drew tolerable houſes; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very beſt piece, in which all our ſtrength was to be exerted. We had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from this, and even doubled our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; when, behold, one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a ſtroke like thunder to our little company: they were reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go, in a body, to ſcold the man for fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick at ſo inconvenient a time, and that, too, of a diſorder that threatened to be expenſive: I
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032200_0110_0FF1848872282A08"/>
ſeized the moment, and offered to act the part myſelf in his ſtead. The caſe was deſperate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly ſat down, with the part in my hand and a tankard before be (Sir, your health), and ſtudied the character, which was to be rehearſed the next day, and played ſoon after.</p>
               <p>"I found my memory exceſſively helped by drinking; I learned my part with aſtoniſhing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and bid adieu to ſnuffing candles ever after. I found that nature had deſigned me for more noble employments, and I was reſolved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehearſe, and I informed my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, maſters now no longer, of the ſurpriſing change I felt within me. Let the ſick man, ſaid I, be under no uneaſineſs to get well again; I'll fill his place to univerſal ſatisfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I'll engage that he ſhall never be miſſed. I rehearſed before them, ſtrutted, ranted and received ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. They ſoon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were beſpoke. Before I aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtage however, I concluded within my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, as I brought money to the houſe, I ought to have my ſhare in the profits. Gentlemen ſaid I, addreſſing our company, I don't pretend to direct you; far be it from me to treat you with ſo much ingratitude: you have publiſhed
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032200_0111_0FF1848CA8EF89B8"/>
my name in the bills, with the utmoſt good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, as affairs ſtand, cannot act without me; ſo, gentlemen, to ſhew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwiſe I declare off; I'll brandiſh my ſnuffers, and clip candles as uſual. This was a very diſagreeable proppoſal; but they found that it was impoſſible to refuſe it; it was irreſiſtible, it was adamant: they conſented, and I went on in king <hi>Bajazet.</hi> My frowning brows, bound with a ſtocking ſtuffed into a turban, while on my captiv'd arms I brandiſhed a jack-chain. Nature ſeemed to have fitted me for the part; I was tall, and had a loud voice; my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entrance excited univerſal applauſe; I looked round on the audience with a ſmile, and made a moſt low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very paſſionate part, I invigorated my ſpirits with three full glaſſes (the tankard is almoſt out) of brandy. By <hi>Alla!</hi> it is almoſt inconceivable how I went through it; <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was but a fool to me; though he was ſometimes loud enough too, yet I was ſtill louder than he: but then, beſides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded up thus, upon the pit of my ſtomach; it is the way at <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> and has always a fine effect. The tankard would ſink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits: in ſhort, I came off like
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032200_0111_0FF1848CA8EF89B8"/>
a prodigy; and ſuch was my ſucceſs, that I could raviſh the laurels even from a ſurloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over, to compliment me upon my ſucceſs; one praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my voice, another my perſon: Upon my word, ſays the 'ſquire's lady, he will make one of the fineſt actors in <hi>Europe;</hi> I ſay it, and I think I am ſomething of a judge.—Praiſe in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a favour; but, when it comes in great quantities, we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thanking them, I internally applauded myſelf. We were deſired to give our piece a ſecond time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</p>
               <p>"At laſt we left the town, in order to be at a horſe-race at ſome diſtance from thence. I ſhall never think of <hi>Tenterden</hi> without tears of gratitude and reſpect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. Come, let us drink their healths, if you pleaſe, Sir. We quitted the town, I ſay; and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out: I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the town a candle-ſnuffer, and quitted it an hero!—Such is the world! little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could ſay a great deal more upon that ſubject; ſomething truly ſublime upon
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032200_0112_0FF1848E45025170"/>
the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give us both the ſpleen, and ſo I ſhall paſs it over.</p>
               <p>"The races were ended before we arrived at the next town, which was no ſmall diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our company; however, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take all we could get. I played capital characters there too, and came off with my uſual brilliancy. I ſincerely believe I ſhould have been the firſt actor of <hi>Europe,</hi> had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly froſt which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common ſtandard of humanity I played Sir <hi>Harry Wildair;</hi> all the country ladies were charmed: if I but drew out my ſnuff-box, the whole houſe was in a roar of rapture; when I exerciſed my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convulſions.</p>
               <p>There was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in <hi>London;</hi> and this gave her pretenſions to taſte, which rendered her the indiſputable miſtreſs of the ceremonies wherever ſhe came. She was informed of my merits; every body praiſed me; yet ſhe refuſed at firſt going to ſee me perform: ſhe could not conceive, ſhe ſaid, any thing but ſtuff from a ſtroller; talked ſomething in praiſe of <hi>Garrick,</hi> and amazed the ladies with her ſkill in enunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, tones, and cadences. She was at laſt, however, prevailed upon to go; and it was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately

I attempted, by laughing myſelf, to excite at leaſt a ſmile;—but the devil a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into ſympathy: I found it would not do; all my good-humour now became forced; my laughter was converted into hyſteric grinning; and, while I pretened ſpirits my eye ſhewed the agony of my heart.

               <p>WHERE <hi>Tauris</hi> lifts its head above the ſtorm and preſents nothing to the ſight of the diſtant traveller, but a proſpect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; on the bleak boſom of this frightful moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſecluded from ſociety, and deteſting the ways of men, lived <hi>Aſem</hi> the Man-hater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſem</hi> had ſpent his youth with men, had ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their amuſements, and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the moſt ardent affection: but, from the tenderneſs of his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he exauſted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the diſtreſſed. The petitioner never ſued in vain; the weary traveller never paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his door: he only deſiſted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</p>
               <p>From a fortune thus ſpent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from thoſe he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merely

relieved; and made his application with confidence of redreſs. The ungrateful world ſoon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a ſhort-lived paſſion. He ſoon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them: he perceived a thouſand vices he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſpected to exiſt: wherever he turned, ingratitude, diſſimulation, and treachery, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to increaſe his deteſtation of them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with contempt, he retired to this region of ſterility, in order to brood over his reſentment in ſolitude, and converſe with the only honeſt heart he knew; namely, his own.</p>
               <p>A cave was his only ſhelter from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's ſide, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent. In this manner he lived, ſequeſtered from ſociety, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hours in meditation, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting that he was able to live independently of his fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p>At the foot of the mountain, an extenſive lake diſplayed its glaſſy boſom; reflecting, on its broad ſurface, the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would ſometimes deſcend, and, reclining on its ſteep

But the beauty of theſe ſcenes is no way comparable with their utility; from hence an hundred rivers are ſupplied, which diſtribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow. Every part of the univerſe is beautiful, juſt, and wiſe, but man: vile man is a ſoleciſm in nature; the only monſter in the creation. Tempeſts and whirlwinds have their uſe; but vicious, ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of univerſal beauty. Why was I born of that deteſted ſpecies, whoſe vices are almoſt a reproach to the wiſdom of the divine Creator! Were men intirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and order. A world of moral rectitude ſhould be the reſult of a prefectly moral agent. Why, why then, O <hi>Alla!</hi> muſt I be thus confined in darkneſs, doubt and deſpair?"</p>
               <p>Juſt as he uttered the word Deſpair, he was going to plunge into a lake beneath him, at once to ſatisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a moſt majeſtic being walking on the ſurface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he ſtood. So

unexpected an object at once checked his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he ſtopped, contemplated, and fancied he ſaw ſomething awful and divine in his aſpect.</p>
               <p>"Son of Adam," cried the Genius, "ſtop thy raſh purpoſe; the Father of the Faithful has ſeen thy juſtice, thy integrity, thy miſeries, and hath ſent me to afford and adminiſter relief.

                  <hi>Aſem</hi> immediately deſcended upon the lake, and his guide conducted him along the ſurface of the water; 'till, coming near the centre of the lake, they both began to ſink; the waters cloſed over their heads; they deſcended ſeveral hundred fathoms, 'till <hi>Aſem,</hi> juſt ready to give up his life as inevitably loſt, found himſelf with his celeſtial guide in another world, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the waters, where human foot had never trod before. His aſtoniſhment was beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, when he ſaw a ſun like that he had left, a ſerene ſky over his head, and blooming verdure under his feet.</p>
               <p>"I plainly perceive your amazement," ſaid the Genius; "but ſuſpend it for a while. This world was formed by <hi>Alla,</hi> at the requeſt, and under the inſpection, of our great prophet,

If you find this world more agreeable than that you ſo lately left, you have free permiſſion to ſpend the remainder of your days in it; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, for ſome time, to attend you, that I may ſilence your doubts, and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation."</p>
               <p>"A world without vice!

               <p>"Ceaſe thine acclamations," replied the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.

But, had I been permitted to inſtruct our prophet, I would have removed this defect, and formed no voracious or deſtructive animals, which only prey on the other parts of the creation." "Your tenderneſs for inferior animals is, I find, remarkable," ſaid the Genius, ſmiling. But with regard to meaner creatures, this world exactly reſembles the other; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for obvious reaſons: for the earth can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a more conſiderable number of animals, by their thus becoming food for each other than if they had lived entirely on the vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; ſo that animals of different natures, thus formed, inſtead of leſſening their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſubſiſt in the greateſt number poſſible.

But they had ſcarce left the confines of the wood, when they beheld one or the inhabitants flying with haſty ſteps, and terror in his countenance, from an army of ſquirrels that cloſely purſued him.

He had ſcarce ſpoke, when he perceived two dogs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing another of the human ſpecies, who, with equal terror and haſte, attempted to avoid them. "This," cried <hi>Aſem</hi> to his guide, "is truly ſurpriſing; nor can I conceive the reaſon for ſo ſtrange an action." "Every ſpecies of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals," replied the Genius, "has of late grown very powerful in this country; for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, at firſt, thinking it unjuſt to uſe either fraud or force in deſtroying them, they have inſenſibly increaſed, and now frequently ravage their harmleſs frontiers." "But they ſhould have been deſtroyed," cried <hi>Aſem;</hi> "you ſee the conſequence of ſuch neglect." "Where is then that tenderneſs you ſo lately expreſſed for ſubordinate animals?" replied the Genius, ſmiling: "you ſeem to have forgot that branch of juſtice."

But let us no longer obſerve the duty, of men to theſe irrational creatures, but ſurvey their connexions with one another."</p>
               <p>As they walked further up the country, the more he was ſurpriſed to ſee no veſtiges of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome houſes, no cities, nor any mark of elegant deſign. His conductor perceiving his ſurpriſe, obſerved, That the inhabitants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; each had an houſe, which though home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was ſufficient to lodge his little family; they were too good to build houſes, which would only increaſe their own pride, and the envy of the ſpectator; what they built was for convenience, not for ſhew. "At leaſt, then," ſaid <hi>Aſem,</hi> "they have neither architects, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or ſtatuaries, in their ſociety; but theſe are idle arts and may be ſpared. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpend much more time here, you ſhould have my thanks for introducing me into the ſociety of ſome of their wiſeſt men: there is ſcarce any pleaſure to me equal to a refined converſation; there is nothing of which I am ſo enamoured as wiſdom." "Wiſdom!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his inſtuctor, "how ridiculous! We have no wiſdom here, for we have no occaſion for it; true wiſdom is only a knowledge of our own duty, and the duty of others to us: but of what uſe is ſuch wiſdom here? Each intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively performs what is right in himſelf, and
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032200_0118_0FF1849EF4024908"/>
expects the ſame from others. If, by wiſdom, you ſhould mean vain curioſity and empty ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, as ſuch pleaſures have their origin in vanity, luxury, or avarice, we are too good to purſue them." "All this may be right," ſays <hi>Aſem;</hi> "but, methinks, I obſerve a ſolitary diſpoſition prevail among the people; each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily keeps ſeparately within their own precincts, without ſociety or without intercourſe." "That indeed, is true," replied the other; "here is no eſtabliſhed ſociety; nor ſhould there be any: all ſocieties are made either through fear or friendſhip; the people we are among, are too good to fear each other; and there are no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to private friendſhip, where all are equally meritorious." "Well, then," ſaid the ſceptic, "as I am to ſpend my time here, if I am to have neither the polite arts, nor wiſdom, nor friendſhip, in ſuch a world, I ſhould be glad, at leaſt, of an eaſy companion, who may tell me his thoughts, and to whom I may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate mine." "And to what purpoſe ſhould either do this?" ſays the Genius: "flattery or curioſity are vicious motives, and never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed here; and wiſdom is out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
               <p>"Still, however," ſaid <hi>Aſem,</hi> "the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants muſt be happy; each is contented with his own poſſeſſions, nor avariciouſly endeavours to heap up more than is neceſſary for his own

ſubſiſtence; each has, therefore, leiſure to pity thoſe that ſtand in need of his compaſſion." He had ſcarce ſpoken, when his ears were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who ſat by the way-ſide, and, in the moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtreſs, ſeemed gently to murmur at his own miſery. <hi>Aſem</hi> immediately ran to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and found him in the laſt ſtage of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. "Strange," cried the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> "that men who are free from vice ſhould thus ſuffer ſo much miſery without relief!" "Be not ſurpriſed," ſaid the wretch who was dying; "would it not be the utmoſt injuſtice for beings, who have only juſt ſufficient to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are content with a bare ſubſiſtance, to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine? They never are poſſeſſed of a ſingle meal more than is neceſſary; and what is barely neceſſary, cannot be diſpenſed with." "They ſhould have been ſupplied with more than is neceſſary," cried <hi>Aſem;</hi> "and yet I contradict my own opinion but a moment before: all is doubt, perplexity, and confuſion. Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here, ſince they never received a favour. They have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, another excellence, yet behind; the love of their country is ſtill, I hope, one of their darling virtues." "Peace, <hi>Aſem!</hi>" replied the guardian, with a countenance not leſs ſevere than beautiful, "nor forfeit all thy pretenſions

to wiſdom; the ſame ſelfiſh motives by which we prefer our own intereſt to that of others, induce us to regard our country preferable to that of another. Nothing leſs than univerſal benevolence is free from vice, and that you ſee is practiſed here." "Strange!" cries the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed pilgrim, in an agony of diſtreſs; "what ſort of a world am I now introduced to? There is ſcarce a ſingle virtue, but that of temperance, which they practiſe; and in that they are no way ſuperior to the very brute creation. There is ſcarce an amuſement which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; fortitude, liberality, friendſhip, wiſdom, converſation, and love of country, all are virtues entirely unknown here; thus it ſeems, that to be unacquainted with vice, is not to know virtue. Take me, O my Genius, back to that very world which I have deſpiſed: a world which has <hi>Alla</hi> for its contriver, is much more wiſely formed than that which has been projected by <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Ingratitude, contempt, and hatred I can now ſuffer, for perhaps I have deſerved them. When I arraigned the wiſdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, I only ſhewed my own ignorance; henceforth let me keep from vice myſelf, and pity it in others."</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce ended, when the Genius, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming an air of terrible complacency, called all his thunders around him, and vaniſhed in a whirlwind. <hi>Aſem,</hi> aſtoniſhed at the terror of

He now departed from the water-ſide in traquillity, and, leaving his horrid manſion, travelled to <hi>Segeſtan,</hi> his native city; where he diligently applied himſelf to commerce, and put in practice that wiſdom he had learned in ſolitude. The frugality of a few years ſoon produced oppulence; the number of his domeſtics increaſed; his friends came to him from every part of the city; nor did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with diſdain; and a youth of miſery was concluded with an old-age of elegance, affluence, and eaſe.</p>

               <head>THE STORY OF ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS.</head>
               <head type="sub">TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ATHENS,</hi> long after the decline of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> empire, ſtill continued the ſeat of learning, politeneſs, and wiſdom. <hi>Theodoric,</hi> the <hi>Oſtrogoth.</hi> repaired the ſchools which barbarity was ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall into decay, and continued thoſe penſions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</p>
               <p>In this city, and about this period, <hi>Alcander</hi> and <hi>Septimius</hi> were fellow ſtudents together; the one, the moſt ſubtle reaſoner of all the <hi>Lyceum;</hi> the other, the moſt eloquent ſpeaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration ſoon begot a friendſhip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two moſt celebrated cities in the world; for <hi>Alcander</hi> was of <hi>Athens, Septimius</hi> came from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſtate of harmony they lived for ſome time together, when <hi>Alcander,</hi> after paſſing the firſt part of his youth in the indolence of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, thought at length of entering into the buſy world; and, as a ſtep previous to this, placed his affections on <hi>Hypatia,</hi> a lady of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032200_0122_0FF184AACCCF6758"/>
and nothing now remained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcander'</hi>s exultation in his own happineſs, or being unable to enjoy any ſatisfaction without making his friend <hi>Septimius</hi> a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce <hi>Hypatia</hi> to his fellow-ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himſelf equally happy in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and love. But this was an interview fatal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the future peace of both; for <hi>Septimius</hi> no ſooner ſaw her, but he was ſmitten with an involuntary paſſion; and, though he uſed every effort to ſuppreſs deſires at once ſo imprudent and unjuſt, the emotions of his mind in a ſhort time became ſo ſtrong, that they brought on a fever, which the phyſicians judged incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>During this illneſs, <hi>Alcander</hi> watched him with all the anxiety of fondneſs, and brought his miſtreſs to join in thoſe amiable offices of friendſhip. The ſagacity of the phyſicians, by theſe means, ſoon diſcovered that the cauſe of their patient's diſorder was love; and <hi>Alcander,</hi> being appriſed of their diſcovery, at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted a confeſſion from the reluctant dying lover.</p>
               <p>It would but delay the narrative to deſcribe the conflict between love and friendſhip in the breaſt of <hi>Alcander</hi> on this occoſion; it is enough
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032200_0123_0FF184AEE16149C0"/>
to ſay, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were at that time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſuch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exceſs. In ſhort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms to the young <hi>Roman.</hi> They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the conſtitution of the now happy <hi>Septimius.</hi> In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and ſet out with his fair partner for <hi>Rome.</hi> Here, by an exertion of thoſe talents which he was ſo eminently poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, <hi>Septimius,</hi> in a few years, arrived at the higheſt dignities of the ſtate, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the city judge, or praetor.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Alcander</hi> not only felt the pain of being ſeparated from his friend and his miſtreſs, but a perſecution was alſo commenced againſt him, by the relations of <hi>Hypatia,</hi> for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſely given up his bride, as was ſuggeſted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to withſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a powerful party. He was caſt, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to raiſe ſo large a ſum at the time appointed, his poſſeſſions were confiſcated, he himſelf was ſtripped of the habit of freedom, expoſed as a ſlave in the market-place, and ſold to the higheſt bidder.</p>

A merehant of <hi>Thrace</hi> becoming his purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, <hi>Alcander,</hi> with ſome other companions of diſtreſs, was carried into that region of deſolation and ſterility. His ſtated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious maſter, and his ſucceſs in hunting was all that was allowed him to ſupply his precarious ſubſiſtance. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of ſeaſon ſerved but to aggravate his unſheltered diſtreſs. After ſome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of eſcaping offered; he embraced it with ardour; ſo that, travelling by night, and lodging in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by day, to ſhorten a long ſtory, he at laſt arrived in <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſame day on which <hi>Alcander</hi> arrived, <hi>Septimius</hi> ſat adminiſtering juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the forum, whether our wanderer came, expecting to be inſtantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he ſtood the whole day amongſt the crowd, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was ſo much altered by a long ſucceſſion of hardſhips, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unnoticed among the reſt; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repulſed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of ſeeking a place to lie in, and
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0"/>
yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the citizens would harbour ſo much wretchedneſs; and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtreets might be attended with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or danger: in ſhort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the uſual retreat of guilt, poverty, and deſpair. In this manſion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for a while in ſleep; and found, on his flinty couch, more eaſe than beds of down can ſupply to the guilty.</p>
               <p>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but, happening to diſagree about the diviſion of their plunder, one of them ſtabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In theſe circumſtances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was ſpread; the cave was examined; and <hi>Alcander</hi> being found, was immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and accuſed of robbery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The circumſtances againſt him were ſtrong, and the wretchedneſs of his appearance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſuſpicion. Misfortune and he were now ſo long acquainted, that he at laſt became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of life. He deteſted a world where he had found only ingratitude, falſehood, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; he was determined to make no defence;
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0"/>
and thus, lowering with reſolution, he was dragg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bound with cords, before the tribunal of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius.</hi> As the proofs were poſitive againſt him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a moſt cruel and ignomonious death, when the attention of the multitude was ſoon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended ſelling his plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſtruck with a panic, had confeſſed his crime. He was brought bound to the ſame tribunal, and acquitted every other perſon of any partnerſhip in his guilt. <hi>Alcander'</hi>s innocence therefore appeared, but the ſullen raſhneſs of his conduct remained a wonder to the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude; but their aſtoniſhment was ſtill further increaſed, when they ſaw their judge ſtart from his tribunal to embrace the ſuppoſed criminal. <hi>Septimius</hi> recollected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the ſequel be related? <hi>Alcander</hi> was acquitted; ſhared the friendſhip and honours of the principal citizens of <hi>Rome;</hi> lived afterwards in happineſs and caſe; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circumſtances are ſo deſperate, which Providence may not relieve.</p>

               <p>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which I paſſed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling ſome pain in thinking that thoſe happy days are never to return. In that retreat, all nature ſeemed capable of affording pleaſure: I then made no refinements on happineſs, but could be pleaſed with the moſt aukward efforts of ruſtic mirth; thought croſs-purpoſes the higheſt ſtretch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wit, and queſtions and commands the moſt rational way of ſpending the evening. Happy could ſo charming an illuſion ſtill continue! I find that age and knowledge only contribute to ſour our diſpoſitions. My preſent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely leſs pleaſing. The pleaſure the beſt actors gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's ſermon. The muſic of the fineſt ſinger is diſſonance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid ſung me into tears with <hi>Johnny Armſtrong'</hi>s Laſt Good Night, or the cruelty of <hi>Barbara Allen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Writers of every age have endeavoured to ſhew that pleaſure is in us, and not in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects offered for our amuſement. If the ſoul be happily diſpoſed, every thing becomes capable
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8"/>
of affording entertainment; and diſtreſs will almoſt want a name. Every occurrence paſſes in review like the figures of a proceſſion; ſome may be aukward, others ill-dreſſed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the maſter of the ceremony.</p>
               <p>I remember to have once ſeen a ſlave in a fortification in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who appeared no way touched with his ſituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to this for life: yet, with all theſe circumſtances of apparent wretchedneſs, he ſang, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrieſt, happieſt man of all the garriſon. What a practical philoſopher was here! An happy conſtitution ſupplied philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and, though ſeemingly deſtitute of wiſdom, he was really wiſe. No reading or ſtudy had contributed to diſenchant the fairy-land around him: every thing furniſhed him with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of mirth; and, though ſome thought him, from his inſenſibility, a fool, he was ſuch an ideot as philoſophers ſhould wiſh to imitate; for all philoſophy is only forcing the trade of happineſs, when nature ſeems to have denied the means.</p>
               <p>They who, like our ſlave, can place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on that ſide of the world in which every thing appears in a pleaſing light, will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8"/>
in every occurrence to excite their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour. The moſt calamitous events, either to themſelves or others, can bring no new afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the buſtle of heroiſm, or the rants of ambition, ſerve only to heighten the abſurdity of the ſcene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in ſhort, as little anguiſh at their own diſtreſs, or the complaints of others, as the undertaker though dreſſed in black, feels ſorrow at a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> poſſeſſed this happineſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the higheſt degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and deſpiſed all that wore the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantic appearance of philoſophy, wherever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was to be ſold, he was generally foremoſt to raiſe the auction. Being an univerſal admirer of the fair ſex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: if ſhe, too, rejected his addreſſes, he never thought of retiring into deſerts, or pining in hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſtreſs: he perſuaded himſelf, that, inſtead of loving the lady, he only fancied that he had loved her; and ſo all was well again. When fortune wore her angrieſt look, and he at laſt fell into the power of his moſt deadly enemy, Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> (being confined a cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032200_0127_0FF184B95676F618"/>
in the caſtle of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi>) he never attempted to ſupport his diſtreſs by wiſdom or philoſophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himſelf and his perſecutor, and ſeemed infinitely pleaſed at his new ſituation. In this manſion of diſtreſs, though ſecluded from his friends, though denied all the amuſements and even the conveniences, of life, he ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his good-humour; laughed at all the little ſpite of his enemies; and carried the jeſt ſo far, as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</p>
               <p>All that the wiſdom of the proud can teach, is to be ſtubborn or ſullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's example will inſtruct us to be merry in circumſtances of the higheſt affliction. It matters not whether our good-humour be conſtrued by others into inſenſibility, or even ideotiſm; it is happineſs to ourſelves, and none but a fool would meaſure his ſatisfaction by what the world thinks of it. For my own part, I never paſs by one of our priſons for debt, that I no not envy that felicity which is ſtill going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward among thoſe people, who forget the cares of the world by being ſhut out from its ambition.</p>
               <p>The happieſt ſilly fellow I ever knew, was of the number of thoſe good-natured creatures that are ſaid to do no harm to any but themſelves. Whenever he fell into any miſery, he uſually called it, Seeing Life. If his head was broke

His inattention to money matters had incenſed his father to ſuch a degree, that all the interceſſion of friends in his favour was fruitleſs. The old gentleman was on his death-bed. The whole family, and <hi>Dick</hi> among the number, gathered around him. "I leave my ſecond ſon, <hi>Andrew,</hi>" ſaid the expiring miſer, "my whole eſtate, and deſire him to be frugal." <hi>Andrew,</hi> in a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tone, as is uſual on theſe occaſions, prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himſelf. "I recommend <hi>Simon,</hi> my third ſon, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him, beſide, four thouſand pounds." "Ah! father," cried <hi>Simon</hi> (in great affliction, to be ſure), "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourſelf." At laſt, turning to poor <hi>Dick,</hi> "As for you, you have always been a ſad dog; you'll never come to good; you'll never be rich; I'll leave you a ſhilling to buy a halter." "Ah! father," cries <hi>Dick,</hi> without any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!" This was all the trouble the loſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave this thoughtleſs imprudent creature. However, the tenderneſs of an uncle recompenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neglect of a father; and my friend is

ſufficiency, and of ſupplying only the wants of nature; but is there not more ſatisfaction in indulging thoſe appetites, if with innocence and ſafety, than in reſtraining them? Am not I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed in enjoyment, than in the ſullen ſatisfaction of thinking that I can live without enjoyment?</p>
                  <p>The more various our artificial neceſſities, the wider is our circle of pleaſure; for all pleaſure conſiſts in obviating neceſſities as they riſe: luxury, therefore, as it increaſes our wants, increaſes our capacity for happineſs.</p>

               <head>PICTURE OF A CRITIC.</head>
               <p>A CRITIC is often guided by the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that direct his author. The author endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſuade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally ſolicitous to ſhew that he could write a better, had he thought proper. A critic is a being poſſeſſed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a ſcholar; inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, from his native weakneſs, of lifting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ground, he applies to contiguous merit for ſupport, makes the ſportive ſallies of another's imagination his ſerious employment, pretends to take our feelings under his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the emphaſis of praiſe, and may with as much juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be called a man of taſte, as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> who meaſures his wiſdom by the length of his nails.</p>
               <p>If, then, a book, ſpirited or humorous, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to appear in the republic of letters, ſeveral critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a ſingle line of it, for themſelves had read it; and they know what is moſt proper to excite laughter. Other critics contradict the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of this tribunal, call them all ſpiders, and aſſure the public, that the ought to laugh without reſtraint. Another ſet are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the

book, intended to ſhew the particular paſſages to be laughed at: when theſe are out, others ſtill there are, who write notes upon notes. Thus a ſingle new book employs not only the paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, the printers, the preſs-men, the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binders, the hawkers, but twenty critics, and as many compilers.

Yet, from the vernal ſoftneſs of the air, the verdure of the fields, the tranſparency of the ſtreams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to courtſhip. Here Love might ſport among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amidſt gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it ſeems he has forſaken the iſland; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the laſt and moſt trifling conſideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their ſympathetic ſouls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's marriageable grove; the match is ſtruck up; and both parties are piouſly in love—according to act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus, they who have fortune, are poſſeſſed at leaſt of ſomething that is lovely; but I actually pity thoſe who have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, at leaſt among our clergymen and officers. The bluſh and innocence of ſixteen was ſaid to have a powerful influence over theſe two profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But of late, all the little traffic of bluſhing, ogling, dimpling, and ſmiling, has been forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by an act in that caſe wiſely made and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. A lady's whole cargo of ſmiles, ſighs, and whiſpers, is declared utterly contraband, till ſhe
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032200_0132_0FF184C96A3BE7A8"/>
arrives in the warm latitude twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and ſmile, when the dimples begin to forſake her; and, when perhaps grown ugly, is charitably intruſted with an unlimited uſe of her charms. Her lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, however, by this time, have forſaken her; the captain has changed for another miſtreſs; the prieſt himſelf leaves her in ſolitude, to bewail her virginity, and ſhe dies even without benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Thus you find the <hi>Europeans</hi> diſcouraging love with as much earneſtneſs as the rudeſt ſavage of <hi>Sofala.</hi> The Genius is ſurely now no more. In every region there ſeem enemies in arms to oppreſs him. Avarice in <hi>Europe,</hi> jealouſy in <hi>Perſia,</hi> ceremony in <hi>China,</hi> poverty among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and laſt in <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> are all prepared to oppoſe his power. The Genius is certainly baniſhed from earth, though once ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ſuch a variety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as inſtances of his former reſidence and favour.</p>
               <p>"The Genius of Love," ſays the Eaſtern Apologue, "had long reſided in the happy plains of <hi>Abra,</hi> where every breeze was health, and every ſound produced tranquillity. His temple at firſt was crowded, but every age leſſened

the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiving, therefore, his altars at length quite deſerted, he was reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to ſome more propitious region; and he appriſed the fair ſex of every country, where he could hope for a proper reception, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their right to his preſence among them. In return to this proclamation, embaſſies were ſent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to diſplay the ſuperiority of their claims.</p>
               <p>"And, firſt, the beauties of <hi>China</hi> appeared. No country could compare with them for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, either of look, dreſs, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes, of the moſt beautiful ſilk, hid their hands, boſom, and neck, while their faces only were left uncovered. They indulged no airs that might expreſs looſe deſires, and they ſeemed to ſtudy only the graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eye-brows were, however, alledged by the Genius againſt them; but he ſet them entirely aſide, when he came to examine their little feet.</p>
               <p>"The beauties of <hi>Circaſſia</hi> next made their appearance. They advanced, hand in hand, ſinging the moſt immodeſt airs, and leading up a dance in the moſt luxurious attitudes. Their dreſs was but half a covering; the neck, the left breaſt, and all the limbs were expoſed to
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032200_0133_0FF184CB13F9BD30"/>
view; which, after ſome time, ſeemed rather to ſatiate than inflame deſire. The lily and the roſe contended in forming their complexions; and a ſoft ſleepineſs of eye added irreſiſtible poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered, to their admirers; they ſeemed to give, rather than receive courtſhip: and the Genius of Love diſmiſſed them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his regard, ſince they exchanged the duties of love, and made themſelves not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, but the purſuing ſex.</p>
               <p>"The kingdom of <hi>Kaſhmire</hi> next produced its charming deputies. This happy region ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peculiarly ſequeſtered by Nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one ſide from the ſcorching ſun; and ſea-born breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their complexions were of a bright yellow, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared almoſt tranſparent, while the crimſon tulip ſeemed to bloſſom on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the ſtatuary's power to expreſs; and their teeth whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than their own ivory. He was almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to reſide among them, when, unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one of the ladies talked of appointing his ſera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>"In this proceſſion the naked inhabitants of <hi>Southern America</hi> would not be left behind: their charms were found to ſurpaſs whatever the warmeſt imagination could conceive; and

ſerved to ſhew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the ſeeming diſadvantage of a brown complexion. But their ſavage education ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them utterly unqualified to make the proper uſe of their power, and they were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as being incapable of uniting mental with ſenſual ſatisfaction. In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their ſuits rejected: the black beauties of <hi>Benin,</hi> and the tawny daughters of <hi>Borneo,</hi> the women of <hi>Wida</hi> with ſcarred faces, and the hideous virgins of <hi>Cafra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> the ſquab ladies of <hi>Lapland,</hi> three feet high, and the giant fair-ones of <hi>Patagonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"The beauties of <hi>Europe</hi> at laſt appeared; grace in their ſteps, and ſenſibility ſmiling in every eye. It was the univerſal opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail; and the Genius ſeemed to lend them his moſt favourite attention. They opened their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the utmoſt modeſty; but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as their orator proceeded, ſhe happened to let fall the words, 'Houſe in Town, Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Pin-money.' Theſe ſeemingly harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs terms had inſtantly a ſurpriſing effect: the Genius, with ungovernable rage, burſt from amidſt the circle; and, waving his youthful pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, left this earth, and flew back to thoſe aetherial manſions from whence he deſcended.</p>
               <p>"The whole aſſembly was ſtruck with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they now juſtly apprehended that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male

power would be no more, ſince love had forſaken them. They continued ſome time thus in a ſtate of torpid deſpair, when it was propoſed by one of the number, that, ſince the real Genius of Love had left them, in order to continue their power, they ſhould ſet up an idol in his ſtead; and that the ladies of every country ſhould furniſh him with what each liked beſt. This propoſal was inſtantly reliſhed and agreed to. An idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the aſſembly, though no way reſembling the departed Genius.
