            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE man of feeling, and the friend of freedom, will read the life of Baron Trenck with ſenſations perhaps too ſtrong: it will remain an eternal monument of the deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the diabolical effects of deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>The hiſtorian will acquire from him eſſential information concerning the characters of perſons, courts, and kingdoms, highly illuſtrative of the annals of the preſent century.</p>
            <p>The philoſopher will meditate on the manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Germany; will wonder, while reading, to recollect that there, as in ſtates more improved, ſuch numbers ſhould remain ſo, almoſt miraculouſly, ignorant, ſuperſtitious, and credulous, while knowledge and ſcience appear to be ſo far advanced; will ſigh, to be ſo repeatedly told of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary courts, and judges condemned to ſweep the ſtreets, after effecting the ruin of thouſands; will inceſſantly reflect, with amazement, at the ſtrange jargon, and confuſion, that ſtill are ſo univerſal over the globe, as he reads the words, king, liberty, vaſſal, military ſentence, property, juſt claim, and an infinity of other heterogeneous and incompatible phraſes; continually will he exclaim—How many ages yet, oh world, muſt thou exiſt, ere thy ſons ſhall indeed learn wiſdom!</p>
            <p>The book is, what it would be, the perfect reſemblance of its author; an original, bold, and intereſting picture, Like him, it has its defects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they are forgotten in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of its inherent and maſculine beauties.</p>

               <head>LETTER I. MORTIMER TO CAROLINE.</head>
               <p>YOUR affectionate ſolicitude, my amiable Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, merits every return that grateful tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fraternal love can make; and the heart of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer offers you its warmeſt acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>The long abſence of which you ſo pathetically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ariſes from no common event, but all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are ill-founded.— It is no miſplaced attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that makes me thus long a ſtranger to my native ſpot: it is no deſtructive infatuation which I am ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant to avow; it is—and why ſhould the heart of virtue bluſh to confeſs it?—the impulſe of generous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.</p>
               <p>You ſmile, my penetrating ſiſter; modern ſenſibility has been the frequent ſubject of my ſatyric powers; but it has been that ſuperficial impoſtor, the offspring of pride and artifice, cheriſhed by the undiſtinguiſhing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of vulgarity, that I have derided; the genuine effuſions of a ſenſible and benevolent ſpirit I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways revered. With me the plaintive voice of unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſorrow has ever been ſacred: and the errors of humanity have never failed to find an indulgent advocate in my boſom.</p>
               <p>This honeſt confeſſion, my dear Caroline, is but the prelude to a tale of woe, which may, I think, convey a

               <p>As ſoon as I had tranſacted the buſineſs that brought me hither, I had adieu to the family of our worthy friend, and hired apartments in a neighbouring ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port town, reſolved to ſee every thing worthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a curious traveller in this part of the world. In this purſuit I ſpent ſome time very agreeably, when, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one evening from a pleaſurable excurſion, I found, in addition to the ſociety I had left on going out, a young handſome military officer, and a moſt attractive elegant lady, who were, I was informed, united in the moſt ſacred of all bands, and purpoſed to fix their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in that place during the ſummer ſeaſon. The engaging emanations of exalted modeſty, good ſenſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eep ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and plaintive ſoftneſs, in the <hi>tout-enſemble</hi> of the lady, ſoon intereſted me in her favour: and I wiſhed to know if the form and manners, ſo calculated to charm, were faithful emblems of as lovely a mind. To this end I aſſiduouſly cultivated the acquaintance of the captain; he ſeemed flattered by my attentions, and a ſhort time produced an exceſs of ſociability. I laughed, drank, ſung, ſmoaked, and boaſted of gallantry with him; and ſometimes talked ſentimentally with his fair partner, the enchanting Ela. I reſolved to ſpare no pains to diſcover the native qualities of her ſoul, and ſoon found it was too perfect to need any diſguiſe. Her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was that of virtue, adorned by the graces: every ſentiment ſhe uttered ſeemed the ſpontaneous effuſions of an enlightened and elevated mind, and was worthy of being immortaliſed; yet, in the midſt of apparent happineſs, a ſudden cloud of tender melancholy would ariſe, which in vain I endeavoured to penetrate. It often croſſed her features without any apparent cauſe, but generally vaniſhed in ſome benevolent or affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effuſion. In love as in every other gentle and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſenſation of the heart, I diſcovered her to be a perfect enthuſiaſt. A ſtranger to every lukewarm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, her expreſſive eyes beamed unutterable tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:021723_0006_0FB7408435FE7AB0"/>
on the object of her choice, and frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him with a kind of ſoft anxiety for which all my penetration was unable fully to account; but I thought I traced indifference, and ſometimes more ungentle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in <hi>his</hi> aſpect and behaviour. How often, when obſerving the impaſſioned attachment that evinced itſelf in all her looks, words, and actions, directed to him, have I appealed to the ſearcher of hearts, whether there was in exiſtence a being capable of injuring ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence? But I did not long wait for a diſcovery that brought the fulleſt conviction.</p>
               <p>Having been abſent near a fortnight on a viſit to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who, finding in me a taſte and ſentiment congenial with his own, had given me repeated invitations to his houſe, I returned to my former habitation, deſigning to bid adieu to my newly acquired friends, and turn my thoughts and wiſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward home. But how was I amazed and ſhocked on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the houſe, where I had ſo lately left them in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent happineſs, to find the amiable Ela alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, expoſed among unfeeling ſtrangers, to all the horrors of poverty, and the moſt poignant anguiſh of heart! Pale and dejected ſhe aroſe at my entrance, fixed her ſwimming eyes on my face, and reading the language of my heart, burſt into a paſſionate effuſion of wo, and was retiring. I could not ſpeak—but ſeizing her hand, as ſhe was about to leave me, ſhe looked at me with an expreſſion that will be forever engraved on my remembrance, and, ſinking into a chair by my ſide, endeavoured to ſuppreſs her emotions.— Mine, I believe, were little leſs violent—Pity entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed my ſoul; and ſhall I own it, my Caroline? —the unmanly tear bedewed the hand of the lovely ſufferer.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhe raiſed her eyes, beaming with gratitude through the deepeſt gloom of ſorrow, and preſſing my hand to her agitated heart—"Noble ſtranger!" ſhe exclaimed—"Do you weep for my ſufferings?—A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as! you know not how little I merit ſuch generous ſympathy, ſuch exalted goodneſs!"</p>
               <p>"I know," replied I, "that you are unhappy—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021723_0007_0FB74091B4B12E78"/>
and is not that enough?" "Enough!"—repeated ſhe, with emotion—"Yes," I added, "and I likewiſe believe you are truly amiable."</p>
               <p>"Then you are miſtaken," interrupted ſhe, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme energy—"I am not—Indeed I am not! —I do not merit your friendſhip—nor can I dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you —Oh! I am loſt! loſt for ever!"—ſhe claſped her hands in agony. "But your unexampled greatneſs of ſoul," added ſhe, "merits more than I can ſay: and truth and ſincerity is the only acknowledgment in my power.—Yes ſir,"—ſaid ſhe, again riſing, "you ſhall know who ſhe is whoſe ſorrows you thus condeſcend to regard;—and for your ſake, I will yet believe, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue reſides among the ſons of men."</p>
               <p>With thoſe words ſhe darted out of the room, leaving me in a ſtate of mind to which no language can do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>My ſteps turned involuntarily after her, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the miſtreſs of the houſe convinced me of an error, and I accompanied her back into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>"Ah! ſir," ſaid ſhe, as we entered, "here has been ſad doings ſince you left us—Well—who could think that ſuch a handſome gentleman and ſuch a fine lady would turn out ſo!—Why the captain is a downright rogue, ſir—and his wife, as he called her, is no better" —"Oh!"—interrupted I,—"you ſhould not ſo readily believe injurious reports.—I dare ſay it is no more than ſome little temporary derangement which has been greatly exaggerated: or, perhaps, entirely miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented."</p>
               <p>"No, no Sir," replied the woman, "'tis too true— Why the lady expoſed herſelf—Trouble, like children, generally ſpeaks truth.—Not but I pity the poor thing; and yet I'm looſer enough by them already; ſo if ſhe can't pay what is due, I muſt ſtop all I can, and ſhe muſt not think of ſtaying here to ſpunge upon an honeſt woman."</p>
               <p>"But you ſurely would not turn her out into the ſtreet!" exclaimed I.—</p>
               <p>"It is nothing to me, ſir, where ſhe goes,"—return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021723_0008_0FB7409335C9AB28"/>
ſhe—"but I know ſhe ſhan't take up my houſe-room and eat my victuals any longer, and ſo I am going to tell her."</p>
               <p>"Stop!"—cried I, as ſhe opened the door to put her cruel threats in execution —"Would you diſtreſs the wretched?"</p>
               <p>"No;"—ſhe replied— "nor they ſhan't diſtreſs me."</p>
               <p>"Hear me then," added I,—"I will be anſwerable for every expence of this unfortunate lady."</p>
               <p>"Well to be ſure, you're a generous gentleman,"— ſaid the woman with a malignant ſneer, "and the loſs of one is often the gain of two."</p>
               <p>I paid no regard to her inſolence, but depoſiting a bill of twenty pounds in her hand to prove the ſincerity of my words, earneſtly deſired that her amiable charge might be treated with all poſſible reſpect and attention: and again aſſuring her of an ample reward, begged ſhe would take to herſelf all the merit ſhe might fancy there was in this conduct;—nor ever let the ſecret paſs her lips, as ſhe expected the performance of my promiſe.</p>
               <p>With this injunction ſhe readily acquieſced: and I left her, ſoothed by the magic power of gold into the moſt engaging benignity.</p>
               <p>Conſoled by the ſweet aſſurance of having gratified a laudable impulſe, I retired to my apartment, and was buried in a labyrinth of conjecture relative to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Ela—when the woman of the houſe tapped at my door, and requeſted to ſpeak with me.</p>
               <p>"The lady," ſaid ſhe, in a tone of alarm—"has faſtened her door, and obſtinately refuſes to anſwer me."</p>
               <p>A dreadful fear croſſed my mind, and, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any reply, I haſtily followed her with trembling ſteps.</p>
               <p>After trying every gentle means to procure admiſſion without ſucceſs, I acquieſced in the expedience of uſing forcible meaſures, and the door was broke open.</p>
               <p>Impreſſed with terrible apprehenſions I entered the room, and beheld the cauſe of my diſquietude ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the carpet with death marked on her features. Unmindful of vulgar cenſure I threw myſelf beſide her,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021723_0009_0FB74094B9C17238"/>
and mourned her lot, fully aſſured that her ſoul had taken its irrevocable flight. But I was ſoon moſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undeceived. The people around me declared ſhe was only in a fit, and a few minutes confirmed the truth of their aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The recollection of her miſery ruſhed like a torrent on her mind; and fixing her eloquent eyes on my face, ſhe enquired, why I had ſuffered them to bring her back?—</p>
               <p>"That we may all unite our endeavours to render you happy," I replied,—"Happy!" echoed ſhe, with a gloomy ſmile—"You know but little of the heart of Ela." As ſhe uttered theſe words her eyes met thoſe of the miſtreſs of the manſion—and, ſtarting wildly from me, ſhe exclaimed, "What, and is that woman too come to render me happy! O, righteous Heaven, why am I reduced to be the ſport of abject cruelty!—But think not, worthy ſtranger," added ſhe—"that I ungratefully claſs you among the unfeeling herd; O, no, the wretched Ela can yet diſtinguiſh ſuch as you—your goodneſs is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten here,"—pointing to her boſom—"in indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.—Yes, and it is written likewiſe on a table that corruption cannot deſtroy; where I, perhaps, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template it when this poor form is mouldered into duſt: and where,"—added ſhe, with an air of mild, yet moſt commanding dignity,—"I may forget too how that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man" (again fixing her eye on the abaſhed offender) "has dared to inſult me."</p>
               <p>"Me inſult you!" cried the woman, whlie anger and ſhame ſpread their ſanguine emblems, over her features— How can you ſay, Miſs, as how I ever inſulted you— I'm ſure your're very ſpiteful, and"—</p>
               <p>I found ſhe was about to enlarge—and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting all my authoritative powers to awe her into ſilence, they happily produced ſuch an effect, that muttering ſome unintelligible jargon, ſhe quitted the room.</p>
               <p>"I refuſed to admit that woman into my apartment, Sir," (ſaid the gentle mourner, addreſſing me)—"be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe has uſed an inſolence of language to which no misfortune ſhall ever make me baſe enough to ſubmit;— but when I heard your friendly voice at the door, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

burſt on my oppreſſed ſoul, and unequal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, I ſunk into inſenſibility."</p>
               <p>I entreated her ardently to endeavour to forget all that could diſturb her repoſe, and ventured to palliate the miſconduct of the landlady: who was, I ſincerely aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, fully ſenſible and aſhamed of her behaviour: and would not, I was convinced, in a cooler moment, ſcruple to own ſhe had erred.</p>
               <p>"I neither wiſh, nor am intitled to ſuch a conceſſion, Sir," ſhe calmly replied. "Perhaps I am more unjuſt in reſenting than ſhe is in giving offence: ſo let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered no more."</p>
               <p>She laid her head on the pillow, ſaying, that ſorrow weighed down her eyelids, and ſleep would, in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, be an ineſtimable bleſſing. Conſidering this as an intimation that ſhe wiſhed to be alone, I beckoned the ſervants to withdraw, and retired wiſhing that every gentle influence might deſcend to give her comfort, and effectually ſoften the anguiſh of her heart.</p>
               <p>The miſtreſs of the houſe met me as I deſcended the ſtairs. Anger ſtill ſparkled in her eye, and ſhe began an harangue about the lady's unforgiving temper, and her own wrongs and eminent virtues:—i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eighing moſt bitterly againſt the captain, and honouring him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve very juſtly, with every opprobrious epithet that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention could ſuggeſt; but I found means to allay the bitterneſs of her reſentment, and make her accompany me amicably to the parlour, where ſhe related all that ſhe knew reſpecting the unfortunate Ela. That the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſappeared the day after I quitted them on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion before mentioned, and all their efforts had proved inſufficient to diſcover his retreat; that the lady in the anguiſh of her heart, occaſioned by this deſertion, had avowed herſelf the victim of enthuſiaſtic love—and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the deſtructive flame ſtill lived in her heart, by execrating her own folly rather than his baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe unguarded expreſſions it was that gave riſe to the treatment ſhe had experienced, and ſtruck ſo forcibly on her heart.—But we are well convinced, by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a generous indulgence to the imperfections of mortality muſt not be expected from groveling minds.—
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021723_0011_0FB74097A03BC908"/>
True ſympathy is the ſpontaneous growth of elevated ſouls—and not to be met with in common walks of life.</p>
               <p>The conduct of the landlady was conſiſtent with her character, and ſtrictly natural.—It therefore, my dear ſiſter, contains this uſeful leſſon, that it is in general certainly a point of wiſdom to conceal our ſorrows; as by expoſing them, we only expoſe ourſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and deriſion of the bulk of mankind.—Sometimes, indeed, we meet with a diſtinguiſhing and generous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;—but let us not too eaſily believe the ſoft perſuaſive voice, the gently-ſoothing accent, or even the tear-fraught eye.—All theſe, experience teaches us, are eaſily, and, I fear, very frequently aſſumed to gild the ſerpent's heart; and, by throwing us off our guard, precipitate us the more readily into the ſnares of the deſigning. Let diſcretion then always mark the bounds of confidence. —Let us remember one of the beſt approved maxims of the wiſeſt of men, and, by keeping a bridle on our tongue, guard ourſelves againſt the dangers of credulity.</p>
               <p>You will laugh in the gaiety of your heart, and call this preaching.—Be it ſo—The ſermon flowed unſtudied from my pen, and why ſhould I ſuppreſs a thought that may eventually contribute in the ſmalleſt degree to the welfare and happineſs of my Caroline?</p>
               <p>But your amiable impatience to know more of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Ela, I am well aſſured, far outſtrips the pen of the readieſt writer. Hence then digreſſion. Your curioſity is the offspring of the virtues, and merits every gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and indulgence.</p>
               <p>The immediate conſequence of Ela's exquiſite ſufferings was a dangerous fever.—Her life was deſpaired of, and I was the conſtant attendant of her couch. Death ſeemed the bleſſing to which all her wiſhes aſpired;—but her prayers were rejected. The cup of her ſorrows was not full. She was reſerved, no doubt, for ſome wiſe purpoſe; and youth triumphed over the conſuming fires of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>During its progreſs I watched each movement of her ſoul, and was confirmed in my firſt belief, that it was governed by the love of virtue: and in the practice of that alone could it hope for happineſs.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:021723_0012_0FB740A8850DC708"/>The ejaculatory effuſion of wounded peace dwelt for ever on her lips—and ſhe prayed inceſſantly to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from a world where poignant miſery muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly await her ſteps, and poiſon every offered delight—But ſtill the lamp of life was unextinguiſhed; a few weeks revolved in doubtful ſadneſs, when health again began to relume her eye, and irradiate her cheek.—But corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding anguiſh ſtill poſſeſſed her mind, and the gentle voice of conſolation ſpoke in vain.</p>
               <p>Unmerited tenderneſs likewiſe ſtill dwelt in the inmoſt receſs of her devoted heart, and conſecrated a temple for the worſhip of an idol whoſe deſtructive image, ſhe ought, from every conſideration, to expel.</p>
               <p>Thus deluded, ſhe languiſhed for the ſoothing but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous indulgence of retirement; and avoided even my ſociety with the moſt viſible ſolicitude.

               <p>WHY will the moſt exalted of mankind ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to participate in the ſorrows of a wretched girl?</p>
               <p>You have been a miniſtering angel appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem me from the power of death, and whiſper peace to the boſom of deſpair: and let that ſuffice; no longer perſecute your generous heart by attempting what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.

me be convinced of his perfidy, and then I will deſpair indeed; but even then memory will obtrude his image on my diſtracted heart—till oblivion draws its thickeſt veil between us. In the firſt moments of his myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abſence, madneſs ſeized my ſoul, and my betraying tongue pronounced him aſſuredly falſe. But cooler rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now tells me I have wronged him.

               <p>No longer, then, worthy Sir, perſiſt in applying the balm of conſolation to her whoſe caſe admits of but one cure.—In my agitated boſom hope ſtill exiſts—and, ſhould that fail me, the light of Heaven within, aided by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and ſolitude, will be my beſt reſtoratives; and you only ſhall be made acquainted with the event, be it what it may.</p>

               <p>AFTER deeply revolving on the contents of Ela's affecting letter, I concluded her requeſt, of being left

to the quiet enjoyment of unmoleſted ſolitude, too juſt and reaſonable to be rejected;—and diſpatching an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, where, in addition to many adieus, was ſome well-meant council; I ventured to incloſe an inconſiderable proof of my friendſhip, that might, in caſe of unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen exigencies, enable her to bid defiance to abſolute penury. I then diſcharged every obligation to her cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous hoſteſs, and my wiſhes ſprang forward to the dear haunt of our nativity, and my ſtill dearer Caroline; from whoſe loved ſociety I have been ſo long eſtranged.

                           <p>"It is confidently aſſerted here, that the celebrated widow Barrymore is on the point of ſacrificing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable captives on the altar of Hymen; and that the cauſe of this wonderful converſion from the deluding path of gallantry, is a young and elegant Hibernian; who, in addition to the charms of a fine perſon, an inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating tongue, and military graces, is deſcended from a race, whoſe heroic deeds are immortaliſed in the annals of his country both in peace and war; and who will, we doubt not, find ample compenſation for the trammels of matrimony in the trebled jointure of the elegant widow."</p>

               <p>It inſtantly occurred to me, on peruſing this curious piece of intelligence, that this fortunate Hibernian was the lover of Ela. Fully impreſſed with this belief, I reſolved to viſit Southampton, and, putting wings to my ſpeed, reached it in a few days.—In the firſt houſe of public reſort that I entered, I beheld my old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance fluttering among the gay ones of the age; with all the aſſurance of triumphant villainy.</p>
               <p>My ſpirit roſe indignant at the ſight—his eyes glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards me, a guilty fluſh marked his extreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion—and he looked around him, as if from a vain wiſh to ſhrink from an obſerver he could not but dread. The loud laugh was converted into an unmeaning grin, and the ſtudied repartee died away on his quivering lips.— He rivetted his eyes on the floor—when approaching him
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021723_0015_0FB740B122945738"/>
with my uſual eaſe and freedom.—"I little expected, captain," ſaid I, with all the <hi>ſang-froid</hi> I could aſſume, "the honor of finding you here."</p>
               <p>He ſtood aghaſt, and replacing the ſparkling glaſs that he was about to convey to his lips, on the table, roſe from his ſeat, and declared, with ſome perturbation, that he really had not the honor of knowing me.</p>
               <p>"Then, Sir," ſaid I, approaching nearer, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly in his face, "either you have a very treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous memory, or I have very treacherous eyes."</p>
               <p>"Faith, very likely, Sir!" he exclaimed, reſuming his native effrontery,—"my memory is ſometimes treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for 'pon my ſoul" (taking out an opera glaſs, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impudently at my face) "I cannot recollect, Sir, I ever had the pleaſure of contemplating your features before; and yet," added he, with an air of <hi>non-chalance,</hi> "I poſſibly may; for immaterial occurrences, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient acquaintance, make but a very ſlight impreſſion on my mind." As he uttered theſe words he threw himſelf careleſsly into a chair and yawned.</p>
               <p>My patience was nearly exhauſted by this inſolence; but determined not to hazard my victory by loſing my temper, I reſolved to be-calm, and aſſuming a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, very foreign to my heart, I lamented the defect in his memory, and enquired if he had likewiſe forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that his name was Temple, and that I lodged in the ſame houſe with his lady and himſelf at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>"Totally, my good Sir!" he replied, again, laughing immoderately.—"Pray you, my well remembered— friends," addreſſing his companions, with a triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſneer at me—"can any of you recollect that my name is Temple, or that I ever had a lady at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth?" They all vociferated a negative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor had the aſſurance to add, that, in his opinion, I had better try the efficacy of a glaſs of their burgundy to ſettle the derangement in my brain; and filling a bumper, he toaſted the widow Barrymore, and daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called on me to honour it.</p>
               <p>Rouſed by this inſolent defiance, I pauſed for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then looking diſdainfully at him, "Think not," ſaid I, "that all your ſubterſuges will ſhield you from

juſtice. Whatever names you may have aſſumed to ſpread devaſtations around you, you know me well; and when I tell you, that ſince. your ſcandalous flight I have again been an inhabitant of the houſe where firſt I ſaw you and your amiable injured wife, you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be convinced that I know you, to your confuſion and eternal ſhame."</p>
               <p>As I concluded theſe words, the ruffian ſeized a bottle that ſtood before him, and fiercely menaced it at me; but one of his companions reſtraining his arm, firmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would not ſuffer any violence to be uſed, as it appeared to him it was altogether a miſtake. "For my friend's name," ſaid he, addreſſing me, "is not Temple, but Dormer."</p>
               <p>"It is not unlikely, Sir" I replied. "I may know the gentleman by a fictitious name; but be aſſured I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the identity of his perſon:—and let me add, his very rage on the occaſion proves that he deems it highly inconvenient, and particularly mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apropos, to know me at this juncture."</p>
               <p>"Villain, ſlave, madman!" echoed the enraged monſter, ſtruggling to elude the hold of his friend.— "My ſword ſhall prove thy ſcandalous aſſertions fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"No," ſaid I, "keep your ſword for ſome future oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

               <p>With theſe words I haſtily quitted the houſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme agitation, and returned to the place where I left my ſervant, quite undetermined reſpecting my future conduct in this affair.

momentary, but I well knew it to be her; and throwing up the ſaſh, I beheld her alight only a few doors from where I was. Gueſſing that her motive for viſiting South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton was ſimilar to mine, I haſtened to receive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from her own lips, and gave her every aſſiſtance in my power.</p>
               <p>Surpriſe and joy animated her dejected form—as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, her, "My beſt, my only friend!" ſhe exclaimed in an impaſſioned tone, "hath the Supreme Being again graciouſly directed you to her, whoſe afflictions are I hope nearly complete?"

               <head>MORTIMER TO CAROLINE. [In continuation.]</head>
               <p>MY heart applauded the conduct of this honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whoſe reſpectful attention to Ela I had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021723_0018_0FB740BDF9D05AA0"/>
and it ſerved to confirm this opinion, that true greatneſs of ſoul is not conſined to any ſituation; but as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſides in the boſom of the mendicant as that of the monarch. I then returned the letter to Ela, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted my advice in what manner to proceed. I pauſed ſome moments; then after a little preparatory converſation, I related my interview with the perfidious man, on whom her ſoul ſtill doated. She reclined her head on her hand, and ſat the ſilent picture of unutterable wo. Not one tear fell, but a fearful wildneſs glared in her eyes, which were ſteadfaſtly rivetted to one point. I trembled for the conſequences of this deſperate ſorrow, and ſpared no pains to melt her into ſoftneſs: my endeavours were happily crowned with ſucceſs, and a friendly ſhower of tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome meaſure alleviated the exquiſite anguiſh of her mind. But her ſilence ſtill continued, and when I preſſed to know in what manner ſhe deſigned to act, ſhe only waved her hand and left me. I conſidered her ſorrow as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and well aſſured that any intruſion would, at ſuch a juncture, be unwelcome, was quitting the houſe, when a ſervant followed me to the door, put into my hand theſe lines, rendered, by the tears and agitation of the writer, ſcarcely intelligible.</p>
               <p>"The unhappy Ela is incapable either of thinking or acting, until that merciful Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who views her deep affliction, ſhall graciouſly vouchſafe to comfort her; then will ſhe again ſee, thank, and ſupplicate the aid of her generous friend; but at this diſtreſsful moment her poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſtreſs admits of no alleviation, and the eye, even of ſympathetic obſervation, would only add to her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings."</p>
               <p>Fully convinced of the truth of her aſſertion, I haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to my lodgings and penned a long letter, which might, I hoped contribute to infuſe reſignation and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into her mind; nor did it fail of producing, in ſome degree, the deſired effect. Some tedious hours elapſed in anxious expectation, when I received a card from the gentle mourner requeſting to ſee me; and inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the meſſenger, found her calm and collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my moſt ſanguine hope. A tear indeed ſhone in her eye, but it ſeemed rather the tear of meek ſubmiſſion, than

excruciating remorſe or ſevere regret; and with all that prevailing eloquence, with which nature has moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endowed her, ſhe, ardently beſought me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to the moſt ungrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ful, yet ſtill tenderly beloved of mankind, that ſhe might at leaſt hear her ſentence from his own lips, ere ſhe reſigned her ſoul to deſpair In vain I endeavoured to diſſuade her from ſo raſh an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and intreated her to have recourſe to her pen; but all my rhetoric was ſoft. "What!" ſhe replied, "warn him again to avoid my dreadful preſence! No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seeing therefore that all argument was inſufficient to change her ſettled purpoſe, we had recourſe to the addreſs in the poſtſcript of the worthy Barlow's letter, and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her on this arduous expedition.</p>
               <p>Barlow received us it the door of their habitation, and ſeeing his late loved miſtreſs all pale and trembling, only prevented by my ſuſtaining arm from ſinking to the earth; his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"William," ſaid the ſweet ſufferer, extending her arm toward him. "good, faithful William!"—</p>
               <p>Theſe affecting words, and the ſtill more affecting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they were uttered, gave a turn to the emotions of this truly excellent man, and ſpringing forward, he faltered out, "Dear, injured, beſt of ladies;"—but, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to add more, turned aſide to conceal his agitation, and wiped off a pitying tear with the ſleeve of his coat.</p>
               <p>Ela held his hand in her own, and looked up to Heaven —Such a ſcene muſt ſurely have penetrated the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling heart, and could not fail to immortalize the pencil of the moſt renowned artiſt, if he copied from nature and truth. I felt a ſigh burſt from my heart, and was about to remonſtrate againſt the impropriety of our ſituation, thus expoſed to the obſervation of the paſſing of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

faſhion and taſte, can beſtow, ſeated in a ſplendid chariot, the golden ſtripes of which mingled with all the vivid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the rainbow, and glittered in the ſun-beams. Ela's eyes followed mine, and Barlow exclaimed, "It is my maſter!" The wretch regarded us with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look, and pulling the ſtring, ordered the driver to go on. But Ela, eluding our hold, claſped the chariot wheel in her arms, ſaying, "O merciful Heaven! I will be heard, or in this poſture periſh!"</p>
               <p>"Drive on, drive on!" exclaimed the monſter; but the ſervant, in whoſe breaſt a principle of humanity dwelt, ſeeing the ſituation of Ela, refuſed to comply—"The lady, Sir!" ſaid he. "The devil," replied his brutal commander, leaping from the chariot. Ela caught hold of his arm as he deſcended.—"My Henry," ſhe cried, falling on the ground, "will you not know your wife, your own Ela?—"Know thee, woman!" exclaimed he, throwing her from him, "away! thou art ſome wretched maniac, whom that villain!" glancing his eyes at me, "has hired to inſult me!" She uttered a piercing ſhriek, and the wretch darted from us. I ſlew to her aſſiſtance. She looked p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One ſit was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded by another, and in the intervals of reaſon, the principles of life faded in her eyes, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conqueror ſeemed making his awful approach. In this ſtate ſhe continued ſome hours without the ſmalleſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a favourable change, and I requeſted Barlow to procure a coach to convey her back to her la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in, the inſtant he beheld Barlow—"thou haſt entered into a league with thoſe wretches that came to abuſe and ruin me!" Barlow, made no reply, but turning from him with an indignant and pity-marked countenance, haſtened to the room that contained us. Dormer followed, uttering moſt tremendous threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings; but on beholding me, with the lifeleſs form of Ela in my arms, he ſtood ſome moments apparently rooted to the ſpot—and the uplifted came dropped from his hand.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021723_0021_0FB740CC319C7468"/>
—A tranſient emanation of remorſe croſſed his features; but his native depravity quickly triumphed over every milder ſenſation; and, approaching me with deſperation and inconceivable fury,—"Now!" he wildly exclaimed, "baſe inſolent lyar, give me inſtant ſatisfaction."</p>
               <p>Satisfaction!—ſaid I, pointing to the corpſe-like Ela— "Look here." "Yes," replied he, in a voice nearly choaked, "I do, I do.—She is gone, and I will ſend thy buſy meddling ſoul to attend her."—He pauſed—then ſuddenly drawing his ſword—"Defend, Defend yourſelf," he cried, brandiſhing the weapon with fierceneſs, "I thirſt for your life—No ſubterfuge ſhall now avail you. "With theſe words, regardleſs of my ſituation, and without giving me a moment's time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o do as he deſired—he made a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thruſt at me; and Barlow, throwing himſelf between us, received it in his arm. The ſight of his generous blood, ſpilt in my defence, called forth every fiery particle with which nature has inſpired me, and ſeeing the villain about to repeat his attack, I inſtantly quitted the happily-inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ela; and enraged beyond all bounds of moderation, met him with fury equal to his own. But yet my preſence of mind proved ſuperior. His wild deſperation put him entirely in my power; and, eluding his paſs, I eaſily wrenched the ſword from his ſlackened arm, ſaying.— "Thy life is mine; but take it and make expiation for thy guilt."—The humbled tyrant hid his face and was ſilent. —I offered up an ejaculation to that power who had thus graciouſly preſerved me from murder; and hoping that the provocation would procure me a pardon for engaging in a practice I juſtly abhorred, careleſsly threw his ſword on the carpet, and turned to my fair charge and her faithful guardian. Barlow; whoſe garments were all enſanguined from the wound in his arm. But the baſe Dormer, ſeeing me thus unguarded, ſnatched up his ſword and again dared me to the combat, adding, that his haughty unſubmitting ſpirit ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accept the life that I could give; and death ſhould end the conteſt. In vain I expoſtulated, and warned him to avoid my awakened vengeance. He was deaf to all I ſaid;—and I moſt reluctantly acquieſced with his impetuous mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—But victory again awaited me; I diſarmed him with equal facility as before; but his ſword wounded
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021723_0022_0FB740CDB8671A28"/>
my wriſt in the ſcuffle, and the blood guſhed out like a fountain.—The pain of the wound, and the ſight of the ſtream that flowed from it, added to the ungrateful return my former lenity had met, determined me to enſure the preſent conqueſt by force, and inflict a corporal puniſhment on the aggreſſor; and taking up the cane that had been lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the unoffending Barlow, I expended my ſtrength on the ſides of the degraded, but ſtill menacing coward; for ſuch in reality he was, and forcing him into an adjacent room, I bolted the door, effectually to prevent his further intruſion.</p>
               <p>During this encounter, a ray of animation reviſited the death-like Ela; but ſhe was ſtill totally inſenſible to all that paſſed. Reſuming my ſtation by her ſide, Barlow haſtened to procure a coach at my requeſt; and calling at a ſurgeon's in our way to Ela's lodgings, our wounds were examined and dreſſed; when, with the conſoling aſſurance of their being unattended by danger, we proceeded with our greatly recovered charge. Then diſpatching Barlow to releaſe his worthleſs maſter, I earneſtly recommended Ela to the care of the miſtreſs of the houſe, who ſeemed a much more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manized being than her with whom we had reſided at Plymouth; and after prevailing on us to take ſome cordial refreſhment. Ela, who had never uttered a ſyllable ſince our return, ſuffered me to lead her to a ſopha; and, in a few moments, an apparently balmy ſlumber ſeemed to ſuſpend every embittering remembrance. But anxiety ſtill pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my heart, and I waited impatiently for the return of our honeſt confederate. A conſiderable time elapſed without his appearance; and Ela awoke from the deep ſtupor which I had miſtaken for ſleep. She fixed her eyes mournfully on mine, but her ſenſes were ſtill abſorbed in forgetfulneſs; at leaſt the ſufferings ſhe had ſo recently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced only floated on the ſurface of her mind, like the ſhadowy remembrance of an unpleaſing dream; and all my endeavours proved inſufficient to break her ſilence. I ſpoke to her repeatedly on the ſubject that I well knew could not fall deeply to affect her heart, but without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other reply than a heavy ſigh, or a gloomy ſmile. At length the long abſence of Barlow greatly alarmed me, and fully aſſured that it muſt originate from ſome diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021723_0023_0FB740DB6B23BB50"/>
circumſtance, I reſolved to go in queſt of him, and left Ela in charge with the woman of the houſe; with whoſe obliging attention I was quite ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>An ill-looking fellow opened Dormer's door; when, on my enquiring if Barlow was there, he replied in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. Pretending to call him, he returned with three others, of ſimilar exterior with himſelf, and ſeizing me declared they would ſoon conduct me to Barlow, whoſe fellow aſſaſſin they knew me to be, and we ſhould receive the reward of our crimes. I was accordingly hurried into the preſence of an old ignorant unprincipled wretch, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the appellation of a juſtice; where, after ſome ſenſeleſs interrogations, all that I could ſay in my defence was treated with contempt, and turned into ridicule; and after the uſual forms I was committed to the priſon that held my fellow ſufferer, the truly eſtimable Barlow. Here we mingled our painful emotions together, not for our own misfortunes, but thoſe of Ela; thus deprived of every earthly aid, and expoſed to every evil from the malice and revenge of the wretch who had thus reduced her.</p>
               <p>Happy was it for you, my dear and amiable Caroline, that no officious tongue dared to whiſper the unmerited ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and ſufferings which at that period awaited your brother. Condemned to the ſociety of the moſt hardened ruffians, and loaded with heavy irons, like the moſt attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious violator of my country's laws; yet, conſcious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity ſupported my ſpirit, and the dignity and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my mind was unimpaired. My anxiety, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, was extreme for the uncertain fate of my lovely but unfortunate friend, for whom I was more than ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted by the imperfect ſketches of her numerous virtues, but too adventurous love, which our faithful Barlow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me during the early hours of our impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the midſt of his unconnected, yet moſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrative, the form of her, whoſe ſorrows we were contemplating, ſtood before us, led by the ſame group of wretches that had been our conductors. Loſt to every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation but the pleaſure of again beholding her in exiſtence, I ſprang toward her, but the clanking of my ſetters ſtruck her with inexpreſſible horror, and claſping her hands fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully together, ſhe attempted to fly from me. Her ungentle
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021723_0024_0FB740E031B72858"/>
attendants, however, effectually prevented her; when one of them daring to uſe very inſolent language, and treating her very roughly, I ſeized an earthen mug that ſtood on one of the windows, and aimed it at his head; but he, luckily for me, avoided the blow; and I was from that moment deemed a moſt deſperate villain by all my fellow priſoners: and all my looks and actions created ſuſpicions of ſome dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical intent.</p>
               <p>But ſhocked, as Ela was at our fate, ſhe ſubmitted with the moſt perfect reſignation to her own.—Not one murmur eſcaped her lips—but a ſilent and corroding melancholy was rooted in her heart! She evidently avoided even our converſe; and it was not without infinite labour that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on her to relate the particulars of what had befallen her after our ſeparation.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that awakened her from the lethargic ſtate in which I had left her when I went in queſt of Barlow, was enquiry from the landlady, whether ſhe did not expect my return that evening? This queſtion ſeemed to bring back the power of reflection, and filled her with alarming conjectures reſpecting our myſterious abſence. After ſome hours of anxious expectation ſhe diſpatched in ſearch of us a meſſenger, who returned with the party that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended me, and were placed as centinels at her betrayer's door, to ſeize any that ſhould enquire for Barlow or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They took her into cuſtody as an accomplice with as in aſſaulting and robbing this monſter of depravity.</p>
               <p>"And now," added the uncomplaining victim of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded love, looking penſively at us—"the meaſure of my woes is nearly full; and but for the cruel return your goodneſs has experienced, pain could never more touch my heart. Be you reſtored to liberty and happineſs, and a priſon or a palace is equal to the undone Ela." I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no argument that could poſſibly afford her comfort, nor was the honeſt Barlow leſs aſſiduous. We treated our misfortune as a fooliſh adventure, and dubbing ourſelves knights-errant of the firſt order, told her that our preſent ſufferings would only prove a ſubject for our future boaſt. But all our efforts were inſufficient, even for a moment to diſſipate the ſettled gloom that enveloped her mind. A grateful, yet melancholy ſmile would often croſs her features
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021723_0025_0FB740E127530C10"/>
as ſhe liſtened to our flattering predictions of ſeeing happy days; but, like the tranſient refulgence of a winter's ſun, it was quickly ſucceeded by clouds and darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed ſeveral tedious days, when we were called to our trial, and the audacious deſtroyer of innocence had even the daring wickedneſs to appear againſt us. Ela faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inſtant ſhe beheld him, and continued inſenſible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of our examination; but without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any viſible effect on her cruel deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>Of the pretended robbery, no proof appeared, and we were therefore acquitted; but the driver of the chariot being ſuborned to ſwear to the identity of our perſons. and Ela's endeavours to detain Dormer againſt his inclination, being corroborated by his own oath, and the bruiſes I had ſo liberally beſtowed on him, we were convicted of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and ſentenced to pay two hundred pounds damages, and to ſuffer with Barlow, who was deemed our aſſiſtant and accomplice, three months impriſonment.</p>
               <p>All remonſtrance was uſeleſs here, and a patient endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our heavy wrongs ſeemed the only alternative.</p>
               <p>This melancholy concluſion to our ſad adventures, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened an event which I before ſaw was inevitable. The deadly ſtroke was given to the gentle heart of Ela; and it was not in the power of mortal aid to ſuſpend the fatal conſequence. I reſolved to ſooth, if poſſible, her fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, and my attention to her ſufferings entirely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed my own. Sometimes, indeed, I felt an ardent wiſh that my ſituation might eſcape the tongue of rumour, and never wound the heart of my amiable Caroline. This was the conſtant prayer of my ſoul when reflection darted on my mind, and the event has proved that it was accepted.</p>
               <p>Unknown to Ela. I penned a faithful narrative of her caſe, to that lady whom the perfidious Dorm r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>marked for his future prey; but, charmed by his falſe deluding arts, ſhe returned my letter unopened, with a meſſage that plainly evinced her heart obſtinately ſhut againſt conviction.</p>
               <p>My whole attention, and that of the excellent Barlow, was now devoted in endeavouring to alleviate the ſilent but exquiſite ſufferings of our fair fellow priſoner. Vain hope, that can ever expect to ſurmount a grief like hers.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021723_0026_0FB740E4EC1FBEF0"/>
I beheld her decline daily like ſome ſweet and modeſt flower, bending beneath the preſſure of an inclement ſeaſon. —In vain I intruded myſelf, from the beſt of motives, perpetually on her ſolitude; no efforts could baniſh the deep rooted ſadneſs that poſſeſſed her mind. During our impriſonment ſhe penned the incloſed letters—and, when we were again reſtored to freedom, I ſtill panted for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the baſe Dormer; but the gentle injured angel beſought me ſo eloquently to deſiſt, that it muſt have been a heart as callous as his that could refuſe its acquieſcence. She begged me to conduct her back to Plymouth, where ſhe left the greateſt part of her cloaths, and papers that ſhe highly valued.</p>
               <p>And here, my beloved Caroline, the motions of my heart, on recollecting the ſcene that awaited as, forcibly ſuſpends the progreſs of my tale. I muſt therefore defer the ſequel to ſome more tranquil moments, fully aſſured that while you peruſe the following teſtimonies of unſuſpecting ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and deteſted treachery, like me you will execrate the wretch capable of deſtroying ſo much native excellence, and drop a ſympathetic tear to the ſorrows of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Ela.</p>
               <p>Adieu, my much-loved ſiſter, expect ſoon to receive the concluſion of my narrative, and let the remembrance of every paſt diſtreſs give place to this conſoling aſſurance, that the bleſſings of liberty again await,</p>

               <p>In the firſt moments of thankfulneſs for the generous part you took in my ſorrows, I ſaid you ſhould know who ſhe was for whom you were thus intereſted; but while falſe hope, and the moſt torturing anxiety kept my mind in a conſtant ſtate of dreary ſuſpence, I was unequal to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that promiſe;—now each corroding paſſion ſeems at reſt, and tranquillity wooes me to what was before inſupportable.</p>

I was early diſtinguiſhed by a ſoul of fire, and often emphatically declared to be a daughter of the Sun.— Fatal diſtinction! It is this native fervour of ſoul that led to all my ſorrows; incapable of guile myſelf, I never ſuſpected it in others;— nor once thought it poſſible for cruelty to lie concealed under the moſt ſolemn profeſſions of love, honor, and fidelity; but the dreadful aſſurance
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021723_0028_0FB740F19E762FF0"/>
now ſtands unveiled before me, and I fall in the early bloom of life, the martyr of my own deluded heart.</p>
               <p>My father, at the remembrance of whoſe indulgent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuſpended anguiſh ruſhes like a torrent on my mind, was a man of eminence in that quarter of the globe. My mother I never knew; the moment that gave me being, conſigned her to the grave; and I believe contributed to endear me to the heart of my remaining parent, by whom ſhe was ſo tenderly beloved, that the mention of her name, after a very conſiderable lapſe of time, never failed to call forth emotions too powerful to be ſuppreſſed. The uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable regret her loſs occaſioned, undermined by ſlow degrees his health, and certainly haſtened his death.</p>
               <p>Oh, beſt of men! How does that awful ſcene croud, with every affecting circumſtance, on my awakened feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? How does it recal ſenſations I could wiſh to cancel from the book of memory! His dying words never broke through my perjured ſoul.—I behold the moſt wronged and amiable of mankind, the all accompliſhed and excellent Granville Clifford, whiſpering ſweeteſt conſolation to my ſorrow, while in vain he endeavours to ſuppreſs his own.</p>
               <p>The parents of Granville Clifford were Engliſh adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, whoſe numerous virtues and amiable manners enſured them the friendſhip and eſteem of my father.—But they both met an early grave ſoon after their arrival in India; and with their lateſt breath committed their helpleſs orphans, and their humble fortune, to the protection of their only friend; who ſoothed their anxious hearts with the moſt ſolemn and generous aſſurances, of which his actions have proved the ſincerity.</p>
               <p>Granville Clifford was at that period, a beautiful boy of five years old; myſelf only ſix months. My father ſoon felt a particular attachment to him, and he ſhared with me his tendereſt affection. Thus we grew up together, and a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of filial love took deep root in my infant mind, and ſtrengthened with increaſing years. The extreme lovelineſs of his perſon, the remarkable endowments of his mind, and the winning graces of his manners, daily increaſed the affection to which his defenceleſs infancy gave birth in my father's generous boſom, and he approved himſelf worthy of the charge with which he was entruſted.—He
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021723_0029_0FB740FD423BABA8"/>
always gave him the endearing appellation of ſon, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to hallow both on him and me every advantage that could be deſired from the moſt finiſhed education. But his affairs rendering it impoſſible for him to quit India, his extreme tenderneſs, and the delight he experienced in our innocent endearments would not ſuffer him to part with us; he therefore procured the beſt maſters for us from England, France, and Italy, and inſpecting our ſtudies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſpared neither expence nor trouble to accompliſh us in every uſeful and polite ſcience: and render us a bleſſing to himſelf and ſociety. How far his endeavours have been crowned with ſucceſs in me, is now, alas! too evident to need any further demonſtration.</p>
               <p>The culture of our expanding minds was the ſole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of my father's leiſure hours He ſtrove to impreſs us with the principles of morality; and his own example powerfully enforced the truths he taught.</p>
               <p>The amiable Clifford imbibed inſtruction as faſt as it could be offered him. He made a rapid progreſs in every valuable attainment: and the improving beauties of his mind and perſon made him univerſally careſſed.—I was the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The anniverſary of my birth was always devoted to mirth and feſtivity. My friends and companions crouded to offer their congratulations: the day was ſpent in every refined and innocent delight, and uſually concluded with a ball and ſupper in the higheſt ſtyle of elegant ſimplicity. The heart of my indulgent father ſeemed always dilated with unuſual gladneſs on that occaſion; and the expreſſive features of Granville Clifford beamed unutterable things.</p>

humbled my vanity; but Henry Dormer uttered a language very different, he told me that I was all perfect,—and I believed him.—The faſcination gained daily ſtrength.— From that evening the perſidious Henry ſpared no pains to enſure his conqueſt;—but while his tender aſſiduities were pointed at me, he was equally attentive to ſecure the favour of my father and Granville, who, ſtrangers to guile, never once ſuſpected the emotions he had excited in my boſom, but encouraged my evident wiſh of appearing agreeable in his eyes;—and while my worthy parent aſſured him of his perfect friendſhip, and zealous ſervices, the gentle Clifford ſhewed him the moſt marked attention and omitted nothing that ſeemed likely to promote his welfare and happineſs. — But I was no longer the ſame—No more did I liſten with enraptured ear to the inſtructions of the beſt of parents— nor did my charmed ſoul attend to the language of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville Clifford's heart.

you have ſaved the life of Ela."—He made no reply, but printing a gentle kiſs on my forehead he joined his cheek, wet with tears, to mine, and preſſed me ſtill cloſer to his heart.

Thus I neglected the warning hand of mercy, and giving myſelf wholly up to the guidance of my infatuated heart, I regarded the conduct of my preſerver as an act of common humanity—and continued to cheriſh the viper in my boſom, who after having deprived me of all that renders life valuable, now throws aſide every diſguiſe, and robs me of that likewiſe.</p>

A very perceptible gloom hovered around the ſo lately gay and gallant Dormer. My father ſeemed labouring with ſome concealed emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and more than common happineſs was viſible in Granville Clifford. I was perplexed by each of them,— but the behaviour of Dormer appeared the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, and dwelt ſtrongly on my mind. He ſeemed to avoid my converſe, and no longer ſought to charm me with the muſic of his tongue. Then it was that anguiſh firſt ſeized my heart. Two days paſſed in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable wretchedneſs. In vain I endeavoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſilent dejection of Dormer; the extreme vivacity of Clifford; or the myſterious air of my father: anxiety preyed deeply on my heart, and ſleep was a ſtranger to my couch.—In this ſtate I was, when the ſecond night after the eſcape from the jaws of the tyger, the ſplendour of the heavenly luminaries, the ſweet ſerenity of the air, and the melancholy murmur of a diſtant wood-dove, added to the melody of a nightingale, cloſe to my chamber window, tempted me to indulge my contemplations in a ſmall piazza, with which it was united. The moon ſhone with unclouded radiance on a fine ſheet of water that fronted the houſe; I walked ſome time, buried in reflexion, when the ſound of a gentle noiſe behind me made me turn round, and I beheld a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful little ſpaniel that belonged to Dormer running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me I eagerly caught the pretty animal in my arms, and loaded it with careſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it was unneceſſary. Dormer aſcended a flight of ſteps that led from an avenue at the end of the piazza, and approached me with a penſive air. The impropriety of my dreſs occurred, and I was retiring; but ſpringing ſuddenly forward he effectually prevented me. "Lovely Ela," he exclaimed, ſeizing my hands—"will you indeed leave me to deſpair?" I was incapable of making any re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply.

"Will you," added he—"angelic maid, ſcorn the moſt ardent paſſion that ever informed the heart of man? Can ſuch unequalled goodneſs condemn her adoring Henry to madneſs and death?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! never, never!" I exclaimed—"Why do you talk thus?" "Becauſe," he replied, "looking firmly in my face, "your father has given you to Granville Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford." "My father!" exclaimed I, ſinking on a bench beſide us. "Yes," he rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"It never can, indeed, it never ſhall,"—ſaid I, looking tenderly at him. "Oh! but I fear, I fear it is inevitable,"—he replied—"unleſs my adored Ela;—but what was I about to ſay?—Your father's heart is ſet on the accompliſhment of this long-deſtined union:—they fondly think you love this Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and it is certain he doats on you. But, what do I ſay? (added he, after a pauſe) it is certain he ſhall never have you, for have you not generouſly declared your heart is mine?—Oh! that accurſed tyger!—It was that which confirmed the deſtiny of your father. Clifford is exalted to a hero; but for me, what remains?"—"Love and happineſs," I replied; "then envy not this really ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able young man the acquiſition of a little empty ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour"—"No," he exclaimed, "I cannot envy him any thing, but your affections."—"To-morrow," added he, "I go to enter on an employment, which the intereſt of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was about to comply with his requeſt, when the ſoft ſound of an approaching footſtep ſtruck

our ears. We ſtarted from each other, Dormer diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in an inſtant; returning day broke through the diſtant clouds, and my father ſtood before me. I could gladly have ſunk into the earth to avoid his preſence: till that moment I never felt the ſtings of ſelf-accuſation. He approached me with his uſual benignity, and ſeating himſelf beſide me—"What," ſaid he, kiſſing my check, has thus early diſturbed the ſlumbers of my ſweet girl!" I threw my arms around him. I hid my face in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, but could not ſpeak. "Ela," ſaid he, in a more ſolemn tone, "you are unhappy. I have ſeen you ſo for many days; and the painful diſcovery has wounded the breaſt of your father."—"Oh! wretched girl" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, raiſing my ſtreaming eyes, "to make my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parent unhappy likewiſe." "Explain then, my child,"—ſaid he, ſtill holding me in his arms, "what is it that preys upon your heart?—and let your fond parent baniſh it." "Yet," added he, after a long "pauſe, why ſhould I aſk a confeſſion that may give you pain, when I already know all that you can tell me?—My Ela is incapable of diſguiſe."—"Yes, dear ſir," ſaid I, claſping his hands between my own, "indeed I am not, I will not, cannot attempt to conceal my heart from you."

You are as much a ſtranger to the bye-paths and indirect, crooked ways of the world as if your days had paſſed in the vale of Abyſſiſinia; but I am fully aſſured you will not ſhut your ears, and obſtinately contemn the voice of inſtruction, which now warns you to avoid all thoſe who would, under any form whatever, ſeek to allure you from the paths of duty and ſtrict rectitude; for thoſe that dare to do ſo, whatever name they may aſſume, can only have their own gratification, not your happineſs in view. I ſee, with a mixture of pain and pleaſure, the native fervor, the exquiſite ſenſibility of your mind;— yes, I have long ſeen it; and while I cannot but approve, I likewiſe tremble.

bleſſings by which I was ſurrounded, I execrated my very being, and impiouſly beſought Heaven to recal the gift that was now become inſupportable. Ah! Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, wretched Ela! how eaſily didſt thou ſuffer thyſelf to be carried away by the tide of paſſion! Forgetful of what I owed the beſt of fathers, and moſt generous of friends—every valuable affection of my ſoul was loſt in this intoxicating ſtream, and no conſideration could prevail on me to forego its fatal draught. I revolved, deeply revolved what my father had ſaid. It penetrated the inmoſt receſſes of my heart; but when the image of my loved Henry recurred, apparently ſtruggling with all the pangs of love, every thing elſe was forgotten, and, and I mourned only from the dreadful fear of loſing him forever.—The amiable form of Granville Clifford then ſtole upon my mind. I reproached him with cruelty, I called him friend and brother, but bade him never hope for more. Ten thouſand times I accuſed him mentally as the cauſe of all my diſtreſs, and felt myſelf, at that diſtracted moment, inclined even to hate him. In this agitated ſtate the hours were ſpent, until a ſervant ſummoned me to breakfaſt; but the traces of ſorrow, viſible in my face, rendered me an object really unfit to be ſeen, and I pleaded indiſpoſition as an excuſe for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my chamber. The fear of a viſit from my father ſtruck me as I delivered this meſſage to the ſervant; I called her back, and bade her ſay I was aſleep.—My heart ſmote me as I thus aſſumed the deſpicable veil of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy to conceal my real emotions. I ſeemed degraded in my own opinion—I wiſhed to recall the meſſage, but it was too late. "Gracious Heaven," ſaid I, "what have I done that ſhould need the maſk of falſehood, that ſhould prompt me in any ſhape to deceive the beſt of fathers? I have condeſcended to a meanneſs that muſt ſink me even in the eſtimation of my ſervant; but there is no reſource. I would not, methinks, for worlds offend or diſtreſs this good parent; and at this juncture I fear I could neither ſuppreſs my emotions nor bear his preſence. But his tenderneſs, claims every return in my power, and I will ſacrifice each wiſh of my own to promote his

I could with fortitude bear any ſuffering of my own in ſilence;—but how ſhall I ſupport thoſe of my Henry?—The bare idea of his being wretched is torture. Oh! fatal, fatal attachment! it has, I fear, forever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed peace from my boſom; and, perhaps, involved the moſt charming of men in miſery."</p>
               <p>In reflections like theſe I was buried until the hour of dinner approached, and I began to dreſs for that occaſion; but before I had riſen from the toilet, my father ſent to enquire if I was well enough to attend him in the muſic-room; I replied in the affirmative, and in a few minutes followed the meſſenger.—Granville Clifford was with him; I trembled and felt a ſanguine glow mount into my cheeks as I approached them; but the ſweet compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of my dear father's features, reaſſured me.—His eyes delicately avoided to ſcrutinize my altered looks; but giving me an open letter—"Here is a ſweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for you, my dear Ela," ſaid he, juſt arrived from England."—I glanced my eyes over the letter: it was from a much eſteemed friend of my father's, warmly recommending a young orphan lady (who deſtitute of any portion but an uncommon ſhare of perſonal and mental graces, had evinced a deſire to viſit India) to his protection.</p>
               <p>"This amiable lady," ſaid my father, as I returned him the letter, "if ſhe anſwers the deſcription here given, will, I hope, in ſome meaſure, compenſate to our little ſociety, for the loſs of our agreeable Dormer, who quitted us early this morning." I felt the colour deſert my cheeks as he pronounced theſe words My heart ſeemed to die within me, and I was very near ſinking to the ground; but ſummoning all my ſtrength. I ſeated myſelf in a chair by his ſide, and aſſuming an air of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, very foreign to my heart, expreſſed my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at the ſuddenneſs of Dormer's departure; then, to prevent any more being ſaid on the ſubject, I took up

Adorers flocked in crouds around her: ſhe had ſoon ſome very ſplendid offers, but thoſe that made them were not happy enough to obtain her favour: co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with bluſhes, in the gentleſt accents, ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the great honour done her by their generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals; but frankly owned that her heart forbade her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them.—My father ſilently wondered at this conduct: others cenſured it as ſome of the gentlemen were, in the general eye, unexceptionable; but guided by my own experience, I read ſome tender ſecret in the fair Auguſta's eyes, and believed her heart, like my own conſumed by a hopeleſs yet devouring flame: yet why then come to India? Why ſubject herſelf to (ſuffer me to ſay) the cenſure of indelicacy by commencing an adventurer, if unable to ſupport that character, and taſte its proffered fruits?—This was an enigma which I was unable clearly to ſolve;—yet, a perhaps, ſometimes croſſed my mind, that the amiable Clifford was the barrier to her golden proſpects. I ſaw the ſoft bluſh frequently ſuffuſe her cheek when he addreſſed her—I frequently obſerved her fine eyes rivetted on his face when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved herſelf unnoticed; but I was fully aſſured, that if ſhe had unhappily fixed her affections there, it was without the ſmalleſt probability of ever meeting a return; for he only paid her the cold tribute of common politeneſs —His unhappy unmerited attachment to me, ſeemed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

confined to his bed, and death made its awful approach. Every heart around him mourned on that ſad occaſion, and every countenance bore the enſigns of ſorrow. A few hours before he expired, he ſummoned me to his bedſide.—"Ela," ſaid he, "I am ſnatched from you ere the firſt wiſh of my ſoul is accompliſhed; but I leave you with the firmeſt reliance on your duty, your fidelity, and your judgment." He raiſed his eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Granville Clifford enter the room.—"Yes," continued he. "I cheerfully commit my deareſt treaſure to this moſt excellent young man."—The eyes of Granville ſtreamed their grateful teſtimonies; the dying ſaint raiſed himſelf in the bed; and I was totally abſorbed in unutterable wo. He took each of our hands, and joining them together, "Be bleſſed,"—ſaid he, "be happy, and mourn not for me.—I am about to be releaſed from all my pains—im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory already beams upon my ſoul.—Adieu—my children!"</p>
               <p>He ſunk on his pillow as theſe words broke faintly from his lips.—And here, my eſtimable friend, bitter reflection ſuſpends my yet unfiniſhed tale, and forces me to grant a reſpite, to myſelf and you.</p>

               <p>IN vain ſhould I attempt to deſcribe the poignancy of my ſorrow, on the ever regreted occaſion, with the account of which my laſt letter concluded; but a heart like yours full of ſenſibility, and awake to all the tender claims of nature, will eaſily conceive them; why then ſhould I labour to recal a ſcene, the remembrance of which fills my ſoul with inexpreſſible torture, and greatly augments my preſent ſufferings!</p>
               <p>Inſenſible to all the gentle arguments of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, my mind dwelt deeply on the irreparable loſs I had ſuſtained, and the voice of conſolation was unheard.—The loved idea of my ever honoured parent engroſſed every houſe: <hi>even</hi> Henry Dormer was unthought of at that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful

period. I avoided as much as poſſible the ſalutary counſel and tender aſſiduity of the diſtreſſed but ever anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attentive Clifford, and even the preſence of the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Auguſta St. Clare was unwelcome. I wiſhed for the unreſtrained indulgence of my wo I ſecluded myſelf whole days within my chamber, abſorbed in gloomy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and was not without great reluctance, prevailed on to join their ſociety.—Never child mourned more truly for a parent's loſs; never one had greater reaſon; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of virtue delivered in the ſofteſt accents of empaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tenderneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at length pierced the deep gloom of affliction by which my mind was enveloped; I liſtened to the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intreaties of my more than brother, enforced by the mild perſuaſions of my charming friend, and reſignation diffuſed its bleſſings around me.</p>
               <p>My father had made no diſpoſition of his effects, every thing therefore devolved to me. This was a conduct I did not expect, nor was I at all gratified by it, as I wiſhed and always believed, he would certainly enſure Granville Clifford an independency; but at the ſame time it determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to make him every compenſation in my power for this apparent neglect. It was certainly this belief from whence this extraordinary ſtep of my father's originated. —He judged of my heart by his own: but, alas! the concluſion was moſt fatally deceptive.—He did not reflect that the human heart is not to be relied on; and a heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined like mine ſtill leſs ſo than any other. He believed me juſt, generous and ſincere; the event proved me falſe, cruel, and treacherous.—in the firſt moment of reflection on my future conduct, juſtice and diſcretion marked out that plan I ought to purſue; and I formed ſolemn reſolutions of acting in exact conformity with what was univerſally known to be the long avowed deſign, and dying wiſh of my worthy father; but how ſoon were thoſe reſolves deſtroyed by the force of a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd enthuſiaſtic paſſion!—unworthy, I now, when too late, diſcover; totally unworthy the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which it came recommended. Granville Clifford indeed truly loved; but impreſſed with a painful ſenſe of his ſituation, his generous ſoul ſtrove to ſuppreſs its emotion, and bore its pangs in ſilence. No longer his ardent vows aſſailed my reluctant ear—but ſadneſs marked
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021723_0047_0FB73E0D88CD8658"/>
his elegant features, and a penſive habit took poſſeſſion of his ſoul.—His fond attachment now looked up to me as a prize to which he durſt not aſpire—and he determined no more to perſecute me with, as he termed it, his unworthy love, but to mourn the deprivation of all his hopes in ſecret, and gladly ſacrifice his own happineſs to my intereſt. Often had he marked the reluctance with which I attended to the language of his heart; but, unſuſpicious of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for Dormer, he hoped every thing from time, and the encouragement and intereſt of my father: but now he had loſt that, he reſolved to withdraw his claims, and (to uſe his own words) leave me to ſome brighter fate. What then was his joy, his unſpeakable amazement, while tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by contending paſſions, to hear me in compliance with the impulſe of rectitude, and the laudable reſolution I had formed pronounce, unſolicited, the moſt ſolemn aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of being only his?—A flood of rapture burſt on his dejected mind—he threw himſelf paſſionately at my feet. —his emotions were too powerful for utterance—but the eloquence of his eyes rendered all other language needleſs. I was deeply affected. Penetrated to the ſoul by the tender and reſpectful ardour of his attachment, and the fulleſt conviction of his exalted merits, I ſincerely partook of his felicity; and a conſciouſneſs of having acted right, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over every ſenſation that had warred againſt my peace; when the door of the room ſuddenly opened, and, quite unſuſpicious of intruſion, Auguſta St. Clare entered, followed by Henry Dormer.—They both ſtarted back— Clifford changed colour, and I fainted in his arms. On my recovery, the firſt object that preſented itſelf was Dormer kneeling by my ſide: tenderneſs and keen reproach marked his features, he ventured to embrace me with ardour; he preſſed his lips to my cheek; I reclined involuntarily on his boſom; and burſt into tears. But remembrance ſoon awakened me from the fond delirium. I diſengaged my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from him, and raiſing my eyes, beheld Granville Clifford witneſſing the ſcene, while an expreſſion of deep melancholy overſpread his lately animated countenance. The impropriety of my behaviour ruſhed upon my mind. Dormer ſtill held one of my hands between his, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the other to Clifford, I bade him no longer be
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021723_0048_0FB73E0EE9C3E8E8"/>
anxious on my account, for I was quite recovered. He ſeemed totally inſenſible of my condeſcenſion, he ſtill hung over the back of the chair, and gazed at me in gloomy ſilence; then ſuddenly withdrawing his penetrating eyes, he ſtruck his hands on his forehead, and darted out of the room. I was deeply affected by his manner: memory brought back the juſt departed ſcene; and the ſolemn vows I had ſo lately uttered filled me with the moſt ſenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. The dying words of my revered father aroſe upon my mind, and conſpired to rack me. The beauteous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta regarded me with gentleſt ſympathy, and Dormer ſat between us abſorbed in thought. The appearance of dinner proved a welcome relief: a ſervant was diſpatched to inform Clifford we waited for him; but he returned for anſwer, that a ſudden but violent illneſs rendered him incapable of attending. I was inexpreſſibly alarmed at this account—embarraſſment hovered around Dormer, and a tender ſadneſs was viſible in Auguſta: our meal was cheerleſs, the unſocial gloom was only diſturbed by a few tender enquiries relative to my health from the amiable Auguſta, and ſome broken unintelligible ſentences from the agitated Dormer.—An inſufferable load of conflicting paſſions overwhelmed my heart: and as ſoon as dinner was removed I pleaded an excuſe for retiring, and haſtened to the chamber of Clifford. He was reclining on a couch when I entered, the picture of death;—but, all pale and trembling, he ſtarted up at my approach, and I ſeated my in ſilence by his ſide. "Are you ill?" ſaid I, leaning tenderly towards him.—"Oh, yes," he replied, averting his face, I am, indeed, ill; but, let, me not diſturb your happineſs."—"Happineſs!" I repeated with emotion, "Can I be happy and ſee my deareſt friend thus?"—"Am I that friend?" ſaid he, raiſing himſelf and fixing his eyes ardently on my face.—"Is it poſſible that I can be bleſt with ſuch an appellation, and does my long adored Ela drop theſe precious tears for my ſufferings?<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was little better; my agitation could not poſſibly be exceeded—he obſerved it, although ſo greatly oppreſſed himſelf, and his looks ſufficiently declared that he was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the obligation he thought my compaſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE illneſs of Clifford increaſed with ſuch rapidity, that in a very few hours the faculty pronounced him in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger.—My grief was ſincere, his innumerable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues dwelt forcibly on my mind, and for ſeveral days and nights no perſuaſions could prevail on me to quit his ſide.

I adminiſtered his medicines with my own hands, and, kneeling, fervently beſought that Heaven would endow them with the power of reſtoration. The lovely Auguſta lent her friendly aid, and ſhared my anxiety, Dormer ſometimes ventured to intrude, and never failed to remind me of the injury my health muſt inevitably ſuſtain from the deprivation of reſt; but no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties could prevail on me to quit this ſcene, until mental and bodily fatigue, added to my having neglected the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary refreſhment of food and ſleep totally over powered me, and the third night of my watching I was conveyed in a ſtate of inſenſibility to my chamber.</p>

                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:021723_0050_0FB73E19648405C0"/>This fatal weakneſs was the inlet to all my ſucceeding misfortunes; Dormer had now every opportunity to diſplay his feigned attachment, nor did he neglect to avail himſelf of it. Too well aſſured of my unhappy predilection, he called forth all his arts to render it ſubſervient to his cruel purpoſe. He inceſſantly aſſailed me with letters, whoſe melting language was formed to captivate the coldeſt heart. I pleaded my ſolemn engagements with Granville Clifford, added to the gratitude he ſo juſtly merited, and my duty to the beſt of fathers; but all I could urge was inſufficient to diſſuade him from the purſuit.—His gentle reproaches, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intreaties, and paſſionate complaints, pierced my yielding ſoul; he tenderly accuſed me with breach of faith, and ſwore he could not, would not live without me.

               <p>Infatuation wrapt me in her thickeſt mantle, and fond delirium ſoothed each accuſing remembrancer with its Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and draught.

               <p>My ears greedily drank in theſe deluſive words, and my fond heart became their eaſy convert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The very winds ſeemed bribed to promote the wiſhes of the baſe Henry, and haſten my deſtruction; they filled the fluttering ſails, and conveyed us with rapidity from the Indoſtan ſhores.

                  </gap>rouded round my heart. My eyes eagerly ſought the dear haunts of my nativity—theſe ſcenes of innocence and artleſs joys forcibly recurred to my diſtracted mind—the image of Granville Clifford aroſe with them: I beheld him languiſhing on the bed of ſickneſs;—methought I heard him once more requeſt to ſee his long-loved Ela, and bleſs her ere he died.—Unequal to the conflict, remorſe and poignant anguiſh ſeized me, and I wept paſſionately in the boſom of the ſoft ſeducer. But he ſoon found means to ſooth my troubled ſoul, and baniſh every image but his own. He prevailed on me to ſign a writing, empowering a perſon, in whom he dared confide, to turn all my effects into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and tranſmit their value to England by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. This end accompliſhed. Dormer devoted all his time to alleviate the anxiety that ſometimes preyed upon my peace. But the righteous vengeance of Heaven purſued my cruel perfidy. A dreadful ſtorm aroſe juſt as we gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fight of England; and, after perils almoſt incredible, we were wrecked on a dangerous coaſt in the weſtern part of the iſland.

the weak ſtate in which I quitted India, added to the recent ſtruggles of my mind, the bodily ſufferings I had juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered, brought on an illneſs that threatened my life; but youth, added to the humane attentions of a worthy pair, who welcomed us with hoſpitable cordiality into their peaceful abode, averted the final blow, and I was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to health and reaſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that ſtruck my obſervation was, that Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had impoſed me on thoſe excellent people for his wife; and, guided by the ſophiſtry of his baleful arguments, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved myſelf in fact ſuch. Here, fain would I draw a veil over my own conduct, but juſtice forces me to ſubmit to the humiliating confeſſion, and own, while deep repentance wrings my heart and tears ſtream from my eyes, that, in obedience to his will, I meanly dared to join in the guilty deception.</p>
               <p>Methinks I ſee your upright ſoul turn with horror from the picture I have drawn of myſelf; but ſoft-eyed pity is the child of goodneſs, and the fulleſt conviction aſſures me that ſhe is the native inmate of your exalted mind. This bleſſed aſſurance, although I dare no longer expect your eſteem, bids me ſtill hope for the continuance of your generous ſympathy; and while you drop a tear over the errors of enthuſiaſtic love, you will, perhaps, rather lament than condemn its victim.</p>

The fondneſs of my Henry filled my whole ſoul; every valuable precept impreſſed on my mind by education and example was lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led aſleep by his deluding tongue; and ſo entirely did I doat upon the dear betrayer, that I ſeemed incapable of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between right and wrong, but as he pronounced them.

I have merited the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of Heaven; but for theſe ſpotleſs victims, why ſhould they bleed?" A deep gloom overſpread Dormer's countenance, and he ſtood gazing at me in mournful ſilence, while the letter fell from his trembling hand to the floor, "Hark," ſaid I, "do you not hear the generous injured Clifford praying for me, faithleſs and cruel as I am, even in the agonies of death?—Do you not ſee the lovely Auguſta imploring mercy for him, rather than herſelf? Oh! my Henry, juſtice muſt force you to allow his worth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in my diſtreſs." "I do, I do," ſaid he, turning from me with emotion, "God knows I feel it powerfully."</p>
               <p>"And does not this loſs ſeem the award of righteous equity?" ſaid I.—"Was I not moſt cruel and ungrateful to leave that excellent young man a beggar? Oh! ſevere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and at ſuch a time too, languiſhing under ſufferings which his unhappy attachment to me had occaſioned; it ſurely was a baſeneſs unprecedented—and I can never ceaſe to lament it."</p>
               <p>"But be pleaſed likewiſe to remember, madam" ſaid Dormer ſternly, "that you are now yourſelf little better than a beggar, and let that ſuffice you to lament about. If you preferred this boaſted Clifford to me, why not evince it ſooner? I have ſacrificed every thing to my fatal fondneſs for you?"</p>
               <p>Amazement ſeized me at this unexpected, and ſurely moſt unfeeling reproach; and nearly choaked by emotions, I could only murmur out—"Unjuſt Henry—what have I not ſacrificed?"—when the appearance of the lady of the houſe prevented his reply. She enquired the cauſe of my tears, ſincerely compaſſionated our loſs, and called forth every argument that humanity could ſuggeſt to alleviate our diſtreſs. Dormer liſtened to her in ſullen ſilence; and a ſervant entering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delivered to him another letter, which came by a private ſhip, from his Indian correſpondent, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that he had diſpoſed of my deſolated lands for their utmoſt value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tranſmitted their produce in inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a Dutch houſe in Amſterdam.

of Dormer; at leaſt ſo well he feigned returning tenderneſs, and deep regret for what he termed a ſudden guſt of paſſion, ſolely ariſing from his extreme anxiety on my account, that I could not retain the ſmalleſt doubt of his ſincerity, and his late unkindneſs was inſtantly forgotten in the tranſport of again beholding the ſoft ſeducing ſmile adorn his cheek, ſuffu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus we were again reſtored to apparent tranquillity, and Dormer propoſed his immediate departure for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, there to wait the remittances from Holland; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed my remaining with our hoſpitable friends until their arrival.

All language is much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to delineate my feelings at that juncture: deaf to the intreaties of all around me, I procured a poſt-chaiſe with all poſſible expedition, in which I ſat off for London, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the hour of midnight; and, without granting a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reſpite to the claims of hunger and watching, I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with ſuch unceaſing rapidity, that, on the third even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after my departure from our hoſpitable weſtern friends, I arrived at the dreary manſions which contained all that my ſoul held dear. I found him in a wretched apartment, ſurrounded with, (as it appeared to me, unaccuſtomed to ſuch ſcenes) every ſpecies of miſery.—Deep deſpair marked his countenance; he ſtarted when I entered, but inſtead of flying to embrace or conſole me, kept his ſeat and hid his face with a handkerchief.—I threw my arms paſſionately around him, and ſhed floods of tears for his diſtreſſes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally regardleſs of thoſe that muſt inevitably await myſelf: I then endeavoured to whiſper conſolation, by directing his mind to hopes that had no exiſtence in my own; but he ſeemed quite inſenſible to all my tenderneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any reply, put me gloomily from him: then ſtarting from his ſeat, he traverſed the room in extreme agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I earneſtly conjured him not to indulge ſuch violent emotions—when looking at me, with a kind of fury, he exclaimed,—"Oh! you have undone me! My bane, my curſe, my ruin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have deſtroyed me!—And now, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief, what do you wiſh for more?"—The ſtroke of death would, I am fully aſſured, have inflicted much leſs pain than theſe cruel words.—My heart ſeemed to die within me, and ſinking to the ground I continued, I believe, many hours in a ſtate of inſenſibility.— Happy would it have been for me had I then been releaſed from miſery— for the recollection of Dormer's unkindneſs was the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that returning reaſon preſented to my diſtracted mind— and—"Oh! dear cruel Henry," ſell involuntarily from
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021723_0057_0FB73E3F601C0C08"/>
my lips. But Henry was not preſent, either to hear my complaints, or pity my diſtreſs; he had left me in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate to the care of thoſe unfeeling beings by whom he was ſurrounded; and it was not till many minutes after my recovery, when my ſpirits were nearly reduced to their former ſtate, by repeated entreaties to ſee him, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room with ſullen aſpect and averted eyes. A ſtranger to every ſpecies of diſguiſe, I could not ſuppreſs the feelings his behaviour had excited—adding, "it is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt unkind to add unmerited reproach to anguiſh which is already inſupportable; for what would I not do to allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the diſtreſs of my Henry?" "And what would you do."—ſaid he, in the ſame harſh ſtrain as before—"What can you do?" "Sooth you with unfeigned, unalterable tenderneſs," I eagerly replied—"and by ſharing every pain that can invade your heart, render it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps, leſs acute." He threw himſelf careleſsly into a chair by my ſide, as I pronounced theſe words. I aroſe, and taking from my arms a very rich pair of bracelets that had been my mother's, and were ſet with brilliants, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Generous, charming girl." exclaimed the re-animated Henry—"But can you with-hold the reſt, and ſuffer me to languiſh in this deteſted place?"—"Oh, no!" I replied, "I cannot with-hold any thing that will contribute to reſtore you to liberty and ſmiling peace: for what are theſe poor hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>les; indeed what is all that the univerſe can afford me, compared with the heart-felt delight of ſeeing you happy?" —He poured out a rhapſody of tender proteſtations, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021723_0058_0FB73E4098AC3538"/>
again attributed his late behaviour to an exceſs of love; and the readineſs with which I admitted his apologies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his pardon, fully verified the juſtneſs of the adage, that,
<q>"What we wiſh, we eaſily believe."</q>
I then enquired, if all I was poſſeſſed of would procure caſh enough to extricate him from his preſent difficulties; to which, after a long pauſe he replied in the affirmative; and I was all impatience to put my deſign in execution.— Dormer overwhelmed me with his fond effuſions, and wrote a letter to a friend of his, who had, he informed me, been one of his pleaſant companions, and had diſſipated a very large fortune by living freely; but was ſtill a moſt worthy, generous, good-natured fellow, and would gladly undertake this buſineſs, for which my inexperience rendered me unfit, and might be depended on to diſpoſe of my jewels to the beſt advantage. A hackney coach was then procured for me, and, unattended, I inſtantly went in purſuit of this gentleman, guided only by a written direction from Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and, after a long ſearch through a variety of obſcure places, attended by innumerable difficulties, I found him in a really deplorable habitation, ſituated in a narrow dirty lane, near one of the Inns of Court. His tall emaciated figure was rendered diſguſting by the paltry gaudineſs of his apparel; his coat had once been ſcarlet, but had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of dull purple from long ſervice; he had a blue ſatin waiſtcoat loaded with tarniſhed embroidery, and ſpangles; a pair of enormous buckles, where the copper peeped through their once glittering veſt, kiſſed the ground as he tottered toward me; an immenſe bag hung ſuſpended by his few gray hairs, and a ruſty military hat, adorned with a large cockade of the ſame complexion, lay on an old ſopha, from which he aroſe at my entrance. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about fifty years of age; his face long, lean, and ſallow, was ornamented with a large pair of dark greeniſh eyes, which glanced at the ſame inſtant to every point of the compaſs; and the entire loſs of his teeth brought his noſe and chin in a conſtant ſtate of ſalutation.— He had a large black patch on his forehead, and another on one of his cheeks; I ſtarted back on beholding him, and would gladly have withdrawn from an object that looked
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021723_0059_0FB73E42569789F0"/>
like a burleſque on the human form: but advancing with a grin of ineffable delight, rendered infinitely ſtriking by the glare of his extended eyes, he made me the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found bow I had ever before witneſſed, and eagerly enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what bleſſed chance he was indebted for the honour of my preſence. I was quite incapable of making him any reply, but by a low curt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſey, and the delivery of Dormer's letter. He ſeemed quite tranſported at the peruſal of it, and enquired how long his friend and favourite Harry had been in England. I anſwered him very conciſely, and ſeating himſelf beſide me on the ſopha; which, with an old worm-eaten table, and a large cheſt, prevented from falling to pieces by ſome cords tied round it, formed the entire furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his attic abode: he pathetically lamented our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, poured out an mundation of friendly profeſſions, and offered to accompany me back to the priſon. I readily acceded to this propoſal, and the coach that brought me there waited to conduct us. Dormer was extremely embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed when we approached.—He aroſe with perturbation, and deep confuſion marked in his air and features:—my eſcort ſaluted him with the ſame eaſy gaiety as if he had found him ſurrounded by every ſpecies of happineſs; and with his native grin of ſelf-complacency, welcomed him to England. Dormer made him no reply, but turning haſtily to me, whiſpered a requeſt that I would retire for a few moments, with which I inſtantly complied, and the keeper of the priſon ſent his wife to attend me. In a ſhort time I received a meſſage from Dormer, deſiring my return to his apartment. His viſitor was gone, and my father's picture, with the bracelets and ring that had been my mother's, lay on the table. "I have ſent all but theſe, my love," ſaid he, pointing to the dear memento's—"Your watch and all your jewels, which my friend aſſures me will bring near three hundred pounds, and my debt is but a hundred and fifty, ſo that the reſt may ſupport us till I can do ſomething better." —"Thank God!" I exclaimed, "who has made me the bleſt inſtrument of your enfranchiſement!"—"And thank you, my charming girl!"—he cried, preſſing my hand paſſionately to his lips. My tears dropped one by one on the boſom of my riding ſhirt, which was faſtened in the middle with a pin that Granville Clifford had given me.

               <p>WITH a heart full of impatience I waited the return of Dormer's deputy.—Two days elapſed in a ſtate of fruitleſs and painful expectation, and we both expreſſed our ſurprize at the delay and ſilence of our ſuppoſed friend, in whom Dormer ſtill profeſſed to repoſe the moſt entire confidence. The third morning paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our wiſhed-for viſitor appearing. Dormer ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, but ſaid little. I was extremely alarmed. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed paying a ſecond viſit to the habitation of his boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend, and with apparent reluctance he acquieſced. On my arrival at the houſe, I was informed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021723_0061_0FB73E455D186CE0"/>
belonging to it, that their lodger had quitted them the evening of that day on which Dormer had entruſted him with my jewels, telling them, that he was engaged to accompany a young nobleman in his travels through Europe—This intelligence almoſt diſtracted me. I could not conceal my emotions, but quitted the houſe in ſilence I burſt into tears as ſoon as I was re-ſeated in the coach, and wept paſſionately as it conveyed me back to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.—Dormer flew to receive me, with a look of eager enquiry; but the traces of ſorrow on my countenance rendered all other information needleſs. "Are we ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, cheated, robbed?"—ſaid he.—Then after a pauſe, he added, "Oh! yes, I know, I feel we are!—And what remains?"—"What indeed?" ſaid I, endeavouring to ſuppreſs my tears. Dormer echoed my words, in an empaſſioned tone, and ſlung himſelf in an apparent agony into a chair. I ſaid every thing that love like mine could ſuggeſt to give him comfort and palliate the ſeverity of this blow; but the loſs of liberty dwelt forcibly on his mind, and he was inſenſible to all I could ſay. Near two years revolved in this ſtate of wretchedneſs. The dear memento's of my revered parents, which Dormer had providentially reſerved from the ſangs of that plauſible devouring harpy, who had ſo cruelly deceived us, were now appropriated to obtain the neceſſary means of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and I added ſomething to the little ſtip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To her I was indebted for reaping both profit and amuſement from the exertion of my unworthy talents. She procured painting, drawing, embroidery, and various kinds of needlework for me. I accquitted myſelf ſo as to give general ſatisfaction, and was liberally rewarded. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wrote to all his relations, and many of thoſe that had profeſſed themſelves his friends; but not one of them condeſcended to take the ſmalleſt notice of his applications. Theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021723_0062_0FB73E53A7B64E38"/>
his temper. I ſometimes experienced the conſequences of it; but my devoted heart never failed to offer a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of apologies in his behalf, "His paſſions are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent."—I often mentally ſaid—"His ſenſibility is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and his tender fears on my account renders it more tremblingly alive to the ſlighteſt touch. He would not feel thus for himſelf only. Shall I then reproach him for a fault ariſing from an exceſs of tenderneſs for me? Shall I not rather forgive a caprice which flows from ſo delightful a ſource, and endeavour to ſoften the wounds I have undeſignedly inflicted? For me, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſweetneſs of his temper is injured; and ſhall I cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dare, even in thought, to condemn him for what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginates ſolely with myſelf? Oh, no; let me endeavour to ſooth his perturbed ſpirits, and gently lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly back to his native ſerenity."</p>
               <p>Theſe were the reflexions that ſupported me during the heavy hours of my Henry's confinement; at length the joyful hope of his enfranchiſement darted its glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ray acroſs my mind. After many tedious delays, we received the little wreck of my once large poſſeſſions from Holland. Its amount was barely eleven hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>I poured out ardent acknowledgments to Heaven, I invoked benedictions on the head of my Henry, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into his hands the welcome ſum. I know not the half I ſaid, but I do not think that a moment of more ſincere delight and lively gratitude ever viſited my heart. Henry ſeemed touched by my enthuſiaſm, and the day concluded with a felicity from which I had long been eſtranged.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow," ſaid Henry, "to-morrow, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love, I ſhall again taſte the ſweets of liberty."</p>
               <p>Heaven knows with what ſincerity I ſhared his raptures, and eagerly anticipated the promiſed bleſſing. Henry, to-morrow, and liberty filled my whole ſoul. The bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words ſeemed to fleet before my eyes in dazzling cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and ſunk, with deep impreſſion, on the tablets of my heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:021723_0063_0FB73E57A42A29D8"/>I aroſe early the next morning to hail the welcome day and facilitate Dormer's enlargement. His debts were ſoon diſcharged, and after ſome neceſſary forms, we quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our dreary abode. The jail-keeper's wife ſhed tears at our departure—ſhe was a worthy creature, and had formed a real attachment to me. I was inexpreſſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at her effuſions of artleſs good will, and after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing on her to accept a trifling acknowledgment of her kind attentions, I left her with ſenſible regret.</p>
               <p>We hired elegant apartments in a polite quarter of the metropolis, and Dormer laid out the moſt conſiderable part of what money remained from the payment of his debts, in purchaſing that commiſſion which he now holds. The private ſolemnization of our nuptials was again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but ſome unlucky circumſtance always ſtarted up to delay its performance. Again Dormer applied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly to his numerous relations, but was equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful as before. It was at that period that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Barlow was engaged in our ſervice. He one evening reſcued Dormer from a band of mercileſs ſtreet-robbers. My heart overflowed with gratitude: the honeſt creature told a tale of artleſs woe: I prevailed on Dormer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in quality of a domeſtic, and amply were we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by his fidelity, and marked attachment. Twice afterwards he ſaved his maſter's life and mine, in the ſhort courſe of a fortnight; once from a daring party of houſe-breakers, whoſe weapons trembled at our throats when Barlow entered with the officers of juſtice, and ſeized every one of them: and a few days after, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, at the imminent danger of his own exiſtence, from the fury of a raging fire, which had conſumed all the under part of the houſe ere we awaked; and our apartment was ſinking in ruins when Barlow appeared at the window with a ladder of ropes, and conveyed me in his arms, to an adjoining houſe. Thus calamity await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us which ever way we turned. Our loſs was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the laſt misfortune. A trunk, containing a part of our cloaths and papers, ſnatched from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flames by Barlow's vigilance, was all that eſcaped deſtruction. The extreme ſhock that my ſpirits received,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021723_0064_0FB73E65B5B0A100"/>
brought on a ſevere and dangerous illneſs, during which time the unwearied attentions of Barlow far exceeded my higheſt praiſe. After a confinement of ſome weeks, I began again to recover. I experienced a chilling cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruel neglect on the part of Dormer: the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane William often witneſſed it with tearful eyes. Whole days and nights would his maſter be abſent, while I was confined to the bed of ſickneſs; but I can with truth declare that a murmur never paſſed my lips. Dormer, I have now every reaſon to believe, at that time engaged in a new and not moſt eligible ſet of acquaintance, and perhaps by their baleful influence formed the cruel deſign of deſerting me His nightly revels generally concluded with riot and intoxication. His noiſy aſſociates often occaſioned ſhameful confuſion at the door of our habitation: but he never introduced one of them to my preſence; and I now ſuppoſe, if ever I was mentioned among them, it was, as being one of thoſe wretched females who live the ſlaves of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nfamy and lawleſs man.</p>
               <p>Poverty ſoon ſtared us in the face with all its horrors. Barlow was diſmiſſed unpaid. Clamorous demands for money perpetually aſſailed us. We had run up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable bill with the people of the houſe, and all the terrors of a priſon recurred to Dormer's mind, and filled him with diſtraction. Often, in his frequent fits of fury and impatience, did I tremble leſt ſome act of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would enſue. The produce of his commiſſion was, to a man of his turn, too inconſiderable to be mentioned. It was barely ſufficient, he always declared, to pay his hair-dreſſer. In this dilemma he mentioned the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of leaving our lodgings clandeſtinely, and propoſed borrowing a trifling ſum on his commiſſion, and imploring the protection of our worthy friend in Cornwall, until the preſent ſtorm was overblown, and time unfolded brighter proſpects to our view. I highly approved the latter part of his ſcheme, but revolted at the thought of deliberate injuſtice. My ſoul ſtarted at the idea of wronging thoſe who had provided us the means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and tenderly adminiſtered every comfort in their power to me, when agonizing on the bed of ſickneſs;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021723_0065_0FB73E6E38894828"/>
but the appearance of Barlow relieved my ſtruggles. He entered the room without waitin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He threw himſelf on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and drawing from his pocket a parcel, he laid it ſoftly at my feet, ſaying, in a low and interrupted voice, "Here, here, beſt of ladies, Heaven ſent it me for you," and riſing, he hid his face with the ſkirt of his coat, and darted out of the room. I ſtooped down and took up the parcel, which contained bank notes to the amount of two hundred pounds.

               <p>I ſaw him no more until day-break the next morning, when ſitting in my room, ruminating on the times that

I gave a piercing ſhri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know not what I ſaid, but caſting on me a pitying look, he cried, "Tell me nothing, dear lady, I know all." "And what," ſaid I, "do you know William?" "Know!" he exclaimed, "know that"—he pauſed—"know enough," he added—"Oh! madam—but my maſter muſt not ſtay here—we muſt get him away inſtantly." "Away,' ſaid I, as my tears fell in torrents on Dormer's pallid face, "where would you take him away? William, William<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is gone already!" "No!" he exclaimed, "but he muſt be gone, or"—"What?" he repeated—"I will tell you another time—but we muſt all go."—"Go!"

               <p>Dormer began to recover. He had wounded his forehead againſt the chair; and I, not till then, obſerved his cloaths ſtained with blood in many places.

That, paſſing the door of a well known gaming-houſe the preceding evening, he obſerved his maſter entering amidſt a crowd of ſharpers; and deſirous of witneſſing his conduct, he diſguiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and followed him. On his entrance he found him engaged in a warm conteſt: fortune was, as uſual on thoſe occaſions, very fluctuating; one moment ſhe poured heaps of gold into his lap, the next left him almoſt pennyleſs; till at length he was ſtripped of all he had, and his lucky anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt refuſed to play any more, although Dormer borrowed a guinea from one of the bye-ſtanders.—Exaſperated at this conduct, and reduced by his ill-fortune to a ſtate of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Dormer ſtruck him; a ſcuffle enſued—ſwords were drawn, murder was echoed through the houſe, Dormer eſcaped, and Barlow was prevented from following imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by his fears of creating ſuſpicion; he therefore mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the purſuers, found they had no knowledge of our abode, and then haſtened to give us every aid in his power, not doubting but Dormer would, ere long, be traced to our late lodging.</p>

I was deeply affected—"No," ſaid I, "kind, good William, we muſt not make you a beggar."—"You will not, indeed you will not.—I muſt ſhare it with you—I muſt always attend you—I aſk no more," he replied, with interrupted voice. I could not ſpeak—"Keep it, pray keep it, Madam," he added—"I only beg to ſtay with you." "You ſhall forever," cried Dormer, taking up the pocket-book that had fallen from my hand.

The miſtreſs of the houſe entered, and informed Barlow, there had been two men below en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring if Captain Dormer lived there, but that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the negative. Dormer changed countenance. Barlow thanked her caution, and put a guinea into her hand.</p>
               <p>"We muſt not continue here," ſaid Dormer, as ſoon as ſhe was gone. Barlow owned it to be unſafe. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly alarmed; and it was agreed that we ſhould ins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly ſet off on our propoſed expedition. Fully aſſured of a cordial reception, I only penned a few lines to apprize our friends in the Weſt of our deſign, and we inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. But when we arrived at the ſpot where we had experienced ſuch proofs of genuine friendſhip, we found the houſe, where we hoped to have been welcomed by theſe generous villagers, uninhabited, and ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring peaſants informed us, that the lady had been many months in an ill ſtate of health, and they were gone to reſide in the South of France.—This was a heart-felt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; at ſuch a juncture it came with accumulated force. I believe we all felt it very ſenſibly; and the following day conveyed us back to the place where we firſt ſaw you.— And fearful of being traced by his real name, Dormer aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of Temple. Barlow ſoon received unequivocal aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances from London, that the perſon wounded by his maſter was entirely out of danger. This intelligence reſtored Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's native levity; and the recollection of former woes ſeemed no longer to hold a place in his memory; but around my heart they ſtill ſhed their baleful influence. Granville Clifford haunted my dreams. Auguſta St. Clare

never failed to accompany him. The image of my father ſeemed to hover perpetually over me—and peace was a ſtranger to my breaſt.—Dormer propoſed our continuing in that place, during the ſummer, hinted a hope that our friends would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ere its expiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> return from France. I have ſince thought, that it was his deſign to throw me on their charity. But if that was his purpoſe it proved abortive. You are already acquainted with what followed—you know the artifice by which he prevailed on the generous, unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Barlow to deſert me likewiſe; why ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it?</p>

ſtriking leſſon of morality, and inſpires me with courage to ſubdue every reluctance, and obey the powerful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of juſtice and truth. Our journey to this place, in compliance with the earneſt wiſh of Ela, mentioned in my laſt, was ſuch as you will eaſily conceive. The truly excellent Barlow accompanied us, and ſadneſs hovered around our little party. Ela's increaſing weakneſs, and deep oppreſſion of mind, occaſioned many delays; when paſſing through a deep glen, as we drew near to our place of deſtination, the piercing ſhriek of female diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs aſſailed our ears, and a voice exclaimed, with moſt affecting vehemence, "villain, monſter, tell me what is become of her!" Ela ſtarted wildly, and ſuddenly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door of the carriage, was going to jump out, regardleſs of the conſequences; but I prevented the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this dangerous attempt, by catching her in my arms. She ſtruggled to elude my hold—"Cruel, cruel tyrants," ſaid ſhe, "why will you keep me from him? Will none of you have pity?"—"And you too,"—added ſhe, looking at me with an expreſſion of poignant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh—"will you detain me from the dear, dear injured," —ſhe could no more. Barlow pulled the ſtring—the carriage ſtopped—the ſcreams ſtill continued. We lifted Ela out in our arms; and beheld at a ſmall diſtance a confuſed group, among whom was Dormer leaning againſt the ſhattered trunk of an old tree, with his face conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between his hands, and the moſt perfect manly form that ever before ſtruck my eyes, encircled in the arms of a lady from whom the ſcreams proceeded, were moſt conſpicuous. We could not diſcern either of their faces, but their figures were equal in ſymmetry. Ela withdrew her hand from mine, and darting from us, threw herſelf before them. They both claſped her alternately in their arms, with ſilent tranſport, and they mingled their tears together. I witneſſed this ſcene with emotions that cannot be deſcribed. Poor Barlow fell on his knees and prayed aloud, that there might not be any more miſchief. Another lady, tall and majeſtie, appeared leaning on the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

form. Her eyes wandered fearfully around her, but reſting on Dormer—"What means this!" ſhe repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclaimed—"Who are theſe—and why do they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you?"—"Huſh, huſh, huſh," he cried, furiouſly ſnatching up a piſtol that lay at the ſtranger's feet— "This anſwers all!" As he uttered theſe ſcarce articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late words, the bullet pierced his raging brain, and he fell proſtrate before his interrogator. But all deſcription is unequal to the ſcene that enſued. Heart-rending ſhrieks echoed through the air. Ela's empaſſioned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable love, ſoared far above her wrongs: agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with accumulated ſufferings, ſhe threw herſelf on the enſanguined earth, and folded the expiring Henry in her affectionate embrace, with a kind of frantic tenderneſs. His head reſted on her boſom, his eyes were eagerly rivetted on her face—The words "own, and only wife," died on his lips, which ſtill ſeemed to beg forgiveneſs. She beſought Heaven to pity the ſad effects of a diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moment—and graciouſly extend his unbounded mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a crime, which no exceſs of wretchedneſs can juſtify, nor any argument excuſe. In broken accents ſhe bleſſed his fleeting ſoul with welcome ſounds of pardon;—and what preſumptuous mortal ſhall dare to ſcan the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable depths of futurity? The ſelf-devoted victim raiſed himſelf with a look of penetrating horror on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding Barlow and myſelf:—we each extended our hands to him—his ſpirit departed with a deep ſigh; the remembrance of his crimes was abſorbed in compaſſion for his fate, and every atom in my frame trembled in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the emotions of my heart.</p>
               <p>Ela continued holding the corpſe in her arms; and with a look of fixed deſpair, repeated, in a deeply mournful voice—"it is over, oh, it is all over!" The elegant young man, who had ſo greatly intereſted me, quitted his fair companion, and kneeling beſide Ela, hung over the woe-fraught ſcene, while horror and heart-felt anguiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed the fineſt features, and moſt faultleſs form that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can picture. The lady, who had demanded of the wretched Dormer an explanition of the myſtery before her, now lay ſtretched on the earth, apparently as lifeleſs as

himſelf:—and the other beautiful unknown ſtill ſat motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the graſs, and concealed her face with her garments. The big drops ſtole ſlowly over Barlow's cheek, and I was unable to interupt the awful ſilence. My eyes were fixed on Ela, whoſe attitude and looks no art can poſſibly deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: the quick tranſition from all the wildneſs of horror to deep deſpair, that marked her countenance, ſurpaſſes all the powers of language, and ſets deſcription at defiance. Her fine expreſſive eyes, ſeemed rooted in the firmament; then, with a ſudden ſtart, ſhe claſped her hands together, ſunk on the boſom of the handſome ſtranger by her ſide, murmured out—"I go, I go, Clifford—bleſs me" and fell into ſtrong convulſions His heart certainly complied with her requeſt; but his tongue refuſed its concurrence. He held her ſtruggling in his arms, and his tears fell one by one on her pallid face. My ſoul ſeemed to echo the name of Clifford—I before believed it to be him—his amiable character was deeply engraved on my memory, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated with him a mixture of admiration and lively eſteem. The beauteous form, in whoſe arms I firſt beheld him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> approached us with agitated air and trembling ſteps: the deſcription of Auguſta St. Clare ſtole upon my mind— never did I behold ſuch delicacy, ſuch animation, grace, ſymmetry, and elegance. She ſtooped down, hung over the ſtruggling Ela, then raiſed her ſtreaming eyes to Clifford and faintly exclaimed, "Here's deſolation!" "Retire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my love," ſaid Clifford—"pray quit this ſcene; you are already ill. "I am," ſhe cried, leaning her head on her hand, "I am indeed ill; but where can I go?" She grew paler and paler. I raiſed her in my arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She poured a torrent of tears on the body of Dormer; then ſuffering me to lead her from the mournful ſcene, I ſaw her ſeated in her own chariot, and committing her to the care of one of her attendants, they followed the other carriage, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſpot that held our poor loſt Ela<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and her guardian friend. In our arms we conducted her to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cottage; there ſhe continued near two days in a conſtant ſucceſſion of thoſe dreadful fits. After the neceſſary
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021723_0074_0FB73E946B0EBC50"/>
forms, Dormer's remains were depoſited in the pariſh church-yard, and his death aſcribed by the voice of the law, to lunacy. Barlow brought us hourly intelligence of our fair fellow ſufferers, who were both ill, but he hoped not dangerouſly, and his ſervices were extended to us all. Ela was at length reſtored to the bitter recollection of the paſt. Her emaciated form was barely animated by exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſhe now really ſeemed what ſhe before vainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, incapable of feeling another pang. "The wounds of injured ſenſibility," ſaid ſhe, as the laſt tear dropped from her eye, "are cloſed forever.—I think my ſufferings are now over.—This poor deluded heart ſeems callous to all that can enſue"—ſhe pauſed, "yes, dear Clifford," ſhe added, "you forgive me, promiſe likewiſe to bury my memory in oblivion, and be happy;—and the bitterneſs of death is paſt." "Rather ſay," replied Clifford, tenderly ſupporting her drooping form, "that you will endeavour to live and make us all happy." "Live!" ſhe faintly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "can my friend, my brother, wiſh me to live? Can Granville Clifford deſire I ſhould continue to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this heavy, heavy oppreſſion?—Oh, miſtaken good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!— But no, no, Ela Spencer muſt not, will not live." We were both too deeply affected to add any more; but, under the guidance of Barlow, ſoon joined the reſt of our mournful party. The fair Auguſta aroſe at our entrance, and after embracing Ela with tenderneſs, while the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate tear bedewed her lovely face, Clifford preſſed her to his heart, and gazing alternately in each of their faces— "Oh!" ſhe eagerly exclaimed, "I have found a parent!" "And I," added her companion, approaching us with the mildeſt dignity, "a long loſt child; the oft lamented pledge of mutual attachment, the dear memento of my early, only love." "Yes, generous Clifford," ſhe added, after a pauſe, —"bleſſed guardian of defenceleſs innocence, if wealth and rank can gratify a mind like your's, they both await you, and you alone are wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Iſabella Waldron, the laſt ſurvivor of that noble houſe, and the rightful heireſs of its vaſt eſtates, which ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious cauſe has hitherto eſtranged her from, and which after the death of her grandfather, devolved to its preſent lately deceaſed poſſeſſor."—"Welcome ſounds," exclaimed Ela,—"has then Granville Clifford triumphed, nobly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the deluſions of his heart, and married the only woman that could ever deſerve him! My few remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days will now glide gently by, and I ſhall lay down my head in peace, bleſſed with the ſweet aſſurance, that the friends of my heart will be happy." A moment of ſilence enſued, when Clifford tenderly embracing his lovely partner ſaid, "Yes, this is my wife, my charming much-loved wife, whom I value for herſelf alone—Yet, madam," he added, "think me not inſenſible to your generous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thus readily adopting an unworthy ſtranger.—I do not, madam, nor ever can deſerve ſuch a diſtinction.— True, madam, I have taken happineſs to my boſom under the ſemblance of Auguſta St. Clare; and if that is a ſufficient claim to your favour, gratitude may, in ſome degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the deficiencies of merit."—"But how," he continued, turning with ſtill more affecting voice and air to Ela, "how ſhall I ſufficiently thank my charming friend?" "By forbearing,"—replied the gentle mourner, "to diſtreſs her by acknowledgments of which ſhe is unworthy." Her ſpirits were quite exhauſted. She expreſſed a wiſh to retire, the other two ladies attended her;—and Clifford related the uncommon viciſſitudes that had befallen himſelf and his lovely charge after the ſudden and myſterious loſs of Ela; but I muſt defer the deſcription of theſe particulars till leiſure enables me to reſume the pen, for I am this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſummoned to the apartment of that injured fair one.</p>

               <p>OUR tragedy draws to a concluſion, the ſorrows of Ela will ſoon ceaſe to exiſt, and the univerſal conqueror aſſumes a milder form than uſual to conduct her to happier climes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had diſpatched my laſt letter to you, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the truly noble Clifford, I haſtened to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that held our fair friends. Ela was ſeated between them; her pallid cheek reclined on the ſhoulder of one, and the other ſupported her in her arms. Their eyes dwelt with ſoft compaſſion on her face, and penſive ſadneſs marked their inimitable features. It was a ſcene for the heart, and I contemplated it ſome minutes without interruption. Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford leaned his arm on my ſhoulder, unconſcious, and a deep ſigh ſtole from him unobſerved by any but myſelf. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Let not then the ſhort hours I remain among you be ſpent in unavailing ſadneſs.—Start not," ſhe continued,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021723_0077_0FB73EA5A9F973F0"/>
"at what I am going to propoſe—the marriage of Clifford and my charming friend, is imperfect in the eye of the law —and what time more proper than the preſent to have it continued?"—We were all ſilent — but our eyes revealed the eloquent language of our hearts—Ela's alone were dry —"Refuſe not," ſhe cried, looking alternately in the faces of Clifford and his Iſabella, this laſt and only requeſt.— "Refuſe you?" repeated Clifford in impaſſioned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted accents, "Oh! who could refuſe you any thing?" She ſmiled ſerenely on him, preſſed his hand gratefully to her lips, and ſunk exhauſted on the boſom of the beauteous Iſabella.</p>
               <p>This laſt wiſh of Ela is now accompliſhed. A few hours ſince, the nuptials of the lovelieſt pair that ſurely ever graced the Hymeneal temple, were again ſolemnized—and the God attended with his brighteſt torch to illume the houſe of mourning. Never ſaw I, till now, a pair ſo matched in excellence, ſo equal in perfection; and although my pen can never give you a true idea of the impreſſion, which the ſcene I have juſt quitted has left on my mind; I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to trace ſome faint reſemblance of it. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was performed in the chamber of Ela. The native charms of Iſabella were heightened by the elegant ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of her dreſs. She wore a fine India muſlin, trimmed with narrow fringe, and lined with lilac, linen correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and her fine auburn treſſes turned ſimply up under a large cap, which added delicacy to a ſet of features, and complexion that ſcorns the power of imitation;—and as, with a graceful tenderneſs, ſhe gave her hand to Clifford and pronounced the ſolemn vow, I ſent up a mental prayer that Heaven would bleſs me with ſuch a bride;—for, like the lovely Roman, ſhe improves her charms,
<q>
                     <l>"With inward Greatneſs, unaffected Wiſdom,</l>
                     <l>And ſanctity of Manners."</l>
                  </q>
Her mother, who is that lady, to obtain whoſe gold, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plunged into the deep abyſs of guilt, fate in penſive at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by Ela's ſide, while her eyes dwelt full of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on her amiable children. Clifford led his bluſhing bride toward her, and kneeling, preſſed her extended hand
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021723_0078_0FB73EA747FF68B8"/>
to his lips; ſhe bleſſed them both, and my heart felt the ſcene too, too affecting. Clifford's elegant features were marked by a <hi>ſombre</hi> ſhade, which all his efforts were inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conceal; and while he preſſed his Iſabella in his arms, he ſtole a penſive look toward the emaciated form of Ela, and a tear ſtarted from his eye. Barlow ſtood behind us, Mrs. Barrymore aroſe; and giving him a paper, "ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept," ſaid ſhe, "this ſmall acknowledgment of our eſteem, your worth exceeds reward."—He eagerly opened the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per— it contained bank notes, which nearly doubled what he had beſtowed on Ela. With much difficulty he was prevailed on to acquieſce:—and unable to expreſs his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or conceal his emotions, he ſilently quitted the room. —A momentary luſtre ſhone in Ela's eyes, and a mild ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of heart-felt joy croſſed her features; but the heralds of approaching diſſolution ſoon reſumed their ſeats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the living principle faded faſt away, and I ſnatch the preſent moment while a deep ſleep has overpowered her, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe particulars to my beloved Caroline.

               <p>THIS day I have ſhed the laſt tear over the lifeleſs Ela, and ſeen it depoſited beſide the ſad remains of him, whoſe penitence, though late and momentary, was, I hope, ſincere, and found acceptance.</p>
               <p>To-morrow we ſet off for the ſeat of Mrs. Barrymore, and ſhall ſoon haſten again to embrace my Caroline, and in her ſociety endeavour to conquer the dejection that now preys upon my mind.—I have juſt parted with my amiable friends for the night; but ſleep refuſes its gentle influence to ſooth my perturbed ſpirits; and I will try to loſe the painful ſenſe of recent ſcenes, by gratifying your amiable curioſity, ſo ſtrongly awakened to know the adventures of Clifford and Iſabella.</p>
               <p>The unwearied attention, and marked tenderneſs of that lovely woman, during a long and dangerous illneſs, which commenced previouſly to the departure of Henry and Ela, and was greatly augmented and prolonged by that event, convinced him of what he had before ſuſpected, that he had undeſignedly attacked her heart.—The devaſtations of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Ali ſoon followed, and when he ſaw her beauteous form rudely ſeized by the hands of ſavage tyrants, his heart loudly proclaimed her intereſt there. He flew, regardleſs of his own life, to her aid; but one of the barbarians ſoon ſtretched him, covered with wounds, at his feet, and were carrying them into a dreadful captivity, when a party of troops met them, and, after a long conteſt, obliged the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to fly, and reſcued all the priſoners Iſabella and Clifford were conducted to the houſe of the commanding officer, where they reſided ſome months, and perfect eſteem and tender admiration was ripened by gratitude into as lively a paſſion in the boſom of Clifford as that by which Iſabella was agitated. Heaven looked down well pleaſed on the virtuous union of congenial ſouls. Clifford received a ſummons from England; intimating that, from a ſeries of remarkable events, a noble eſtate had devolved to him, and that his preſence was neceſſarily required to take poſſeſſion
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021723_0080_0FB73EB673C138C8"/>
of it.—The hope of yet again beholding his once adored Ela, his lamented friend and ſiſter, rendered this acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doubly welcome. But his heart pronounced Auguſta St. Clare arbitreſs of his future happineſs: without her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation he felt the ſtrongeſt aſſurance that joy muſt ever be a ſtranger to his heart; and the gifts of laviſh fortune be beſtowed in vain. He flew to pour out the language of his generous ſoul at her feet. A ſtranger to affection, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, ſhe owned the intereſt he had long poſſeſſed in her heart; and ſuperior to the ſcruples and aſſumed delicacy of leſs exalted minds, permitted him the following day, to lead her bluſhing to the altar; and they immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in the fleet that was ready to ſail for England.— Here their fruitleſs reſearches after Ela alone interrupted their felecity; when chance directed them to the ſpot where Dormer and ſhe had experienced ſuch friendly aid after their eſcape from the fury of the waves, and where they had been ſo long detained with the moſt cordial hoſpitality. But here their hopes of tracing the fugitives were equally unſucceſsful as before; and they were haſtening back to the metropolis, when they overtook Dormer, and his deſtined bride, and the ſcene already pourtrayed inſtantly enſued. His intended union with Mrs. Barrymore was prevented by a delay, which teſtifies an over-ruling Providence, and for which ſhe now looks up with heart-felt gratitude. Deprived of her natural protectors, ere ſhe could be ſenſible of the loſs, at a very early age, ſhe engaged the affections of a moſt accompliſhed youth, the only ſon of a wealthy family, to whom ſhe was nearly allied; but under whoſe roof her childhood paſſed in a ſtate of dependance much worſe than ſervitude; a ſtate which the delicate mind of my Caroline will readily conceive, and a good heart never fail to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate.— The attachment was mutual, a private marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age took place, the birth of Iſabella led to a diſcovery, and wretchedneſs enſued. The tender wife was torn from the arms of her diſtracted huſband, hurried, with her lovely infant, on board a veſſel, and condemned to perpetual exile from the object of her fond attachment. There ſhe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſome years a ſtranger to joy, but what aroſe from contemplating the ſoftened features of her adored huſband, viſible in her beauteous child; when the ſudden account of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021723_0081_0FB73EBACC7099D0"/>
his death ſeemed to complete the meaſure of her woes. Long ſhe ſtood trembling on the brink of eternity, wrapt in delirium; and the firſt object her ſenſes fought, was the ſweet pledge of mutual love, the only ſolace of her ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing widowhood. But the heart-rending intelligence, that death had likewiſe robbed her of that bleſſing, excluded every ray of conſolation, and many years revolved in woe that would not admit of alleviation.—When, after repeated ſtruggles with her own heart, gratitude prevailed on her to reward the generous love of an amiable foreigner, and ſhe accompanied him to her native ſhores; ſhe found that the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>durate parents of her adored Edward had not long ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and the eſtate had devolved to a diſtant part of the family. She endeavoured to drown the remembrance of the paſt in every ſpecies of faſhionable diſſipation. Again ſhe became a widow; again was prevailed on to accept the golden fruits that Hymen offered—and ere ſhe attained her ſix and thirtieth year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found herſelf again at liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with an income of eight-thouſand a year. She then mentally reſolved no more to wear the hymeneal chain;—but how weak are female reſolutions? Her's was not proof againſt the arts of Dormer; when a ſummons from the perſon that ſucceeded to the eſtates of her loved Edward, requeſting inſtantly to ſee her at his houſe in Wales, to impart to her ere he died, a ſecret which lay heavy at his heart, delayed the promiſed nuptials:—her lover murmured;—but her commands were abſolute; and, with a very ill grace, be bowed ſubmiſſion, but was permitted to attend her. The dying penitent informed her, that her daughter was, by his hands, torn from her boſom to ſecure to himſelf the inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to which he had long aſpired. That, under the name of Auguſta St. Clare, ſhe was educated in a convent in France; that from a fear that her uncommon beauty and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had attached the heart of his only ſon, he had forced her to India ſoon after her return; and that Heaven had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his cruelty, by the full conviction of having murdered his child, who ſurvived her loſs but a few months, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, with his dying breath, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the performance of their vows; but Mrs. Barrymore firmly declared, that until ſhe folded her long loſt child in her arms, joy muſt be a ſtranger to her boſom.</p>
               <p>Deſpairing of ever accompliſhing his wiſhes if ſhe held that determination, he called forth all his rhetoric to ſhake it, but in vain. They bade adieu to Wales, and their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was a ſcene of murmurings and altercation. When the ſound of Granville Clifford's voice reſounded through his heart, he raiſed his eyes, and beheld the dreaded interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, with the equally formidable Auguſta by his ſide.—Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration at that moment ſeized him, Clifford bade him alight;—he threw himſelf from the carriage—and aimed his ſword at his breaſt; but their attendants interpoſed, and the ſequel you are already acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Bereft of all her arts Vice ſtands expoſed in her native deformity. The Wiſdom of Virtue is no leſs conſpicuous. The finger of Truth points at the folly of wickedneſs; and the inevitable miſery, by which it never fails to be attended, even in this world, is ſurely ſufficient to deter every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind from the practice of it, without alluding to what muſt as certainly await it in a future ſtate.</p>
               <p>Let us then, my dear ſiſter, remember that wholſome medicine may be extracted from the moſt poiſonous plants; and while ſympathy drops a tear over the grave of Ela, and ſilence throws a veil over the memory of Dormer, let us profit by their ſad example, and apply the warning voice to our hearts; and we ſhall feel the ſtrongeſt conviction, that happineſs can never reſide with depravity;—nor, however it may ſuffer for a time, will the boſom that rectitude inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits ever want a ſupport.
