            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Take no pleaſure in noiſy controverſies and contentious diſputes, neither will I be engaged in any ſuch. Matters which have any relation to the kingdom of God, which is the dominion of truth, righteouſneſs and peace, ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with great fairneſs, calmneſs and equity.</p>
            <p>I hope no envy towards any man, nor the leaſt diſpoſition to leſſen the juſt reputation, and fully the honor of any of my brethren in the miniſtry; but ſhould rejoice to ſee them all, by a clear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth, and calm, conſiſtent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt hurtful errors, commend themſelves, throughout, to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God. I have no quarrel againſt any of the gentlemen, ſome of whoſe ſentiments are remarked upon in the following dialogue, nor will I.</p>
            <p>'Tis error, hurtful error that I cenſure and contend againſt, not men. Such gentlemen as have diſtinguiſhing marks of honor conferred on them by public ſocieties, I would willingly, as is fit, give honor to: But then they are expected to do more than barely to ſhew the feathers in their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011285_0003_0F869C5219A4DD78"/>
caps; they muſt ſhew themſelves worthy of them. It is doing ſuch too great honor, to connive at errors becauſe they embrace and teach them.</p>
            <p>Hurtful errors ought to have no ſanctuary; not to be protected from juſt cenſure, under the covert of a biſhop's gown nor even under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the throne; for they are laid under cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by a juſt ſentence given from the ſupreme throne. And it is too dangerous to countenance what God has condemned, and contradict what he has ſaid.</p>
            <p>The following dialogue has been ſhewn to moſt of the gentlemen in the miniſtry, in my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who have given it me as their opinion, that it is neceſſary to hear a public teſtimony againſt the dangerous errors which are ſpreading among our churches, and that the following teſtimony is ſo calulcated to ſerve the intereſt of truth, that it will be for the edification of the churches to publiſh it. And as no public teſtimony is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, at preſent, againſt a moſt deſtructive ſcheme of falſe doctrines, breaking in upon us as a flood, that I know of, I preſent this to the public; deſiring all to whom it may come, calmly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to weigh the things which are offered to their conſideration, by</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>A Clergyman and a Gentleman of the Laity, his acquaintance and friend, being in company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the other day, their converſation, by inſenſible ſteps, led them into the following DIALOGUE.</hi>
            </head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
               <p>I HAVE obſerved, ſir, that you gentlemen of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, though you differ in ſentiments from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet all claim to yourſelves the honor of being orthodox; and the ſame man, tho' he differs from himſelf in different ſtages of his life, yea, and even at the ſame time, and in the ſame diſcourſe, yet is orthodox ſtill, and inconſiſtent and contrary propoſitions are ſound doctrine. How is this to be accounted for; Does orthodoxy follow the motions of the clergy, as the ſhadow upon the dial does that of the fun? And when your motions are retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, does orthodoxy go backward like the ſhadow upon the dial of <hi>Abaz</hi>?</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011285_0005_0F869C537A87BBF0"/>
               <speaker>CLERGYMAN.</speaker>
               <p>YOU are merry upon us, ſir. But we are agreed in this, that true orthodoxy is a fixed thing, and that the holy ſcriptures are the only true rule of faith, and ſtandard by which doctrines of religion are to be tried, and determined to be orthodox or not. We may poſſibly differ in our underſtanding of the ſenſe of the ſcriptures, in ſome things. So do the gentlemen, and judges of the law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the law, in ſome particulars. But it don't at all follow from thence, that true orthodoxy, either in law or divinity, is a wavering or uncertain thing: it only ſhews that men are fallible. We may poſſibly err in ſome things, in our profeſſion, as well as the beſt of men in other profeſſions; but I hope we don't willingly err from the truth in any thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>GENT.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad, ſir, to find your thoughts ſo juſt: But I believe it is a pretty difficult thing, for men who are teachers of others by office, and have preſided in the church a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, to be <hi>themſelves, perfectly teachable.</hi>

               <p>It is indeed fo: and if we are not truly humble we ſhall not be ſo. If the defire of worldly honor and pre-eminence, and love of the praiſe of men prevails in us above the deſire of pleaſing God, and being approved by our great maſter, we ſhall become obſtinate in

defending our own unhappy miſtakes, and ſooner run into two popular errors than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege one. However, we ought all of us, to ſit at the feet of Jeſus with as much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and meek teachableneſs as the leaſt of our hearers, that we may hear and learn of him, and be corrected by him, wherein we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily erred from his truth, and willingly receive his corrections of our errors, by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hands they are miniſtred to us.</p>

               <speaker>GENT.</speaker>
               <p>I am right well pleaſed with your modeſt and juſt ſentiments; and wiſh all the gentlemen of your order, throughout the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, had them written on their hearts.</p>

               <p>Under the influence of theſe tho'ts, and in your preſent temper of mind, I believe you will be an impartial examiner, and juſtly cenſure ſuch errors in religion as deſerve cenſure. I will therefore, if it be agreable to you, ſir, mention to you ſeveral things which I have collected out of ſundry diſcourſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our clergy, which have been lately publiſhed, which appear to me very wrong, and of very evil tendency; ſome of which are, I think, nearly related to <hi>Sandeman's</hi> hereſies, and deſire your thoughts upon them.</p>

               <p>Do as you. pleaſe, ſir. As to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> his books are written in a very artful manner, but are, in my opinion, the worſt and moſt pernicious of any that ever I read, which were pretended to ſerve the cauſe of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What the author's deſign was in writing them, I do not pretend to ſay; but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his ſcheme of doctrine, repreſented by him at the true goſpel ſcheme, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and turn the goſpel into ridicule, and in the iſſue to ſerve the intereſt of deiſm. It is to me very ſurpriſing that any of our clergy ſhould go into his ſentiments, ſo far as ſome of them ſeem to have done. I am ſure theſe things diſſerve the intereſt of chriſtian truth and virtue.</p>

               <p>I will then firſt mention ſome of the things I have collected out of two diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> lately printed in <hi>London.</hi>

               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>I have not the happineſs of any particular acquaintance with the Dr. but have heard ſome things ſpoken of him to his honor, and wiſh the diſcourſes you refer to, were calculated to do him more honor than they do. I have read them, and confeſs my expectations were greatly diſappointed. I obſerved ſundry particulars which I greatly diſlike, and think the general plan of the diſcourſe is wrong. But what are the things you have remarked as erroneuos?</p>

               <speaker>GENT.</speaker>
               <p>Paſſing by various leſſer matters, I will only mention ſome things which appear to me of importance. And firſt, the Dr. ſays, p, 7. <q>Man's enmity is the cauſe why God, became <hi>his enemy</hi>; and this enmity or anger of God is moſt reaſonable and righteous.</q>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>The Dr. does not do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God's holy diſpleaſure againſt man for his firſt apoſtacy and rebellion, as the ſame with enmity. They are as different from each other as the diſpleaſure of a gracious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate father, towards an offending child, is from the hatred of an enemy. But if God did become his enemy, whence did he love him ſo, as to give his own Son to ſave him? The Dr. ſhall be his own corrector. He ſays, p. 27. <q>The gift of Chriſt was the effect, not the cauſe of God's love.</q>

               <p>Your anſwers encourage me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. The Dr. quoting theſe words of the apoſtle, Rom. 3.25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, thro' faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt—that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believes in Jeſus,</hi> ſays, <q>From this ſcripture it plainly appears, that the great end for which Chriſt was made a ſacrifice for ſin, was to declare, manifeſt, vindicate and honor the righteouſneſs of God,</q> (that is, as he explains himſelf, his puniſhing juſtice) <q>not to declare his kindneſs, and perſuade men that God is very merciful and ready to forgive them.</q> And he ſays that <q>men are of themſelves too ready to believe this without any arguments and perſuations,</q> and thence infers, p. 26. <q>Therefore Chriſt did not come into the world to declare or demonſtrate that God is merciful, for it was not doubted before; but it was to manifeſt the truth and righteouſneſs of God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the law.</q>—What ſay you to theſe things, ſir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>In the firſt place I ſay, the Dr. here
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011285_0010_0F869C58C2D5E420"/>
inverts the order of the goſpel, and ſpreads a very diſhonoring cloud over the glory of this diſpenſation. The ſcripture every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the immediate and <hi>grand</hi> deſign of Chriſt's appearing and ſuffering in the fleſh, as being to manifeſt God's mercy, and to miniſter to and accompliſh the deſigns of his love to man. He became a ſacrifice, to the honor of juſtice, only as an expedient to open the way, for mercy or love to do all the good pleaſure of its will, in conſiſtence with juſtice; as the apoſtle ſays, <hi>that God might be juſt, and the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier of the ſinner who believes in Jeſus.</hi> In this diſpenſation juſtice miniſters to, and follows the lead of mercy. The Dr. acknowleges the truth in theſe words, <q>The love of God broke out firſt in the glorious act of giving Chriſt: to open a way for its honorable exerciſe in the ſalvation of ſinners.</q> p. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. The good Dr. has undoubtedly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the ſenſe of the text you mention. By the righteouſneſs of God there, he ſuppoſes his puniſhing juſtice to be intended; whereas the apoſtle intends his righteouſneſs in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin and juſtifying the ſinner; that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God by which ſinners are juſtified, which the apoſtle oppoſes to the righteouſneſs of obedience to the law. This, I think, is very manifeſt from the apoſtle's reaſning from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011285_0011_0F869C59800101D0"/>
the 20th to the 28th verſe of this third chapter of Romans. The apoſtle uſes the word righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in the ſame ſenſe as it is here uſed in many other texts.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The Dr. is greatly miſtaken in ſaying, God's mercy in freely pardoning and ſaving poor guilty ſinners, was not doubted before Chriſt revealed it, and that men are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too prone to believe it. What he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of carnal, ſecure ſinners eaſily believing the mercy of God, but not his juſtice, is to no purpoſe—they only ſeem to believe it: If they really believe any thing, it is that they have very little need of mercy. The true trial of their faith is taken from their being bro't under juſt conviction of their ſin and evil deſert. And now they are found more eaſily and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to believe God's juſtice than his mercy. What a guilty world wanted was a juſt ground of faith concerning God's mercy and readineſs to forgive the penitent, and to be ſhewn how this can be done conſiſtently with juſtice, which the guilty do more readily believe; and this is done only by the goſpel.—But if it is as the Dr. ſays, whence is it that our firſt parents before they had received any revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's purpoſes of mercy to them, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his juſtice but not his mercy, and were afraid when they heard the voice of their Lord,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011285_0012_0F869C5A437168A0"/>
and hid themſelveſ among the trees? Fear or dread of divine wrath is the natural reſult of a ſenſe of guilt, and what all mankind feel the impreſſion of, and can't be effectually relieved from but by the diſcovery of God's mercy made by the goſpel. Accordingly the apoſtle ſparks of the Gentiles as <hi>mourning without hope, and ſays Jeſus Chriſt has redeemed thoſe who thro' fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>

               <p>The Dr. ſays, <q>To aſſert that the death of Chriſt hath cauſed any reaſon for our reconciliation to God to exiſt which did not exiſt before, and which would not have exiſted had not Chriſt died, is to aſſert that it is now more reaſonable to love God than it would otherwiſe have been.

               <p>There is a moral beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in equity, righteouſneſs, veracity, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, goodneſs, benignity, bountifulneſs, mercy, compaſſion, pity, placableneſs, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forgive and overcome evil with good. Theſe are the characters of that great Being,

whoſe we are. There is a moral deformity, uglineſs and baſeneſs in all the contrary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, tempers and actions. Is the preſent frame or conſtitution of human nature ſuch, ſo totally <hi>inverted,</hi> that God is hated as being thus excellent, and morally perfect?

Are they the objects of our utter averſion? If ſo, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we naturally approve the contrary vices. They are beautiful, excellent and amiable characters in our view and taſte of them.

               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>I hope it will be allowed that thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011285_0016_0F869C5DDB7937E8"/>
who are <hi>followers of that which is good,</hi> are, therein, followers of God, and conformed to Jeſus Chriſt. Now the apoſtle Peter ſays, <hi>Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good</hi>? 1 Pet. 3.13. Implying that moral good is not naturally hateful to men, but rather approved and countenanced as good, in their eſteem. But I won't inſiſt on this now, for our new apoſtles have thrown the old ones quite out of the ſaddle. But if it is as the Dr. ſays, we ought to ſee this utter averſion to all that is morally good and Chriſt-like univerſally expreſſed in the life and actions of all unconverted men. But do we ſee them generally expreſs ſuch a hatred and utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to equitable conduct, in caſes where they are unintereſted to all the expreſſions and actions of juſtice, goodneſs, kindneſs, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, compaſſion, meekneſs, forbearance, placableneſs, veracity and faithfulneſs? Do we ſee the contrary vices generally approved and commended by natural men, in inſtances where, they are unintereſted? All the world are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the contrary: It would not be a more glaring contradiction to notorious fact to aſſert, that all men walk upon their heads with their feet ſtretched up into the air. — I believe it will be found, on a critical examination, that the enmity of carnal men to God's character, is an
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011285_0017_0F869C5DFA7773F8"/>
intereſted and partial affection, contrary to their own inward and natural ſenſe of what is right and morally good and excellent; like that of a corrupt, bribed judge againſt the ſentence of righteouſneſs. But I don't enlarge here.—How does the Dr. account for the introduction of that horrible ſpirit of enmity againſt the perfections of God, and all moral excellence which he ſpeaks of as the character of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart ever ſince Adam's offence?</p>

               <p>He ſays, <q>Whether this hatred of God or depravity ariſes from the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aids of his Spirit, or from ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive viciouſneſs I ſhall not ſpend time to determine, tho' I believe the former.</q> p. 11.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo, he ought not to have ſaid that this hatred is <q>innate and interwoven with the very frame of our hearts.</q> But the good gentleman's faith in this particular was very ſhort-liv'd; for by the time he came to the fourteenth page, he changed his mind, and ſays, <q>It is clear that this enmity ariſes from the viciocity of our hearts, and that it is innate and interwoven with their very frame.</q> And this notion runs through the remainder of his diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>It does ſo. He ſays, p. 19. <q>All natural men's hearts are ſo contrary to all God's perfections that nothing can give them

               <p>The Dr. is aware of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and approves it, and it is one eſſential part of his ſyſtem of orthodoxy.

glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt to the mind and heart of a ſinner, is the moſt unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table means that can be uſed to convert and reconcile him; it is like throwing oil into fire in order to quench it: and the devil is ſadly out in his politics, in endeavoring to blind the eyes of unconverted people left the light of the glorious goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them.</p>

               <p>Well, the Dr. alſo ſays, <q>The wonderful manifeſtation of his (God's) love and grace, in the goſpel, with all the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and melting accents of his mercy, are not ſufficient to prevail with one ſinner to make up the quarrel with God.—The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, and the love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted therein, is not <hi>ſufficient, by way of motive,</hi> to prevail with one ſinner to return to him.</q> p. 44 —Again, <q>The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine glory by Chriſt tranſcends every other method in which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his perfection, and unfolds more of his nature and attributes than the works of creation and providence.—But all this ſerveſ not to engage unrenewed man to love, but more ſenſibly to abhor God, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the clearer manifeſtation of his nature and perfections. For if there is enmity in our hearts to God, the clearer views we have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011285_0020_0F869C60FAE90A18"/>
of him, the more will it work and ſhew itſelf, till a change takes place,</q> p. 50, 51. I think the Dr. is now quite perfect in his way.</p>

               <p>If the caſe is ſuch, Jeſus Chriſt expreſſed himſelf very improperly when he ſaid, <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me</hi>; and when he makes the drawing influence of the truth the great inſtrument of engaging men to come to him, ſaying, <hi>No man can come unto me except the Father draw him.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John 7.44, 45.</note> And it is to no purpoſe to addreſs unconverted men in the apoſtle's manner, ſaying, <hi>We beſeech you and pray you, in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God; for he hath made him ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.20, 21.</note> For the hearts of men are ſo monſtrouſly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that moral and goſpel motives can take no hold of them, till they are firſt new-made, <hi>without the word</hi>; but the more goſpel truth draws them, ſo much the more they pull back. Theſe are no more calculated to draw ſuch hearts, than they are to draw a cart. But I can more eaſily believe the Dr. has blundered into a groſs and abominable error, than admit theſe things as true. But if it is as the Dr. ſays, that "the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the love

               <p>The Dr. acknowleges it, ſaying, <q>God takes much pains to perſuade man to be reconciled to him, yet, alas! the enmity remains; man is ſtill totally averſe to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and all the threatnings and promiſes, all the intreaties and arguments which can be propoſed, are inſufficient to overcome and bow his will and reconcile him to God. Natural men laugh at his counſels and deſpite his reproof; and ſo they will do till the arm of God's power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to make them willing.</q> p. 33, 34. I think the Dr. muſt be underſtood to intend here a different kind of power from the moral power of goſpel truth and love; for this power is oppoſed by him to the perſuaſive power of the goſpel: that can effect nothing; this alone can ſubdue the enmity and make the ſinner willing. So the Dr. robs the goſpel of all its <hi>moral</hi> power over the minds of ſinners, and of all the glory of drawing men to God, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading

If his Majeſty, out of his pity to the poor, mad creatures, confined in Bedlam, ſhould ſend his biſhops among them from week to week, and from year to year, to preach to them, and exhort them to lay aſide their wrong and wild imaginations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſober and reaſonable, what high tho'ts ſhould we entertain of his Majeſty's wiſdom, and great ſkill in curing madneſs? But if we knew his Majeſty perfectly underſtood the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their diſeaſe, and knew that all this parade of preaching, reaſoning and exhorting them could effect nothing, and that he could otherwiſe cure their diſeaſe by the exerciſe of mechanic power, what tho'ts ſhould we have of his ſincerity, and of his proſeſſed love and pity to thoſe poor creatures? How ſhocking

Gentlemen who talk in this wild manner would do well to lay to heart the words of Job, whereby he reproves the partial, perverſe reaſonings of his friends, <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully for him?

               <p>If ſo, Jeſus Chriſt and his holy apoſtles were very injudicious preachers, and took abundance of impertinent pains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ſinners; and yet no man ever perſuaded them ſo ſucceſsfully: the multitude flocked about Jeſus to hear his preaching. Did he thunder and terrify them as at the mount that was covered with blackneſs, and burned with fire, and quaked with fear? No: <hi>They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and their eyes were faſtened upon him.</hi>—But ſuppoſe it is as the Dr. here ſays, that "no moral arguments except the terrors of the Lord are adapted to influence carnal

ſinners, &amp;c." He alſo ſays, p. 34. " They deſpiſe his reproof: and ſo they will do till the arm of God's power is revealed to make them willing."

He adds, <q>The minds of men are too full of enmity to God, to be perſuaded to love and be reconciled to him, by any, tho' the moſt powerful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, addreſſed to their underſtanding, or affections; therefore I don't think that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is effected by light, i. e. by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the things of religion to their minds, or even by <hi>opening their eyes to ſee them</hi>; but in order to this the power of God muſt be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew.</q> p. 53.</p>

ven into hit frame and conſtitution, a fixed, incurable averſion and deteſtation to all ſweets, it is in vain to go about to cure this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional averſion by feeding him with ſugar and honey: His conſtitution muſt be mechanically changed before he can be reconciled to them. So if the caſe be with man as the Dr. ſays it is, the very frame of his nature muſt be altered before he can be brought to love God: A view of his moral perfections, and goſpel truths can do nothing towards working this change, but this muſt firſt be wrought by abſolute power, before theſe truths can take any hold of the heart. This change, according to the Dr. is wrought only by the exertion of a power of the holy Spirit upon the ſoul of man, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a different kind from the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth and love, a power which produces its effects, not by moral exertions and means, but by a phyſical, forcible exertion of ſtrength. This is the darling doctrine of the Sandemanian divines, the quinteffence of the new orthodoxy.</p>

               <p>Well; but the Dr. ſpeaktng of the means by which God ordinarily brings men to be reconciled to him, ſays, p. 48. <q>God to effects the new birth by his own almighty power, yet he makes uſe of means in order thereto. He deals with men as rational creatures, propoſes all thoſe motives and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011285_0026_0F869C67D3662BD8"/>
arguments to their conſideration, which would be ſufficient to engage their love to him, were it not for their hatred of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable perfections; and theſe motives have a powerful influence on all thoſe whoſe hearts are conformed to God in regeneration. Preaching the goſpel is the ordinary means which God makes uſe of to reconcile ſinners to himſelf, and it is as well calculated to work on the minds of ſinners as any means can poſſibly be: But yet all the motives the goſpel ſets before ſinners will be ineffectual, without the agency of divine power to renew their hearts and conform them to his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character.</q>

If ſo, God treats man, in the goſpel diſpenſation, as being what he is not; which is to treat him. contrary, to truth, improperly and wrong, and ſolemnly applies a courſe of means for the cure of ſinners, which can have no effect till the

               <p>I will now let the Dr. reſt; but have a few things collected from Mr. Hopkins, out of many, which are very faulty, which I deſire your thoughts upon.—In his treatiſe, intitled, An Enquiry concerning the Promiſes of the Goſpel, he ſays, p. 124, 125. <q>The awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, convinced ſinner, who has taken a great deal of pains in the uſe of means, and has hereby got a great degree of inſtruction and knowlege, and yet remains impenitent, is, in this reſpect, much more guilty and vile, and a greater criminal in God's ſight, than if he had never attained to this conviction and knowlege: yea, his impenitence, and all his other ſins, are ſo aggravated by the light and conviction he obtains, that whatever particular ways of known ſin he has forſaken, and how many ſoever external duties he attends upon, yet, on the whole, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011285_0028_0F869C69AD0A1B08"/>
a greater ſinner than he was when he lived in ſecurity, and the neglect of the means of grace. So that the impenitent, unregenerate ſinner does not grow better, but rather worſe by all the inſtruction and knowlege he gets in the uſe of means. And awakened, convinced ſinners, with whom moſt means are uſed, and who are moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the concerns of their ſouls, and moſt in earneſt in the uſe of means, are commonly, if not always, really more guilty &amp; odious in God's ſight than they who are ſecure and at eaſe in their ſins.</q>—p. 127. <q>If theſe things be ſo, then the ſinners who continue impenitent under the greateſt convictions of conſceience, and the moſt concern about their ſouls and ſalvation, and are conſequently taking the moſt pains, and uſing unwearied endeavors, are uſually the greateſt ſinners, really more guilty, more vicious and vile than they were when in a ſtate of ſecurity; and lived in a great meaſure in the neglect of the means of grace. And if they live and die impenitent, their condemnation will be more intolerable than if they never had that conviction and knowlege, which by their attention to the goſpel they have attained.</q> How do you like theſe things, ſir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all. 'Tis uſual for enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011285_0029_0F869C6A08780F70"/>
convinced ſinners to complain that they grow worſe: they ſee more of their own bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ than formerly, and ſo imagine they really grow more wicked, and are in danger of being diſcouraged. But it is a new thing to teach them doctrinally, that they really do ſo, and are more odious to God in proportion as they are more, awakened, and take more pains to become better, as Hopkins does. This is a ready way to throw them directly into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's arms. If this author was alone in theſe fentiments, I would not trouble myself with any attention to them; but as they are embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and taught by too many, I will a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon them.—This gentleman puts the caſe of a ſinner who by his attention to the goſpel is enlightned, has gained much chriſtian knowlege, and is under ſtrong convictions, and is thereby put upon uſing his beſt endeavors to obtain mercy and grace, in the uſe of the means of grace, and engaged to abſtain from his old ways of ſin, and carefully to practiſe outward duties. Such he ſuppoſes to be ſtill <hi>impenitent.</hi> By which he muſt be underſtood to intend that his repentance does not ſpring from the higheſt motives or principles, a ſupreme love to God and holineſs, and a diſintereſted governing hatred of ſin, and ſo is not of the ſaving kind. For ſuch a ſinner as he here deſcribes does
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011285_0030_0F869C6ACCA43C90"/>
repent in ſome fort. He has a change of mind and conduct with reſpect to ſin and duty, with reſpect to God and the eternal world, which is effected by the knowlege and belief he has obtained of goſpel truths. Hopkins deſcribes him as forſaking and abſtaining from his old ſins, (ſorry, no doubt, that he ever practiſed them) as reforming his life and practiſing the duties of religion, as far as he can, and as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeeking God's mercy and ſalvation in the careful uſe of the appointed means of grace, and in a word, as going as far as he can under the influence of common grace, and the higheſt illuminations and influences of the Spirit of God, by the word, which are ſhort of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and ſaving. Is he now become a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinner than, he was before? Is he now more guilty and vile, and odious to God than he would have been if his mind and conduct was contrary to what it is? The motives he acts upon are ſuggeſted to his mind by the word and Spirit of God. If they are not the higheſt motives, they are <hi>true</hi> motives, <hi>goſpel motives</hi> to ſuch a conduct as he now obſerves; and the conduct is ſuch as is required, though not the whole that is required. Is it then more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act right in part, than not at all? to be influenced to do part of our duty, by ſome of the reaſons and motives God ſets before ſinners
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011285_0031_0F869C6B9A7D24A8"/>
to engage them thereto, than to be influenced by none of them, and do no part of our duty, but to deſpiſe them all? Is it a viler thing for a poor ſinner to believe and fear God's wrath, and endeavor to flee from it, than to diſbelieve and deſpiſe it, and run upon the point of his ſword? Is it more odious to God to hear a ſinner, under deep conviction, cry to him for mercy, than to hear him prophane his name and imprecate his curſe upon his head? Is a thief, who being hardened in his firſt theft, goes preſumptuouſly and commits a ſecond, leſs guilty than he would have been, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his firſt ſin, he had brought again that which he ſtole, and ſeriouſly aſked God's forgiveneſs?</p>

               <p>It is ſaid that the awakened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner acts upon ſelfiſh principles and motives in all that he does in religion, not from the love, and for the glory of God; and this is a wicked thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>God acts with a view to his own glory, and to our true intereſt, ſubordinate thereto; and requires that we do ſo too. If the convinced ſinner can't yet act upon the firſt and higheſt motive, yet in acting as he ought on the ſubordinate principle, he acts right as far as he goes, and as God wills him to do, though he does not go ſo far as he ought.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011285_0032_0F869C6C6E825388"/>
His preſent conduct is therefore criminal in a leſs degree than it would be if he neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the glory of God, nor cared for his own ſoul and future well-being. And he who acts right now, as far as he can, may, through the grace of God, attain to act alſo upon the beſt principles: But if men will not be influenced by the lower, there is no probability that they will ever have given them the higher.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hopkins ſeems to make the increaſed wickedneſs of the convinced ſinner to be the reſult of his increaſed light. He ſays, <q>His impenitence and all his other ſins are ſo aggravated by the light and conviction he attains that,</q> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>When, in proportion as light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, men's enmity and oppoſition to the truth, and obſtinacy in their evil ways increaſe, they do indeed grow more vile and odious in God's fight, and in men's too. So it was with the incorrigible, malicious Phariſees, as our Lord obſerves of them, <hi>If had not done among them the works which no other man did, they had not had ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin. Now they have both ſeen and hated both me and my father.</hi> But the caſe of the convinced ſinner which Mr. Hopkins puts, is widely different from this. He does not drive againſt his convictions, and maliciouſly reſiſt and rebel
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011285_0033_0F869C6D9B457DB8"/>
againſt the light which ſhines in his mind, but ſubmits to its reproofs, and amends his ways, and applies himſelf to do his duty as he is able; is ſtruggling againſt his luſt, and cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me</hi>? and cries to God for mercy and deliverance. If his repentance is imperfect, ſo is his preſent light: It is proportioned to his light; if one is ſhort of ſaving, ſo is the other. Where, or what then is the great aggravation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſins by the light he has obtained, above that of all his ſins in his careleſs ſtate of mind? I wonder gentlemen will talk ſo abſurdly.—Indeed, if it were true as Dr. Whitaker ſays, "that the more natural men are enlightned the more they neceſſarily hate and abhor God," Hopkins's doctrine would alſo be true: But then the ſcriptures would be falſe; for they certainly teach a contrary doctrine to theſe.—This doctrine reflects great diſhonor upon the holy Spirit; for it is under his influence that ſinners are awakened and put upon ſeeking mercy in an earneſt attendance on the means of religion: It alſo ſtrongly tends to diſhearten and diſcourage awakened ſinners from applying themſelves to the means of religion, and to make them deſperately bold in wickedneſs.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hopkins ſays (upon his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <q>There is reaſon why the ſinner ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011285_0034_0F869C6DC2266A40"/>
diligently attend all means of inſtruction and knowlege, and ſufficient encouragement hereto. For without this inſtruction and knowlege the ſinner can't be ſaved.</q> p. 127.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>CLERG.</speaker>
               <p>A very poor encouragement is then ſufficient. This thought, that let him do his beſt he only becomes more guilty, vicious and vile than he would be if he ſhut his eyes and ſinned away in the dark, at all adventures, will not greatly encourage him to open them: this reflection, that he only becomes more wicked by all his endeavors and prayers to become better, and that if he fails at laſt, it will be much worſe with him forever, than it would have been if he had never troubled his head about theſe matters, can never animate his heart in ſtriving to enter in at the ſtraight gate: And a perſuaſion, that by all he does, or can do, he only becomes more odious in the ſight of God, than he would be if he cared for none of theſe things, will never convince him that ſuch ſeeking as he is capable of, is a likely means for obtaining what he ſeeks.—Theſe diſcouraging thoughts are wholly unballanced by theſe other thoughts, viz. "that without that knowlege and conviction which makes the ſinner worſe, he can't be ſaved; and that this knowlege can be obtained only in the uſe of means." If you urge a poor, guilty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011285_0035_0F869C7069986C18"/>
low-ſpirited ſinner to earneſt, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering diligence in ſeeking God's mercy and grace in the uſe of means, upon theſe principles, telling him that without this knowlege and application he can't be ſaved, he will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reply, that he has become much worſe already by the pains he has taken in ſeeking God, and that the more he does, he ſhall only become the more odious and vile in his fight; and you ſhall never perſuade him that this is a likely way to obtain his mercy; that if your principles are true, the beſt way is to ſit ſtill and do nothing: If God deſigns to ſave him, he ſhall be brought home one time or other; and if not, that he ſhall be leſs miſerable in this way than in that you urge him to. Upon theſe principles, 'tis ſo far from being true that there is <hi>ſufficient</hi> encouragement to a poor ſinner to ſeek, that he has <hi>no true</hi> encouragement at all, This doctrine is a perfect <hi>ſnare of the fowler</hi> to poor, ignorant, perplexed ſouls.—Such tho'ts and reaſonings, uſed formerly, ſometimes, to be ſecretly ſuggeſted, and urged upon the minds of awakened, concerned ſinners, by the devil, with a view to diſcourage them from ſeeking; and it has ever been the care of ſkilful and tender guides of ſouls to detect the ſophiſtry of the deceiver, and deliver poor ſinners out of theſe ſnares, craftily laid for them. But what

We ſeem, ſome of us, to have refined all the ſpirit and virtue of it away, and to be bringing in a ſyſtem of errors, which have the moſt deſtructive influence upon the intereſt of virtue and genuine chriſtianity.

But this diſeaſe of our nature, according to theſe new notions, is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by power only, only by the exertion of a power as different from the power of divine truth and love, as a mechanic power is from a ſyllogiſm.</p>
               <p>Another conſequence is, that natural man is not a moral agent. How can he be ſo, if his nature is ſuch that moral truth and motive neceſſarily produce effects in him contrary to their nature? as Dr. Whitaker's doctrine ſays they do.

               <p>Another neceſſary conſequence is, that it is to no more purpoſe to urge goſpel truths and motives on unconverted men, to perſuade them to be reconciled to God, than to reaſon with a

mad man, with a view to cure him of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; and that the goſpel miniſtry, as it reſpects the unconverted, is the vaineſt, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheſt, and abſurdeſt thing in the whole world. What would you think of the conduct of a phyſician, who, with a ſhew of great compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a ſick and diſtracted ſervant, ſhould preſcribe to him, and command him to take a courſe of medicines in order to his cure, which (though of excellent virtue in ſome caſes) he knows are not at all adapted to his caſe, but will only inflame his diſeaſe and make him more raving: and becauſe he does not mend, but grows worſe under the uſe of theſe means, kindles wrath againſt him, and commands him to be burnt to death as a deſpiſer and abuſer of his love and care for him, ſaying, with tears of ſeeming compaſſion in his eyes, I would have healed you, but you would not be healed? <hi>Tears,</hi> as <hi>deceitful</hi> as Judas's kiſſes.</p>

                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:011285_0040_0F869C74805FBFB8"/>Another conſequence is, that there is no preparatory work of the Spirit, no influence of common grace which does at all prepare and prediſpoſe men to receive the kingdom of God; but that the moſt careleſs, abandoned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate wretches are as near to the kingdom of God, and as well diſpoſed to receive it as the moſt enlightned, concerned, and earneſt ſeeker, Sandeman avows this conſequence, and makes it a pillar in his building. And Dr. Whitaker and Mr. Hopkins, upon their principles muſt admit it, if they will be ſelf-conſiſtent. For one ſays, the more natural men ſee of God's character, the more their hatred to it ariſes; and the other ſays, the more they know of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truth and ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, the worſe they grow. If theſe things are ſo, common grace is no grace. It is, not only, eventually no favor to thoſe who never obtain ſpecial grace, through their abuſe of it; but it is no grace to ſuch, in its nature, tendency, and deſign: And all the common influences of the holy Spirit on them are vain triflings. They are a means that don't at all prepare the ſubject for the end that is profeſſedly aimed at by them—And ſinners can't, in equity, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for not profiting by them; for they are not improvable by them to any ſpiritual advantage.</p>

                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011285_0041_0F869C771AA165E8"/>Another neceſſary conſequence of this ſcheme is, that the Spirit of Chriſt, acting in character, as the great teacher of his truth and love, and enlightner and drawer of ſouls, can do no more towards converting ſinners, than you or I can. We uſed to think and ſay, as our venerable fathers taught us, and the holy apoſtles before them, that men, and miniſters of the goſpel, can't convert ſinners and draw them to God, becauſe they can only ſpeak the quickning, converting truths into their ears; but that the Spirit of Chriſt, by ſpeaking it into their hearts prevails, and divinely perſuades and draws them home to God in Chriſt. But according to our new divines, this internal teaching can do no more towards converting the ſoul than the merely external. The holy Spirit acting as the Spirit of truth and endearing love, upon the minds and hearts of poor ſinners can effect nothing. The more clearly and ſtrongly he repreſents and impreſſes the glorious truth upon them, the more furiouſly they rage in their enmity againſt the truth, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of truth. Their enmity turns the edge of his ſword: "<hi>The ſword of the Spirit is the word of God,</hi>" with which he was girded when he was ſent forth from the Father, by the Son, as his miniſter, to ſubdue the enmity of men and make them willing captives to the Savior.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011285_0042_0F869C796D58FA70"/>
But he can effect nothing by it; the harder he ſtrikes the head of this enmity with his ſword, the ſtronger and more lively it grows: (for the more natural men ſee of God's character and glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, the more does their enmity riſe and exert itſelf; if we may believe our new teachers.) In ſhort, he is quite defeated, in the uſe of his own proper weapons, by every fooliſh ſnner: And if he will conquer at laſt, he finds himſelf obliged to throw away his ſword, and betake himſelf to a very different kind of power, which has nothing more of the moral kind in it, than the action of a watch-maker in taking out of a badly conſtructed watch a ſuperfluous ſpring which prevents the action of the true ſpring. How far the doctrine which draws ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible conſequences, reflects impious diſhonor upon the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would do well ſeriouſly to conſider, who teach it.</p>

conſtantly aſſert that converſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is wrought by light, by the moral power of divine truth and love, as believed and realized. They indeed acknowlege the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and corruption of human nature ſince the fall to be ſuch, that men neither will, nor can, ſo believe and realize goſpel truth as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by its influence, unleſs the Spirit of truth accompany the word and ſpeak it, as it were, to the heart, (which is true): But then the power he exerts is, as they acknowlege, a moral power, i. e. the powerful energy of the Spirit, acting as the Spirit of truth, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love.<note n="*" place="bottom">A gentleman of ſenſe to whom this dialogue was read, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that the apoſtle ſeems to repreſent the power by which men are quickned from the deadneſs of ſin, as of the ſame kind with that by which Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, Eph. 1.18—20. And that in other texts this is ſpoken of as the effect of the <hi>power</hi> of the holy Ghoſt; which ſeems to favor Dr. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker's notion of the power by which men are regenerated. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome others in reading this may have the ſame objection in their thoughts. I therefore remark a little on that text.—The apoſtle there tells the Epheſian churches that he prayed for them, <hi>that the eyes of their underſtanding way be enlightened, that they may know what is the hope of God's calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the ſaints; and what the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us word who believe, (which is) according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Jeſus Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, &amp;c.</hi> It is, I think, very manifeſt that the apoſtle is not ſpeaking of that power which God exerted in quickning them from the moral death of ſin, but of a power which he will hereafter exert in favor to them, thus quickned already; a power like to that by which he raiſed Chriſt from the dead and exalted him to glory, and productive of like effects in them, quickned their mortal bodies, and exalting them to glory with him.— He gives us a perfect explanation of his meaning here, (if it can be thought to need any explanation) in Phil. 3.20, 21 <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſhall change our vile body that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> The moral change of the mind is of an eſſentially different kind from the literal or mechanical change of the body, and is effected by the exertion of a different kind of power.—Each effect requires a power ſuited to its nature: and the power proper to one effect, can never produce the other. To argue from one to the other is therefore idle and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The Spirit of God is poſſeſſed of theſe two different kinds of power, and exerts the one or the other according as he wills to produce a change of the moral or phyſical kind, in moral beings or others.—Exalt the power of the holy Spirit as much as you pleaſe, in effecting the moral change in the ſoul, called regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but then don't confound it with the power exerted upon dead bodies in quickning and glorifying them; but conſider and repreſent it according to its nature, as a moral power, which is he power of goſpel truth and love, applied by the Spirit of truth and love to the ſoul, with his own peculiar energy. This will free us from abundance of confuſion and abſurdity in our thoughts and reaſonings on this ſubject.</note>

               <p>And for this reaſon this carnal temper muſt be mortified, and a better and holy temper introduced into the mind or heart.

God graciouſly ſubdues the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, changes and reconciles the ſoul by letting in the light, and a ſweet, attractive ſenſe of his holy truth and love.

               <p>Firſt, That the general paſſions of love and hatred are indeed "innate, and interwoven with the very frame of our hearts," and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute part of their natural character—That <hi>good</hi> is the natural and right object of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love, and <hi>evil</hi> of hatred—Good may be diſtinguiſhed into two general kinds, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral: ſo may evil.

This faculty is "innate," an eſſential part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution of all intelligent and moral beings, <hi>as ſuch</hi>; and is found in experience, actually exiſting both in righteous and wicked men. On this is founded the principle and power of natural conſcience. Beaſts want this faculty of moral diſcernment, and therefore are naturally incapable of moral government; take, it out of our nature, or ſuppoſe it deſtroyed or inverted in man, and he is as unfit a ſubject of ſuch a government as they.</p>
               <p>From hence it neceſſarily follows, that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and characters which are morally good, when viewed by the mind in their <hi>true light,</hi> or as being what they really are, can't but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear good, amiable, and worthy of eſteem and honor, conſidered abſolutely in themſelves

To ſuppoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is inconſiſtent with the exiſtence and exerciſe of the above-mentioned faculty of diſcerning and diſtinguiſhing between moral good and evil; or otherwiſe, is to ſuppoſe the ſame object, in the ſame view of it, to appear both good and evil, at the ſame time, and for the ſame reaſon; which is abſurd and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. We do in fact ſee things in real life, as this reaſoning ſhews them to be. Nothing is more common than to hear vicious men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the vices in others, which they allow in themſelves, when circumſtances are ſo varied that they don't ſee themſelves in them; and on the other hand, approve and commend thoſe virtues in others which they refuſe to practiſe: and what is more, in their calm and ſerious intervals, they do, and can't but ſecretly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve their own evil conduct and blame themſelves for it, (and would ceaſe from it too if particular luſts did not draw them on) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ancient acknowlegement of the heathen philoſopher, "<hi>I ſee and approve thoſe things which are good, but practiſe thoſe that are

evil.</hi>" Which is a demonſtration that virtue is not hated as virtue, nor vice loved as vice. Vicious men do indeed too often call evil good, and good evil; but this is 'always effected by miſrepreſenting them to themſelves, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with unnatural circumſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make them appear to their minds with a different face from the true.</p>

               <p>Actions, and agents or characters morally good, may be conſidered in a twofold view; either firſt, ſimply, or abſolutely as they are in themſelves: in which view of them, I have ſaid, and I believe proved, that they can't be hated, can't but be approved as right and good by the mind of man, and by all moral beings: —Or ſecondly, they may be conſidered relatively, or as they reſpect us. In this relative view of them, they may poſſibly be hated, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011285_0054_0F869C84945B8858"/>
in fact they too often are, becauſe they militate againſt ſome particular luſt of our's, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſome private intereſt we have much at heart. Thus a man who is guilty of treaſon, ſeeing the equity of the judge's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt another perſon, as a cruel mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, who he has no intereſt in, will very readily approve the judgment, becauſe he ſees the righteouſneſs and equity of it: but let him be arraigned, and upon a fair trial, condemned for his treaſon, and his heart may very poſſibly riſe in enmity againſt his judge, againſt the law, and againſt the king; and perhaps he will puſh his enmity ſo far, if he can, as to dethrone his rightful ſovereign. But what is his enmity levelled againſt? Is it againſt the condemning ſentence ſimply <hi>as righteous</hi>? Not at all: It is againſt it only as militating againſt his life. His love to his life is ſtronger than his regard to righteouſneſs, and ſuppreſſes the acting of that. However, we often ſee the ſenſe of righteouſneſs ſo ſtrong, even in unſanctified minds, under condemnation for their crimes, as to prevent the riſings of this unjuſt enmity, and bring them to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the hands of juſtice. And all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinners are bro't to aſcribe righteouſneſs to the great God, and ſubmit at his foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receive his renewing and pardoning

mercy; (and this Dr. Whitaker owns, and even carries the matter too far) which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be bro't to till they are new made, if the enmity was againſt righteouſneſs for it's own ſake, or as righteous, and innate, and a part of the preſent frame of the human heart, as he repreſents the matter: and ſo he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſays.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>He ſays, p. 15 <q>I firmly believe that no man ever was or will be reconciled to God, till he is brought to approve and willingly ſubmit to that righteouſneſs of God which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs of men, and according to which he will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul or man that doeth evil: Which implies more in it than a bare owning that God is righteous, and will take vengeance on the wicked;— It implies an approbation of, and love to it, ſo as to <hi>delight</hi> in God <hi>on this account,</hi> as well as for his infinite grace, love and mercy to thoſe that are ſaved.</q>

All moral perfections are united in him, and in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible degree; and the natural perfections as united with, and exerted for the purpoſe of diſplaying and exerciſing the moral, are, in this view of them, amiable as well as awful.

He can't then be the object of hatred to any moral being, conſidered ſimply in himſelf; or in other words, his character can't be hated for its own ſake, or as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mind wrong and worthy of diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in its own nature.

               <p>It may be as you ſay, for ought that I know to the contrary; but Dr. Whitaker ſays, p. 13. <q>Is it not very abſurd to ſuppoſe that our native enmity to God ariſes <hi>only</hi> from the apprehenſion of his anger againſt us? If this were true, it would follow that men would have no enmity againſt God or his law, till they come to believe he is angry with them.

               <p>Doubtleſs there is ſuch a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrariety to God and his laws in the hearts of men, ſo far as luſts of ſin rule in them. But then, in this they are contrary to <hi>themſelves,</hi> as well as to God. If they have light in their underſtanding, they diſapprove what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in practiſe, and approve the law as juſt and good, at the ſame time that, for their luſts ſake, they bear partial enmity to it, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011285_0057_0F869C86C1E76958"/>
to them. And if they thus hate the law, they at the ſame time blame and condemn themſelves as acting <hi>wrong</hi> in acting contrary to it; which is a juſtificasion of God and his law, and a demonſtration that this enmity to God is an <hi>intereſted</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> paſſion, and does violence to the moral ſenſe planted in the mind by the hand of the Creator: and herein lies the great malignity of wilful ſin.</p>
               <p>From what has been obſerved on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it follows, that it is not enough to engage a ſinner to love God with a ſupreme practical regard, to ſhew him the character of God, as amiable in itſelf; he muſt alſo be ſhewn how it is conſiſtent with his happineſs, and has a benign aſpect upon him, and how his life and happineſs are connected with his duty to God. 'Tis the great deſign of the goſpel to do both theſe. And when the holy Spirit gives this double view to the mind of a poor ſinner, by the word of the goſpel, and ſrongly impreſſes this ſenſe upon the heart, there needs no more; his enmity dies, ſlain by the moral power of this glorious light of the truth and love of God; his heart is reconciled, and flows out in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring love and praiſe, and diſſolves in genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine repentance: he is a new creature, in the moral ſenſe. This agrees both with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and experience of the holy apoſtles. Paul

               <p>I ſuppoſe he goes into this forced and unjuſt interpretation, of the text, from hard neceſſity: for in the obvious ſenſe of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's words, they oppoſe and overthrow his new ſcheme of doctrine. But I think it is much ſaſer, much better, and more honorable for men to remove their own wrong notions put of the way of the holy apoſtle's, than to compel them to give the way to their upſtart errors. But I return to the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Another conſequence is, that the enmity of man's heart against God is not, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of the "innate," or natural paſſions, "interwoven with the frame of our hearts," as Dr. Whitaker ſays it is; or in other words, it is not one of the <hi>primary</hi> paſſions of human nature in the preſent ſlate of it, but is a <hi>ſecondary</hi> paſſion only, a conſequence and reſult of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011285_0059_0F869C8B8E57AD38"/>
wrong affections, indulged in oppoſition to the law and will of God. Any particular ſinful affection, whether of the ſenſual, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ambitious kind, (of which we have the ſeeds of more than enough in us ever ſince the fall) thus indulged, is practical oppoſition, or enmity, if you pleaſe, to the law of God. And theſe perſiſted in againſt light, will draw after them a higher and more malignant kind of enmity againt God, as ſtanding in the way of ſuch indulged luſts. And in this caſe, if the ſenſe of God's righteouſneſs in oppoſing and condemning the ſinner in his evil way is weak, (as it too commonly is) and the ſenſe of his own faultineſs low and cull, this enmity may flame out dreadfully, and work up to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and curſing: This is the preſent ſtate of devils, and in a ſad degree the caſe of ſome men. But it is a great miſtake to ſuppoſe and teach that things will remain in this horrid confuſion in wicked minds forever, as too many do.—When God comes near to judgment he will reveal his righteouſneſs from heaven, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon all wicked ſouls both of men and devils, ſuch a clear, convincing, ſtrong ſenſe of the equity and fairneſs, and <hi>real kindneſs</hi> of his diſpenſations towards them in their former ſtate of trial, of the heinouſneſs of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of the juſtice and moral neceſſity of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011285_0060_0F869C8C106FB7C8"/>
his preſent ſentence of condemnation, (which impreſſion will never be ſuffered to wear off any more) as will ſo far over ballance their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſelf-love, as to oblige them to juſtify God's character, conduct, and judgment, in word and mind ; and forever ſilence all murmurings, injurious reflections, and hard ſpeeches againſt him, and all blaſphemy and curſings of their Maker: Their rage will then turn inward againſt themſelves, as the flame of a reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting furnace falls with all its force upon the melting metal. This is the view which he who knew gives us of the final condition of loſt ſouls: <hi>There ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and graſhing of teeth,</hi> he tells us; but not a word of blaſphemous rage againſt God. No: Hell will at laſt, in this reſpect, be as ſilent as the grave.</p>
               <p>I obſerved above, that the enmity of ſinful ſouls againſt God's true character is directed againſt it only as relatively conſidered, and is a ſecondary paſſion, which ariſes in the heart in conſequence of men's indulgence of particular luſts, which firſt lead them into a practical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the law and righteous will of God. When the light of truth manifeſts their deeds to be evil and reproves them, and kindly calls them back into the right way, if they ſubmit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011285_0061_0F869C8C82AB0390"/>
oppoſition to God ceaſes, no higher enmity can riſe in their hearts ; their enmity is turned againſt their <hi>own</hi> luſts; But if they refuſe to receive reproof, and perſiſt in their ſins againſt light, the light becomes offenſive, and they hate it, as reproving them; <hi>The ſcorner hateth him that reproveth him.</hi> But ſtill, even in ſpite of themſelves, they do, and can't but ſecretly approve God's character as right and good, whenever they are brought to view it in it's true light; ſuch is the natural and unchangable frame or conſtitution of their ſouls, as intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and moral beings. God has placed in every man's breaſt, and will forever maintain there, a true witneſs for himſelf, and againſt their own wickedneſs ; which will ſpeak, and can't but he regarded as "reproving with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty," whenever the light pf God breaks in upon the mind.<note n="*" place="bottom">A certain gentleman hearing this dialogue read, objected to the that I miſrepreſented the ſentiments of thoſe gentlemen who think with Dr. Whitaker; that he never knew any among them who do not acknowlege a moral conſtitution of nature, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers of reaſon and conſcience. Perhaps ſome others in reading, may make the ſame reflection. For their ſakes, I here give the anſwer I gave him. "It is true they do acknowlege ſuch faculties in human nature; I have not ſaid they do not: But they are inconſiſtent with themſelves, and give ſuch a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the natural enmity of ſhe heart to God's whole cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and all moral excellence, as, if true, neceſſarily implies the deſtruction of natural conſcience" Natural conſcience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implies a faculty by which we diſcern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween moral good or excellence, and its contrary, and that the mind ſeeing this difference approves the good, as excellent, and worthy of eſteem and honor, and diſapproves the evil as wrong, hateful, and blame-worthy. This is abſolutely inconſiſtency with ſuch a kind of enmity, and total want of <q>taste for moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and ulter abhorrence of God's whole character, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the very frame of the heart,</q> as D.

Our Lord repreſented their own wicked character to them, in his parable of the vineyard let out to huſbandmen, in ſuch a manner as to give them a clear and juſt view of it, and at the ſame time to conceal from them their concern in it; and then aſked them, ſaying, <hi>When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to thoſe huſbandmen? They ſay unto him he will</hi> miſerably <hi>deſtroy thoſe</hi> wicked <hi>men,</hi> Mat. 21.40, 41.—They readily ſaw the moral badneſs of their character, and <hi>hated</hi> and condemned it; they ſaw what juſtice required to be done in the caſe, and readily approved it as good and fit. The Lord then applied the parable to them; and they ſeeing their own face in the glaſs, cry out, <hi>God forbid</hi>; and <hi>ſought to lay hold on
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011285_0063_0F869C8E148BE728"/>
him,</hi> and would have immediately ſlain and caſt him out of the vineyard, but <hi>they feared the people.</hi> This is a full teſtimony, and <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> witneſs to the truth of my account of the ſpring and nature of the enmity of wicked hearts againſt God, given to us by the human heart, by human nature itſelf; (and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable more might be produced.) One ſuch witneſs is of more weight than ten thouſand confident aſſertions of ſpeculative men, in contradiction thereto.</p>
               <p>This doctrine concerning the enmity of carnal men againſt God, is further confirmed by this obſervation, which holds univerſally true in fact, viz. Men who hate God, his ways, and righteous ſervants, always miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their characters to themſelves, paint them in falſe and odious colours, and place them in ſuch a wrong view as to make them appear either contemptible, or morally evil: This is the method they always take to juſtify to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves,</hi> well as toothers, their enmity to them; which they would not do if moral rectitude, wiſdom, righteouſneſs and goodneſs, were, in themſelves, objects of their natural hatred; but their hatred would point itſelf directly againſt them, as being what they really are; as in the caſe of natural averſions to ſome particular kinds of food. This hatred of wicked men
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011285_0064_0F869C8F3B273040"/>
againſt God is then an <hi>intereſted</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> affection, taken up in aid and ſupport of ſome carnal luſts and intereſts they are devoted to.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt, who knows all the ſecret ſprings of human paſſions and actions, points out to us the true root and ſpring of this wicked enmity, in ſuch a clear manner as, I think, ought to be deciſive, when he ſays, ſpeaking of the wicked who ſhall be condemned, <hi>Men loved darkneſs rather than light,</hi> (whence this abſurd and monſtrous preference of darkneſs to light?) <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> Particular wrong affections and ſinfill paſſions, firſt draw men away to do evil, (theſe paſſions, in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its preſent ſtate, will act wrong and be ſprings of evil works, till the truth and grace of God rectify their diſorders, and take them under their lead) and then for their luſts ſake, and with a view to juſtify and quiet themſelves in their evil ways, they <hi>love darkneſs rather than light. For every one that doeth evil</hi> (with habitual wilfulneſs) <hi>hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> or diſcovered to himſelf to be what they really are, in their nature and tendency. For then he muſt be ſtrongly ſelf-condemned, and filled with fear; which wicked men will avoid as long as they can They therefore hate the light, juſt as every judge, who has taken a bribe,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011285_0065_0F869C9067627560"/>
hateth the light of righteouſneſs, and him that diſcovers and reproves him for his bribery and corruption. Ahab expreſſed the very ſoul of this wicked, intereſted enmity when he ſaid to the King of Judah, ſpeaking of Michajah, <hi>I hate him, for he doth not propheſy good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, but evil.</hi> Had we Michajah's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as drawn by Ahab, doubtleſs it would be a very bad one. The wilful miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which wicked men make to themſelves of God's character and works, their evil ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and blaſphemies of him, are a full evidence that their enmity againſt him is initereſted, not ſuch as Dr. Whitaker and ſome others repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it. No man ever did ſpeak evil of God's ways, viewing them as they truly are, as equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and good, but as placing them in a wrong light to themſelves. When they are obliged to ſee them as they are, they are reduced to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, can object nothing to them, but juſtify and approve them as right, and condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe are not idle and arbitrary ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but obſervations grounded upon facts and experience of the workings of the human heart in real life.</p>
               <p>Our Lord directs his diſciples ſaying, <hi>Let your light ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</hi> Now, according to the notion under

cenſure, the more clearly the light ſhines and is ſeen by men, the more furiouſly does their enmity flame and rage againſt God and thoſe that bear his image. This is a way of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God which Jeſus Chriſt never adviſed his diſciples to ſtir men up to.</p>

               <p>Many very honeſt and good people bave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complained of the workings of a ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and hard thoughts of God, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings againſt him; which does not, like that we have been diſcourſing upon, ariſe out of the wickedneſs of the heart, but is wholly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by miſrepreſentations of the character and ways of God to the mind, and falſe and wrong views of him, which have unhappily gotten poſſeſſion of the mind, and are ſuppoſed, thro' ignorance and wrong inſtruction, to be the true and genuine views of his character and works. In the light wherein they view them, they appear morally evil, wrong, and objects of juſt hatred. The enmity which the mind conceives againſt them, viewed in this wrong light, is, in a proper ſenſe, a natural enmity; that is, it ariſes from the moral frame of the mind, and the innate ſenſe of the hatefulneſs
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011285_0068_0F869C93C460DD68"/>
of actions and characters morally, evil and wrong. And if the heart is gracious, this ſenſe is greatly heightened. This kind of enmity is, in no true conſtruction, a hatred of God's true character, which may be heartily approved and loved at the ſame time; but only of a really bad character, falſely aſcribed to him, merely thro' ignorance, miſtake and miſinformation. This may be illuſtrated by the caſe of a child educated abroad, who has inſtilled into his mind, perhaps by the fooliſh tattle of his nurſe or ſchoolmaſter, very wrong and injurious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his father's character, and temper, and deſigns towards him; repreſenting of him as very unreaſonable, arbitrary and cruel, or falſe and hypocritical towards him; whereas, in truth, he is quite the revſrſe. This wrong view raiſes in the child diſiffection, and hard and blaming tho'ts. His father, who knows the caſe, pities him, conſidering it as ignorance and error, not malice againſt his true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—The true and effectual cure of this kind of enmity, is accompliſhed by correcting theſe unhappy miſapprehenſions, and giving the mind a juſt view of the true character of God, and ſetting his actions and diſpenſations in that true light wherein he himſelf has placed them.</p>

inſtructed in the character and diſpenſations of that great and glorious God and Saviour, who you are, by the duty of your office, to make known to others. I don't know how honeſt men can eaſily forgive you, if by your ignorant and preſumptuous miſrepreſentations of the great Lord and Father of the univerſe, you miniſter to them the occaſion of hard and injurious tho'ts of him, whom they ought to adore and bleſs continually, with all humility and joyfulneſs.</p>

               <p>What you now obſerve if worthy is four moſt ſerious conſideration. But our hearers ought not to receive implicitly, with a lazy credulity, all that their teachers ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, but to ſtudy the word of God with humility and prayer; where they may hear God himſelf teaching the good knowlege of himſelf. But I am very apprehenſive, that after all our care and ſtudy, we <hi>all,</hi> both teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and hearers, ſhall ſtill need to have great allowances made by the heavenly father, for our weakneſſes and miſapprehenſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and his diſpenſations towards man, in too many inſtances; and be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure liable to the rebuke God himſelf gave to Job's friends, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken the thing that is right concerning me.</hi> Yet, if we have not ſpoken and reaſoned wrong, careleſſly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011285_0070_0F869C9588B6A2F8"/>
and in the pride of our hearts, or as ſeeking to pleaſe men and gain their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or to ſhelter ourſelves from their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleafure, or through covetouſneſs, or any biaſing luſt; but in ſimplicity, through weakneſs, and pitiable miſtake; this is the ſupport of our hope, that one greater than Job is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pray for us.</p>
