         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN Purſuance of your Inſtructions, as ſoon as I was informed of the <hi>Indians</hi> being come to <hi>John Harris</hi>'s, I ſet off from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to meet them, and arrived at <hi>John Harris</hi>'s the 29th of <hi>March, 1757,</hi> where I met about One Hundred and Sixty <hi>Indians,</hi> Men, Women and Children, Part of eight Tribes.</p>
               <p>The Thirtieth, I examined <hi>Joſeph Peepy,</hi> and <hi>Lewis Montour,</hi> in regard to the Meſſages I had ſent by them to the <hi>Saſquchannah Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They informed me, that <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was gone to the <hi>Seneca</hi> Country, to get a Number of the <hi>Senecas</hi> to come down with him; and they delivered me a Belt of Wampum ſent me by <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> in Return of mine ſent him by them; by which Belt he informs me, that he will be down as ſoon as poſſible, with Two Hundred <hi>Indians,</hi> but could not tell, whether he would come in at <hi>Eaſton</hi> or at <hi>John Harris</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The remaining Part of this Day I ſpent in getting what Intelligence I could of the Strength of the <hi>French</hi> on <hi>Ohio,</hi> and the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> and by the beſt Accounts I can get, I find the <hi>French</hi> have not had above Three Hundred Men in Garriſon at <hi>Ohio</hi> this Winter, and that the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> on <hi>Ohio</hi> were divided amongſt themſelves, one Half of each Tribe going down <hi>Ohio</hi> to where the Lower <hi>Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> are ſettled, and the other Half were determined to go off to the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am informed, that all the <hi>Saſquehanna Indians</hi> are diſpoſed for Peace, except the <hi>Munſeys,</hi> or <hi>Miniſink Indians;</hi> yet I underſtand that a Number of them will be down with <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am informed, by a <hi>Six Nation Indian,</hi> one of Reputation amongſt them, that reſided at <hi>Diahago,</hi> that as ſoon as <hi>Joſeph Peepy</hi> and <hi>Lewis Montour</hi> had delivered their Meſſage there, the Council, that Night, diſpatched two Men to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> to inform the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> living there, of this Meeting, deſiring ſome of them to come to it; but if none of them ſhould chuſe to come, theſe Meſſengers were then to inſiſt that none of the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> living on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> ſhould come to War againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> till this Meeting was over, and they have Time, after returning Home, to let them know how it ended:</p>

               </p>
               <p>With this Belt of Wampum I wipe the Blood off the Seats round your Council Fire, that your old Men at this critical Juncture, when convened in Council, may ſit with Comfort, and direct their Warriors with Wiſdom.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I have wiped the Blood off the Seats round your Council Fire, I, with theſe Strouds, wrap up the Bodies of your deceaſed Friends, and bury them decently, covering their Graves with theſe Blankets and Halfthicks.</p>

               <p>As the Blood is wiped off the Seats of your Counſellors, the Dead decently buried, and their Graves covered, I, with this Belt of Wampum, wipe the Tears from your Eyes, and deſire you may mourn no more.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now wipe the Sweat off your Bodies after your long Journey, and bid you a hearty Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to this Government in the Name of your Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>I embrace this Opportunity of acquainting you, that laſt Year your Brother <hi>Onas</hi> held two Conferences at <hi>Eaſton</hi> with your Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and your Brethren the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> that live on <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> in order to ſettle the Differences ſubſiſting between them and us; but as that good Work could not be accompliſhed at that Time, they agreed to have a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Spring to finally ſettle all Differences ſubſiſting between them and us their Brethren: And that this Meeting might be the more general, I diſpatched Meſſengers up <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> and to <hi>Ohio,</hi> and I wrote to your Brother, Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> deſiring him to requeſt a Number of you our Brethren, the <hi>Six United Nations,</hi> to be preſent at this Meeting, who I am heartily glad to ſee here; and when your Nephews and Brothers arrive, I am in great Hopes, by your Aſſiſtance, to be able to accommodate Matters to the mutual Satisfaction of both them and us their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the ſeveral Governments.</p>
               <p>And by this Belt of Wampum, I requeſt you to make uſe of all your Intereſt with your Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> to bring about an Accommodation between them and us, that the Sun may once more ſhine upon us in Peace, and that the Peace may laſt as long as the Sun, the Moon and the Stars give Light.</p>

This Evening I had a Meeting of the Sachems, and propoſed the Going to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to hold the Treaty; but I could prevail on none of them, except the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> to go there; the reſt were afraid of Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>When I found they were not to be prevailed on to go there, I called a Council, and, with a Belt of Wampum, I removed the Council Fire to <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> to which Place they all agreed to go, and wait the Arrival of <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> with the <hi>Senecas, Delawares,</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt, to remove the Council Fire to</hi> Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the 7th, I arrived at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> from <hi>John Harris</hi>'s; from whence Mr. <hi>Shippen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boude,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cane,</hi> with a Number of other Gentlemen, Inhabitants of that Borough, went out with me to meet the <hi>Indians</hi> (who I had left a few Miles behind) to bid them welcome to <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Indians</hi> were ſettled at the Place taken for them by <hi>James Wright,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> I then kindled a ſmall Fire for them to ſit by till they ſhould hear from their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> of the Arrival of <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the 10th, I received a Letter from his Honour the Governor, acquainting me of the Arrival of Fifty <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> at <hi>Fort-Allen,</hi> and that they were ordered to wait there the Arrival of <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> who were coming with him.</p>
               <p>I immediately ordered a Meeting of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and acquainted them with what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor had wrote me about the Arrival of the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> at <hi>Fort-Allen,</hi> which was very agreeable to them.</p>
               <p>I then acquainted them, by a Belt of Wampum, that their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> had prepared a very convenient Place for them within a Mile of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and that he propoſed to hold the Conference at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as Teedyuſcung had, at the laſt Treaty at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> given his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Governor a Promiſe to come to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this Spring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Indians, <hi>after conſidering what had been ſaid to them, returned the following Anſwer.</hi>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Preſence of Mr. <hi>James Webb,</hi> which was well received by them.</p>
               <p>After the Goods were divided, the Chiefs of the ſeveral Tribes came in a Body, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thanks to the Government for the Cloathing they had received.</p>
               <p>The 13th, the ſeveral Chiefs came to me, and told me, they obſerved that I gave no Cloathing to our Brothers the <hi>Conneſtogoes,</hi> and deſired that I would give them ſome, elſe they ſhould be obliged to give them Part of what had been given them.</p>

                  <hi>April</hi> the 26th, <hi>Scarroyady,</hi> with a Party of <hi>Mohawk</hi> Warriors, came and told me that they were apprehenſive the <hi>French</hi> would make ſome Attempt againſt <hi>Fort-Auguſta,</hi> and deſired I would fit them out to go there; to which I agreed, giving them Orders to reconnoitre the adjacent Woods, for a few Days, then to proceed towards the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and to reconnoitre the Country well as they went, and if they diſcovered any Body of <hi>French,</hi> or Parties of <hi>Indians,</hi> coming towards <hi>Fort-Auguſta,</hi> or any Part of this or the neighbouring Governments, they were immediately to return and give Notice to the Commanding Officer at <hi>Fort-Auguſta,</hi> or to the Commanding Officer of the Fort nigheſt to that Part of the Country where they ſhould come into.</p>
               <p>The 26th of <hi>April, P. M.</hi> the Chiefs of the ſeveral Tribes called a Meeting, and ſent for me, and deſired to know what Time they might expect their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> up, and their Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> to hold the Conference.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwered, I had not yet received any certain Account of the Arrival of the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> and until the Governor had fixed the Place and Time of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> I could not give them a full Anſwer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have been here a great while, and the Spring is coming on faſt: It is Time for us to think of going Home to plant. We have heard what you have ſaid to us from our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> both at <hi>John Harris</hi>'s and here, that our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> propoſed to hold the Treaty at <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> Every Time you ſpoke to us upon that Head, we gave you our Objections againſt going ſo far down, which we expected would have been conſidered before now; but as our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> has not yet agreed to come here, we have determined in our own Minds to treat with our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> here, and go no further down the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have appointed three Men to go to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to ſpeak with our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> and requeſt of him to come up, and we deſire you will find Horſes for them to ride down, and a Man to go with them to the Governor.</p>
               <p>And we have appointed three more to go and meet our Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> and bring them here, and we deſire you will find them Horſes, and a Man to go and take Care of them, and provide Neceſſaries for them on the Road.</p>

About two Hours afterwards, Captain M'Kee returned from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who were ſent down to the Governor to invite him here to hold the Conference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 6th, I called a Meeting of the Chiefs of the ſeveral Tribes, when <hi>William Logan,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Member of his Honour the Governor's Council, returned the Governor's Anſwer to the Meſſage ſent him by <hi>Thomas King,</hi> and <hi>Rut King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, the Deputies of the</hi> Six United Nations, <hi>and your Couſins and Brethren the</hi> Delawares.</p>
               <p>I am ſent to you by your Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as a Member of his Council, and your very good Friend, and I deſire you will attend to what I am now going to ſay to you, and conſider my Words as if they were ſpoken by <hi>Onas</hi> himſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A few Days ſince, <hi>Thomas King,</hi> and <hi>Rut King,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Thomas M'Kee,</hi> as their Guide, came to me in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and informed me, by this Belt of Wampum, that you held a Council Fire at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and had ſent for our Friend <hi>George Croghan</hi> to it, and had made a Speech to him; in which you acquainted him, that on his Invitation you came to <hi>John Harris</hi>'s, underſtanding the Council Fire was to be kindled there; that after you had ſtaid there ſome Time, you were deſired to accompany him to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and that I would meet you there; that therefore you had appointed theſe two <hi>Indians</hi> to wait on me, and to take me by the Hand, and invite me to your Council; that you had determined among your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to come no further, and would be glad to ſee me, and that my coming would rejoice your Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt be very ſenſible, that in the tranſacting Publick Affairs, in theſe troubleſome Times, many Difficulties and unforeſeen Accidents happen which require my particular At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> this is my preſent Caſe. And as <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> the Chief of the <hi>Delawares,</hi> our Countryman, and your Couſin, with ſome other Chiefs and Head Men of that Nation, has ſent me lately a Meſſage, acquainting me, that he was on his Way, with a great Number of <hi>Indians,</hi> coming to meet me, in order to finiſh the Treaty of Peace begun laſt Year by our late Governor and myſelf with the ſaid Chiefs, and deſired me to be ready with my Counſellors to aſſiſt in finiſhing the ſaid Treaty which was ſo happily begun, and that I would be ſo kind as to ſend for <hi>Moſes Tatamy,</hi> and <hi>John Pumpſhire</hi> (two <hi>Delaware In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Interpreters) from the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> to be preſent; and that as there was ſo great a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> who were coming with him, they would want Proviſions on their Way, and deſired I would ſend ſome to <hi>Wyoming</hi> for them, which I immediately complied with. Theſe, Brethren, have been the Reaſons for my delaying my Journey to meet you at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and for my deſiring <hi>George Croghan</hi> would endeavour to prevail on you our Brethren to come to the Council Fire at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where the old wiſe People, who are your hearty Friends, would have been exceeding glad to ſee you; and as I have heard nothing from <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> very lately, I am uneaſy left ſome Accident has happened to him. I thank you very kindly for your affectionate Invitation: I accept of it, and will, with great Pleaſure, come and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with you at your Council Fire at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 9th, three of the Meſſengers I ſent to the <hi>Ohio</hi> returned, and make the following Report.</p>
               <p>That on their Arrival at <hi>Venango</hi> (an old <hi>Indian</hi> Town) on <hi>Ohio,</hi> they found ſeveral of the <hi>Delawares</hi> there, one, named <hi>Caſtalago,</hi> their Chief. They immediately called a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and delivered the Speeches ſent by them, which were very well received by the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares;</hi> who told them, in Anſwer, That they would accept of the Invitation, and come down with them; but that they muſt firſt go and conſult their Uncles the <hi>Senecas,</hi> who lived further up the River. The next Day they ſet off to a little Town further up the River <hi>Ohio,</hi> where they ſummoned a Number of the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Senecas</hi> together. After repeating the Meſſages over, one of the <hi>Senecas,</hi> named <hi>Gariſtagee,</hi> one of the Chiefs, ſaid to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawares;</hi> Nephews, You muſt not accept of that Call, for the Belts which are ſent you are not proper Belts on this Occaſion. I know <hi>George Croghan</hi> very well, and would be very glad to ſee him; and if he will ſend a proper Belt, with Men wrought in it, for the ſeveral Tribes he wants to meet with (himſelf taking us by the Hand) made of old Council Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum, which is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> on theſe Occaſions, I will go down with you and ſee him: To which the <hi>Delawares</hi> agreed, and then returned the Belts.</p>
               <p>They ſay that one of the Meſſengers proceeded further, to where the <hi>Delawares,</hi> that lived formerly at <hi>Kittanning,</hi> were now ſettled, on <hi>Beaver-Creek,</hi> with a View of finding out the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007920_0008_102E016FA6546890"/>of them; and they expect he will be ſoon down, if not killed. Theſe Meſſengers ſay, that there were but fifteen <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at <hi>Venango,</hi> and that the Fort there is very weak; and that the <hi>Indians</hi> in them Parts are very much diſtreſſed for Proviſions.</p>
               <p>They ſay that the <hi>Ohio Indians</hi> are much afraid of the Southern <hi>Indians,</hi> having been ſtruck three Times by them this Spring, twice near <hi>Fort Du Queſne,</hi> and once at the <hi>Logs-Town;</hi> and that the <hi>Indians</hi> are moving faſt up the <hi>Ohio</hi> towards the <hi>Senecas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They heard from the <hi>Indians</hi> there, that the <hi>French</hi> were defeated at <hi>Fort William-Henry,</hi> and that there was another Party defeated by Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> at the <hi>German-Flats;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> were determined yet to make another Trial againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but that they could not tell where they intended to ſtrike next.</p>
               <p>They ſay the two Men killed at Fort <hi>Auguſta,</hi> were killed by the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which was the only Party of <hi>Delawares</hi> or <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> that has come againſt us this Spring; that the other Parties that have been on the Frontiers of this and the neighbouring Provinces, were <hi>Indians</hi> from over the Lakes; that the <hi>Delawares</hi> made great Game of the Lake <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and told thoſe Meſſengers, that one Party of them, who had been down, had, on their Return, killed and eat three of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, for want of Food; that there was an Account came there whilſt they were at <hi>Venango,</hi> that the <hi>French Conewagas</hi> had differed with the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe the <hi>French</hi> would not ſupply them with Proviſions; the Difference roſe ſo high at laſt, that they came to Blows; that Sixty of the <hi>Conewagas</hi> were killed, and a great Number of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I quere the Truth of this News, as the <hi>French</hi> undoubtedly know their Intereſt too well to differ with the <hi>Conewagas</hi> at this Time.</p>
               <p>Theſe Meſſengers, on their Return, touched at <hi>Diabogo,</hi> where they met with <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> who enquired of them what they had been doing at <hi>Ohio;</hi> they repeated over to him the Meſſages that had been ſent by them from this Government, and the Anſwer they had received from the <hi>Ohio Indians;</hi> on which <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſent the following Meſſage by them to their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOU have been at a great deal of Trouble in ſending Meſſages to us, your Brothers the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> but the Perſons you employed are young Warriors, and not Counſellors, thereſore unſit for ſuch Buſineſs; likewiſe the Belts you have ſent, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, are no more than Strings; but if you will ſend to call us together, and ſend proper Belts, and wiſe Men to take us by the Hand, we will come down with them, and give you a Meeting. In which Meeting I hope we ſhall ſettle all Differences ſubſiſting between us; and I aſſure you, by this Belt of Wampum, that our Minds are well diſpoſed, and that our Hearts are warm and true towards you our Brothers the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and we deſire that you, as Meſſengers from our Brothers, may take this Belt to Capt. <hi>Thomas M'Kee,</hi> and let him deliver it in our Name to our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> and <hi>George Croghan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave the Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Thing that gives us a great deal of Concern, which is, our Fleſh and Blood that lives among you at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> being kept as if they were Priſoners. We formerly applied to the Miniſter at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to let our People come back at Times and hunt, which is the chief Induſtry we follow to maintain our Families; but that Miniſter has not liſtened to what we have ſaid to him, and it is very hard that our People have not the Liberty of coming back to the Woods, where Game is plenty, and to ſee their Friends.</p>
               <p>They have complained to us, that they cannot hunt where they are; and if they go into the Woods, and cut down a Tree, they are abuſed for it, notwithſtanding that very Land we look upon to be our own; and we hope, Brothers, that you will conſider this Matter, and let our People come into the Woods, and viſit their Friends, and paſs and repaſs, as Brothers ought to do.</p>

               <p>By the Mediation of Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> His Majeſty's ſole Agent and Superintendent of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs for the Northern Diſtrict of <hi>America,</hi> a Ceſſation of Arms was agreed upon, and they, at a Conference held in <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> promiſed to lay down their Hatchet; which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they ſince ratified and confirmed in another Conference with that Gentleman in your Preſence; at which Time Sir <hi>William</hi> deſired to know what was the Cauſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Hoſtilities on their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which Queſtion they did not then give a full Anſwer to. But at a ſubſequent Treaty with me at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> laſt, the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being put to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> he frankly acknowledged that their fooliſh young Men, being deluded by our Enemy, the falſe hearted <hi>French</hi> King, were perſwaded to take up the Hatchet againſt us. This, he ſaid, was the firſt and principal Cauſe; but that one Reaſon why the Blow fell the heavier on us was, that their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> had fraudulently poſſeſſed himſelf of ſome of their Lands, without having firſt purchaſed, or given any Conſideration for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being very deſirous that all Cauſes of Diſcontent ſhould be removed, I propoſed that the Matter ſhould then be finally accommodated; but <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> declaring, that he was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007920_0010_102E0172EAD41C80"/>impowered to finiſh that Buſineſs, declined it, and deſired another Meeting this Spring, when he engaged to bring with him thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> to whom the ſaid Lands belonged, at which Time this Complaint might be fully heard, and amicably adjuſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having the greateſt Confidence in the Friendſhip and Juſtice of our Brethren the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> I immediately acquainted Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> with theſe Proceedings, and requeſted that he would be pleaſed to ſend ſome of the wiſe Men of thoſe Nations to be preſent and aſſiſt at the propoſed Meeting. I expected <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> would have been here before this Time, and am greatly concerned at his Stay.</p>
               <p>It would afford me great Satisfaction, if it had ſuited your Conveniency to wait his Arrival; but as you have informed me your Buſineſs will not admit of being longer abſent from your Country, if you can now think of any Meaſure that may be likely to promote the good Work in which we are engaged, and eſtabliſh a firm and laſting Friendſhip between us and your Nephews, you ſhall find me ſincerely diſpoſed to join with you in doing every Thing in my Power conducive to ſo deſirable an End. In Confirmation whereof, I give you this Belt of thirteen Rows.</p>

                  <hi>Gave the Belt.</hi>

               <p>Little Abraham <hi>opened the Meeting, addreſſing himſelf to the Governor as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER you had done ſpeaking to us Yeſterday, you left the Appointing the Time for the next Meeting to us. We are now met in Council, and I deſire you to liſten to what we are going to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas King</hi> then got up, and repeated over the two firſt Speeches made to them by the Governor Yeſterday, and returned his Honour Thanks, for acquainting them with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances that happened during the Courſe of the Conference at <hi>Eaſton</hi> laſt Fall, between his Honour and the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> and expreſſed the great Satisfaction it gave them to hear that their Brother <hi>Onas</hi> was to fortunate as to find out the true Cauſes from whence the Difference aroſe between their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and their Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> for that they had taken a great Deal of Pains to find it out without Succeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> then addreſſed himſelf to the Governor, and ſaid, he hoped, that if they ſhould make any Blunders, or have forgot any Part of the Speech, he would excuſe them, as they could not write; therefore were obliged to keep every Thing in their Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little Abraham</hi> then deſired the Governor to give Attention, as they were going to return an Anſwer to his Honour's laſt Speech; and after he had repeated over the laſt Speech deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them by the Governor Yeſterday, he ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You deſired our Advice in Regard to the Differences that aroſe between you and our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> and you deſired us to give you our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007920_0011_102E01752C020978"/>which would be the beſt Method now to purſue to bring about an Accommodation: We have conſidered what you required of us. Brothers, We are diſappointed, by the Heads of our Relations not coming to this Meeting; it was on their Account that we met our Brothers at this Time.—If they had come here at this Time, we ſhould have ſat ſtill, and heard the Complaints on each Side, then we ſhould have been the better able to judge who was in the Fault, and would have given our Opinion freely: However, as Things now ſtand, we muſt inform you, our Brothers, That in the Time of our Great-Grand-Fathers, and when the <hi>Six Nations</hi> firſt united, it was agreed that the <hi>Seneca</hi> Country ſhould be the Door to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> into which all Meſſengers ſhould paſs in Time of War, and there deliver their Meſſages, and the <hi>Senecas,</hi> our Brothers, were to forward the Meſſages to all the <hi>United Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Differences ſubſiſting at preſent between you and our Nephews and Brothers, we have heard nothing from that Quarter, though we are ſenſible that Meſſengers arrived there upon this Affair. And as we, the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> are a Door to the Eaſtward of the <hi>Six Nation</hi> Country, eſtabliſhed at the ſame time with that to the Weſtward, finding that they neglected their Offices, we took the Affair in Hand, and ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> and there a Council was held, and the Deputies we ſent charged them to get ſober, as we looked upon their Actions as the Actions of drunken Men: This was the Subſtance of the Speeches ſent to them.—They returned for anſwer, That they looked upon themſelves as Men, and would acknowledge no Superiority that any other Nation had over them.—We are Men, and are determined not to be ruled any longer by you as Women; and we are determined to cut off all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> except thoſe that may make their Eſcape from us in Ships; ſo ſay no more to us on that Head, leſt we cut off your private Parts, and make Women of you, as you have done of us. In the mean time, though they did not any longer acknowledge the <hi>Six Nations</hi> as their Uncles, yet they would liſten to what <hi>Anugh Kary Tany Tionen Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowy</hi> ſhould ſay to them.—Him only they acknowledged for their Uncle.—Notwithſtanding this raſh Speech, they afterwards, at the Inſtance of Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> agreed to a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms, to come to an Interview with him and their Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Brother, our Advice is to you, that you ſend proper Meſſengers immediately to the <hi>Senecas,</hi> to invite them, with our Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> to a Meeting with you here; and when they come, be very careful in your Proceedings with them, and do not be raſh, and it will be in your Power to ſettle all the Differences ſubſiſting betwen you and them: And we aſſure you, Brethren, by this Belt of Wampum, that we will continue our good Offices till this Affair is brought to a happy Concluſion.</p>

We look upon your informing us of that cloſe Connection, at preſent ſubſiſting between your Couſins and the <hi>Seneca</hi> Nations, of which we were till now ignorant, as the greateſt Mark of your Regard and Eſteem for us.—Brothers, Your Advice is good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and I ſhall, in Purſuance of it, ſend an Invitation to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> to come down, and leave it entirely to his Choice to bring with him ſuch and ſo many of his Uncles, and others his Friends, as he thinks proper, and will then cautiouſly and carefully purſue your Advice in treating with them.</p>

               <p>I DESIRE to be informed if you have any Complaints againſt this Province, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Purchaſes of Land, or for any other Cauſe whatſoever: In Expectation that you would freely open your Hearts to me on theſe Heads, I give you this Belt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I then acquainted the <hi>Indians</hi> by the Interpreter, that I was going to ſpeak to them in Behalf of the Honourable Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> Baronet, His Majeſty's ſole Agent and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent of the Affairs of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and their Allies and Dependents, and deſired them to conſider my Words as if ſpoken by himſelf.</p>

               <p>As Deputies from moſt of the Tribes of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> are now here, who may not be preſent when <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> comes down, and as I am ordered and required by the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> Baronet, His Majeſty's chief Agent and Superintendent of the Affairs of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> their Allies and Dependents, to enquire into and hear the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and, if juſtly grounded, to uſe my utmoſt Endeavours to get them redreſſed, I do inſiſt upon it, that you open your Hearts to me without Reſerve, and inform me of every Thing you know concerning Frauds complained of by <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> or any other Injuries or Injuſtice done to you, or any of the Tribes of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> or other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in Alliance with His Majeſty King GEORGE, in this or the neighbouring Colonies, that I may be thereby enabled to repreſent the true State of your Grievances to His Majeſty.—Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, after this candid Conduct towards you, and my thus preſſing you to open your Minds to me, I do expect that you will hide nothing from me, but ſpeak from the Bottom of your Hearts: And I expect that you will recommend it to your Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> to come down and give your Brother <hi>Onas</hi> a Meeting, to make their Complaints appear, and have them adjuſted, elſe I ſhall take it for granted that they have no juſt Cauſe of Complaint: To inforce what I have ſaid, I give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren of the</hi> United Nations,</p>
               <p>You remember that your Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with you at <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> promiſed to lay down their Hatchet, and in a ſubſequent Meeting with Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> at his Houſe, in <hi>July</hi> laſt, ratified and confirmed it in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Manner in your Preſence; then promiſing to deliver up all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners that were by any Means brought to their Country, or in their Poſſeſſion; and I deſire that on your Return to your Country, you will remind your Nephews and Brothers of their Promiſes to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and recommend it ſtrongly to them to bring down what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners they have amongſt them, and deliver them up, as that is the only Proof they can give us of their Sincerity and good Diſpoſition towards us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sachems and Warriors of the</hi> United Nations,</p>
               <p>In that Meeting with your Brother <hi>Warraigheyagey,</hi> your Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> renewed and brightened the Chain of Friendſhip between them and us, and promiſed to fix their Eyes on you their Uncles, and regulate their Conduct by yours; and at the ſame time declared, in a publick Manner, by dancing, and ſinging the War Song, that they would turn the Edge of their Hatchet, in Conjunction with you their Uncles the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> the treacherous and faithleſs Invaders of the Property of Mankind. And I muſt now deſire that you will inſiſt upon their being ready, when called upon, to join His Majeſty's Troops, in Conjunction with you our Friends and Allies, againſt our common Enemy.—That this Speech may have its full Force upon your Minds, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a War Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Little Abraham <hi>then ſpoke as follows.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Speeches you have juſt made are of great Conſequence both to you and us.—We ſhall duly conſider them, and, as ſoon as poſſibly we can, we will return you an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May 18, 1757.</hi> This Day four Perſons that were killed on the Frontiers, in the Settlement of <hi>Swetara,</hi> by the Enemy <hi>Indians,</hi> were brought to this Town.—In the Afternoon the chief <hi>Sachems,</hi> with a Number of their Warriors, called a Meeting in the <hi>Indian</hi> Camp, and ſpoke to us as follows.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We have called this Meeting with Tears in our Eyes, on Account of ſeeing ſo many of our Brethren killed by the evil Spirit; and we take this Opportunity, as we have a good deal of Buſineſs yet to do, to wipe the Tears from your Eyes, ſo that To-morrow, when we meet in Council, we may ſee each other with the ſame Good-will we have hitherto done.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>

               <p>Now we have wiped the Tears from your Eyes, agreeable to the antient Cuſtom of our Forefathers, we clean the Blood off your Council Seats, that you may ſit with Comfort, and hear what we have to ſay to you. No Doubt but the <hi>French</hi> King, who takes delight in Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, has taken this Opportunity to ſend his Children down to commit theſe Murders, with Expectation of breeding a difference between you our Brethren and us; but we deſire you will hold faſt by the Chain of Friendſhip ſubſiſting between us, and diſappoint him in his Deſigns.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EACH of you made us a Speech Yeſterday on the ſame Subject; both which Speeches I now propoſe to anſwer at once, and then ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>Brothers,</p>
               <p>Some Years ago, in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> one of the Head Men of the <hi>Delawares</hi> had been out a Hunting.—On his Return, he called to ſee a Gentleman, a great Friend of his, one of your People, who he found in his Field: When the Gentleman ſaw him he came to meet him. It was rainy Weather, and the <hi>Delaware</hi> Chief had his Gun under his Arm.—They met at a Fence, and as they reached out their Hands to each other, the <hi>Delaware</hi>'s Gun went off by Accident, and ſhot him dead. He was very much grieved at the Accident, and went to the Houſe, and told the Gentleman's Wife what had happened, and ſaid he was willing to die, and did not chooſe to live after his Friend. She immediately ſent for a Number of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.—When they were gathered, ſome ſaid it was an Accident, and could not be helped; but the greateſt Number were for hanging him, and he was taken by the Sheriff, and carried to <hi>Amboy,</hi> where he was tried, and hanged.—There was another Misfortune that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—A Party of <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> who were going to War againſt their Enemies, in their Way through <hi>Carolina,</hi> called at a Houſe, not ſuſpecting any Harm, as they were amongſt their Friends, a Number of the Inhabitants roſe and took them Priſoners, on Account of ſome Miſchief that was done there about that Time, ſuſpecting them to be the People that had done the Miſchief, and carried them to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> and put them in Priſon, where the chief Man, called <hi>The Pride,</hi> died.—The Relations of theſe People were much exaſperated againſt you our Brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on Account of the ill Treatment you gave their Friends, and have been continually ſpiriting up their Nations to take Revenge—Brothers, you deſired us to open our Hearts, and inform you of every Thing we knew that might give
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007920_0015_102E017DEBC57D78"/>Riſe to the Quarrel between you and our Nephews and Brothers.—We muſt now inform you, that in former Times our Forefathers conquered the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and put Petticoats on them.—A long Time after that they lived among you our Brothers, but upon ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between you and them, we thought proper to remove them, giving them Lands to plant and hunt on at <hi>Wyoming</hi> and <hi>Juniata,</hi> on <hi>Saſquehannah.</hi>—But you, covetous of Land, made Plantations there, and ſpoiled their hunting Grounds; they then complained to us, and we looked over thoſe Lands, and found their Complaints to be true. At this Time they carried on a Correſpondence with the <hi>French,</hi> by which Means the <hi>French</hi> became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Cauſes of Complaint they had againſt you; and as your People were daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their Settlements, by this Means you drove them back into the Arms of the <hi>French,</hi> and they took the Advantage of ſpiriting them up againſt you, by telling them; "Children, you ſee, and we have often told you, how the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> your Brethren, would ſerve you; they plant all the Country, and drive you back; ſo that in a little Time you will have no Land: It is not ſo with us; though we build Trading-Houſes on your Land, we do not plant it; we have our Proviſions from over the great Water."—We have opened our Hearts, and told you what Complaints we have heard that they had againſt you; and our Advice to you is, that you ſend for the <hi>Senecas</hi> and them; treat them kindly, and rather give them ſome Part of their Fields back again than differ with them.—It is in your Power to ſettle all the Differences with them if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave two Belts, one for Sir</hi> William Johnſon, <hi>and one for the Governor</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Little Abraham <hi>ſpoke again as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what paſſed between you and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> laſt Fall, reſpecting the Purchaſe of Lands we know nothing of;—they are not here, and if we enquire, we can only hear what you ſay on that Head.—We ſhould have been glad our Nephews the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and Brothers the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> had been here at this Time, that we might have heard the Complaints on both Sides; then we ſhould have been able to judge who was in the Fault, and we are determined to ſee Juſtice done to the Party aggrieved.—As they are not here, we can ſay nothing about it; but you yourſelves, between whom the Buſineſs was tranſacted, muſt be the beſt Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You acquaint us there are certain Perſons empowered by the King to purchaſe Lands here from the <hi>Indians:</hi>—We are unacquainted with that, neither do we know how our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King of <hi>England,</hi> has divided his Provinces.—You ſay, if you have done the <hi>Indians</hi> any Injuſtice, you are willing to make them Satisfaction. We are glad to hear it; and as you have Writings to refreſh your Memories about every Tranſaction that has happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and our Nephews and Brothers, the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> we recommend it heartily to you to do Juſtice.—We are much concerned to ſee how you are uſed by them and the <hi>French,</hi> every Day having your People killed, and you ſitting with your Heads between your Legs, and receiving the Blow, without reſenting it, as if you could not, or would not, fight to defend yourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>We deſire that you may not think of great Expeditions far off.—Uſe your beſt Endeavours to defend your Frontiers, and protect the Lives of your People.—It is better for you to give up ſome Points to them, than to contend, provided they ſhould be in the Wrong, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all Differences ſubſiſting between you as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He added, Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> take Pattern by Sir <hi>William Johnſon;</hi> he always keeps large Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties patrolling acroſs the Frontiers where he lives, and you do not hear of any Murders being committed there.—That is the Way to defend yourſelves.—The Enemy is afraid to enter the Settlements there; and if you purſue the ſame Meaſures, they will be afraid to come into your Settlements.</p>
               <p>Thomas King <hi>then ſpoke as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have conſidered what you ſaid to us, about our requeſting the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> to bring down and deliver up all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners they have, agreeable to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to Sir <hi>William Johnſon.</hi>—We will do every Thing in our Power that may induce them to do it; but perhaps it will not be in our Power to prevail on them to give them up.— Once more we deſire that you would ſend for the <hi>Senecas</hi> and them, and endeavour to ſettle all thoſe Differences.—It is in your Power to do it. When it is done, you will certainly ſee ſome of your own Fleſh and Blood again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>

               <p>It is true, we were preſent when the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> brightened the Chain of Friendſhip with Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and promiſed to turn the Edge of their Hatchet againſt the <hi>French.</hi>—But you muſt know that laſt Fall, tho' they went out to War with us, they always turned back, and did not perform what they had promiſed; ſo that we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what they will do now.—But for our Parts, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> we have been engaged in the War with you, and are always ready, when we ſee an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flag, to join our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to go with them, and ſhare the ſame Fate.</p>

               <p>I ſhall immediately report the whole that has paſſed at theſe Conferences to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> who is glad of all Occaſions to ſhew his Attachment to our Friends the <hi>Indians,</hi> and promote His Majeſty's Service.—It is that Gentleman's peculiar Province to treat and finiſh all Treaties with the <hi>Indians.</hi>—Let me add, my Brethren of the <hi>United Nations,</hi> that you ſhall find no Deceit in me, and I ſhall be happy if my Conduct deſerves your Eſteem and Approbation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ordered the Preſents provided by the good People of this Province to be carried to the <hi>Indian</hi> Camp early in the Morning; and inform you, that a Part of theſe Preſents is given by thoſe who are the Deſcendents of the Inhabitants that firſt came over to this Country with your old Friend <hi>William Penn,</hi> as a particular Teſtimony of their Regard and Affection for the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I then ſpoke in Behalf of Sir</hi> WILLIAM JOHNSON.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sachems and Warriors of the</hi> United Nations,</p>
               <p>You ſee how the <hi>French,</hi> the Enemies of Mankind, ſet on their Children to murder, in a barbarous Manner, your Brethren that are ſettled on the Frontiers of this and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces.—Brethren, I muſt now deſire you, in the Name of the Great King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> your Father, and my Maſter, that on your Return to your own Country, you will be active, and not ſuffer any of the <hi>French,</hi> or their Children, to paſs over your Lands to murder your Brethren; and that you will let <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and his People know, I expect he will do the ſame.—Tell them it is not, nor will not be, their Intereſt to carry on the War againſt their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—Their Father, the <hi>French</hi> King, makes Fools of them, and will, in the End, make Slaves of them: But you, Brethren, are convinced, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have always treated you as their Brethren, and I expect a due Regard and Performance to this Requeſt on your Side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Little Abraham <hi>made the following Anſwer to the Governor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>We return you our hearty Thanks for accepting of our Advice in ſending for the <hi>Delawares, Shawaneſe</hi> and <hi>Senecas,</hi> and we hope, when you meet them, you will be able to ſettle all Differences to your Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>We likewiſe return you our hearty Thanks for your kind Invitation to us to ſettle at <hi>Genoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> and your Promiſe to ſupply thoſe that will ſtay, or come and ſettle there, with Proviſions and Goods.—We accept of the Invitation, and will take it into Conſideration as we go Home, how many of us will ſtay there, or come back from our Towns to ſettle there; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you Thanks for appointing our Brother <hi>Thomas M'Kee</hi> to take Care of us, as he is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very agreeable to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſpoke again as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Warraighiyagey,</p>
               <p>We have all given Attention to what you have ſaid to us by <hi>Anaquarunda;</hi> and you may depend upon our being on the Active, and doing every Thing in our Power to prevent the <hi>French</hi> or their Chidren coming to murder our Brethren; and we will recommend it ſtrongly to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and his People, to do the ſame.—Brother, we muſt deſire you will aſſiſt our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> in ſettling the Differences between him and our Nephews and Brothers, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> which will be the only Method to prevent theſe cruel Murders daily committed on our Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 21ſt. The Preſents were delivered to the <hi>Indians</hi> in their own Camp; after which I condoled with them on account of ſome of their People who died of the Small-pox ſince they came here, and gave them a Piece of Stroud to cover the Graves of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, agreeable to the antient Cuſtom of the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeveral Chiefs returned their hearty thanks for our condoling with them, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Graves of their deceaſed Friends, agreeable to the antient Cuſtom uſed by their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and expreſſed great Satisfaction with the Treatment they met with in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and returned Thanks for the Preſents they had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 22. I called a Meeting of the Chiefs of the ſeveral Tribes, and I repeated over to them the Meſſages going to be ſent to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> by this Government, agreeable to their Requeſt; and at the ſame time I acquainted them, that there was a ſmall Preſent provided by this Government for their Brethren the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> who had come into this Government, and was now waiting in Expectation of its being ſent them, agreeable to their Requeſt.—I then deſired them to give their Opinion about the Meſſage to be ſent to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and whether it was agreeable to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which they made me the following Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have conſidered every Part of your Meſſage to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and we approve much of it, and think it will be acceptable to our Nephews and Brothers; and we likewiſe approve of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007920_0018_102E0185AFB20D70"/>our Brother <hi>Onas</hi>'s ſending a Preſent to our Brothers the <hi>Cherekees.</hi>—You, our Brothers the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> took ſome Pains to bring about a Peace between them and us, and we embrace this Opportunity of brightening the Chain of Friendſhip between us in your Preſence.—We have appointed three Men to go with you to ſee them, and hope you will provide for them on the Road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>

                  <hi>The Speech ſent by the Governor to</hi> Teedyuſcung.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung,</p>
               <p>AT the Treaty held at <hi>Eaſton</hi> laſt Fall, you complained unto me that the <hi>Indians</hi> had been defrauded of their Lands.—This you told me was one of the Cauſes that had alienated the Minds of our Brethren, the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> from us your Brethren; —upon which I told you, if you could make it appear that you had received any Injuſtice or Injuries from this Province, I was ready to hear it, and promiſed to make you Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You then informed me, that the People who claimed thoſe Lands, as they did not expect that Affair would come under Conſideration at that Treaty, were not preſent, and had not impowered you to tranſact that Buſineſs for them, and therefore you could not finiſh it at that Time, but that you would come down again in the Spring, and would bring with you as many of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> as could be got together, in order to a full Settlement of all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between us, that a firm and laſting Peace might be eſtabliſhed for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you had thus promiſed to be down in the Spring, we were pleaſed to find a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number of your Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> were come amongſt us, to be preſent and hear all your Complaints.—They ſtaid a conſiderable Time for that Purpoſe, in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeeing you here; but as ſome Accident may have prevented your coming, your Uncles grew very uneaſy at being detained here ſo long, and deſired me to meet them at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whither I went, and opened my Heart to them, giving them a full Account of all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between us at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> promiſing your Uncles, that I would take Care to ſee you redreſſed, either on account of your Lands, or any other Injuries you may have received from your Brethren of this Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> at this Treaty, ſhewed a great deal of Kindneſs for you, and would have been extremely pleaſed to have ſeen you here, being reſolved to ſee Juſtice done to you; but as you were not come in, they adviſed us to treat you very tenderly, and to adviſe you to bring with you ſome of your Uncles, the <hi>Senecas,</hi> that we might open our Hearts to one another freely, by which Means all Cauſes of Jealouſies, or Miſunderſtandings between us, might be ſettled and taken away for ever, and that they would join their beſt Endeavours to bring about a firm and laſting Peace between you and your Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave your Uncles my hearty Thanks for their good Advice; and told them, that as I highly approved it, as good and ſound Advice, I would act as they had ſo earneſtly deſired me to do, being ſincerely diſpoſed to hear all your Complaints, and to do you Juſtice, as I had formerly promiſed you at <hi>Eaſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I have now informed you of the earneſt Requeſt of your Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and of my own Opinion, which is the ſame with theirs, I do by this Belt of Wampum invite you to come down as ſoon as it will ſuit your Convenience, and leave it to you to bring with you your Uncles, the <hi>Senecas,</hi> or ſuch of them as will be moſt agreeable to you, to open your Hearts to us your Brethren; and if it ſhall appear that you have been defrauded of your Lands, or received any other Injuries from this Province, I do promiſe you ſhall receive Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſome late Letters received from your Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in Anſwer to my Repreſentation of the late Conferences, and your Complaints at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> he acquaints me he is willing to have the Injuries complained of fully heard and ſettled as ſoon as poſſible.—If you rather chuſe Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> ſhould determine theſe unhappy Differences, I moſt warmly recommend it to you to apply to that Gentleman, as he has the Honour to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſole Agent and Superintendent of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs in the Northern Diſtrict.</p>

After this Speech was delivered to the Meſſengers, the Sachems of the ſeveral Tribes made the following Speech.</p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we have finiſhed the Buſineſs for this Time, and we deſign to part To-morrow, you muſt be ſenſible that we have a long Journey, and a hilly Country to paſs over, and ſeveral of our old Men very weak, we hope that you will not ſend us from your Frontiers without a Walking-ſtick

               <hi>He laid down two Strings of Wampum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We thank you for the Concern you ſhew for the Misfortune that beſel our Warriors in <hi>Virginia.</hi> We take it as a particular Mark of Friendſhip. We aſſure you, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the unjuſt Treatment our Warriors met with in <hi>Virginia,</hi> we did not allow our Heads to be giddy, nor to reſent it as it deſerved, which might have occaſioned a Violation of Treaties, and the Deſtruction of many.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We thank you very kindly for the early Steps you made in calling your old and wiſe Men together to conſult with them. It was a very prudent and good Advice they gave you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mediator betwixt us your Brethren, and the <hi>Virginians</hi> your Neighbours. We thank them for ſuch good Advice: And we aſſure you, we will accordingly come to an amicable Accommodation with the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> if he will come to reaſonable Terms. And if a War ſhould break out betwixt us and him, you will be convinced of his being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it: For when in former Times we received a deadly Blow, we never returned it, if it was ever ſo dangerous; we always judged it to be given by diſorderly People, and we uſed always peaceable Means to make it up; but when we received the ſecond Blow, we judged that War was intended againſt us, and then we roſe and knocked down our Enemies with one Blow, and we are ſtill able to do the ſame, but we leave now our Caſe to you. We have ordered our Warriors, with the ſtrongeſt Words, to ſit down, and not revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Therefore, Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> go on with Courage in your Mediation; we aſſure you we will not violate or do any Thing contrary to your Mediation.

<note n="§" place="margin">That is, this Summer.</note>, before we can finiſh them: We therefore deſire you will ſet your Heart at Eaſe, and think on nothing but what is good. We will come and treat with you at <hi>Canataquanny,</hi> on <hi>Saſquebannab,</hi> To-morrow Morning

               <hi>The Speaker laid down four Strings of Wampum.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Dutchman</hi> on <hi>Scohooniady (Juniata)</hi> claims a Right to the Land, merely becauſe he gave a Little Victuals to our Warriors, who ſtand very often in Need of it. This String of Wampum ſerves (the Speaker then took two Strings of Wampum in his Hands) to take the <hi>Dutchman</hi> by the Arm, and throw him over the big Mountains within your Borders. WE HAVE GIVEN THE RIVER SCOHOONIADY (JUNIATA) FOR A HUNTING-PLACE TO OUR COUSINS THE DELAWARE INDIANS, AND OUR BRETHREN THE SHAWANESE; and we ourſelves hunt there ſometimes. We therefore deſire you will immediately, by Force, remove all thoſe that live on the ſaid River of <hi>Scohooniady.</hi>

            <p>I live upon this River of <hi>Ohio</hi> harmleſs like a little Child: I can do nothing; I am but weak; and I do not ſo much as intend Miſchief. I have nothing to ſay, and do therefore ſend theſe Strings of Wampum to <hi>Catchcawatſiky,</hi> the Chief Man, again; he will anſwer your Meſſage, as he is the older, and greater, Man.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Sachſidora</hi> took up the four Strings of Wampum, and ſpoke in Behalf of <hi>Catchcawatſiky,</hi> as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother, the Governor of</hi> Pennſylvania,</p>
            <p>The Place where I live, and the neighbouring Country, has been overſhadowed of late by a very dark Cloud. I looked with a pitiful Eye upon the poor Women and Children, and then looked upon the Ground all along for Sorrow, in a miſerable Condition, becauſe of the poor Women and Children. In all that dark Time, a Meſſage from you found the Way to <hi>Shamakin;</hi> and when it was delivered to us, the dark Cloud was diſperſed, and the Sun im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began to ſhine; and I could ſee at a great Diſtance, and ſaw your Good-will and kind Love to the <hi>Indians</hi> and the white People: I thank you, therefore, Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> for your kind Meſſage; I am now able to comfort the poor Women and Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here the Speaker laid down four Strings of Wampum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Speaker took up two Strings of Wampum, and directed his Diſcourſe to the</hi> Delaware In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, <hi>the</hi> Shawaneſe, <hi>and to</hi> Onas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Couſins the Delawares,</hi>

            <p>We are informed that you can talk a little <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by which you have heard many Things amongſt the white People; and you frequently bring Lies amongſt the <hi>Indians;</hi> and you have very little Knowledge and Regard for Treaties of Friendſhip; you give your Tongue too much Liberty. This String of Wampum ſerves to tie your Tongue, and to forewarn you from Lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren, the</hi> Shawaneſe,</p>
            <p>You believe too many Lies, and are too forward in Action. You ſhall not pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our People that have been killed in <hi>Virginia:</hi> We are the Chief of all the <hi>Indians;</hi> let
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007920_0021_102E018C1EDAAE80"/>your Ears and Eyes be open towards us; and order your Warriors to ſtay at Home as we did ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>Your Back Inhabitants are People given to Lies, and raiſing of falſe Stories; ſtop up their Mouths; you can do it with one Word; let no falſe Stories be told; it is dangerours to the Chain of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The Strings of Wampum were delivered to the <hi>Delawares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Speaker had finiſhed, an handſome <hi>Indian</hi> Dinner was given to all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by <hi>Shickallemo</hi>'s People.</p>
            <p>After Dinner I delivered my Meſſage to them, and preſented the Company with two Rolls of Tobacco, about three Pound each Roll, to ſmoak whilſt they were in Company together, to talk about the good News they had heard that Day, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shickallemo</hi> told me, by Way of Diſcourſe, that they (the Council of <hi>Onondago</hi>) had ſent Strings of Wampum by him to all the <hi>Indians</hi> upon the River <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> to tell them to uſe their Endeavours to ſtop all their Warriors, and not permit them to go to fight with the People of <hi>Virginia;</hi> and to acquaint them of what was agreed upon in <hi>Onondago,</hi> which was accepted of in every Town.—I enquired what Buſineſs of Moment the <hi>Six Nations</hi> had under Deliberation that prevented their coming down to treat with the Governor of <hi>Maryland. Shickallemo</hi> aſked whether I could not gueſs at it. I told him no. Then he ſaid, How ſhould they come down with a Hatchet ſtruck in their Head? The Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> muſt waſh off the Blood firſt, and take the Hatchet out of their Head, and dreſs the Wound (according to Cuſtom, he that ſtruck firſt muſt do it) and the Council of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> will ſpeak to him, and be reconciled to him, and bury that Affair in the Ground, that it never may be ſeen nor heard of any more ſo long as the World ſtands.—But if the <hi>Virginians</hi> would not come to do that, he <hi>(Shickallemo)</hi> believed there would be a War; but I might aſſure the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the Warriors would not come then within the inhabited Part of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> but direct their Courſe directly to <hi>Virginia.</hi> over the <hi>Big Iſland,</hi> in the North-Weſt Branch of <hi>Saſquehannah.</hi>
