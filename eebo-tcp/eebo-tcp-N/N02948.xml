            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003534_0005_0FF859E953A35FD0"/>1. An Appointment or Decree of God, in theſe words, <hi>It is appointed,</hi> that is by God: He is the author of this decree; this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, and abundantly expreſſed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Objects of this decree, and they
are <hi>Men.</hi> It is appointed <hi>for men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Extent of this decree with reſpect to the Objects of it, and that is noted by this word <hi>All.</hi> It extends to all men; the decree with reſpect to the Object of it is of univerſal extent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The things contain'd in this decree or appointment of God, and they are two, <hi>viz, Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Death It is appointed for all men to die.</hi> And here we may obſerve the Limitation of this, namely of mens dying, by the Divine decree as to time; as God hath appointed that all men muſt die, ſo he hath Limited their dying to one time, they muſt die but once. There have been two men ſince the world began that never died, <hi>viz. Enoch</hi> &amp; <hi>Elijah</hi> And they alſo that will be alive when Chriſt comes to Judge the world (as ſeems plain from Scripture will not die; And ſome of the lead that were raiſed to life by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, &amp; by ſome of the Prophets, might (for ought that we know) die a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; but in all Ages &amp; Generations of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003534_0006_0FF859EC562CFC98"/>
men (those mention'd only excepted) we have reaſon to conclude that all have died &amp; muſt die, &amp; that but once. This ſeems to be the decree of Heaven: this is the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great Sovereign of the world concerning men.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) The ſecond thing mentioned in the decree of God concerning men is, <hi>that they ſhall go to Judgment.</hi> Now men are favour'd with a time of Patience &amp; a day of Grace; but a day of Judgment is coming, wherein they muſt receive a Judicial Sentence from God their Judge, and be diſpos'd of by him acccording to the Rules of ſtrict Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The laſt thing I ſhall Obſerve in the Text, is, the time of this Judgment, &amp; that is, <hi>after Death.</hi> It is appointed for all men once to die, &amp; <hi>after this the Judgment.</hi> What is further needful for the Opening of the words, may be left to the Explication of the Doctrine, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT. The Time is coming when all Perſons now Living, muſt ſurely Die &amp; go to Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many things men in this life do greatly differ, and that both in temporal &amp; ſpiritual reſpects, but there is one thing wherein they all agree: Men of all ranks &amp; degrees, of all kinds &amp; qualifications do agree in this, that they are mortal &amp; muſt die.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003534_0007_0FF859EDDAA98BD8"/>And as men greatly differ in their ſtate &amp; condition during this preſent life (I mean eſpecially while health is continu'd to 'em) ſo they do in the manner of their dying. Thus it is both as to godly &amp; wicked men. Some that have liv'd a truly godly life ſay but little when they come to die; others ſay much, &amp; that to the great comfort of their friends about them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some godly perſons die with but a ſupporting hope, others die with a triumphant joy; &amp; ſome of the dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God have (without doubt) died in the dark.</p>
            <p>The death of wicked men alſo is attended with very differing circumſtances; ſome of them die in the ſame carnal ſecurity &amp; ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtupidity in which they all along liv'd, <hi>Job</hi> 21.23 Others die as with a guilty, ſo with an awakenend &amp; accuſing Conſcience. Some die under deluſions &amp; with falſe hopes, and in others their hope is as the giving up of the ghoſt. <hi>Job</hi> 11.20. Terrors are upon them, yea they take hold of them as waters. <hi>Job</hi> 27.20. They are in great diſtreſs upon their death-beds, they die in the bitterneſs of their souls, <hi>Job</hi> 21 25. Yea, it hath been the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſe of ſome that have liv'd wicked lives to go out of the world deſpairing of mercy. Thus greatly do ſome men differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the circumſtances that their death
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003534_0008_0FF859EF6FCA2568"/>
is attended with &amp; that both of the godly &amp; of the wicked, but in this they all agree, that they come to their end, their breath goeth forth, they return to their duſt, their ſouls go into Eternity, their bodies go to the grave, to the houſe appointed for all living, they enter into the ſtate of the dead, and there they take up their lodging, lying and ſleeping in ſilence in the dark chambers of death, and have no more a portion for ever in any thing done under the Sun.</p>
            <p>And as there is a great difference between ſome men &amp; others at their death, or in the manner of their dying, ſo there is ſtill a far greater difference in their ſtate after death.</p>
            <p>Men don't all go to heaven when they die, neither do they all go to hell: ſome go one way &amp; ſome another. Some go to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt joy &amp; glory, others to endleſs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, wo &amp; miſery: but in this they agree that they all go to Judgment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> handling of this truth may come under theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is a time coming when all the living muſt ſurely die. 2. God hath made it to be the duty of men, to ſpend their appointed time in the world in the ſervice &amp; to the glory of their Maker. 3. God hath appointed a time, wherein he will call men to an account how they have acted in their places, &amp; how they have ſpent their time in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003534_0009_0FF859F1A0901710"/>I. <hi>There is a time coming when all the living muſt ſurely die.</hi> All the living have ſinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, the God that created them &amp; all the world, &amp; therefore they muſt die. God at firſt made man in a ſtate of innocency &amp; integrity, &amp; had he continu'd in that ſtate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his probation, God would have ſetled &amp; confirm'd him in a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; but our firſt Father, the firſt man that God created, by diſobedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, fell from his firſt eſtate, &amp; being conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God to be the publick Head &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all that ſhould by ordinary Generation deſcend from him, all mankind ſinned in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then again,</hi> All are ſinners by their own inherent corruption, Pſ. 51.5 <hi>Behold, I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in ſin, &amp; in iniquity did my mother conceive me</hi> Job 25.4. <hi>How can man be juſtified with God, or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</hi> And all that live to be capable of it, are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by actual tranſgreſſion, Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good &amp; ſinneth not.</hi> And therefore all the living muſt die. Man hath made himſelf a ſinful creature, and therefore God hath juſtly made him a mortal dying creature, Rom 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, &amp; death by ſin, &amp; ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinn'd.</hi> The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt die, becauſe they are under the curſe

of the Law, of which death is a conſiderable part: and though Chriſt hath delivered the Righteous from it, having born the curſe for them, yet for great and weighty reaſons they muſt die alſo.</p>
            <p>Should men upon their Converſion be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made immortal, ſeveral great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences (as might eaſily be ſhew'd) would follow upon it, &amp; therefore God hath wiſely order'd it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And then the death of the Righteous is an occaſion of ſome great and excellent things, which would never have been without it, things that are much to the glory of God, &amp; honour of our Redeemer. I ſhall very briefly mention ſome of them, Namely, a humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion &amp; Reſignation to the Will of God, in the moſt trying caſe, in their willingneſs to die, and ſo to leave all that's dear to them in the world &amp; to part with life it ſelf becauſe God will have it to be ſo, Numb. 33 38. <hi>And Aaron the prieſt went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord &amp; died there, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence Patience hath its perfect work, in the dying Saint's bearing the pains of his Sickneſs, yea ſometimes of a long &amp; ſore ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the very pangs and bitter agonies off death it ſelf, as the hand of a Sovereign God upon him, with a humble, holy ſilence &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, without any diſcontent or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003534_0011_0FF859F71D70ED20"/>
And hence Faith alſo is exercis'd in ſome of the moſt noble acts of it, in leaving Children, &amp; others very dear, with God, and in the departing ſouls venturing it felt for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, in the hands, &amp; under the care of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, &amp; in truſting in him, for a glorious Reſurrection of its now dying body, from the Dead to Life again.</p>
            <p>The dying of the righteous is alſo an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of the higheſt &amp; moſt glorious acts of divine Love, in that they eſteem the viſion &amp; fruition of God, &amp; their being with Chriſt in heaven in a ſtare of perfect holineſs, to be things worth dying for, &amp; therefore are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the ſake of theſe things to leave all earthly things &amp; that for ever, and that their bodies that have been ſo dear to them, ſhou'd during God's pleaſure dwell in a ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; ſilence, &amp; be the ſubjects of loathſom corruption in the noiſon purifying Grave.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo will ariſe great honour &amp; glory to the Son of God, in raiſing not only the wicked, but the righteous too, and ſo all the dead of all ages and generations to life again. The Reſurrectin of the Dead is a work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly great &amp; wonderful, &amp; this work will be done by Jeſus Chriſt, Joh 5 25,—28,29 <hi>The hour cameth when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God... The hour is coming in the which all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, &amp; ſhall come forth. &amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003534_0012_0FF859F8C33194C8"/>And herein the mighty Power, &amp; infinite Underſtanding of Chriſt will gloriouſly ſhine forth, and he will appear to be a perſon truly Divine. Conſidering theſe things, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as well as the Wicked, and ſo all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons living muſt die.</p>
            <p n="2">II <hi>God hath made it the duty of men to ſpend their appointed time in the world, in his Service &amp; to his Glory,</hi> And indeed it is moſt juſt and reaſonable that it ſhould be ſo; for God is a Being of infinite Dignity &amp; Excellency, and all men have received their life &amp; being from Him, and he ſuſtains them day and night and keeps them every moment: He is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all that good that they enjoy or hope for. Upon God men have an abſolute and intire dependance for all that they have, and for all that they need, &amp; that both for time &amp; eternity; and to Him they are under the higheſt Obligations: And therefore by the very law of their Creation, &amp; by all the laws &amp; rules of Reaſon &amp; equity, of Gratitude Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Prudence &amp; Self-intereſt, they are bound to ſerve and glorify God. And indeed that men ſhou'd ſpend their whole time, &amp; improve all their opportunities &amp; talents for that God who is a Being of all poſſible Perfection, whoſe Creatures they are, and whoſe Service and Glory is the very end of their being, &amp; of all that they are &amp; have, is a duty ſo reaſonable,

that there can be no juſt Objection againſt it, nor any good Excuſe made for the neglect of it. Deut. 10.12. <hi>And now, Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, &amp; to walk in his ways, &amp; to love him, &amp; to ſerve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul?</hi>

            <p n="3">III. GOD <hi>hath appointed a Time wherein he will call men to an Account how they have acted in their Places, and how they have ſpent their time in the world.</hi> Divines tell us that immediately after death, God paſſes a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgment upon men; and the Scripture ſeems plainly to favour this, &amp; to guide us to ſuch a concluſion, Eccl. 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth, as it was, &amp; the ſpirit to God who gave it.</hi> Not to God to enjoy Him as their Portion; this can't be the meaning of it, for it ſpeaks of all departed Souls and wicked fouls in their ſeparate ſtate will be far from that: therefore it muſt mean that when men die, their ſpirits or ſouls ſhall return to God as their Judge, to be ſetled by his Judicial Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in their Eternal State. The word of God alſo informs us, that the ſouls of ſome preſently after their death are fixed by God in a happy ſtate, and the ſouls of others in a ſtate of two &amp; miſery, Luk. 16.22, 23. <hi>And the beggar died &amp; was carried by angels into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſom: the rich man alſo died &amp; was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment, &amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003534_0014_0FF859FEE32CCA90"/>It is alſo clear from God's word, that this preſent life is mens only time to prepare for Judgment in. When that is at an end their day of grace is paſt &amp; over for ever, and they are immediately ſet by God under a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Judgment, 2 Cor. 6.2 <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath alſo appointed a day or time of general Judgment, wherein all the inhabitants of the world, of all Nations &amp; Ages muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before Him, and receive Judgment from Him. This may well be call'd (as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is) the great Day of Judgment, wherein God who is infinitely the higheſt Majeſty, the moſt awful &amp; tremendous of all Beings, will appear in amazing Glory, as King &amp; Judge of the world (God in his Second Perſon, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I mean, who is God the Son) when the Monarchs of the world, with the Meaneſt of the People, ſuch as are now Judges in their Robes, with them that are Priſoners in their Chains; they that ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, with them that hear them; yea, all mankind from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the throne to the footſtool, muſt ſtand at Chriſt's Bar, on whom He will with the moſt ſolemn form, and in the moſt open and publick manner, paſs that final and definitive Sentence, that will unalterably ſettle them in their Everlaſting State, according to what
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003534_0015_0FF85A0088B88F28"/>
they have done in their ſtate of Mortality here in the world. Rev. 20 11,—<hi>And I ſaw great white throne, and him that ſat upon it.... And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God &amp; the books were opened, and the dead were judged out of thoſe things that were written in the books, every man according to their works</hi> This is alſo very clear from what we have in <hi>Mathew</hi> 25.31 <hi>to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All mankind ſhall be Judged by Chriſt in this ſolemn &amp; moſt open manner, that ſo all his faithful Servants may appear with him in glory, &amp; be by Him abſolved, acquitted, owned and highly honoured, and by his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence have a moſt glorious Reward aſſign'd them before all the world. And that all the wicked being condeamed by Chriſt to their deſerved Puniſhment, may ſtand aſhamed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed &amp; confounded, before GOD, Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>It is a very ſuitable thing, &amp; moſt wiſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God, that there ſhould be a day of Judgment held in this moſt publick, open &amp; s;olemn manner, that ſoan innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels with many millions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, may be witneſſes to the tranſactions of that day &amp; of Chriſt's management of the grand affairs of it, that ſo the grace, truth, juſtice &amp; holineſs of God may gloriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the view of all, and that the glorious

Dignity and Majeſty of Chriſt may be fully manifeſted in this His moſt Exalted State, and that his Divine and Godlike Excellencies may in the ſight of all the World ſhine forth in the Brightneſs and Glory of them.</p>

            <p>USE, III. Of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> in ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> The Firſt ſhall be to the <hi>Honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that Sit Chief in our Civil State</hi>: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to it, I ſhall premiſe (as briefly as may be) ſeveral things as the proper Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of, and much to be deſired in a Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowlege.</hi> If the Underſtanding be the eye of the Soul, Knowlege is the light of that eye, whereby it clearly ſees its proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Knowlege is as a lamp to a Rulers feet, to ſhew him the way, both of his duty &amp; ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; gives him boldneſs in it, without which he would be but a blind Guide, &amp; ſadly expoſe himſelf with them that are under his conduct.</p>
            <p>Therefore God in his word directs a People to chuſe able men for Rulers, men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the work &amp; buſineſs that they are call'd to Exod I8 22 <hi>Moreover, thou ſhall provide out of all the people, able men,... and place ſuch over them to be rulers.</hi> 1 Chron. 12.32 — <hi>As are men that have underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is a great, &amp; indeed an eſſential Qualification of a Ruler; for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are appointed to be miniſters of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003534_0018_0FF85A08257B61F8"/>
Juſtice, &amp; therein miniſters of God to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for good, <hi>Rom</hi> 13 4. They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be men of great Integrity; they ſhould ſet themſelves with all poſſible impartiality to adminiſter Juſtice to all that come for it, yea, to all to whom it is due. This was one great thing that made <hi>Job</hi> appear ſo bright &amp; amiable, and with ſuch a comely &amp; venerable majeſty in the eyes of his people Job 39 7,—<hi>When I went out to the gate thro' the city, when I prepared my ſeat in the ſtreets, the young men ſaw me &amp; hid themſelves, &amp; the aged aroſe and ſtood up; the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their mouth; the nobles held their peace, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 11<hi>th.</hi> &amp; 14<hi>th.</hi> Verſes we have theſe words, viz. <hi>When the ear heard me it bleſſed me, &amp; when the eye ſaw me it gave witneſs to me; I put on righteouſneſs &amp; it cloathed me, &amp; my judgment was as a robe &amp; a diadem</hi> This graces &amp; adorns a Judge more than a ſword of State, a ſcarlet Robe with a chain of Gold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A merciful compaſſionate ſpirit.</hi> A civil Ruler is to be conſider'd, not only as one cloath'd with the Authority, acted and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſpirit of a ſtrictly Juſt &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, &amp; girt with the Sword of Juſtice, as one reſolv'd &amp; ready to Execute the Law without reſpect to Perſons, &amp; ſo as a Terror to Evil-doers; but alſo as one veſted with Power, furniſh'd with Ability &amp; Advantage,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003534_0019_0FF812E9C4975E88"/>
and qualify'd with a Diſpoſition to right the Injured, relieve the Oppreſſed, do good to the Poor &amp; Needy &amp; afford help to the Afflicted; And ſuch a Ruler was that eminent Perſon mentioned but now, Job 29, 12, 13 <hi>I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him: the bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, &amp; I cauſed the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows heart to ſing for joy.</hi> And in the 15<hi>th</hi> &amp; 16<hi>th.</hi> Verſes, it follows thus, <hi>I was eyes to the blind &amp; feet to the lame: I was a father to the poor.</hi> And Chap 30.25. <hi>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my ſoul grieved for the poor?</hi> Of ſuch a ſpirit ſhou'd every Ruler be especially in a Chriſtian Government.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Courage</hi> This is exceeding needful for a Ruler, that ſo his Authority may not be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, &amp; himſelf treated with contempt by proud &amp; inſolent men, and that he may not tear to draw the Sword of Juſtice againſt the moſt bold &amp; daring Tranſgreſſors. Hence Rulers in Scripture are exhoſted to be men of courage. 1 King 2 1 <hi>Now the days of David drew nigh that he ſhould die, &amp; he charged his ſon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, ſaying, I go the way of all the earth; be thou ſtrong therefore &amp; ſhew thyſelf a man.</hi> Deut. 31 7. <hi>And Moſes called unto Joſhua &amp; ſaid unto him in the ſight of Iſrael, Be ſtrong &amp; of a good
courage.</hi> And after the ſame manner God himſelf ſpeaks to him, Joſh 1.1, 6, 7. <hi>And it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003534_0020_0FF85A0B5D552F90"/>
came to paſs that the Lord ſpake unto Joſhua the ſon of Nun, ſaying, &amp;c.—Be ſtrong &amp; of a good

This is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Government can't be well maintain'd even in the leaſt Societies without it: And therefore God requires it in Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. 1 Tim 3.4. <hi>One that ruleth well his own houſe, having his children in ſubjection with all gravity.</hi> It is very needful in all Heads and Governours of Societies; but eſpecially in Publick Rulers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Prudence.</hi> The work of a Ruler, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one of Superior Rank, is a great work, and in many caſes is attended with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, &amp; requires an uncommon meaſure of Wiſdom to a right management of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns on it. And hence King <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo earneſtly ſeek it of God. King 3 9 <hi>Give there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy ſervant an underſtanding heart, to judge thy people</hi> And this was one main thing that made him ſo great in the eyes of the People. 1 Chron. 29 25. <hi>And the Lord magnified Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

exceedingly in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi> 1 King 3 28 <hi>And all Iſrael heard of the judgment that the king had judged &amp; they feared the king, for they ſaw that the wiſdom of God was in him to do judgment.</hi> Now Prudence is an eminent branch of Wiſdom: it is very much of the practical part of if. Prov. I4 I5 <hi>The prudent man looketh well to his going.</hi> This is ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Ruler, that the want of it but in ſome particular actions may not a little hurt the Reputation of men in power, tho' eſteemed wiſe men, vea men of excitting Abilities for the main Eccl 10 1. <hi>Dead flies cauſe the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour, ſo doth a little folly him that is in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for wiſdom and honour.</hi> Such as are in chief Rule over a People, ſhould not only be men of knowledge &amp; underſtanding, but alſo men of great Judgment and Diſcretion Eccl. 8 5. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Fortitude.</hi> This is a Virtue conſiſting of courage and patience; it is that whereby a man not only dares to engage in a juſt and honeſt Cauſe, but alſo bears up under the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that it is attended with without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; continuing with an invincible Patience, Strength and firmneſs of mind to purſue the matter, waiting in the uſe of proper means for the deſired End. That great &amp; renowned

Magiſtrate in Iſrael, <hi>Moſes</hi> (the ſupream Ruler under God of that people) had a great &amp; eminent meaſure of this Vertue: and yet there was a time when he ſeemed to want more of it, as we may ſee in Numb. 11 14, 15 <hi>I am not able to bear all this people alone, becauſe it is too heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee out of hand, if I have found favour in thy fight; and let me not ſee my wretchedneſs.</hi> So very needful (as we may ſee by this great inſtance of it) is the vertue of Fortitude in a civil Ruler.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>A Publick ſpirit.</hi> It is not eno' for men to ſerve a People in a publick Capacity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they do it alſo with a publick Spirit. The chief Rulers of a People are in Scripture ſtiled their <hi>great Men, their Nobles and their Princes</hi>; and they ſhould be men of a great, noble &amp; princely Spirit God hath ſet them in a publick &amp; eminent Place, and they ſhould be men eminently of a publick Spirit.

Thus it was with <hi>Phineas</hi> of old, and God took it exceeding well from him, &amp; he therein prov'd a great bleſſing to the People. Numb. 25.11, 13. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas— hath turned away my wrath from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, while he was zealous for my ſake among them: Wherefore I give him my covenant of peace, the covenant of an everlaſting prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood becauſe he was zealous for his God.</hi>

            <p>Let us alſo conſider the ſolemn Charge that God hath given us in his Word, together with the repeated ſolemn Calls he hath lately given us in his Providence, to be Faithful in our work, and ſo to prepare to die &amp; go to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Removal of ſo many of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in this Government by death, So that the laſt Year may well be call'd the <hi>dying Year of the Miniſters of Connecticut</hi>; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

it has been ſuch a Year, as I ſuppoſe neither the People of <hi>this Colony,</hi> nor any part of <hi>New-England</hi> ever ſaw before.

            <p>God hath fill'd the Land with Men, &amp; men have fill'd the Land with Sin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of Iſrael, according to Pſal. 105.24. <hi>And he increaſed his people greatly, and made them ſtronger than their enemies</hi>; compar'd with Hoſ. 4.7. <hi>As they were increaſed, ſo they ſinned againſt me.</hi> God hath plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us the bleſſings of his goodneſs; and we have made him returns, not in Love, Praiſe and Obedience, as we ought to have done, but (many of us at leaſt) in Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sins and Provocations.</p>
            <p>We have great reaſon to bleſs God that we have not them that hate us to Rule over us; That our Seats of Juſtice are fill'd with our Friends and not with our Enemies; That we yet enjoy our precious Civil Liberties, our Charter Priviledges; That yet we have our Anniverſary days of Election, the choice of our own Rulers, that our Nobles are of our Selves, and our Governour is not a ſtranger and a foreigner, but one that proceeds from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

above our Brethren: And while we are under theſe diſtinguiſhing ſmiles of the Divine Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we have a price in our hands, which if it were well Improved, might greatly tend to make us a happy People. And it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that you that now ſit at the Helm of our civil State, may, with the help &amp; bleſſing of God, contribute much to our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city And truly <hi>Sirs,</hi> It's much to be deſir'd, that from holy Zeal for God, and from a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tender Affection to this People now under your care, you would ſet your ſelves in good earneſt, to do all that you well can for their welfare, &amp; therefore for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the God-provoking evils, that are to be found among us.</p>
            <p>And there are two things that I ſhall now mention, which if they were duly put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, might prove a great &amp; happy means of our Reformation; and they are <hi>Conſideration &amp; Reſolution.</hi> Let this Honourable Aſſembly be Intreated thoro'ly to make tryal of them both.</p>
            <p n="1">[I.] <hi>Try what Conſideration may do</hi> And in the firſt place, conſider whether ſuch things may not be done more than hath yet been done for the Reformation of known evils, things that have been mentioned, faithfully &amp; ſolemnly Teſtfied againſt, by thoſe Meſſengers of the Lord, that have from year to year ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us in His Name on ſuch days as this,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003534_0035_0FF85A2F0B4FEB78"/>
as <hi>Drunkenneſs, Unrighteouſneſs</hi> and other <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, vicious &amp; prophane Practices</hi>; and among others, that of Prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>; concerning which I ſhall now briefly Obſerve ſomething, and that only in one branch of it, and that is perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly &amp; without any juſt cauſe Abſenting themſelves from the Publick Worſhip of God on the Sabbath-Day (I ſpeak not of Quakers &amp; other Sectaries, but of them that make the ſame Profeſſion that we generally do) I can't but fear that many in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are very guilty of this great Neglect &amp; ſinful Omiſſion of their Duty. And it may truly be ſaid of them that are thus guilty, that they live much in the Violation of the Fourth Commandment, which is, <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy</hi>; and in the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of a principal means of putting viſible Honour upon God, and of doing their part to maintain &amp; keep up Religion in the Places where they dwell, and are guilty of putting an open ſlight upon Chriſt, the Offers and Tenders of the Goſpel, and all the glorious things contained in it, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much in the neglect of the great &amp; principal means of their own Salvation. All theſe Evils they do at once, and live in them, that commonly neglect the Publick Worſhip of God. Surely this practiſe in which ſo many great Evils are contained, can be no little Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:003534_0036_0FF85A316B349BA0"/>It may well be tho't that every Member of this Aſſembly will readily own, that all ought to be done that can be done, in the great duty of turning from Sin to God: Now therefore let it be ſeriouſly Conſidered, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that has been done for the Reformation of this Evil?</p>
            <p>Again, Conſider whether there be not ſome way of Sin, not only yet unpurged, but alſo too little diſcover'd, &amp; leſs conſider'd. It would be a ſad thing indeed, if Iniquity (ſo hateful to God) ſhould in any one Branch of it have a free courſe among us. If there ſhould be any thing common with us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are injured, and God is offended &amp; diſhonour'd, and yet we ſhould be under ſuch a cloud of darkneſs, and ſome way or other ſuch an evil influence, that little Teſtimony is bor'n againſt it, even by them that are eſteem'd ſome of our beſt men. Surely this would call for lamentation &amp; mourning. Yet its poſſible that it may be thus even among a Proſeſſing People, as the Word of God, and Experience itſelf do too fully prove.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Sirs,</hi> pray Conſider whether there be no Inſtance of this nature to befound in this Government: and let me Deſire and Exhort every one to be Serious in thinking of it. Conſider how it hath been of late Years, and how it is now, with a hearty willingneſs,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003534_0037_0FF85A33A3EC6940"/>
and with an unfeigned earneſt deſire to ſee wherein we have ſinned, according to Job 6.24 <hi>Cauſe me to underſtand wherein I have erred.</hi> And Chap. 34.32 <hi>that which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity I will do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Search for Iniquity as with Candles, as a man ſearches for ſomething which he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires to find, which otherwiſe may prove hurtful, if not fatal to him. Let Sin be thus enquir'd after, and ſearched out.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall offer two things to your Conſideration, which tho' they can't be ſaid to be things in all reſpects of a ſecret and hidden nature, yet are things that have not been mention'd, that I remember on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and it may be not ſo much tho't of, as many other things that are amiſs among us.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>The exceſſive number of Law-ſuits that are Commenced in this County.</hi> Conſidering what Information I have bad of it, I cannot doubt but that in this thing, there hath been, and ſtill is a great Exceſs. I am very apt to think (if I have been righly inform'd) there are more Law-ſuits ſometimes (if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) commenc'd at one of our Inferiour Courts, than there was informer Years (yea long ſince my remembrance) in all the Courts of the Government for a whole Year. As there ſeems to be a very exorbitant Exceſs in this thing, ſo the inconveniences &amp; ill-effects
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003534_0038_0FF85A3692472748"/>
of it we may well conclude are very great; for it muſt needs conſume much of our Wealth and Subſtance, and that every Year. Its eaſy to ſee that it leads to Idleneſs, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Buſineſs, vain Company-keeping, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Drinking, the conſumption, waſte and loſs of much precious Time, to the great hurt of many particular Perſons and Families, in bringing them to Poverty &amp; Want, which is a great &amp; ſore Affliction, in which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and wrap'd up many Sorrows.</p>
            <p>This thing may well be accounted to be one of our Calamities. It is an evidence of much Iniquity, &amp; an occaſion of a great deal more; and how much ſin &amp; ſorrow may be the evil &amp; bitter fruit of it, and that from Year to Year? God only knows. I therefore would now offer it to the ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Honourable Aſſembly, whether ſomething may not be done to Reſtrain this Exceſs, and bring &amp; keep this thing within ſome narrower Bounds?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Another thing that I would deſire the Aſſembly's ſerious Tho't of, is, viz. <hi>Whether ſince the great diſ-count of our Bills of Credit, and from thence the great advance of the Price, both of the Conveniences &amp; Neceſſaries of Life, &amp; ſo of the Charge of Houſe-keeping, great Wrong hath not been done to ſome Perſons from Year to Year, in the Payment of what hath been due to them, &amp; that by reckoning what hath been Paid to them,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003534_0039_0FF85A38269EEAC8"/>
not according to the Value of it in former Years, but very much by the preſent Name &amp; Sound of it.</hi> My meaning is, That tho' the ſame Sum will not now go near half ſo far in defraying or anſwering the Charge of the Expences of a Family, as it would in Years paſt, yet to ſome Perſons there is no juſt Allowance made on that account. This hath been much talk'd of, &amp; condemn'd in the Country &amp; that by wiſe &amp; good men, both by ſuch as have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by it, &amp; by them alſo that have not. It hath been Teſtified againſt in Print, by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Note, both of Civil &amp; Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as that which is very unfair and unjuſt. Now I intreat the General Aſſembly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether or no it hath not been thus, not only in other parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> but alſo in this Government, and if ſo, whether this be according to that Divine Precept? Deut. 16.20. <hi>That which is altogether juſt ſhalt thou follow.</hi> Yea, whether there be not Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in it, &amp; that which is Evil in the ſight of the Lord, and whether this Evil, this Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath not had too free a courſe, &amp; paſſed too current among us? And whether it be not Iniquity attended with ſome great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations? And if upon a ſerious &amp; impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry, is be found that not only ſuch a Practiſe as I have now mention'd, hath been common, among us, but that alſo it is not

            <p>There is certainly a ſpirit in every truly godly man, from a gracious reſpect to God, univerſally to love truth &amp; righteouſneſs; &amp; to hate, abhor &amp; bear Teſtimony againſt all Iniquity: and this is unqueſtionably the duty of every Chriſtian, &amp; eſpecially of <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>the Miniſters of God's Word</hi>; yea of all that act in a <hi>Publick Capacity</hi> among us.

            <p>And if you would be every way obedient to Chriſt, pray alſo for your Miniſters; their Work is very great, and they greatly need the help of the prayers of all their Chriſtian friends; and conſider, in praying for them, you pray for your ſelves and for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bleſſed will you and yours be for ever, if you pray for them as you ought to do, and God hear your prayers.</p>

any Perſon either in Name or Eſtate. See
that you don't wrong any one for want of conſideration; and conſider you ought to weigh your actions, and ponder the paths of your feet, and mind what you do and ſay.</p>
            <p>Take heed that you do no wrong from the inordinate love of Gain; or becauſe you hope you have obtain'd mercy, and therefore ſhall not die for it; or becauſe you think you can do it without much hurting your Name or Credit among men; or becauſe you hope you ſhall live to repent of it, or upon any conſideration whatſoever.</p>

ſay to us (in his Providence) <hi>Moſes my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is dead.</hi> And now Death in repeated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it is come into the <hi>Houſe of Aaron.</hi> Not long ſince the hand of God was very remarkable in the Removal of many of our Magiſtraces, and that in a ſhort time; ſeveral of whom were the ſtrongeſt Pillars of the Common-wealth; And the laſt Year it was no left, but much more ſo, in the Death of ſo many of our Miniſters; ſeveral of whom were the Pillars of our Churches: And ſuch an one was that faithful Servant of Chriſt, that ſome Months ſince died in this Town,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reverend Mr, THOMAS BUCKINGHAM.</note> whoſe Pleaſant Countenance, Grave and Comely Preſence, were wont from Year to Year, on our Days of Election, to Grace and Adorn this Pulpit; but he is gone, &amp; much of our Strength, Light and Glory are gone with him: He was truly a man of a bright Character, being one of ſuperiour Abilities, one of the Chief of our Miniſters, one had in Reputation among us, one of our Pillars &amp; Principal men: He was of a Converſation becoming a Miniſter of Chriſt, one that in his Life &amp; Walk imitated and honoured his Bleſſed Maſter, being very blameleſs and of exemplary Piery, Gifts &amp; Graces, a pleaſant Temper, an affable obliging and engaging Carriage, and indeed many excellent things,

a whole Cluſter of amiable? adorning &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Vertues did meet in him We have all Cauſe to mourn that we ſhall ſee his face no more: So qualified was he for his Work &amp; Place, that without queſtion, he would have been highly priz'd by any Orthodox Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Chriſtian Congregation in the Land, not ore excepted. And as the death of ſuch a man, and our great loſs in it, may well be matter of Grief and Sorrow to us, and that in no low degree, ſo our Affections may be allowed to riſe the higher, and our Tears to flow the more in expreſſions of Lamentation &amp; Mourning. Conſidering how many Choice men, and of great worth, of the ſame Order, it hath pleaſed God to take from us by death but a little before him. And alſo Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the final departure of<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reverend Mr. TIMOTHY WOODBRIDGE</note> Him that ſo ſoon followed him, I mean that aged and eminent Servant of Chriſt who died in this Town this laſt week, who was one of the principal men of his Order in the Land; Him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that were his Contemporaries in the Sacred work ot the Evangelical Miniſtry in the Towns about him, generally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one much our Senior and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and in Caſes of Weight and Difficulty, adviſed with, and hearkened to him as our Head &amp; Guide, yea very much as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003534_0058_0FF85A6566381A78"/>
who was indeed one of the chief of the Fathers of that Tribe in Iſrael, which he by Office as a Miniſter of Chriſt, ſtood eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially related to.</p>
            <p>As I have not pretended to give you the full Character of him had firſt mentioned of theſe Reverend Perſons, ſo neither ſhall I now attempt it concerning him I am now more eſpecially ſpeaking of; but ſhall only briefly mention ſeveral things wherwith it pleaſed God, the Giver of every perfect Gift, the Author and Fountain of all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vertue, to qualify and adorn him. And I may truly ſay of him, that Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the goodneſs of his natural Temper, the gravity, greatneſs &amp; ſuperiority that appear'd in his Countenance, his bodily Preſence being ſo far from being Mean and Contemptible, that it was great, much above what is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; his proper Stature (he being Taller than the Common Size) with his Comely &amp; Majeſtick Aſpect, being ſuch as Commanded Reverence; and Conſidering how Wiſe and Judicious he was, with his great Prudence, his entertaining Freedom, obliging Courtesy &amp; Affability, his ſuperiour Learning, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge, his Liberal, Bountiful, Generous and Publick Spirit (in which he did much excel) his great Ability for, and Readineſs in giving Counſel in difficult and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003534_0059_0FF85A671D888430"/>
important Caſes, and how much the Care of the Churches, &amp; of the College lay upon him &amp; what a Bleſſing he was to them both; &amp; what a ſingular Gift, &amp; how happy a hand he had in managing of Controverſies and Differences, and what Influence, Sway and Auhority he had both with Miniſters and People, vea with men of all Ranks, Degrees and Orders, and how much he hath been a Healer of Breaches, Strife &amp; Diviſions among us; and how from place to place he carried the bleſſing of Peace with him, &amp; how ready and willing he was with Love to ſerve men, &amp; do good to all, &amp; how he delighted in it; and Conſidering his Orthodoxy &amp; foundneſs in the Chriſtian Faith, I mean in the Articles and Principles of our holy Religion, &amp; how much he favour'd of a gracious Spirit, and particularly in his great love to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his bleſſed Maſter; his holy Zeal for God, and againſt Sin, his humble ſubmiſſion and reſignation to divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, his great Mortification to the World; and Conſidering alſo for how many Years, &amp; how well he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Pulpit, and (in our Counſels and aſſociations) the Moderators Chair, and with how amiable a Converſation he adorn'd his Profeſſion, and how brightly the Graces and Vertues of a Christian, &amp; of a Miniſter of Chriſt ſhined forth in his Life.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003534_0060_0FF85A68AB8E6BD0"/>
And Conſidering how great &amp; good he was in the eyes both of Miniſters and People, &amp; that both at home and abroad, &amp; how much good he did in his Day, &amp; how extenſively uſeful &amp; ſerviceable, and what a Bleſſing he was in his Generation, and how becoming a Chriſtian and a Miniſter he carried himſelf both living &amp; dying: I ſay Conſidering theſe things (beſides others of the ſame kind that might be added to them) which I have thus briefly mentioned concerning this eminent Perſon, it may doubtleſs be truly ſaid of him, that he was one of the Choiceſt &amp; Greateſt Men, that have ever appear'd among us in theſe parts of the Country.</p>
            <p>The Firſt and Chief of our Colleges hath had the Honour of the Education of ſome great men, &amp; is muſt be acknowledg'd that he was one of them. In his Death a very bright &amp; precious Jewel is fallen from our Crown, &amp; much of the Glory is departed from our <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Truth is, it may be ſaid of the Reverend Miniſters of Chriſt that lately died in this Town, that they had both of them ſuch adorning Gifts and Vertues, and ſuch bright Marks &amp; Characters of true Piery, &amp; ſo many excellent things in them, that it is but paying the Tribute juſtly due to their Name and Memory (which are deſervedly dear &amp; precious to us) to ſay of them that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003534_0061_0FF85A6B31849AF0"/>
they were Choice &amp; Excellent men, &amp; that they were worthy of that high eſteem we had of them, while they lived, and of that general Lamentation and Mourning that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Death, and with which they have been followed to their Graves, &amp; hath been continued ſince they died, as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their great worth, &amp; our great loſs, in their final departure from us.</p>
            <p>When ſuch men die, we may well weep over them, as the King of Iſrael wept over the holy Prophet, 2 King. 13 14. <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Chariots of Iſrael &amp; the horſemen thereof.</hi> And indeed it will be a great &amp; high Favour of God, if their Places be ever fill'd up, which Conſidering the All ſufficiency of God our Saviour, the glorious Head &amp; King of the Church, we muſt not deſpair of, but with inſtant and earneſt Prayer wait for at the Throne of Grace with hope.</p>
            <p>God by putting out ſo many of our Lights, yea of our brighteſt Lights, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; in ſo there a time, has bro't us under an awful and very dark Diſpenſation. It is now a cloudy and dark Day with us, and in particular it may be ſaid as in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. It is a day of Darkneſs &amp; Gloomineſs, &amp; of Clouds and thick Darkneſs with this Town. I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it has never ſeen ſuch a Day as this before. And the truth is, a dark Cloud is
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003534_0062_0FF85A6EED96BB08"/>
ſpread over us all in general, the awful hand of God upon us calls for our ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Tho'ts. God's Voice to us now, is as as of old to his ancient PeopIe, Hag 5.7. <hi>Now therefore, thus faith the Lord of Hoſts, Conſider your ways.</hi> Seeing God hath of late pluck'd up ſome of the ſtrongeſt Stakes in our Hedge, removed ſome of the firmeſt, &amp; moſt poliſh'd Stones in our Wall, and thereby made great Gaps &amp; Breaches in one part and another of it: Taken away by Death, ſo many of our Moſes's and of our Aarons, of our Judges &amp; of our Prophets, and therein from Year to Year been hewing down our Pillars, both in Church and State, and taking from us the Choſen Men of our lſrael, and by Mortal Diſtempers, and by other adverſe Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions been manifeſting himſelf diſpleas'd &amp; angry with us; I ſay Conſidering theſe dark &amp; awful Frowns of Heavens diſpleaſure thus appearing againſt us, in the face of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſurely we have reaſon to ſay as in Pſal 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleſh for fear of Thee, &amp; Iam afraid of thy Judgments. And in Lam. 3.40. Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us Conſider, what if any of us ſhould die, and be called to the Bar of our judge Unprepar'd? If any of us that now ſit at the Table of the Lord, ſhould be found at laſt to

have been falſe Profeſſors, and among the fooliſh Virgins; If when God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall ſay to us, behold thy days are Numbred and Finiſhed, any of us be them found to have been unfaithful in our Places, &amp; if after all our Profeſſion, Eſteem &amp; Name on Earth, with our hopes of Heaven, we ſhould meet with that from our Judge in the other World in Rev 3.2. <hi>I have not found thy Works Perfect before God.</hi> Or that in Dan 5.27. <hi>Thou art weighed in the Ballance, &amp; art found Wanting.</hi> O how dreadful would it be! How amazing! How Confounding! How may the tho'ts of ſuch a thing, put us in mind of the words of the Prophet, Hab 3.16. <hi>When I heard my Belly trembled; my Lips quivered at the voice, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in my ſelf.</hi> And as for you that are now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in your ſins, &amp; careleſs of your Souls, that paſs your time pleaſantly &amp; merrily away, walking after the fight of your eyes, and the luſts of your hearts; that live in the Neglect &amp; Contempt of Chriſt, &amp; his great Salvation, and in daily Diſobedience to God and the Goſpel, what will you do in the end thereof? What will you do in the day of Viſitation? When God riſeth up, what will you anſwer him? To whom will you flee for help? What will you that are now Chriſt-deſpiſers &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters, do when you are dying, &amp; juſt ſlepping into Eternity? When the Judge of the World
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003534_0064_0FF85A72EE9A0DC0"/>
comes to Call you to an Account, how will you do to ſtand before him? How will you anſwer that awful Voice, that ſolemn Call of the Arch-angel with the Trump of God, and in the Name of the great Judge in theſe Words, or ſomething equivalent to them, Ariſe ve Dead and Come to Judgment</p>
            <p>And what will you do when Judgment is paſs'd upon you, if that ſhould be your Doom (which God in mercy to your Souls forbid) Matth 2.5.41. <hi>Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And if that ſhould be your caſe, Mat 25.46. <hi>And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> Sirs, Seriouſly Conſider theſe things, and ſay in your hearts, O how can I bear the Torments of eternal Fire! How can I dwell with everlaſting Burnings! O my Soul while thou haſt yet time in the world, improve it, and if poſſible get into a ſtate of Grace &amp; Salvation that thou may'ſt be ready for thy departure hence &amp; for eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that thou may'ſt not be Condemned, Loſt &amp; Damn'd forever in the other World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And Laſtly,</hi> Let us Conſider the great Uncertainty of our Time in this world. Whatever we have to do in our Publick or Private Capacities, for Body or Soul for Time or Eternity, muſt be done while this preſent Life laſts, &amp; who knows how ſhort that may
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003534_0065_0FF85A74C1F772D0"/>
be? Who can tell what the events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be in the Courſe of the preſent Year? Who knows where any that are now in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or of the Miniſters of the Goſpel here preſent, or any of us now within theſe Walls may be before another Day of Election?</p>
            <p>Let us all Conſider in how ſhort a time the Sovereign Lord of life and Time, and holy Judge of the World, may make a great Change in our preſent Place &amp; State: How ſoon may be take our Son's from our Bodies, &amp; lay our Bodies in the cold &amp; dark Grave, and ſet our Souls at his moſt awful Bar, &amp; by his definitive and irreverſible Sentence, ſetle us in our eternal State? How ſhould this affect the hearts of thoſe of us, that are in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place, both of Civil &amp; Sacred Order, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how great our work is, &amp; what a great account we have to give up to God, &amp; that it infinitely Concerns us to be ready for it?</p>
            <p>And with what ſerious &amp; ſolemn Tho'ts, ſhould all unconverted Sinners think of this, that have their Peace yet to make with their Judge, &amp; who, if they die, as they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liv'd, are ſure to receive from him a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation, a moſt fearful Doom of eternal Damnation with Devils in Hell.</p>
            <p>And as this terrible Sentence, this diſmal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Doom will ſurely be paſſed by God upon all Chriſtleſs &amp; Impenitent Sinners, at the great Day: So it will moſt certainly be Executed upon them in their future State (to which they are daily haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003534_0066_0FF85A781FC02898"/>
and that without the leaſt Pity or Mercy, except by Faith in Chriſt and true Repentance they turn from their Sins to God, before Death comes, which is daily coming, and is (doubtleſs) very near to ſome of them, &amp; God only knows who they are. Let all therefore here preſent before God, whoſe caſe this is, be adviſed &amp; perſwaded without the leaſt longer delay in the diligent uſe of God's appointed means, with fear and trembling, ariſing from a Senſe of their preſent danger, to ſeek the Lord &amp; wait upon him for his Mercy &amp; Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, while yet there may be hope. Before I Conclude, I ſhall only further ſay,</p>
            <p>We are never like to meet all together again in this World, it being very probable that our next General Meeting will be at the Bar of Chriſt, and before the Judgment Seat of God, in our Immortal and Eternal State. Now ſeeing the Caſe ſtands thus with us, Let us make it our great Care ſo to ſpend the remaining Part of our preſent, ſhort, uncertain Life, in the work of our General and Particular Callings I mean as we are Chriſtians, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Places wherein we ſtand, that we may then appear in Glory at the Right Hand of Chriſt, and give up our account to the acceptance of our Judge, and with Joy unſpeakable and Glorious in our own Souls. I ſhall Cloſe all with two Texts of Scripture agreeable to the two ſolemn Things which have been ſo much the Subject matter of this whole Diſcourſe, I mean Death and Judgment <hi>viz.</hi> Eccl. 9.10 <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work nor deviſe nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave, whether thou goest.</hi> Rom 14, 10, 11, 12. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt. For it is written, As I Live faith the Lord every knee ſhall bow to me, &amp;c. So then every one of us, ſhall give an account of himſelf to God.</hi>
