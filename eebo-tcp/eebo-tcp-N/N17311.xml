            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yet when the ſtate of the young people within the extenſive limits of this Yearly Meeting, is taken into conſideration, with the care manifeſted by Friends in Great-Britain, in the eſtabliſhment of ſchools for the

benefit of their young people not in affluent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as well as others, and attending to the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons which have been urged on various occaſions in favor of a more guarded courſe of inſtruction than is cuſtomary, it has been apprehended, that a uſe might ariſe from having an abſtract of what relates to thoſe ſchools in Great-Britain, mentioned in a publication made by Dr. John Fothergill deceaſed, on the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Ackworth, brought more generally into the view of ſociety at large, with the ſenſe of Friends in Great-Britain and America, on the ſubject of board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchools, and the neceſſity for a greater care in the education of their young people: for which purpoſe I have collected ſuch materials as would enable me to anſwer the expectation of Friends, who may be deſirous of information on this intereſting ſubject. And as the Meeting for Sufferings, in New-England, has given the ſenſe of their Yearly Meeting on this head, ſo early as the year 1690, with ſome judicious obſervations, calculated to recommend a greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the education of their youth, I ſhall, therefore, introduce the ſubject with a quotation from their epiſtle dated the 11th of the 11th month, 1782, ſigned Moſes Brown,<note n="*" place="bottom">

<q>to Friends every where, as far as they are able or capable,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022361_0004_0FB84847A0722ED0"/>
to provide ſchool-maſters and miſtreſſes who are faithful Friends, to teach and inſtruct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not to ſend them to ſuch ſchools where they are taught the corrupt ways, manners, faſhions, and language of the world, &amp;c.</q> To which the Meeting for Sufferings add, <q>The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of attention to which advice has occaſioned the well-concerned amongſt us, for the happineſs of the riſing generation, and proſperity of truth, to mourn for the hurt thereby ſuſtained in our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—Our principles lead to a ſeparation from the world, its cuſtoms, habits, language, and manners; how, then, can we hope for faithful ſucceſſors in our poſterity, or that they will come up in principles and practice agreeable thereto, if we continue ſo far to neglect the <hi>early</hi> care of our offspring, as to ſend them to ſchools, where principles and practices ſo repugnant are taught.— It is eſſential to the continuance of every ſociety upon the foundation of its riſe and eſtabliſhment, that its firſt principles be often recurred to. The principles of light and truth, which firſt ſeparated our antients from the world, early led George Fox into a ſight of the neceſſity of a ſeparation from the world in the education of ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which advice, if attended to in ſome inſtances, has never been ſo fully regarded as its importance requires; owing to various circumſtances which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

but be obvious to the well-informed, and which likewiſe appears to have been the caſe in Great-Britain, from what has been obſerved by Doctor Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thergill, reſpecting the ſchools amongſt them; and as an account of theſe ſchools may prove ſatisfactory to many, and ſhew the neceſſity for a greater care in the education of our youth, I have been large in my quotations reſpecting them, more eſpecially as the inconveniences which have attended moſt of them, led to the foundation of that noble inſtitution at Ackworth, and appear to be the ſame which we have experienced in America, with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which are mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the account of theſe ſchools we are informed
<q>of one at Gilderſome in Yorkſhire, which was ſet on foot by the activity of Friends, who have the immediate care of it, and from whom it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a generous ſupport; yet as it is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the liberality of friends within the limits of the neighbourhood, or of the Monthly Meeting of Brighouſe, by whoſe generoſity it was ſet on foot, it was thought the plan was <hi>too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> to admit of that uſefulneſs, which that at Ackworth promiſed: eſpecially as the <hi>price of education</hi> was neceſſarily greater, as was found on experience; altho' by the activity of Friends, who had the care of it, Gilderſome ſchool has proved beneficial to many children, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many to be brought from a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:022361_0006_0FB8484AA2A34F40"/>
                  <q>Beſides this, there is another houſe for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Friends' children, which has been founded in London, and ſupported almoſt ſolely by Friends of the Quarterly Meeting of London, that is, Friends' ſchool-houſe and workhouſe at Clerken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; the following circumſtances are mentioned reſpecting it: many well-diſpoſed perſons, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtate of the poor in LONDON, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that many of the aged, as well as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of divers, might be better ſupported and more ſuitably educated, were they collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, where every thing neceſſary for their well-being might be provided, more to their comfort than at their own habitations. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly about the year 1700, this buſineſs was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and liberally proceeded in, and was ſo prudently conducted, that it drew many perſons of note of other perſuaſions, to viſit it; which was the means of deriving credit to the ſociety, and of exciting a degree of the like attention to ſuch uſeful undertakings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A committee of eighteen Friends, choſen from the ſeveral Monthly Meetings, meet for the moſt part once a month to tranſact the buſineſs of the houſe; beſides weekly viſitors who inſpect at <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſeaſons</hi> the conduct of the family.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Under ſuch management it cannot be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, that the eſtabliſhment ſhould become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022361_0007_0FB8484C21F88498"/>
The fund is about £. 20,000; ariſing from the generoſity and bequeſts of individuals among Friends in that metropolis, a very few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances excepted; in which ſum is included a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy left by our deceaſed friend, Devereaux Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of London, of THREE THOUSAND POUNDS.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it appears from a local circumſtance that the benefits derived from this inſtitution have not been in every reſpect equal to the hopes of Friends;
<q>too few of the youth educated, the number conſidered, having turned out uſeful or reputable members of ſociety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Two cauſes are aſſigned for this diſappointment; one is,
<q>the ſcholars were permitted too frequently to be in the ſtreets, alſo had liberty at times to viſit their friends and relations, not always the moſt exemplary in their conduct; by which means they contracted ill manners and worſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and returned to the houſe in every reſpect worſe than when they left it." Another cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned is, "that a conſiderable number of antient poor are maintained under the ſame roof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome of whom have been brought to this ſituation by their miſconduct, and conſequently, not the moſt likely perſons to ſet the children a commendable example.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:022361_0008_0FB8484D9E80C6E0"/>One other ſchool is mentioned which ſhows the pernicious influence of bad example, which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice;
<q>A ſchool-houſe was built, an able and well-qualified maſter procured, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds generouſly ſubſcribed by Friends, for a day-ſchool: but ſuch was the ill effects of the children <hi>mixing with others,</hi> ſo much were they hurt by bad examples and bad company, that thoſe who had engaged in the generous deſign, found it neceſſary to abandon it, merely, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, from this circumſtance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſchool at Clerkenwell has lately had divers bequeſts made to it for the purpoſe of increaſing apprentice-fees, and further encouragement to ſuch children of both ſexes as may deſerve it after a certain age, and ſome regulations have been made to prevent the youth mixing with others; with a view to preſerve them from the influence of bad example.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How far Friends' care in this reſpect may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the deſired benefits in that large metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, we are yet to learn in the conduct of the youth who may be brought up at that ſchool: that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable endeavours were not uſed previous to the publication of theſe remarks, cannot be urged as an objection to a more ſelect and guarded education, as will appear by the following ſhort account of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022361_0009_0FB8484F2F20A2E0"/>
Friends' labor to preſerve them in <hi>ſo expoſed a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> "There is not," proceeds the ſaid Friend,
<q>an inſtitution exiſting, upon which more labor and diſintereſted endeavours, that every thing might be managed with order, oeconomy, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and general benefit, have been employed, than in this houſe (Clerkenwell:) ſuch is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of preſerving youth from the influence of bad example, if we hope to preſerve them in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and ſimplicity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The importance of a right education is ſuch, that it is no occaſion of ſurpriſe when we conſider the failure of thoſe inſtitutions already mentioned, of anſwering all the ſalutary purpoſes expected from them, with the concern of friends, as mentioned in the following extract from the Minutes of the Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting of Great-Britain in 1777, that they ſhould be induced to turn their attention to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on an enlarged plan, ſo as to obviate the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which they had ſo diſcouragingly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. The extract is as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is the renewed concern of this Meeting to recommend a care for the offspring of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe earnings or incomes are ſo ſmall as to render them incapable of giving their children a ſuitable and guarded education, and that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from home, by which they may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from mixing with others who are not of our

religious perſuaſion, which ſo often leads into hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful habits, from which they are not afterwards eaſily reclaimed: and as ſome of our members may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſly permit their offspring to ſuffer this great loſs, rather than apply for aſſiſtance from their Monthly Meetings; it is recommended to Friends in every Monthly Meeting, to ſeek out ſuch of their members as may be thus ſtraitened, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to their help, and it is deſired that ſuch will receive the ſalutary aid with a willing mind, and thankfulneſs to the great Author of all good. And it being the judgment of this meeting that encouragement for boarding ſchools, ſuitable for the education of children whoſe parents are not in affluence, will be advantageous, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a plan for that purpoſe is referred to the Meeting for Sufferings, to be laid before this Meeting next year; to which Friends in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are alſo deſired to join their attention and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances gave occaſion to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of a large and commodious building which had been erected at a place called ACKWORTH, in Yorkſhire, for a Foundling HOSPITAL, but through miſmanagement had been left unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This building with the premiſes was offered for ſale for £. 7000, a purchaſer having appeared
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022361_0011_0FB84852E3E11EA0"/>
who offered £. 6800 for it: in conſequence of which the matter was laid before the Meeting for Sufferings. This Meeting, upon deliberation, were deſirous to refer the ſubject to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enſuing Yearly Meeting; but this was neceſſarily prevented by the unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the other purchaſer: this induced a number of Friends to ſtep forward with an offer to bear the Meeting for Sufferings harmleſs, ſhould the Yearly Meeting decline the purchaſe: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accepted, a contract for the buildings, &amp;c. was made, and the matter reſerved for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Yearly Meeting in 1778, when it was agreed to, and became a ſociety concern.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall be more particular in what relates to this ſchool, as it furniſhes us with an inſtance of great liberality in Friends of Great-Britain, and the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations intended to be (and which afterwards were) introduced into that ſchool are proper for imitation, and may be conſidered as part of the Plan of education now propoſed for the young people in theſe parts: for which reaſons I hope it will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove unacceptable nor uſeleſs. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed.</p>
               <p>Previous to the Yearly Meeting coming to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
<q>a committee of one Friend out of every county, together with the Meeting for Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, with any others who choſe to attend, was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022361_0012_0FB8485527E47E70"/>
early appointed to take this weighty ſubject into conſideration, after various meetings of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, a report was agreed to, recommending, beſides the purchaſe of the buildings, &amp;c. a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to be ſet on foot during the ſitting of the Meeting, by donations, by annuities on two lives, at 5 per cent. each,<note n="*" place="bottom">The perſon who chooſes to make his ſubſcription in this way, names any two perſons, and fixes a ſum, on which he agrees to pay 5 per cent. per annum during the continuance of their two lives, be they longer or ſhorter.</note> and by bills of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at eight guineas each:<note n="†" place="bottom">It is apprehended, the perſon who ſubſcribes in this way is entitled, for every eight guineas he ſubſcribes, to a ticket, which will give admittance to any perſon into the ſchool for one year to whom he pleaſes to preſent it, provided they are approved of by the committee nominated for that purpoſe.</note> after deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the report was received by the Yearly Meeting, and the propoſed ſubſcription was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and ſtrongly recommended to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which proceedings our friend John Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill obſerves;
<q>The great unanimity that prevailed in the ſeveral ſittings of the committee, apparently proceeding from a juſt ſenſe of the want of ſome ſuch inſtitution; the cordial, tho' not haſty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Yearly Meeting with the report of the committee; and the generous exertions of many Friends in conſequence of this concurrence, afforded ſuch an indication of the propriety of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022361_0013_0FB848572370A5A8"/>
concern, that FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in three or four days, and diſpelled all the doubts he had entertained about it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ACKWORTH is ſituate in Yorkſhire, about 180 miles from London; the building appears by a front view given of it, in the account from which theſe extracts were made, nearly to reſemble the ſtate-houſe in Philadelphia, and equally extenſive, beſides having two wings, which, with the centre buildings, form a hollow ſquare: the whole being in good repair, large, commodious, and judiciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived; every convenience in the arrangement of the apartments ſeems to have been attended to, and no kind of office or out-houſe omitted, which might be neceſſary for the accommodation of a large family; hence it appears to have been a circumſtance peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly favorable to Friends' views, that this building with the appurtenances was to be had at this time.</p>
               <p>By a ground-plot it appears, that there was about 85 acres of land belonging to the premiſes, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with them, containing a garden and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures: ſince then there has been added about 40 acres more, which they were enabled to purchaſe by legacies left for that particular purpoſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">In future it is intended that all donations or bequeſts of £. 50. or upwards, be placed out ſo as to form a fund, and the principal not to be applied towards the current expenſes of the inſtitution.</note>

               <p>The management of this inſtitution was originally committed to the Meeting for Sufferings, but is ſince under the direction of a large committee united with them, compoſed of repreſentatives from the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings, of the agents of the inſtitution for the ſeveral counties and places, the treaſurer of the ſame, with the members of the London and county com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, who meet annually at Ackworth on the laſt fourth day of the ſeventh month in every year, for the purpoſe of making regulations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fund and proviſion made by Friends have been ſufficient to enable them to pay for the eſtate, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, victual, clothe, and accommodate upwards of 300 children, girls and boys, annually, for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, beſides making a proper compenſation to the neceſſary maſters, miſtreſſes, and other perſons employed, at what they conſider a ſmall expenſe to the children's parents or friends; and by reports made of the proceedings in this very laudable and beneficent work, there appear grounds to hope that it will prove an uſeful eſtabliſhment, and not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the labor and patronage of Friends.</p>

                  <q>As this ſchool was more particularly deſigned for the children of Friends not in affluent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is intended to direct their education accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and to have them not only <hi>maintained and clothed,</hi> but inſtructed in reading, writing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, as fully as the time allowed them will permit; ſome uſeful employment may be provided for the boys, according to their age, ſtrength, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, or as their condition may require.

               </p>
               <p>Our Friend before mentioned obſerves,
<q>that as many Friends were not able to make the neceſſary proviſion for their offspring in ſuch a way as would preſerve them from the ill effects of mixing with corrupt company; and being apprized of this as well as many other circumſtances," it is ſuppoſed "he was led to conſider the ſubject of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation," in its fulleſt extent, "with a warm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to promote it;</q>
in conſequence of which he has left ſome profitable inſtructions, which thoſe who are entruſted with the care of youth, would do well to attend to, and for their benefit I have ſubjoined ſome of the moſt neceſſary to be known, viz.</p>
               <p>He ſays, that
<q>it is the wiſh of thoſe concerned, as he believes, by gentleneſs, kind and affectionate

treatment, holding out encouragement and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the deſerving, exerting the influence of the fear of ſhame,<note n="*" place="bottom">Whether this may operate to the children's advantage, will altogether depend upon the qualification of the teacher.</note> and by prompting them to acts of kindneſs and beneficence one towards another, to bring forward into the ſociety and its ſervice, a number of youth who may have been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted under ſuch tuition, in degree, with the diſcipline of wiſdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Many children amongſt us (proceeds the ſaid Friend) ſuſtain a grievous loſs by not being early and properly made acquainted with the principles we profeſs. For want of this inſtruction, they become too eaſy a prey to the cuſtoms of the world and its habitudes; and that which would be as a kind of hedge about them, and preſerve from many temptations, is laid waſte, and all the allurements of vice and folly ſuffered to ſeduce their affections to their ruin. For when they ceaſe to be diſtinguiſhed from others by their garb and deportment, they too often ceaſe to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the world by their morals, and the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their conduct.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is therefore intended to make the children of both ſexes acquainted with the hiſtory of the riſe and progreſs of Friends, their ſufferings, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022361_0018_0FB848666ADA3700"/>
the indulgences granted them by the legiſlature, as well as the general doctrines of religion and morality," and to train them up in the knowledge of the ſacred writings; on which there is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: "Too few are the parents who can honeſtly ſay, that they train up their children in a godly converſation; in plainneſs of ſpeech, behaviour, and apparel; and the frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures. Here (at Ackworth) care will be taken both of their principles and conduct: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is hoped that ſuitable opportunities will be embraced of cheriſhing in their tender minds, obedience to the inward principle of light and truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as it is of great importance to habituate children from their infancy to ſilence and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only as a preparative to their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a religious life, but as the ground-work of a well cultivated underſtanding, it will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly regarded.<note n="*" place="bottom">To watch over the human heart is a circumſtance of greater importance than mankind in general ſeem to underſtand.</note> We are almoſt the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, who acknowledge the uſe of this abſolutely neceſſary introduction to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knowledge and Chriſtian practice. To have the active minds of children early put under this kind of reſtraint, to be accuſtomed to turn their attention from external objects, and habituated to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022361_0019_0FB84867F3FE8430"/>
a degree of abſtracted quiet, is a matter of great conſequence, and may be of laſting benefit to them. To this they are inured in our aſſemblies, and to ſit in ſilence with decency and compoſure. Tho' it cannot be ſuppoſed their young and active minds are always engaged as they ought to be, yet to be accuſtomed thus to ſtillneſs, and brought to curb and reſtrain the ſallies of their youthful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, is no ſmall point gained towards fixing a habit of patient recollection, and a regard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, which ſeldom forſakes thoſe who have been accuſtomed to it, and have been properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in this entrance to the ſchool of wiſdom, during the reſidue of their days.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it was needful it might not be difficult to ſhew, from abundant authority and reaſon itſelf, the vaſt aid afforded to the improvement of the human mind, by early habits of ſilent attention. The moſt antient ſchools of philoſophy taught and practiſed it; and the Scriptures are ſo full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts on this head, as ought to remove every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this neceſſary duty.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It has been thought that a uſe would ariſe from a care in the maſters and miſtreſſes, to have their ſchools adjourned with greater decorum than is generally the practice; and that a ſhort pauſe previous thereto would afford them an opportunity, when neceſſary, to extend ſuitable reproof or encouragement, as well as to diſmiſs their ſcholars more in the quiet.</note>

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:022361_0020_0FB8486A267F7FD0"/>To which he ſubjoins, as a further motive for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in the undertaking,
<q>And as there are many children, who, by the remoteneſs of their parents' ſituation from meetings, are deſtitute of ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, it is another call to the ſociety, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as much as poſſible the loſs ariſing from ſuch a circumſtance. To this conſideration it will not be improper to add another which is connected with it, and that is, the want of opportunities of ſending their children to Friends' ſchools; by which means, if they have any learning at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, it is under the tuition of ſuch as are moſtly ſtrangers to our principles, and the practices derived from them, plainneſs of ſpeech, ſimplicity of manners, and that beginning of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is inſpired by the fear of the Lord. On the contrary, they are liable to aſſociate with ſuch children as are unacquainted with all theſe things, taught to deride thoſe who practiſe them, and live at large to appetite and cuſtom: and how often does it happen that the children of Friends in ſuch ſituations, bred up with unprincipled, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious youth, form connexions with them, to their own great hurt, the diſtreſs of their parents, and the loſs of many valuable members to ſociety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is propoſed, when the ſchool is opened, a meeting for worſhip ſhall be held in the houſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Which is accordingly done.</note>

every firſt-day morning and afternoon: likewiſe a meeting on the fourth day of the week, theſe times being judged moſt convenient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As an inſtance of the care which was intended to be taken with the youth in that ſchool, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quotation may not be unacceptable, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perhaps (ſays our Friend) there is nothing in the courſe of public education in the world, that ſo unfits men for that humble attention to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine monitor within, renders them ſuch perfect ſtrangers to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity and all its happy effects, as the cultivation of a bold, unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition, under a notion of promoting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and courage: it too often ſets aſide that great defence and ornament of youth, a modeſt, ingenuous temper, accuſtoms them to throw off all the reſtraints of duty and affection, and at length to bid defiance to intreaty, admonition, and reproof. At Ackworth, endeavours will be uſed to form in the children a temper widely different, equally remote from a culpable fear and ſervility, and an audacity that knows no reſpect for order or authority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to the dreſs of the children at that ſchool, it is remarked,
<q>The children at Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth are to wear the ſame kind of garments;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022361_0022_0FB8486DE3DF2E88"/>
regard being had to the dreſs of the different ſexes;" he ſays, "for various reaſons the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal is a good one. The children there ought to value themſelves on no other ſuperiority than that of behaving themſelves better than others, both in reſpect to learning and conduct. They are all to conſider themſelves, and be conſidered, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of one family, under the care of that body, which deeply intereſts itſelf in the welfare of them all. The riches, the poverty, the good or bad conduct of their connexions, muſt have no other regard paid to them, than ſuch as may proceed from the neceſſity of guarding them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of any circumſtances prevailing to their future diſadvantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude what relates to the ſubject of the children's education, I ſhall add the following ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious obſervation;
<q>Tho' the children's improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in learning, their health, and other ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accommodations, are matters of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch an inſtitution as this, yet there is one of a ſuperior nature, to promote a tender, teachable diſpoſition, inuring them to bear that yoke in their youth, which will moderate their deſires, and make way for the ſoftening influence of divine good-will in their hearts, fitting them for the faithful diſcharge of every duty in life, yielding content in affliction, moderation in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becoming at once the ſafeguard and ornament
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022361_0023_0FB8486F6E8F9DE0"/>
of every ſtage in life, from youth to ripe old age.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This ſhould be the conſtant, uniform endeavour of thoſe who may be engaged in the immediate care and ſervice of the family, in whatever ſtation they may be placed: for the encouragement, of thoſe who may be thus engaged, he adds, "it is hoped they will bear ſome little difficulties, ſhould they occur, as endeavours will be uſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them, ſo that the good of the youth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their care ſhall be built as little as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible on the ſufferings of any individual.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As theſe obſervations will convey ſome idea of the education which is deſired for our young people, and the nature of the inſtitution which is now propoſed, I hope it will be needleſs to apologize for their length, and it may be ſufficient to add, that ſchool has been conducted nearly agreeable to theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, much to the ſatisfaction of Friends, as far as we learn, and there is a pleaſing proſpect of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing extenſively uſeful to ſociety, and beneficial to the youth who may be educated therein.</p>

               <p>TO ripen this concern, and to prepare it for the conſideration of Friends in a collective capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was ſuppoſed that a PLAN more particularly accommodated to our circumſtances would be uſeful.

If it ſhould not meet with general approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all its parts, it is to be hoped that it will not prove a diſcouragement to the undertaking; as it cannot be doubted, that a ſolid committee of the Yearly Meeting would be enabled to improve upon any hints that might be offered for conſideration by an individual, and that ſuch parts as may appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, would be either explained or expunged, and ſuch others added, as would bring it into a ſtate to meet with general acceptance.</p>
               <p>The PLAN is as follows:</p>

It has been thought adviſable that a ſtanding committee be appointed by the Yearly Meeting, veſted with all the neceſſary powers <note n="*" place="bottom">The epiſtle on this ſubject from the Meeting for Sufferings, in New-England, particularizes what is meant by theſe powers, and may be referred to, ſhould information be wanting.</note> to tranſact the buſineſs relating to this concern in its fulleſt extent; their proceedings and conduct to be ſubject to the direction and reviſion of the ſaid Meeting, as it may think proper.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:022361_0025_0FB848742EC7CCB0"/>II. That a tract of good land of 1000 acres be purchaſed in a healthy ſituation, not too remote from the ſeat of the Yearly Meeting, where ſuitable build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be provided or erected, according to the views of Friends, ſo as to accommodate the ſcholars and all others concerned on the premiſes, and the land occupied in ſuch way as will beſt contribute to afford ſupplies to the ſcholars, and promote the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That it be recommended to Friends in the ſubordinate Meetings to encourage a free, voluntary, and liberal contribution for this purpoſe, which ſhould be continued from time to time until a permanent and adequate proviſion be obtained.</p>
               <p>Note, I have propoſed a much larger tract of land for the uſe of the inſtitution amongſt us than they have at Ackworth, for theſe reaſons: land of equal quality is to be had at a much lower price here, where it would ſuit for ſuch a purpoſe, than in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and the product of land properly occupied would afford a better return for money than could be had in any other way, for the ſupply of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with neceſſary food, fuel, timber, &amp;c. and after having overcome the difficulty of a firſt purchaſe, would become a permanent and improving eſtate; and a foundation might be laid for a ſettlement where artificers and huſbandmen would be collected to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct many youth in various branches of buſineſs,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022361_0026_0FB848756020F1F0"/>
free from the corrupt examples which a mixture of different people might occaſion, as well as other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that would probably attend it, which need not be mentioned.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That regular minutes be kept of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and expenditures, with the ſums ſubſcribed, or the eſtates granted, and which may be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or remain in reverſion; with all other matters relative to, and for the ſupport of, this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo as to afford a clear view of the ſtate of the inſtitution and fund belonging to it; in order that proper endeavours may be uſed, and ſuitable advice extended from year to year, for the encouragement and ſupport of the undertaking.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Beſides uſeful learning, the boys and girls are to be inſtructed in ſuch manual buſineſs and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic employments of every kind, as may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Friends' proſpects of uſefulneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, or redound to the benefit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In providing of buildings regard is to be had to ſuch as may be neceſſary for tradeſmen and others, whoſe aſſiſtance may be required, either for labor or the inſtruction and accommodation of the youth, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent of the fund,</hi> as well as for the accommodation of thoſe who may have occaſion to reſort to, or be reſident at, the place; and it is to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022361_0027_0FB84876E1F0BC68"/>
be obſerved, that none be permitted to be reſident there, but ſuch as are of ſober, exemplary conduct, and pious converſation; that the youth may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in ſuch way that there may be a rational proſpect of their being preſerved in innocence.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That a ſteward and clerk, with a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Friend to act as ſuperintendants, be appointed; the two latter continually or occaſionally to inſpect into the ſtate of the ſchools, the places of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and maintenance of the youth, and report to the committee of the Yearly Meeting, the ſtate of things from time to time, extend the advice of the ſaid committee with their rules and orders to all concerned, and ſee to the due execution of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe general heads of a plan, ſome other rules will be neceſſary for the government of the ſchools, and accommodation of the families; the diſcipline to be obſerved by the youth, and order to be eſtabliſhed where they are boarded; as well as for the improvement to be made on the premiſes, and management of the farms, with a view to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſupport of the family, tend to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the young people, and add a reputation to the ſchool; likewiſe to preſerve order and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a neceſſary ſyſtem of oeconomy, ſo as to afford a proper ſupply without profuſion or waſte: all which ſhould be attended to by the general committee of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022361_0028_0FB84878BB1BE1B8"/>
the Yearly Meeting, as there may be occaſion, with ſuch other matters as may be needful.</p>
               <p>Thoſe very pertinent remarks made by our valued friend John Fothergill deceaſed, with a view to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the moral and religious improvement of the youth, will no doubt claim the attention of thoſe entruſted with the management of this inſtitution, as objects of ſuperior conſequence; or any hints for that purpoſe which may be ſuggeſted by Friends of experience.</p>
               <p>To enter into every minute circumſtance which will be proper for their attention, cannot be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on this occaſion: yet, as a few leading rules for the government of thoſe concerned, may be of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſe, and afford to others a more ſatisfactory view of the deſign, as well as prove an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome to unite in their endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, or induce them to entruſt the care of their tender offspring at ſuch a place, the following are ſubjoined by way of information, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The houſes for the accommodation of the youth are propoſed to be of a moderate ſize, and at proper diſtances from each other, with neceſſary apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. ſo as to afford comfortable accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the children, who ought not to be crowded in too great numbers together, that they may have
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022361_0029_0FB8487AC3AA9170"/>
the benefit of a private reſidence and a public educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the ſame time.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That each family conſiſt of not more than the man and woman Friend who are to board the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, with their children, and the neceſſary domeſtics, and <note n="*" place="bottom">The number is left for future conſideration.</note> 
                  <hi>pupils,</hi> whereby they may with more eaſe extend the neceſſary care and attention to the conduct of the youth; apply ſuitable advice, admonition, or reproof, or occaſionally, by kind and gentle treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, encourage thoſe who may require it; beſides, the health of the young people would be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be preſerved, when not too numerous in one family; their accommodations made more agreeable, as well as more ſuitable to their age, ſo that in caſe of indiſpoſition they might be better attended, and their wants more ſuitably relieved: nor would it be leſs conducive to their general improvement; as the girls might, by rotation, as they became able, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in domeſtic employments, ſo as to qualify them in turn to fill up thoſe ſtations in ſociety which may fall to their allotment, with propriety: the boys likewiſe may find a ſhare, and not unprofitably, in thoſe duties, added to the care of the gardens, &amp;c. whereby they would find employment for their leiſure hours, be taught to fill up a painful vacancy by ſome profitable labor, derive inſtruction from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the works of Providence, be benefited by
<pb n="31"
                      facs="unknown:022361_0030_0FB8487C9B5BB150"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
moderate exerciſe, and probably enjoy
<q>a healthy mind with a healthy body:</q>
and might have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many young people who have been brought up in cities or large towns, advantages which cannot be obtained in ſuch places.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is ſuppoſed that the ſchool-houſes for the boys ſhould be ſituate at a convenient diſtance from thoſe for the girls, to prevent any improper familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: likewiſe that they be boarded in different hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; yet not ſo far ſeparated but that an innocent and cheerful intercourſe may be allowed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged under ſuitable inſpection at proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And that each one employed be generally confined to their reſpective duties. The youth had better not be boarded with their tutors; as it might draw their attention from their ſchooling, and occaſion a greater burden than ought to be the ſhare of any individual, beſides other inconveniences which might attend it; it is therefore propoſed, that the perſons who board the youth ſhould confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the care of their wards, and ſee that they give proper attendance at ſchool, and alſo watch over their general conduct and attention to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Care ſhould likewiſe be taken to prevent rambling in the ſcholars, as well as unprofitable
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022361_0031_0FB8487DF47B5168"/>
collections of neighbouring people at leiſure ſeaſons, in ſuch a manner as might diſturb the order and quiet of the family.</p>
               <p>Having taken into conſideration ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as opened in my view, as moſt likely to promote the accommodation of the youth, and tend to their preſervation in innocence, what relates to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is ſo well known and ſo judiciouſly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Friends, that at this time it only remains for me to add, with reſpect to the intention of this inſtitution, that it is deſigned to provide for any who may need the benefit of ſuch a ſchool; the wealthy and thoſe who are not in affluent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are intended to be alike the objects of Friends' care, with this diſtinction only, that thoſe who can afford it, may be accommodated, ſchooled, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on ſuch reaſonable terms as ſhall be aſſeſſed by the committee of the Yearly Meeting; but thoſe not in affluence ſhall receive the ſame advantages ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free of coſt, or at ſuch moderate charge as may be ſuited to their circumſtances.</p>
               <p>A plan ſo large and calculated to be ſo extenſively uſeful, may ſtartle ſome who have been accuſtomed to view things on a more contracted ſcale, appear to be difficult in the execution, and be ſuppoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the abilities of the ſociety: with reſpect to theſe points, the proſpects of ſome may differ until the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment be made; it may be remembered that there
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022361_0032_0FB8487F76E99630"/>
is nothing new in the deſign, nor in the execution;<note n="*" place="bottom">The extraordinary inſtance of the ſchool at Glaucha, near Hall in Saxony, is worthy of notice on this occaſion. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Herman Franck, a German miniſter at that place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, from motives of humanity, to ſchool and provide ſupport for poor children, whoſe ignorance had excited his compaſſion; for which purpoſe he fixed up a charity-box in his place of reſidence, with an inſcription on it intimating his deſign: upon which ſome perſon was moved, in about a quarter of a year afterwards, to put into his box to the value of 18<hi>ſ</hi>6 ſterling at one time; which ſo encouraged this pious perſon, that he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay the foundation of a charity-ſchool, without any other proviſion than what he might be furniſhed with from time to time from the benevolence of well-diſpoſed perſons, and without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any united with him in this concern, but ſuch as were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed in the ſervice of the ſchool; which experienced ſuch a ſeries of providential ſupport, that he was enabled to carry on his generous deſign thro' many difficulties and great diſtreſs without obſtruction, until he had laid the foundation of conſiderable build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which he at length accompliſhed; and in the courſe of a few years, it is related, that this ſchool, which was begun with ſo ſlender a capital as 18<hi>ſ</hi>6 ſterling, had upwards of 200 poor ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars clothed, fed, and accommodated with good dwelling-places, beſides receiving the neceſſary ſchool-learning, &amp;c. free of coſt: and this charity was continued, as he remarks,
<q>without any ſettled proviſion, and without any regard to human ſupport, but reliance on Providence, and he did not ſcruple to make daily additions to the number of their children; and thus the firſt foundation of the ſchool was laid: and he obſerves, that he was led to engage in this deſign without having premeditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a project, but thinks it was by a ſecret guidance of the Lord, that he was carried to the performance of ſuch things as tended to an end he had not as yet conceived; and that the experience for ſuch a work grew up with the work itſelf.</q>
The many inſtances of unexpected relief which he met with in the proſecution of this laudable undertaking, as related in the account publiſhed reſpecting this ſchool, were accompanied with ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as will ſcarcely be received as credible in an age of ſcepticiſm and unbelief: otherwiſe the recital of a few of thoſe paſſages might afford encouragement to thoſe who are engaged in ſimilar designs, and be a ſtronger confirmation of the ſacred pages in what relates to a providential ſupport, than ſome who are hedged <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Friends might be called upon by various motives to favor ſuch an undertaking, as the ſufferings of their anceſtors, and the ſacrifices they had to make of a large portion of their property by ſpoiling, &amp;c. in obedience to Chriſt, whereby we have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to experience an exemption from many grievous burdens yet impoſed on the profeſſors of other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious denominations, thro' their attachment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive forms and ceremonies introduced amongſt them in times of greater ignorance; not to mention the various inſtances of extravagance and diſſipation which too many freely indulge themſelves in, with the very expenſive education which they give their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and yet we have been ſhown in this inſtitution at Glaucha near Hall, as well as in other inſtances, what might be done with proper exertions and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on divine Providence; which encourages a hope we ſhall be enabled to eſtabliſh, provide for, and ſupport, in a reputable, uſeful manner, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution now propoſed, which ſeeems to be, at this time of outward care, both our intereſt and duty.</p>

               <head>SECTION III.</head>
               <p>AS there are ſome whoſe engagements will not permit them to enter minutely into an inquiry of this nature, ſo as to form an adequate idea of the undertaking without ſome aſſiſtance; for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theſe, and that they may be encouraged to unite in promoting ſuch a plan, the following exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into the propriety thereof is added, eſpecially as it may afford ſome uſeful information, and point out the neceſſity of attention to this very weighty ſubject.</p>
               <p>When we conſider that the youth amongſt us need the ſame care that they do in Great-Britain, and that the ſame meaſures are neceſſary to be purſued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their welfare here as there, and as we have the benefit of their experience to aſſiſt us in the proſecution of our endeavours, it is an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the undertaking.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding there may be an apparent languor in ſome minds with reſpect to this moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern, yet when the caſe of our young people is brought into view, and found to claim our ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, as well as call for ſome relief, no doubt that it will be conſidered as a powerful motive to engage in ſo beneficent a deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:022361_0035_0FB84888963EA038"/>And when we conſider how many there are who are favored with abundant opportunities of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond what others have, and how ſmall a part of the redundancy of that property which many are poſſeſſed of, if brought together into one ſum, would afford a fund which, under the management of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and well qualified committee of the Yearly Meeting, would lay the foundation of a ſchool which might have all the advantages of that at Ackworth, with ſuch others as the peculiar circumſtances of the youth in this highly favored country might make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, we cannot but ſuppoſe that Friends might be brought to unite with, and ſupport, a plan for ſo valuable a purpoſe. And it ſhould be remembered, as was obſerved on the like occaſion by John Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill,
<q>that it is not intended to burden any, for large contributions are not to be expected where there is but little to be ſpared,</q>
nor would it add a reputation to thoſe who have abundance, ſhould they withhold the neceſſary aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Many advantages are expected to reſult from this undertaking, that are not ſo apparent on a ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al view as they would be found on a cloſer inquiry, both with reſpect to what relates to the temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the young people, as well as their future well-being: beſides as all things here below are in a ſtate of mutability, we know not but that, whilſt we are providing for others, ſome of our particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants may be benefited by ſuch an inſtitution, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022361_0036_0FB8488C05D00980"/>
that we may be laying the foundation of a retreat for them, in a healthy part of the country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of ſober, well qualified friends, where they may be inſtructed and ſupported, free from the corrupt examples, which cities and too many ſchools afford, whilſt they are in a ſtate of incapacity to form a proper judgment or take ſuitable care for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe, with other important conſiderations which might be mentioned, ſhow that it is both ſeaſonable and proper for this concern to reſt with weight upon Friends' minds; and it is hoped that what has been ſaid will be ſufficient to prepare them for the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this ſubject free from thoſe biaſſes, which habits, with local or partial attachments, might cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; neither regarding the objects of this benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as they may be rich or poor, remote from us in their reſidence, or near; otherwiſe than as it may tend to their individual advantage and the benefit of ſociety in general: and after having the ſituation of many of our young people brought into their view, with other circumſtances, it is expected they would be enabled to form a clear judgment how far they might extend their proſpects, ſo as not to exceed the abilities of ſociety, nor yet forget the extenſive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which ſuch an inſtitution would afford.</p>
               <p>For which purpoſe the following ſtate of the youth who are deſcendants of Friends, and for whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

            <head>A STATE OF THE YOUTH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">I. On an examination into the ſituation of the young people within the compaſs of this Yearly Meeting, it muſt be acknowledged that many would be found, who, at an early period of their days, have been deprived of one or both their parents; perhaps left under the care of ſtrangers, or entruſted
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022361_0038_0FB84893A7387F30"/>
to guardians not in all reſpects qualified to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them in their afflictive ſituations, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to extend that kind attention to their caſes, which might in ſome degree compenſate for the loſs of parental care and affection: and perhaps ſome of this number might not be ſuitably provided for, as well as others who have parents, who, thro' various circumſtances, have been deprived of the means of providing a decent ſupport for their tender offspring, and much leſs of ability to ſchool and educate them properly. Theſe with many other circumſtances open a field continually for the exerciſe of Chriſtian ſympathy and benevolence.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there are many in affluent ſituations who are earneſtly deſirous that their children might have the benefit of a ſelect and guarded education, at ſuch an inſtitution, under well qualified tutors, remote from the corrupt examples which are too prevalent in cities and common ſchools; theſe would freely contribute of their ſubſtance, and they ought to be encouraged in the commendable diſpoſition, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the pious recommendation of Friends already expreſſed, and to the ſoundeſt maxims of prudence and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe other caſes that would occur, where the diſpoſition of children of the ſame family, as well as other cauſes which might make it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or uſeful to ſeparate them for awhile one from
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022361_0039_0FB84750493888E0"/>
another; ſometimes to diſſolve unprofitable acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances or unpromiſing connexions, which otherwiſe might terminate to their diſadvantage, if not eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to their ruin. That a large number of young people of both ſexes would come under theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in one or more inſtances, muſt be allowed; as alſo others, who, from inclination, would prefer the opportunity which ſuch an inſtitution would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, of being inſtructed under a well regulated ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem with ſober Friends.</p>
            <p>And yet it is with ſatisfaction to be acknowledged, that many of our young people are ſo peculiarly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored as to have every accommodation neceſſary to render their ſituations eaſy and agreeable; and ſome who have the additional advantage of well informed friends and relations, whoſe pious converſation and exemplary conduct are the ſources of continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and improvement; independent of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which ſchooling may afford: but as this is not the caſe generally, and there are others ſo ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to need the care of Friends, it therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us, as members of one religious community, to afford that relief which their ſeveral caſes may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which cannot be ſo effectually done in any other way. Theſe circumſtances, without bringing into view others which might be mentioned, which ariſe from weakneſs in parents and ſorrowful declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in too many children, which cannot but be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, ſhow the propriety of an attention to this
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022361_0040_0FB84751AC1F8840"/>
weighty ſubject, and that ſuch an inſtitution as is now propoſed, is wanting.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That there has been a growing concern within the limits of this Yearly Meeting may be inferred from what has appeared for ſome years back, when a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons of our profeſſion have been engaged to promote ſomething of this kind;<note n="*" place="bottom">When this was wrote it was intended to give ſome account of the ſchool at Nottingham, in Cheſter county, with ſome other matters, in an appendix; but the length of this eſſay has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned their being laid aſide for the preſent.</note> and ſome ſtill continue to be ſo diſpoſed, notwithſtanding they have been unprovided with a regular plan, ſo fully matur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to obtain the concurrence of the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to direct their proceedings by. Yet, under theſe diſadvantages, conſiderable bequeſts have been made, and ſome donations added; as well as offers to a more conſiderable amount,
<q>apparently proceeding (as our friend John Fothergill obſerved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Ackworth ſchool) from a juſt ſenſe of the want of ſome ſuch eſtabliſhment,</q>
on an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and liberal plan, ſubject to the directions of a committee of that Meeting.</p>
            <p>And it is likewiſe hoped, that this concern will have more place, and be found to have increaſing weight, on Friends' minds, when the nature of it is more clearly underſtood, and that ſo beneficent an undertaking will be remembered by many, not only
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022361_0041_0FB8475464230D88"/>
when they are making a final arrangement of their temporal affairs, but likewiſe at other ſeaſons, when they find that there is a probability that their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table intentions will be fulfilled, and any donations or bequeſts appropriated agreeable to their benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſigns and Chriſtian duty, under the direction of ſuch a committee.<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been thought proper to recommend this concern to the attention of our women Friends, as it has been apprehended that they might not conſider themſelves as equally bound with the men to promote it; but as it is intended for the benefit of both ſexes, and they are favored with a portion of providential bounty, with ſuitable qualifications to be uſeful, it is hoped they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, and, when called upon, afford that aſſiſtance, which, in the wiſdom of truth, may be pointed out.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. With reſpect to the third propoſition, that there is an ability in ſociety for ſuch an undertaking, it may be obſerved:</p>
            <p>To effect any thing that will be extenſively uſeful in this way, that will attract the attention of ſociety at large, or add a reputation to it, it is neceſſary we ſhould have a plan of conſiderable magnitude in view; which cannot be attended with any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, if it is concluded afterwards to conduct it and carry it into execution on a ſmaller ſcale, as it is much eaſier to retrench a large one than it might be to enlarge a ſmall one; and as it is not the intention of thoſe who have this ſubject moſt at heart, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the abilities of ſociety, there can no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ariſe from their having an extenſive plan in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022361_0042_0FB84755E1696010"/>
view, but rather otherwiſe, as we are ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to engage in ſmaller difficulties by having large ones made familiar: and it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that the plan of a ſmall inſtitution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in all its parts in writing, will have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſomething greater than it is intended to be; ſo that I hope none will be harmed with ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that any thing burdenſome is intended, or what is inconſiſtent with the eſſential intereſt and good of the riſing generation.</p>
            <p>If too ſmall a plan was propoſed, it might tend to limit the views of ſome well-informed Friends, who may be favored with diſcernment to perceive what the abilities of the ſociety could perform, and the benevolence of wealthy individuals diſpoſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, when united with others leſs able; and might by this means prevent its becoming ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively uſeful as it otherwiſe would; as well as diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe who may come after us, with more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and perhaps with more ability, from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving upon our labors to advantage: for which reaſons I have thought it beſt not to be too contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my proſpects, leſt we might loſe the benefits ariſing from a proper education, for want of ſuitable exertions.</p>
            <p>When we are conſidered but as inſtruments in the Divine Hand, and that he can diſpoſe the hearts of men, beyond what human reaſon might ſuggeſt, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022361_0043_0FB84757F850BB98"/>
ſuch an undertaking, and with ſo much liberality as rather to excite our admiration than diſappoint our wiſhes, it has raiſed ſome degree of confidence that this undertaking will not be left unaccompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor fail to anſwer the valuable purpoſes expected from it; and I have been ſtrengthened in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, when I have remembered the manner in which the ſchools under the direction of Friends in this city originated, and how their funds have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſchools were firſt ſet on foot by a ſingle Monthly Meeting, and were liberally provided for when our numbers were comparatively few to what they are at this time, nor were they near ſo wealthy, beſides having difficulties to contend with, in the early periods of this ſettlement, which we are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to at this day.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they were principally endowed and provided for by a few perſons who had the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject weightily on their minds, who left property ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to form a fund, which has been adequate to the ſupport of ſchools for the poor of the Monthly Meeting, beſides many others, the offspring of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to other religious ſocieties. The overſeers of theſe ſchools have been able to allow ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, and grant encouragement, in divers ways, to well-qualified tutors; and at this time their fund is quite ſufficient to anſwer all the neceſſary purpoſes
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022361_0044_0FB84759F9347090"/>
of keeping them up, and fully equal to what is neceſſary to begin an eſtabliſhment, ſuch as is now propoſed for the whole ſociety to undertake.</p>
            <p>And this can only be conſidered as a private fund, accumulated within the limits of one Monthly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="*" place="bottom">Since divided into three.</note> and the reſult of a benevolent diſpoſition in only a few individuals, principally effected above half a century ago: ſo that the preſent generation has had no ſhare in forming it; but have derived conſiderable benefits from this fund: hence there ſeems to be an obligation on the preſent generation of Friends to make the like proviſion for thoſe who are to ſucceed them, <note n="†" place="bottom">Many young people, who are in a way to have increaſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, are apt to be inattentive to concerns of this nature, and to the important conſequences which reſult from a right education; I have wiſhed that they might remember, that unleſs ſuitable ſchools are begun to be eſtabliſhed before they want them, their offspring cannot be benefited by them when they do; and it has been my deſire that they may not neglect an early attention to the right education of their offspring, nor be indifferent with reſpect to the making proviſion for ſuitable ſchools, according to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, leſt they ſhould experience the neceſſity for them when too late to be remedied, and have to lament their inattention, in conſequence of the depravity or ill conduct of their children; which has been the ſorrowful experience of many.</note> as well as for the preſent: indeed ſuch is the nature of inſtitutions of this kind, that they not only ſerve thoſe who may be living at the time of their eſtabliſhment, but likewiſe have a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote effect; and by an attention to ſuch uſeful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, we may confer a benefit upon many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, who are to ſucceed us, which is a very
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022361_0045_0FB8475BCC785648"/>
encouraging circumſtance to thoſe who may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to promote them.</p>
            <p>There is another inſtance in a ſchool under the care of Friends of this city, for the inſtruction of the blacks: where unexpected proviſion has been made, by unforeſeen ways, of a ſufficient fund to ſupport it, in the courſe of a few years, and thoſe who had the firſt burden, were exonerated ſooner than was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. At preſent they have an annual income of about £. 200, ariſing from ground-rents, &amp;c. ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated that there is a pleaſing proſpect that it will afford a permanent eſtabliſhment to this generous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; which, it is ſaid, originated with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our religious ſociety in this city.</p>
            <p>If ſuch inſtitutions as theſe have been begun and ſupported within the limits, and by the benevolence of Friends moſtly within, this city, what may we not hope from the united endeavours of the whole ſociety? to infer an inability in them to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eſtabliſhment, and provide for the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accommodation, and ſupport of a number of thoſe who need it, and have a religious claim upon them for aſſiſtance, would be contrary to the proſpect of ſuch Friends as have conſidered the ſubject in a ſolid, weighty manner; and if the number of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which conſtitute this Yearly Meeting, was known, it could be made appear: but as this is uncertain, any calculations founded on our numbers muſt be
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022361_0046_0FB8475CE000FA58"/>
vague; ſome have ſuppoſed, that if the expenſe was liquidated, it would not take more than a buſhel of wheat for each family to effect ſomething reputable and extenſively uſeful in this way.<note n="*" place="bottom">Of this I do not conſider myſelf as a competent judge, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I built altogether on our numbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is hoped a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of liberality will be excited in thoſe who are abundantly able.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as we may reaſonably conclude that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum would be generouſly given for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by wealthy individuals, we might hope that a fund would be gradually formed ſo as to relieve the apprehenſions of its being attended with any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable expenſe; and that donations and bequeſts would be made, unſolicited, at times, to enable Friends to erect many of the moſt expenſive and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary buildings: ſo that when we compare the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which may be expected from ſuch an inſtitution with the expenſe likely to attend it; and conſider the foundation there is to believe that many wealthy indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, as well as others, will be diſpoſed to favor ſo uſeful a deſign; and reflect upon what has been done by a part of the ſociety; <note n="†" place="bottom">Within the limits of Philadelphia Monthly Meetings.</note> we need not heſitate to conclude that there is ſufficient ABILITY for ſuch an undertaking.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And that it would be attended with many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages not to be had in any other way, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the following conſiderations, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:022361_0047_0FB8475E69CF8D60"/>Amongſt other circumſtances which might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the excellent regulations introduced into the ſchool at ACKWORTH, and the manner in which that inſtitution has been conducted, with the experience which has been ſince had of the beneficial effects of thoſe regulations on the manners and deportment of the youth brought up at that place, affords a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſpect that a ſyſtem of oeconomy and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is practicable at a large inſtitution, which may be productive of many advantages not to be obtained at ſmaller ſchools, particularly ſo as to reduce the coſt of board and ſchooling, which are circumſtances wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of regard in the eſtabliſhment of ſchools.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unlikely, as was obſerved reſpecting Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth ſchool,
<q>that one on a large plan would fix the attention, and excite the bounty, of Friends, whilſt thoſe upon a ſmaller ſcale would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and ſoon diſappear,</q>
as was found to be the caſe in Great-Britain; beſides, it might be expected that this inſtitution would draw forth from a ſtate of leſs activity, men and women, who may have been raiſed up and ſuitably qualified for every ſtation which ſo large an undertaking would require, however arduous, who might be willing to engage in any line of duty to which they might be called, from an enlarged proſpect of uſefulneſs, and a deſire that their labors may be bleſſed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the young and riſing generation; as has been the caſe at that valuable inſtitution at Ackworth: nor
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022361_0048_0FB8475FE4A2BD08"/>
is there any doubt in my mind, but ſuch are now amongſt us, unnoticed and in a ſtate of greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
            <p>Another evident advantage which muſt ariſe from ſuch an eſtabliſhment is, that a number of young people of both ſexes would be forming from time to time, under the excellent regulations which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be introduced at ſuch an inſtitution, who Would be likely to come forward with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which could be obtained from a well regulated courſe of inſtruction, to engage as maſters and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes at thoſe ſchools which are recommended to be eſtabliſhed throughout the ſociety by the Yearly Meeting, and thereby advance what that Meeting have had in view,<note n="*" place="bottom">As expreſſed in the extracts from their minutes lately ſpread thro' the ſociety under the direction of our Meeting for Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> by removing a principal diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the eſtabliſhment of ſuch ſchools, that is, <hi>the want of ſuitable perſons for teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other circumſtances which might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch an inſtitution uſeful above any other which could be eſtabliſhed on a more contracted ſcale, viz. it might be laying the foundation for greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in the ſyſtem of inſtruction to be purſued for the benefit of the youth at ſuch a place; likewiſe in the manner of bringing them up, that there
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022361_0049_0FB8476225C8BEA8"/>
might be a greater conformity to what has been invariably recommended by Friends from the firſt riſe of the ſociety, as the only probable means, of deriving to our offspring thoſe ſubſtantial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which have been uniformly experienced to flow from an attention to their advice, in additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe uſeful qualifications which would ariſe from ſo judicious a courſe of ſchool-learning, and it is likely that the example afforded at this ſchool would be followed by others; hence, its influence on the manners and conduct of the youth might extend to remote ſeminaries: whereby Friends would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in promoting the happineſs and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many young people, who might otherwiſe remain in a leſs cultivated and leſs happy ſtate; nor could ſuch an inſtitution, properly conducted, fail of adding a reputation to the <hi>ſociety,</hi> and perhaps have a tendency to diffuſe the principles of LIGHT and TRUTH which we profeſs; by awakening a ſpirit of inquiry after them, amongſt other people.</p>
            <p>Another advantage which would reſult from this undertaking, and ſeems worthy of notice is, that by engaging in this laudable deſign, it might excite a greater diſpoſition to attend to the religious inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the young people, in ſome who have been too inattentive to this important concern; who might be brought, by giving up to it, to become more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly engaged to encourage other ſchools, agreeable to what has been recommended by Friends: for it 
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022361_0050_0FB84763DAD61E00"/>has been conſidered as an approved maxim,
<q>the more any perſon gives towards <hi>charitable</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note n="*" place="bottom">Although this inſtitution is not intended for the uſe of thoſe young people <hi>only</hi> who are not in affluent circumſtances, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it may, according to the niceſt conſtruction of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be conſidered as a charitable deſign; for there is no way in which we can ſo effectually relieve difficulties, as by ſuitable endeavours to prevent them: nor can a better ſyſtem of oeconomy be adopted by a ſociety in extending alms, than by providing for the proper education and inſtruction of the young people who may have occaſion for ſuch aſſiſtance. How great have been the difficulties which ſome have been involved in for want of this care? what irretrievable evils do many unguardedly plunge into for want of early inſtruction? and what misfortunes have enſued, ſo as to produce a ſeries of fatal conſequences which have excited a painful recollection? merely thro' the neglect of an early care for that purpoſe, and perhaps I might not improperly add, for want of more liberality and neceſſary attention to ſuch uſeful ſchools.</note> the more willing he becomes to give to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the encouragement of <hi>others,</hi>
               </q>
eſpecially when it is for the like benevolent purpoſes; we might therefore conclude that it would have a tendency to promote a greater degree of liberality with a better diſpoſition to ſupport leſſer ſchools on the ſyſtem, and for the valuable purpoſes recommended by the Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting.</p>
            <p>All theſe circumſtances ought to afford us grounds to believe, that ſuch an inſtitution will be attended with advantages which cannot be had in any other way.</p>
            <p>Being confirmed in this opinion, and that ſuch a ſchool, ſomewhere in the country, in a healthy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, free from the objections which have been
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022361_0051_0FB84766C347F358"/>
mentioned, and on a large eſtabliſhment, will have many advantages which cannot be obtained either in town or country. I have, therefore, engaged in this eſſay, with an expectation that Friends will be favored to judge of the propriety of the concern, and that in due ſeaſon it will claim their ſolid atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obtain ſuitable encouragement, and be the means, under Divine Providence, of many of our young people, who may be left in an unprovided condition, as well as others, being ſuitably taken care of, inſtructed, and prepared to enter upon the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, with every advantage which a well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected education can afford: which is the deſire of their friend and well-wiſher in the truth,</p>
