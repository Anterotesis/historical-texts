            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len this day in Iſrael?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHILE I behold this aſſembly, admiring the ſolemnity that appears in every countenance, and reflect on the melancholy occaſion of our meeting, I feel emotions in my heart impoſſible for my tongue to deſcribe. While I am led to regret the great and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable loſs my country has ſuſtained by the death of her Deliverer, I feel a meaſure of joy ariſing from the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he died not unlamented. No—you, my brethren, have this day evidenced your reſpect to his memory; and by the great concourſe who are now crowded within theſe walls you manifeſt your ſorrow as chriſtians, Americans, and lovers of liberty. Your countenances beſpeak that ſuitable degree of grief that now occupies your hearts, and ſhew that you partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with your fellow citizens throughout theſe United States in the general affliction occaſioned by the loſs of our beloved WASHINGTON. While we drop the ſympathizing tear over his princely urn, with all our afflicted brethren, let us not, my countrymen, be guilty of the ſuperſtitious errors prevalent in pagan ages and countries: Let us carefully avoid every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſervility and adulation, which are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to republicans, and would be ſcandalous in the virtuous and enlightened ſons of Columbia. Let us,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037558_0004_100EDB621C650EE8"/>
while we are paying the juſt tribute of reſpect due to his exalted merit, aim at the medium between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of indifference and vaſſalage.</p>
            <p>In the words of the text, David calls Abner a great man—WASHINGTON was much greater; and, if we except thoſe who in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> extraordinary manner were inſpired to reveal the will and mind of God to mortals, I ſincerely believe a greater than WASHINGTON never exiſted. Many great and virtuous men, in various ages, and among different nations of the world, have ſhined like the moon in their reſpective orbits; but when compared to the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, who may with propriety be called the reſplendent Sun of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, whoſe virtues and abilities poured forth the genial rays, and diſſeminated the light and vigour, of liberty in the hearts of Columbia's ſons—their glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence is ſwallowed up in the bright effulgence that proceeds from our moſt excellent Chief. Thoſe who are inclined to extol them who have been remarkable for great abilities, or eminent for worthy actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting any one of them as the perfection of human nature, and inſinuating that none more remarkable, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or virtuous ever lived—let them not liſp the name of WASHINGTON, leſt the glory of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favourites be eclipſed, as the light of the moon is by the brightneſs of the ſun. The glory of Columbia has never been equalled, not to ſay excelled, in thoſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind.</p>
            <p>I have never ſuppoſed greatneſs to conſiſt in noble birth, the virtues of anceſtors, or in the worthy deeds of our fathers. Even in this reſpect, none, even the moſt ignorant, can aſperſe our beloved WASHINGTON. Dr. Robinſon ſays, he was a deſcendant from the great duke of Albermarle, who was the inſtrument in God's hand of reſtoring peace and tranquillity in England, and out of anarchy and confuſion to introduce a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form of government, any kind of which is better than none. But his greatneſs proceeds from his own innate virtues and abilities: this will appear more
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037558_0005_100EDB63AAA2DF08"/>
conſpicuous, if we compare him with, and contraſt him to, many who were and now are called great in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was greater than ALEXANDER.—Becauſe, deſtitute of the guilty ambition that fired the breaſt of that hair-brained Grecian youth, when he appeared in the field under the command of Braddock, we have every reaſon to ſuppoſe (if we judge by his future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct) that a fervent deſire to ſave his countrymen from the cruel hands of the ſavage barbarians induced him to leave the pleaſures of a rural, to endure the fatigues, toils and dangers of a ſoldier's life. At the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the American war, his country called, and he obeyed. Again the pleaſures of Vernon are deſerted: he draws his ſword in the cauſe of liberty, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or enſlave nations, but to preſerve them; not to make himſelf popular by ſhedding the blood of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but to make Columbia free and happy. Every part of his conduct, in the field, in our councils, and in the cabinet, evidences, his only ambition was, faithfully to ſerve his country, and take an active part in the cauſe of liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was greater than VESPASIAN.—His vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were not blotted by an inſatiate love for gold. His noble breaſt never luſted after ſuch paltry ſtuff. It was not poverty that drove him from his peaceful abode; neither was he under the neceſſity of entering the field to ſupport a broken fortune, or to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wealth. No, my countrymen; when he entered the field, and drew his ſword for us, he was bleſſed with every neceſſary that could make life happy. His refuſing any compenſation for his ſervices evidently proves, he was not infected with this pernicious vice: he had enough: an addition would have been profuſion; and profuſion and luxury this virtuous republican deſpiſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was greater than JULIUS CAESAR.—Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Roman chief was eminent for great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037558_0006_100EDB656EFB38C0"/>
and particular virtues, we find his reputation ſpotted with pride and baſe preſumption.</p>
            <p>Was WASHINGTON guilty of theſe vices? Were the Commander of the American army, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Columbia, in oppoſition to each other? Did the General refuſe to obey the orders of the Congreſs? Was he deſirous to aggrandize himſelf, rather than promote the cauſe of liberty by laudable and virtuous means? No; thoſe imperfections never polluted the virtuous heart of WASHINGTON. Always ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and condeſcending, he acted in concert with the Congreſs, and adopted their meaſures. It is true, in his letters he mentioned what he thought neceſſary to be done, but in language ſo modeſt and ſubmiſſive, they ſcarcely had the appearance of advice, much leſs the air of dictation. By his modeſty, and their conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, true friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lenity ſubſiſted between them. So far was he from acting the part of Caeſar, that I firmly believe he would have entered the ranks, and ſerved as a private ſoldier, if his ſervices in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have promoted the cauſe of Columbia more than his commanding the army. It was not to make famous the name of WASHINGTON, that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to unſheath his ſword—it was to make America free and happy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He was greater than CHARLES.—This Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh monarch by his raſhneſs and intemperance had a brave army deſtroyed, in the midſt of Ruſſia, by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in all his tranſactions we diſcover more courage than conduct. WASHINGTON was deliberate in all his meaſures, and executed them with prudence and calmneſs: the lives of his ſoldiers were not ſacrificed to his enemies becauſe he would not recede from meaſures he had adopted, when he was fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced they were erroneous, and would be attended with fatal conſequences: willing rather to ſhew that he was man, than to riſk the loſs of his army without any probability of ſucceſs, he thought it no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to expoſe his fallibility, and ſhew the world
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037558_0007_100EDB67653669B8"/>
that he was not obſtinate in errors: he well knew that in the multitude of counſellors there is ſafety; and therefore did not, like Charles, keep his officers ignorant of his deſigns.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He was greater than PHILIP and PETER.— Theſe great men injured their reputation by the acts of cruelty and barbarity they ſo often committed, which ſhock the feelings of humanity to relate or hear.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was a ſtranger to this ferocious ſpirit; he knew nothing of this beaſtly diſpoſition; his ſoul did not delight in the afflictions and ſufferings of his fellow creatures; it was not made and form'd of ſtuff ſo ſtern. Did he ever ſmile when he heard the ſoldier ſigh, or ſaw him weep? Did he ſtand unaffected when he ſaw him bleed, or beheld his wounds? Did he not commiſerate his hard fate, when deſtitute of the neceſſaries of life? Did he ever hear the mourning of the ſoldier's widow, and the cries of his orphan children, without ſympathizing with them, and alleviating their ſorrow if in his power?— The truly brave are humane, and are not inſenſible when they ſee the tears, or hear the complaints, of the diſtreſſed. See our WASHINGTON in Braddock's ſlaughtered army—What tears and entreaties he made uſe of to ſave his countrymen, while his heart experienced the keeneſt pain to ſee the dreadful carnage!</p>
            <p>His benevolent heart was not of a contracted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: it embraced the foe, even the enemy of liberty and his country; thinking it more noble to treat him with lenity and compaſſion, than to augment his miſeries, and increaſe his ſufferings. Let thoſe who were priſoners in the late war teſtify of his conduct in this reſpect. The Britiſh have not withheld that tribute of praiſe due to the virtue of Columbia's Chief. Behold his conduct at the melancholy affair of the unfortunate and much-lamented Andre.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He was greater than TRAJAN.——The worthy deeds of this noble hero were tarniſhed by liſtening to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037558_0008_100EDB69216CBF58"/>
the tongue of ſlander, which filled him with the ſpirit of jealouſy, that green-eyed monſter; the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which deprived many thouſands of their lives, who were his friends, and delighted in his proſperity. Our Illuſtrious Chief well underſtood men, and, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a good and virtuous ſoul, which was averſe to vice, he would willingly have thought all men virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as he was virtuous. As a vicious mind is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpicious, ſo a virtuous one thinks no evil. WASHINGTON knew bad men exiſted; but he was willing to think every man good until he proved him to be bad: when proved, and found to be ſuch, he would rather reform than deſtroy. His ear was never pleaſed with the voice of ſlander; and if he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of hearing accuſations, he was willing to make great allowances for prejudice and party ſpirit: his judgment was never formed until he had heard the defence of the accuſed, as well as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. He could well bear a ſuperior: this gives him the pre-eminence of Caeſar. He could well bear an equal: this makes him greater than the jealous Pompey. His honeſt heart never envied another for his merit. See his conduct when an attempt was made to ſupplant him in office. Did he treat one of his generals as Pompey treated Caeſar, although he knew the machinations that were carried on againſt him? No; the jealouſy of vicious minds had no effect on him: he trod in the paths of virtue, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways delighted in merit, and was not the laſt to pay due reſpect to the abilities of another, when it was apparently to his own injury.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He was greater than CORIOLANUS.—When this Roman hero received an inſult, he deſerted the cauſe of his country, and joined with the enemy, to the injury of Rome. He deprives her of the aſſiſtance he was able to afford, and proceeded to take up arms againſt her, with an intention to revenge his private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries on all his countrymen; as though he was more anxious to ſupport his own than his country's glory.

No; I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe he would have ſuffered his heart to be opened, and every drop of blood to be drained from it, rather than have taken up arms againſt his country, or even deſerted the cauſe of Columbia. He was not a ſtranger to inſults; he met with reflections, and was treated in a diſreſpectful manner by men in high repute, and of exalted rank; but he ſmiled at their envy, ſcorned their malice, and pitied their jealouſy. The cauſe of liberty was his cauſe, and faithfully he fought by her ſtandard. He did not, like the baſe Arnold, (with abhorrence I mention his name) revenge a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affront by aſſiſting the enemy, and waſhing his hands in the blood of his countrymen, or diſtreſſing the lovers of liberty.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He was greater than CROMWELL.—Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well deceived the Engliſh. He apparently drew his ſword to redreſs their grievances: they courageouſly fought by his ſide, and, animated by his bravery, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued their enemies. But behold, for yokes of wood he made them wear thoſe of iron, and whips they exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſcorpions. Whatever his pretences were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or in the war—however he might profeſs his love for the commonwealth, and proclaim himſelf a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can—yet, when he ſaw the enemy vanquiſhed, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed himſelf of the opportunity that offered, aſſumed the title of Lord Protector, and ruled with more ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and deſpotiſm than the unfortunate Charles. After thouſands were ſacrificed, he made the ſituation of England worſe than it was under its former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His crime was aggravated by the baſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy he uſed to effect his deſigns.</p>

            <p>The men I have mentioned received the appellation of great, and are to this day repreſented as characters worthy of imitation to the riſing poſterity. It appears to me almoſt a diſparagement to the character of our beloved WASHINGTON to compare him with many of them. As they were eminent for valiant actions, they are alſo remarkable for abominable vices: theſe vices he abhorred. They had imperfections that never ſullied his character. Will not every lover of liberty juſtify me when I ſay, that he was not only a GREAT MAN, but, excepting, as I have ſaid before, the ſubjects of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſpiration, the GREATEST OF MEN? His negative virtues are worthy of our obſervation; but we are not confined to them: he poſſeſſed virtues ſufficient to dazzle the eye of every unprejudiced and candid

beholder—Of every unprejudiced beholder did I ſay?— Every man, who has the exerciſe of his reaſon, muſt and will, with ineffable pleaſure, behold the character of Columbia's Glory; who was great without guilty am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, honourable without oſtentation, courageous without raſhneſs, prudent without timidity, wiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption, patriotic without ſelfiſhneſs, humble without guile, and pious without ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He poſſeſſed the moderation of CINCINNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS.—Like this Roman chief he was called from the pleaſures of a rural life, when the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution took place, to command an army compoſed of Columbia's brave ſons, who groaned under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and longed to be free. At this critical period the eye of all America was on WASHINGTON, as the only man with whom they could entruſt this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant office. With what moderation and ſelf-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did he accept the offer! With what zeal did he labour to effect the arduous taſk aſſigned him! When he had ſubdued the enemies of Columbia, Cincinnatus-like he humbly reſigns his commiſſion to, and lays it at the feet of, the ſupreme rulers; then he retires to his beloved retreat on Vernon's mount. Not long did he continue in the enjoyment which he there had promiſed himſelf. Again his country calls, and he obeys. He accepts the office of Supreme Magiſtrate, with his former modeſty; and faithfully he diſcharged the duties of it; until, far advanced in years, he declines occupying his former reſpectable office, and withdraws to ſpend the remainder of his days in retirement and peace. The ancient Father of America hears that his country's rights are violated by a foreign power, and again the ſons of Columbia, who were not ignorant of his abilities, look up to him for aſſiſtance. Though far advanced in years, and almoſt worn out in his country's ſervice,

               </gap> to his lateſt hour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He had the conſtancy of CAMILLUS.—Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was treated amiſs by many, and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to dangers, hardſhips, toils and troubles, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant heart, ever true to the cauſe of liberty, never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to conſult his own eaſe when his country was in danger. You, my countrymen, in the late war fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently trembled on his account. You ſcarcely knew whether he was dead or living; before you were aware of it, behold, he was in a part of the continent that little expected him, and at the very heels of his enemies. Like Camillus before the walls of Rome, ſo he appeared before Trenton and York, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his enemies.</p>
            <p>In his gloomy rout through the Jerſeys he was troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed. Although his enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in his forlorn ſituation, and entertained pleaſing hopes of his final ruin, behold, he appears ſuddenly, routs and diſperſes them. As Camillus drove the Gauls from the walls of Rome, and compelled them to return to their own country, ſo WASHINGTON drove the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Engliſh from the ſhores of America, and forced them to return to Britain with ſhame and confuſion. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the drooping hearts of Columbia's ſons by the bleſſing of liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He had the fortitude of TITUS.—Although his army was frequently routed, and he with pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his brave troops bleeding, and flying in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection before a powerful and victorious enemy—al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though other armies in different parts of the United States, who were engaged in the cauſe of liberty, ſhared

               </gap> of Columbia muſt fall before the power of Britain, and bow to the cruel invader—although many of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in this diſtreſſing ſeaſon loſt all their hopes, while the private ſoldiers were almoſt ſunk into deſpair—the ſons of America, and the daughters of Columbia, wept, and ſmote their breaſts for grief, while their eyes were fixed on and looking up to him, by whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliverance—he alone remains calm and ſerene in this awful juncture, and like Titus renews the attack again, and again, until he ſhews himſelf victorious. I make no doubt that our Hero was affected when he viewed the deplorable ſtate of his affairs; but the juſt cauſe in which he was engaged, and the confidence he had in that righteous God who ſuperintends all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man events, ſupported his mind, and gave him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fortitude by which he was enabled to face the enemy, and manfully fight for liberty and his country.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He had the wiſdom and honeſty of FABI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US.—Courage in war, without prudence, would lead a man into many difficulties, from which he could not eaſily extricate himſelf. Should I attempt to enumerate the many circumſtances, that occurred through the courſe of the late war, in which the ſuperior wiſdom of WASHINGTON was diſplayed, it would exhauſt my ſtrength. As they were many, ſo they are recent. His deſigns were not planned precipitately, but with proper deliberation: when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but if approved of, on the day and at the place of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>on they were executed with judgment and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. He well knew what advantages to avail himſelf of, and what uſe to make of them—when to appear againſt the enemy, and when to avoid them—in what to encounter them, and at what time—when to purſue
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037558_0014_100EDB74AA098D08"/>
them, and when to retreat before them—when to ſlacken the reins of diſcipline in his army, and when ſtrictly to enforce it—when to appear affable, and when reſerved—when to encourage, and when to threaten. I know of few to whom our beloved WASHINGTON can be compared in this reſpect, and to none with more propriety than to FABIUS: in every trait of his character he equals if not excels him. His honeſty was as remarkable as his wiſdom. When reduced to the moſt humiliating ſituation he could poſſibly be in (unleſs a priſoner in his enemies' hands) when he needed men, money, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, his enemies offered him certain honours, and great rewards, if he would deſert the cauſe of liberty. On this occaſion he ſhewed that ſame ſpirit of indignation that fired the breaſt of the holy martyr when the queen's pardon was offered him on baſe conditions: he exclaimed "God forbid I ſhould touch the unclean thing."</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, as before obſerved, did not engage in the war to accumulate wealth: if he had, this was a fair opportunity to acquire it. Neither did he labour to gain honour, but by virtuous deeds. The ſituation of his affairs, when the bribe was offered, were ſuch that few men would have refuſed it. As to fortune, he had much to loſe with the loſs of liberty, and no property did he gain by making America free. If he deſired honours from Columbia's ſons, the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was dark and gloomy, and no certain foundation had he to build his hopes upon: whereas, had he accepted the bribe, he would have obtained certain though baſe honours. But he would rather riſk the chance of being conquered, ſafely conveyed to the Tower of London, and executed as a rebel, than to forſake the cauſe of liberty, and betray the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037558_0015_100EDB767675DD30"/>
to him by the virtuous Americans. He was one of thoſe "honeſt men," who are "the nobleſt work of God."</p>
            <p>"O admirable WASHINGTON! it was as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to "prevent the ſun from ſhining, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thee from the paths of virtue." Thy enemies were not perfectly acquainted with thee, or they would never have made the fruitleſs and vain attempt to allure thee by gold and honours, or terrify thee with threatenings, menaces and invectives, as means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or compel thee to betray thy country, and blot thy reputation with vice. Ye ſons of Columbia, your Chief has taught the world to believe, a man did exiſt, whom no quantity of gold, nor profuſion of honours, could pollute. He had no price but virtue, no object but liberty. The offers of one day, and the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of another, had the ſame effect on him, whoſe only policy was honeſty, and whoſe only glory was virtue.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He had the reſolution of FREDERIC.——Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and prudence are not always united in military characters. It would be often better to be quite deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of both, than to poſſeſs one in a very great, and the other in a very ſmall, degree. Courage often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſource of miſery to him who is deſtitute of prudence. In WASHINGTON we find both united: not intimidated by the ſight of danger, when there was a probability of ſucceſs he ruſhed forward with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, well tempered by good conduct. Fear never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from ſeizing an advantage: he never eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when he might ſafely come to, an engagement. No; he drew his ſword to protect Columbia, and valiantly faced every oppoſition; not accounting his life dear to him, if he could only make America the ſeat of peace and liberty. The purity of his cauſe, and the ſtrict virtue he practiſed, deprived death of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037558_0016_100EDB78483C0C28"/>
his ſoul was thereby preſerved, and in the field of battle with perfect calmneſs he iſſued out orders.</p>
            <p>Such was our WASHINGTON (not inferior to Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric) who was a mighty man of war. But this was not his delight; it was his duty. For us, my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he unſheathed the ſword, and chaſtiſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſons of Britain: and, ſtrange to tell, as they once feared, ſo now they love, the name of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON.</p>
            <p>Thus, my countrymen, you behold, and while you behold you admire, the greatneſs of your Illuſtrious Chief. He was not only great, but great among the greateſt; deſtitute of their vices, yet poſſeſſing their abilities. He had not the ambition of Alexander, the avarice of Veſpaſian, the preſumption of Caeſar, the raſhneſs of Charles, the cruelty of Philip and Peter, the credulity of Trajan, the jealouſy of Pompey, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Coriolanus, or the hypocriſy of Cromwell; but the moderation of Cincinnatus, the conſtancy of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, the fortitude of Titus, the courage of Frederic, the wiſdom and honeſty of Fabius. Many of theſe poſſeſſed virtues, and are called great; their names are not blotted with vice; yet they are inferior to WASHINGTON: they did not poſſeſs virtues of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds, nor in ſo great a degree: they had no virtues that he was deſtitute of, no uſeful abilities but what he was acquainted with. But who of them ever poſſeſſed, or when and where did the man ever exiſt who poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all the abilities of WASHINGTON, and all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that ornamented his ſoul? To the fierceneſs of Alexander, he united the moderation of Cincinnatus; the courage of Frederic, with the wiſdom of Fabius; the fidelity of Veſpaſian, with the patriotiſm of Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus; the ſpirit of Caeſar, with the fortitude of Titus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:037558_0017_100EDB7A025CDBC0"/>I ſhall now mention his greatneſs as a <hi>ruler.</hi> By the unanimous voice of the citizens of the United States, he was called to the high and important office of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. In this reſpectable poſt, he did not carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a man with proud looks, and of an high mind: his moderation was known to all men; none complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his power, or envied him his glory. His abilities and virtues were augmented with his cares. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the welfare of the Indian tribes; his love for peace at home and abroad; his manner in ſuppreſſing internal inſurrections, and baffling foreign artifices; every part of his adminiſtration, beſpoke the greatneſs of his ſoul, and the wiſdom that reſted on him. To mention every part of his conduct, while he filled this important office, would be very improper on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We this day enjoy the bleſſed effects of his wiſe proceedings. Happy waſt thou, O Columbia! Who was like unto thee, O people favoured of the Lord— bleſſed with ſuch a righteous ruler, who cauſed the land to rejoice, and exalted our nation?</p>
            <p>I will now conſider his greatneſs as a <hi>political writer.</hi> In his writings you view him great with his pen, as he formerly was with his ſword. In all his letters and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes he evidences himſelf to be no unſkilful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; particularly in his laſt Legacy. It was ſaid, Ariſtotle ſhewed himſelf to be great by his writings. The writings of WASHINGTON were not inferior to his: in them he diſplays his republican principles, and ſhews himſelf to be the real friend of liberty. With what zeal he recommends union to the people of the United States, reprobates military eſtabliſhments, and recommends uſeful knowledge! In fine, he gave advice which, if adopted, would make Columbia the ſeat of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and peace. In this Addreſs are ſentiments ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime, they do honour to his memory, and ſhould be taught the riſing poſterity. While he wrote theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037558_0018_100EDB7BC45F2FB8"/>
lines, and retired from public ſervice, like the Jewiſh prophet on a ſimilar occaſion, I fancy him uſing his language—God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you. O Columbia! his God only knows how often he bowed his knee, and lifted his hand, toward the throne of Grace in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. He firſt ſerved you with his ſword; when it was returned to its ſcabbard, he preſided in your councils, and ſerved you in the cabinet as faithfully as he had done in the field; then with his pen he laboured for your welfare; and laſt of all, with fervent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to his God. I make no doubt but you agree with me, that WASHINGTON was not only greater than Abner, but greater than any uninſpired man you ever heard or read of.</p>
            <p>But he is fallen. WASHINGTON is no more: the union between his ſoul and body is diſſolved. But though dead, he yet ſpeaks, by his examples, works, writings, and the bleſſings he procured for us. Can we enjoy the bleſſing of liberty, and live in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of freedom, and forget the name of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON? No; he lives in the heart of every virtuous ſon of Columbia, and it is only with ineffable pleaſure they ſound his name. As the Iſraelites reſpect the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Moſes, who brought them from the bondage of Egypt within ſight of the promiſed land, ſo may every virtuous American remember the worthy deeds of WASHINGTON, who delivered us from a yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage that neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, even a foreign yoke; the avarice of prieſts, hereditary governors, and church eſtabliſhments, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of oppreſſion, and the yokes of tyranny. He brought us not only within ſight of the bleſſings of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but, like Joſhua, led us into the very enjoyment and poſſeſſion of them. While I ſpeak, my heart grows warm. I feel a meaſure of gratitude that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037558_0019_100EDB7DC81AAD30"/>
deſcribe. Before my infant heart knew the value of the bleſſings I now enjoy, my Father and your Father was in the field, fighting to procure them for us. My indignation riſes againſt the American who refuſes to pay ſuitable reſpect to the memory of WASHINGTON. If ſuch a man there be, ſurely he ought not to eat his bread on the American ſhores: let him give place to hundreds and thouſands in Europe more grateful than he, who would willingly come to this delightful and pleaſant land of liberty, if they had it in their power. I would adviſe him to go among his brethren of the Indian tribes. Alas! they would ſuppoſe their ſociety polluted by the company of ſuch a wretch, and would conſequently expel him from among them. When thus expelled, let him join his ſable brethren on the African ſhores. Even they would proteſt, the colour of their ſkin is not more black than his heart is baſe. But I hold, and charitably hope, there is not a wretch ſo vile in this aſſembly. What! a man who daily lives in the poſſeſſion of thoſe liberties WASHINGTON procured for him, and glories in the enjoyment of them, and yet refuſes to pay ſuitable reſpect to his memory! Forbid it, Heaven!</p>
            <p>Your anceſtors came to this continent from the iſland of Great Britain; they fled from oppreſſive power, and not far from this ſpot made their firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. When their mother country made encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their liberties, they remonſtrated, but in vain; they then had recourſe to arms, and called on WASHINGTON to head their troops: he complied, fought, bled, and conquered. Shall we, their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be guilty of an act that would have made our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous fathers bluſh? No, my countrymen; let grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ariſe from your hearts, and teach poſterity the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds of our illuſtrious Chief.

the praiſe of GOD, and the principles of CHRISTIANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY; then teach them to liſp the name of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON—the name ever dear to all the virtuous friends of liberty. The American may travel to the moſt diſtant parts of the world, where the ſons of Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia are known as a nation, and need not bluſh when he is told, WASHINGTON commanded your armies; a WASHINGTON ſtood at the helm of your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Europeans may bluſh when they ſee the vices of their princes expoſed, their ignorance deſcribed, or their cruelty reprobated: but the Glory of Columbia had no apparent imperfections; conſequently it is not in the power of enemies to reproach us on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; we bid defiance to the tongue of calumny. "He was the heroic General, patriotic Stateſman and virtuous Sage." I ſhall ſhortly ſail for England: if I arrive ſafely there, I will carry with me this badge of mourning, and inform thoſe with whom I am or may be acquainted, that I, with Columbia's ſons, mourn the loſs of a political father, even the great, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>I was in this town when I firſt heard the doleful news of his death: the tolling of the bell firſt excited my curioſity, then depreſſed my ſoul in ſorrow. I could not forbear expreſſing my grief. The ſound echoes from city to city, from town to town, and from grove to grove—WASHINGTON is no more! the great, the good, the virtuous WASHINGTON is no more! While the brave ſons of America, and the fair daughters of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia, hang their heads, and torrents of tears ſtream from either eye, they ſmite their breaſts, and cry, Oh, my father! my father! the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!

Age feels the quick emotion: his feeble hand wipes from his venerable cheek the tear that inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſtole from his eye, while he exclaims, in mourning accents, Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men. O, my brethern, the Lord hath taken away the mighty man, the man of war, the prudent man, and the counſellor: WASHINGTON is no more. You that fought by his ſide when he bore the heat and burden of the day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone—his courage animated you, his virtues awed you; you who loved him as a father, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and protector, with what pain did you receive the unwelcome tidings, and now what emotions do you feel, when you reflect on the great loſs you and your country have ſuſtained! Kind ſouls, you weep—Ah! theſe are precious drops—drops of pity that fall on the princely urn of your beloved WASHINGTON. To weep on this occaſion is manly; not to weep, would be ſtoical. Well may we weep when we have reaſon to fear his equal is not left behind. O, what a treaſure have we loſt by the death of our illuſtrious Chief, who was our ſupport in war, our guide in peace! When I conſider his worthy actions, and eminent merit, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee him ſtand before his Judge, hearing the bleſſed plaudit—Well done, good and faithful ſervant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.

He is one of thoſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous that ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance.</p>
            <p>Let us, my brethren, improve the advice he has left behind. Let us cultivate that liberty he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us, and not make it a cloak of laſciviouſneſs. Let us ſhew to the world, that WASHINGTON has made us free, and taught us how to preſerve our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that we, as obedient children, will follow his

advice; that it may never be ſaid of Columbia, WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON laboured for her in vain.</p>
            <p>May his death remind us of our approaching diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. May we ſee the impartiality of death; and if the great and good fall before him, if ſuch as WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON muſt die, let us remember how frail we are, and now apply our hearts unto wiſdom. We ſhall ſee him here no more. He cannot return to us, but we ſhall go to him. May we this day begin the important work of preparing to meet our God. Time is ſhort; eternity is juſt at hand: let us be diligent. A great and important work is before us—a God to ſerve, a heaven to obtain, and a hell to ſhun. And as we are dying daily, God forbid that we ſhould be negligent. We have privileges great and many. We may ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our own vine, and none to make us afraid. Let us improve theſe opportunities, and while we enjoy the bleſſings of liberty, both civil and religious, may we with profound reſpect verberate the names of FRANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN, MONTGOMERY, WARREN, GREENE, and WASHINGTON.</p>
