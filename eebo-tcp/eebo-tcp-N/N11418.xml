            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>APPENDIX. TO THE CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE foregoing ſheets were firſt publiſhed in April, 1774, and we are now in the next November; time and events have, in the ſhort intervening ſpace of ſeven months, but too plainly and too ſtrongly confirmed the opinions reſpecting our American meaſures, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which were then preſumed by the author to be laid before the public. It is in the preceding pages explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the plan propoſed, and confided in by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration on that occaſion, appeared to be, that the removal of the cuſtom-houſe, and the ſuſpenſion of the commerce of Boſton, would ſoon bring on their knees, and ſubject to our commands, the inhabitants of that town and of its colony; who were by that means to become, beſides their own obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, an example likewiſe and a terror to the reſt of their brethren on that continent; but the policy and the probability of this fine ſpun ſcheme are there doubted of, queſtioned and diſcuſſed. It is repreſented, that the harſh and violent meaſures then carrying on, would in America be received no otherwiſe than as a declaration of war, and depend upon the ſame iſſue; that it could only be by force and by conqueſt, if they were ſubmitted to; that we muſt expect to have to do with an union of that continent; that it would among them be made a common cauſe not to be taxed by us, and that they would certainly join, combine and aſſociate together for their general and mutual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and defence. Is there any occaſion to ſay whether or no theſe things have proved true?</p>
            <p>We were at the ſame time warned, that if it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to uſe force and violence, the deciſion might not be ſo very ſoon or ſo very ſure; that theſe being a truly free people, and their government democratical, they would be
<pb n="04" facs="unknown:014439_0003_0F925DE59A4ACDF0"/>
able to arm every man in their country; that neceſſity would, beſides their Committees of Correſpondence then ſubſiſting, teach them other means of moving and of acting together; that they would probably have at their head ſome of the wiſeſt and of the ableſt men of their country; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of our Governors, and of our other civil officers would ſhrink to nothing, nor our own authority probably extend farther than where it was enforced by our own troops; that our very ſoldiery would deſire and endeavour to leave us, and to go over to the Americans. Has one word of all this fallen to the ground, or is there almoſt a ſingle ſentence of it which is not now become a matter of fact?</p>
            <p>It was farther ſet forth, that no immediate impreſſions upon the town of Boſton, or poſſeſſion taken of it by a fleet or an army would carry the command of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or force them to ſubmit to meaſures ſo univerſally againſt their bent and inclinations, but that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the moſt ſtrenuous and moſt vigorous exertions were from that whole people to be expected in ſupport of their common liberties and properties. May I call on our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and demand whether they are not themſelves ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by this time of all theſe things?</p>
            <p>I will paſs by other particulars of the ſame ſort, that I may not tire my reader with the repetition of them How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I hope, that the preſumption will be pardoned, ſhould it be aſked, Whether there is any one event as yet come on, in the order of time and the courſe of things, which has contradicted or happened otherwiſe than what was before pointed out? This gives a great prejudice and ſuſpicion with reſpect to the farther train remaining yet to follow. However there is behind, and among the things in ſuſpence, one particular circumſtance of ſuch a magnitude, that all theſe other incidents are, in compariſon of it, but as the duſt upon the balance. I mean, that ſhould, by theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, either the public expences increaſe, or income de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or both together, ſo that the national revenue ſhall fail, and we be rendered unable to proceed in paying the whole intereſt of our debt, then will, in all appearance, be no longer delayed the day and the hour of our deſtruction, but that conjuncture prove the lateſt and the uttermoſt term of our peace, our proſperity and our ſtability, as a ſtate and a nation. This point is much preſſed in the former ſheets; however Heaven avert, that fate ſhould in the due
<pb n="05" facs="unknown:014439_0004_0F925DE6421595A8"/>
order of things, and at ſome perhaps not very diſtant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, demonſtrate it to be as well grounded, as have already been found ſo many other cautions and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before given! But if we ſow the ſeeds, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on that the fruits will follow; cauſes and effects keep their courſe like day and night; events appear to be preparing and bringing on that period; men and things, counſels and actions, ſigns and appearances ſeem to tend to that cataſtrophe. However the writer preſumes to offer once more to the public the mite of his ſentiments upon the ſtate of our affairs in America, as it ſtands now altered ſince the date of the preceding pages; while we have yet allotted a time to do it, while there is room for reflection, and that any thing remains more for Britons than only to relate the ſtory of their ruin.</p>
            <p>This attack upon the continent appeared to many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt unreaſonable and moſt unpromiſing from the very beginning; futurity has nevertheleſs before it a conſtant cloud and obſcurity, which no human eye can perfectly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate; raſhneſs and inconſiderateneſs do ſometimes make this more of a pretence than the caſe will well warrant; but however doubtful the matter might then be or not, time has now opened events, and fact and certainty have in many reſpects taken place on the ſubject. It is clear and ſure, that the propoſed plan and project have failed and miſcarried. We ſent out, at firſt, forces fit for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended deſign. The common language uſed in commendation of the meaſure was, that a few regiments and a few ſmall ſhips of war would do the buſineſs. But we are now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gathering together an army from all quarters, from England, from Ireland, from ſeveral different parts of America, and even our newly conquered province of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec is to be unguarded and unfurniſhed, that we may be enabled to carry on a war againſt our ancient colonies, and our own countrymen. We have inſtead of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of bringing to taxation and to ſubjection all America, by the means of the town of Boſton, loſt the reſt of that continent, and not gained the town. We have with our own hands, and by our own counſels, got things into ſuch a ſtate; that our colonies obey their Governors no farther than they pleaſe; and that they are unanimouſly and publicly preparing to oppoſe meaſure to meaſure, or force to force, as they ſhall upon the event judge moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; while that b<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="06" facs="unknown:014439_0005_0F925DE6F5909DB0"/>
the face upon an equality, and holds up its head as highly as we do ourſelves. Matters are ten times more embroiled than they were; wear ten times a worſe and a more threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſpect than they did ſeven months ago, and before that we entered on theſe meaſures, every ſtep taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in our preſent track, ſeems only to lead us into far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief and difficulties. Our adminiſtration is, in the mean time, become the wonder and the contempt of all Europe. When we find therefore, that we are going on in a road directly wrong, why don't we take a contrary courſe? This appears to be a moſt obvious ſtep; there is no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reach of reaſon, or extraordinary depth of human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom demanded, to make that concluſion. It is an old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb; that wiſe men do often, but fools never change their opinion. No one little or great need ſcruple to alter for the better his actions or his meaſures; it is ſurely his firſt praiſe and firſt prudence ſo to do. But what muſt be thought of thoſe, whom facts and events themſelves will not convince; or, who being convinced, are nevertheleſs determined to ſtrive and to contend againſt the irreſiſtible force of them? Our political pilots have a fair and a direct wind for the port, to which the commonwealth is bound; but they are obſtinately bent to run counter to it, to buffet ſtorms and tempeſts, to riſque rocks and quickſands, and to endanger in the greateſt degree the common adventure and fortunes of us all. We read a fabulous ſtory of an ancient Roman ſaid to have leaped into a gulph to ſave Rome; but what will poſterity believe, when they ſhall be told of the men of theſe times, who run headlong down a precipice for no apparent end, but to carry along with them their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the ſame ruin?</p>
            <p>The original deſign and expectation were at leaſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plain and intelligible; but the adminiſtration having been deceived in them, there is now no longer left the leaſt appearance of prudence or of policy in our proceedings. It is become difficult to comprehend, what the authors or the friends of theſe meaſures purſue even in their own breaſts. Let any one within the bounds of probability or almoſt of poſſibility fancy in his mind, events at pleaſure, and let him reflect by what ſteps, what means, what chain of incidents and accidents, what train within the wit of man to trace, it can be expected, that we ſhall in this violent and military method of going on come to a good and advantageous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and I believe, that he will evidently find himſelf
<pb n="07" facs="unknown:014439_0006_0F925DE7C254F838"/>
at a default on the ſubject. I am perſuaded, that our rulers would themſelves be put to it, to lay down fairly and clearly their own plan, nor is any ſuch commonly known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. The facts are public, the other would, no doubt not be difficult to find, if reaſon, appearances, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſuggeſted or admitted of any ſuch. The chaplains of our regiments are not to chop logick with the Americans, and to reaſon them into the being taxed at Weſtminſter: That is not the intention, nor will hard words bring this about, from whenceſoever trumpeted—No: We will force them to it—Be it ſo. Let us, without conſidering the chance of war or reſiſtance, ſuppoſe Boſton in aſhes, no one ſtone of it ſtanding on another, the inhabitants, men, women and children buried under its ruins, and all this havock and deſtruction the effect of our cannon, bombs and mortars. This would no doubt be a noble event; Europe would ſtare, and it would exceedingly redound to the honor and the glory of the government that ſhould atchieve it. However, let us come to the conſequences; the miſchief and the evil are eaſily found, rage and deſpair reigning every where, all our colonies crying out for vengeance, America in arms, and in open and avowed revolt againſt Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; theſe things need not to be pointed out. But how are butchery and maſſacre to conduct us to peace, to a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a reſtoration of union and of harmony, or to any deſireable end whatſoever? All regard for the Americans being baniſhed out of the queſtion, either as brethren or as men, it can nevertheleſs not be pretended, that we ought likewiſe to loſe ſight of the true intereſt and the benefit of our more immediate country of Great Britain, nor are we ſurely to ſeek for any other views or motives of our public counſels on the occaſion, than thoſe. God forbid, that there ſhould inſtead prevail paſſion, reſentment, an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of oppoſition and of diſappointment, a thirſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and for the blood of the people of Boſton and of New-England: Heaven avert, that there ſhould directly or indirectly, more nearly or more remotely, be at this moment preparing or meditating any deſperate ſtroke, which may disjoin America and Great Britain in a manner to be never united more! I will not deny, but that the queſtion reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plan of our conduct may with leſs difficulty be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, if ſome ſuch unfit principles and conſiderations are to be taken into the account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="08" facs="unknown:014439_0007_0F925DE9AB2257D8"/>
But ſome one may ſay, What a ſtrange tragedy and image have here been introduced? Who thinks of any ſuch thing? We would not for the world be the aggreſſors; but if the people of Boſton or of New-England ſhall begin firſt, and ſhall attack or unlawfully reſiſt us, you know, that the wrong will then be with them, and that all, which we ſhall do, will be nothing but ſelf-defence and the execution of the law, nor do we wage war but with men. I anſwer; that this is too high, too home and too ſerious a ſubject, on which for any one to refuſe himſelf or to be readily refuſed by others freedom of ſpeech. I preſume, that it is within the lawful liberty of an Engliſhman to demand, in return, to what end are then intended a military Governor, a fleet, an army, artillery, warlike proviſion and ammunition and ſupplies and reinforcements of theſe things, together with acts of Parliament, which, it was known, would not be obeyed? Are all theſe red coats and regiments muſtered there only to aſſiſt the people of America in the clearing of their plantations, the reaping of their harveſts, or the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their flocks and their herds? Should any one ſtart at the idea of Boſton being overthrown, what would he ſay, were he in plain Engliſh told, that there is no appearance or probability of carrying into execution ſome certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, without cutting the throats of almoſt all our Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, without dying its foreſts, its ſwamps and its ſavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs, with the blood of thoſe, whoſe anceſtors fled from their country, and went thither in hopes of finding refuge from the tyranny and the oppreſſion of the Governors of Great Britain? What does it matter, who dies a victim; the firſt or the laſt, and whether by the ſword, the muſket and the bayonet, or by famine, diſtreſs and miſery, when a whole region ſhall be laid waſte and depopulated? Is it difficult to pick a quarrel on any ſubject, or to drive a people into deſpair and then to deſtroy them for being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, or are there wanting writers or ſpeakers to defend any action or any meaſure? But will the gloſſing, the quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, the flattery of penſioners or of ſycop ants heal the wounds, calm the minds, appeaſe the paſſions, reconcile the affections, or blind and confound the underſtandings of an injured and exaſperated continent, conſiſting of many numerous and flouriſhing provinces, and inhabited by a people poſſeſſed and inſpired with a love of liberty almoſt loſt to the ſhame of the human ſpecies, out of Europe, but moſt pwerful and irreſiſtible wherever it prevails and is
<pb n="09" facs="unknown:014439_0008_0F925DEAA836B168"/>
united with the means of defence? I do not mean to talk to Miniſters and to Stateſmen about right and wrong, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, compaſſion and the cardinal virtues; but I repeat, that there is in theſe meaſures full as little of the policy of Machiavel as of the morality of Grotius, or the religion of the Whole Duty of Man; not a whit more of the wiſdom of the ſerpent than of the innocence of the dove.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of the nation is in the mean time moſt ſtrong againſt theſe tranſactions; people were not at the beginning ſo much moved; they appear not to have believed, that any men at the head of a ſtate would really be ſo wild and ſo headlong, as to bring about in effect what now ſtares them moſt ſtrongly and moſt fully in the face; it is well underſtood that the all of the public and of every private perſon is upon a deſperate caſt, at ſtake againſt nothing; men raiſe their eyes and their hands with horror, when they ſpeak on the occaſion; they ſympathiſe in common with the Americans, and expreſs plainly and roundly their own ſentiments on their account; ſuch are on the contrary ſilent and reſerved on the ſubject, who are uſed to direct their diſcourſe by mean motives; the change or diſcharge of theſe meaſures would be a moſt ſincere and univerſal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Shall then a great nation, with its eyes open and ſenſible of its ſituation and its danger, be drawn or driven upon its ruin, by a few men among them, and thoſe perhaps intruſted for its ſafety and its protection? Where is in that caſe the conſtitution, or what is our pretended and our boaſted repreſentation? Is there nothing, nothing even to the utmoſt extremity of our deſtruction, but what corruption can compaſs, and proſtitution will perform? Theſe proceedings are of that dangerous and deſtructive tendency, that whoever promotes or unites in them, does, as a private man, light a brand to fire his own houſe, and to lay waſte his own eſtate; but as one of the public he concurs with his own hand to thruſt a dagger into the heart of his already wounded, helpleſs and almoſt expiring country. It may be wondered how any ſuch perſon can hold up his hands towards heaven, to pray for proſperity on him or his, which he does himſelf ſo directly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. Can then any nation, famous for its freedom, want in ſuch an extremity ſome proper remedy and reſource againſt the rage, the madneſs, or the incapacity of an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?</p>

I anſwer, that our anceſtors were far from being ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of thoſe to come after them, as to have left us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns depending on our own domeſtic government without means very ſufficient for our ſafety and our welfare. The people of Great-Britain have a lawful, conſtitutional, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, undiſputed, undoubted power of application and petition. This is an inherent right of every county, every city, every borough, every body of men in it, and which any one may be confident, that no King, no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and, let me add, no Parliament will reſiſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; if the exertion of it ſhall be general, univerſal and unanimous, ſuch as ſhall evidently ſpeak with the full and the clear voice of the whole nation, it may in ſuch a caſe be depended upon for ſufficient and effectual. Never did perhaps any period of our hiſtory more require ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion than the preſent moment. I will not repeat what has been ſaid with reſpect to the ſtake, either of the public or of private perſons; but even the Miniſter muſt, in all appearance, be in his own breaſt pleaſed with it. It might afford him a fair opportunity, or almoſt force him, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his foot out of difficulties; in which he cannot but by this time be ſenſible how raſhly and inconſiderately he has involved both himſelf and his country. What unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable fatality is it, which can prevent any one at the helm of a nation from taking of his own accord ſo prudent and ſo ſalutary a ſtep. But this matter mounts higher. The King is bleſſed with a fair and a large family, from whom even a private parent might promiſe himſelf the greateſt comfort and felicity, but much more may his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, if they near him ſhall by their fatal and unfortunate counſels mingle no bitter in his cup. However let all loyal ſubjects well reflect, and eſpecially they firſt in favour, whether theſe meaſures are not of ſuch a magnitude and a malignity, that they may either immediately or in their conſequences throw the whole ſtate into the laſt confuſion, endanger our becoming a prey to foreign powers, ſhake the throne itſelf, and diſturb one day the peace and the happineſs of our gracious Prince, even within his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and in the midſt of his numerous royal progeny. To whomſoever we may therefore preſume on this ſubject to offer up our humble petitions, we ſhall beſeech thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable persſons to bleſs and to ſecure equally both the public and themſelves.</p>

It ſeems the more neceſſary to uſe this laſt ſafe reſource of the conſtitution, as it is difficult to find any other help, that is left for us under heaven. Our political parties and their leaders bear a ſuſpicion of covering and concealing, under pretences of the general good deſigns of perſonal ambition and advancement. The people of England have had but too much experience in that reſpect. What divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what connection, what denomination of men among us have not in their turn ſpoiled and plundered this poor country? Our liberties and our properties were before the Revolution attacked, under the pretence of prerogative, by a ſet of men who bore the name, and who invented or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the doctrine of Tories; but the virtue of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ſaved us then. Through how long a ſeries of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive adminiſtrations has ſince that time this nation been ſold, bartered and betrayed by a race of falſe, pretended, unworthy and venal Whigs; whoſe endeavours towards our deſtruction have unfortunately been more ſucceſsful than thoſe of their predeceſſors? God forbid, that we ſhould now be ready to receive our fatal and our final ſtroke from the joint force of both theſe cauſes, from the accurſed prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of corruption, united with the ſenſeleſs principles of a boundleſs obedience of the people, and of an extravagant power of the crown! Theſe evils do not perhaps leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the very places, which ought moſt to be a ſanctuary and a ſecurity againſt them. What is become of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient public ſpirit of England, when the firſt in rank and in fortune were ever the foremoſt to protect the rights of the whole? It is for the honor of our name and our nation to be hoped, that this noble paſſion of the human breaſt is retired, and is ſetting up its ſtandard among our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on the continent, if it has totally fled from this once free and fortunate iſland. It muſt grieve any one to aſk, Whether there are none, even in the reſpected band of our profeſſed patriots, who had it once in their power to have utterly extinguiſhed, but who left unhappily and purpoſely to lurk and to ſmother in their proceedings and in their own acts of parliament this very pretenſion, and, as it were, the ſame fire, which has ſince broken out ſo fiercely, and which threatens now to conſume in one common flame both Britain and America? However, it is to be hoped that theſe perſons will, from ſuch violent and ſuch evident miſchiefs, be at length convinced, nor continue backward to concur and to contribute towards ſome ſufficient meaſures for the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014439_0011_0F925DF22CB64A00"/>
laſting peace and relief of our country and our colonies. But we are now upon the brink of the precipice; our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation admits no longer of our being led blindfold; it is too late for us to truſt either to thorough-paced miniſters or to half-paced patriots; the time requires this nation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare its own genuine ſenſe, perhaps its laſt ſenſe of its condition and its circumſtances. How can we otherwiſe expect in this caſe the aſſiſtance of providence itſelf than in employing the powers, which his goodneſs has, by the means of the conſtitution and the proviſion of our anceſtors, been pleaſed to lodge with us for that apparent purpoſe?</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, have not we a legal repreſentative, and is not that ſufficient? I ſhall leave the matter of fact to anſwer with reſpect to the ſufficiency, but I deſire to ſay ſomething in explanation of the point itſelf. I hope to be perfectly underſtood, that I do not at all mean to deny our having ſuch a legal repreſentative; but it is ſurely juſt and becoming for us to diſcourſe on ſubjects of this conſequence with one another, like men. I preſume, that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for any one to aſk, whether there is not ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between a legal repreſentative and a real one. All bodies of men ſpeak and act by their majority. It is a handful of people in compariſon of the whole nation, which chooſe the major part of our Houſe of Commons. I may in ſaying this expreſs myſelf freely, but I offend no worthy or honeſt man. No ſuch will ever take offence at a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth, and none can well be more ſo than the fact, which is now mentioned. How can then, in the common uſe and ſenſe of the Engliſh language, any body of men really repreſent any others, than thoſe by whom the greater part of them are named and appointed for that purpoſe? This may not interfere with a legal repreſentation, nor do I declare myſelf any opinion about a real one. I am on the ſubject ready to receive with reſpect the dictates of my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It may perhaps be a myſtery in politics, or ſomething not at this moment comprehended by the writer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this legal, this real repreſentative, or in what manner ſoever that honorable body is to be deſcribed, they do ever ſuffer their fellow-ſubjects to apply to them by petition, through the hands of any one of their own members. This circumſtance is there neceſſary, but it ſeems to make no effectual difference. The right or practice itſelf has never been denied or diſputed, nor therefore has it ſtood in need of the ſanction of an act of parliament. The road is yet
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014439_0012_0F925DF2634D3370"/>
more direct to the throne; the ſubject preſents of himſelf, and without intervention, his petition there. This right was at the Revolution confirmed in as fit terms as the trueſt frind of the freedom of his country could have found. There are therefore required no ſtrings or belts to clear either of theſe ways; they remain ever plain and open, and lead immediately to thoſe who can afford us effectual redreſs and aſſiſtance. Thus ſtands then this point: Our throne is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, our peerage is hereditary, the major part of our Houſe of Commons is appointed by an inconſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the nation; can then many words be wanted to recommend or to enforce the practice of petition by the people and the public, or is the community to have no ſhare in its own coſtitution, in its legiſlature, its government, and the determination of its moſt important and moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential concerns?</p>
            <p>However, as we have in our hands proper, prudent, and peaceable means of ſtopping or of diverting theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo let us on the other ſide conſider; whether we ſhall not by a neglect of them become partakers in the guilt of the wrongs done to the Americans, and of the ruin brought on ourſelves and our poſterity. All people are reſponſible for the public conduct of thoſe, whom they appoint or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be over them; this is the law of men and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it is likewiſe that of a higher power; it is the law of nature. I obſerve with reverence, that providence ſeems to unite together the intereſts and concerns, the fate and fortunes of each ſtate and of each kingdom, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at their hands an account of the actions of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective rulers, whether princes, miniſters, or any other; their proſperity and their adverſity appear to be in a great degree dealt out to them according to that circumſtance. It is ſtrange, on what ground ſome people found their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; for the public does not only appoint govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its firſt original; but it is moſt evident, that it does afterwards continue at all times to anſwer for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and the meaſures of its governors both to God and to man. But with reſpect to our own caſe in the preſent inſtance, can there be in the affairs of humanity a fairer or a more equitable condition than for people to have in their own power the means of removing their danger, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their ſtability? However it behoves us to remember on what terms we enjoy it. The Americans may one day require at our hands, and retaliate upon us their own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014439_0013_0F925DF517193D10"/>
and moſt certainly will do ſo, if we ſhall not exert to effect theſe means inherent in us, but that the things and the events already begun and in motion ſhall come to extremity. The ſtory of the war carried on by the Dutch in ſupport of their liberty, againſt the Portugueſe and the Spaniards, will ſufficiently teach us this; if we need to go beyond our own reaſon for ſuch a piece of inſtruction. We have in ourſelves, and placed in our hands, the power on this occaſion of inſuring our own ſafety, and of reſtoring to our colonies and our countrymen of America their rights, their peace, their properties, and their liberties, a moſt noble and ineſtimable privilege, but in all appearance not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to us without account.</p>
            <p>It may however be aſked, what way is then to be taken, what clue can be found, that may lead us out of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perplexity and difficulties? I anſwer, that it is much more eaſy to embroil a ſtate, which is in peace and in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, than it is to reduce it again to the ſame deſirable ſituation, when it ſhall once be ſo embroiled. However I will in ſo important a matter venture to hazard an opinion, although with ſome uncertainty of the future fact whereon it is grounded. There is ſaid to be ſitting, at Philadelphia, a Congreſs of ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſons of that continent. It appears probable, that there may from them come in ſome ſhape or another propoſitions to the public or to the government. Should that be ſo, let not theſe be out of an ill-judged pride or idea of ſuperiority deſpiſed and refuſed, but on the contrary adopted and made the ground and the foundation of a future ſettlement and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment between us and America: I won't prevaricate or deny that, I mean in ſome meaſure a new one; for of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again exactly and preciſely to the former and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient one, there is not the leaſt appearance of probability; although there ſhall in the way be nothing more than what is known to have already happened. They have once truſted to our experience and our prudence; however they have found theſe but a weak and a ſlender ſecurity. They will undoubtedly expect ſome ſtronger and better barrier, ſome line to be drawn, or ſome land-mark to be fixed, in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity between us. I ſpeak it with the utmoſt ſincerity; that I verily believe them to underſtand the joint intereſts of Great-Britain and of America better than we do, and that they will in the firſt inſtance propoſe nothing unfit or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming with reſpect to this country; but ſhould we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014439_0014_0F925DF54DD89DE0"/>
or reject proper terms, when they are offered, we may perhaps afterwards not come readily to the ſame again. On Charles the firſt granted ten times more at laſt, than would have contented and have ſatisfied at firſt; but he ever ſuffered himſelf to be forced; that was his evil policy and evil fortune. None thanked him for what he did. He loſt at length all, his head not excepted. Do not let our ſtate or our government imitate in their conduct that unfortunate prince. There may directly be for a kingdom no block or ſcaffold; but there are juſt and equal laws, and a ſevere and irreſiſtible fatality attending upon the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of them. What is in the general courſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite univerſe, perpetually proceeding in obedience to thoſe laws, the exiſtence, the riſe, or the fall of a ſtate, any more upon the compariſon than that of a ſingle perſon? Theſe are not light and trifling matters, which are now in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a midſummer night's dream, or the ſtory of a day; with which we may divert ourſelves at our will. It may be depended upon; that it is for ever, if theſe provinces ſhall once be ſevered from us. The command and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of great countries are not to be taken up again at pleaſure, when they ſhall have fallen from the hand that holds them, like the playthings of children.</p>
            <p>But it may be obſerved to have been thrown out, that France and Spain would interfere; whereas nothing of that kind has happened, nor are we diſturbed by either of them. I anſwer, that their miniſters of ſtate muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been much as thoughtleſs and as inconſiderate as our own. It is fit, that the fiſh ſhould faſten on the hook or be entangled in the net, beyond the power of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting free, before the hand appears which is to ſtrike or to make a prey of it. He is ſurely but a poor politician, who can be laid aſleep by thoſe two cabinets, being more cunning than to ſtay or to turn us in the beginning of a career, which muſt be ſo much to their ſatisfaction and their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is an old proverb, that any one ſhould make a bridge of gold for his enemy when he is flying from him. Is it to be doubted, but that theſe powers would willingly pave, almoſt with any materials and at any expence, a way for us to march and to attack our own provinces; thoſe provinces which have ſo long been the ſupport of ourſelves, and the envy of other nations. It has been ſaid, that they have before now found the means of paving the way to their own peace with us; but heaven forbid that they ſhould ever
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014439_0015_0F925DF607B5F020"/>
find that of putting us at daggers-draw among ourſelves, of engaging in a war with one another the mother country and our colonies of North-America! Whenever that ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarred hour ſhall arrive, and by whoſe folly or artifice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever brought about, the arms of our rivals will hardly he wanted to lay the glory and the greatneſs of Britain in the duſt. France and Spain laugh and ſing in the mean time to ſee what we are doing, and it may be depended upon, that they know better than to meddle at this moment in our broils.</p>
            <p>There is another point, to which I would ſpeak a word, before I have done. Some ſycophants and makers of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on the other ſide of the Atlantic ſeem to have had no ſmall part in cauſing the preſent diſturbances. Why ſhould otherwiſe all theſe have rather ariſen in Maſſachuſetts-Bay than in Connecticut or in Rhode-Iſland; except that we appoint the Governors in the former, and that the people themſelves do ſo in the latter. The counſels of theſe men muſt, upon experience, have been found wrong and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. They magnified the mighty power of parliaments, and appear to have flattered ſome people here, as if their ſinger was irreſiſtible. Had they pointed out events, as they have really happened; it is impoſſible that we ſhould have conducted ourſelves as we have actually done. All this may clearly be accounted for, if we ſuppoſe one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is that they meant to advance themſelves in Great-Britain, however their endeavours might turn out either for us or for America. It would be a moſt ſtrange thing, ſhould theſe ſame perſons be ſtill conſulted, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and encouraged. We ought to be ſenſible how clearly we have already paid on that article. The writer does not know the face of one of them; I ſpeak ſingly for the ſake of the public; but there can in all appearance no common good come to the two countries of Great-Britain and of North America, until that theſe fatal authors of our mutual evils ſhall be baniſhed from all counſels and confidence.</p>
            <p>So much for my preſent object. I have on this occaſion not entered into the difficulty, or rather the apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, of ſubduing with a few thouſands of ſoldiers from England a very great continent, moſt ſtrong in itſelf, and defended by ſome hundreds of thouſands of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants naturally placed over the different parts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the produce and the advantages of the country,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014439_0016_0F925DF6B9A32468"/>
and who are armed, trained and ready to take the field in defence of what they believe to be their all; men of tried bravery, and that have upon experience performed many actions of remark. I have not inſiſted on the abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their finding, in caſe of a direct rupture and revolt from Great-Britain, foreign aſſiſtance. I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned our miniſters having wantonly, and in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of perſonal ambition, taken upon themſelves the affairs of our Eaſt-India Company, and having by that means ſubjected on any contention with the native powers of thoſe regions, the nation to the danger of being one day found between the two fires of the Weſt-Indies and the Eaſt, and perhaps at the ſame time a fire in Europe hotter than either of the others. I have not examined the burthen of our national debt preſſing in the midſt of theſe circumſtances moſt heavily upon us. I have not touched on very many other topicks reſpecting our preſent ill-judged and ill-omened attempt; theſe were of a preceding ſubject. This matter has now been only taken up on the ground where it was left upon a former argument, and upon our meaſures and the change and the ſtate of affairs in America ſince that time; here will I likewiſe leave it once more.</p>
            <p>It is not owing to a want of information, to a want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to a want of a ſenſe and a knowledge of the importance or the imprudence of our American meaſures, if ſome people of property, of capacity, of independence ſeem to ſleep ſupinely, while a rock is ready to fall and to cruſh their country. There is in public concerns an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectneſs, which obtains and daily increaſes among us, and that in a rank of men where it ought leaſt to prevail, and to whom others are intitled to look up in a time of danger or of difficulty. The riſe and the beginning of this might readily be pointed out, it was not firſt in this reign; but theſe men may truly be told, that there is no ſupport for themſelves, but in the ſtability of all; that their private fortune and poſſeſſions will in the common deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt inevitably go to wreck and to ruin with the reſt; the cloud from the Atlantic threatens them, as well as the merchant and the manufacturer, the farmer and the labourer. But we ſeem not to remember, that we are born Britons; that governments are inſtituted for the good of the governed, and for that only; that we have in our immediate, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and collective capacity an inherent right to ſignify our ſentiments of the national meaſures to thoſe who contrive, govern and direct them; that the concern therein of many
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014439_0017_0F925DF8AC1CA9E0"/>
is upon the compariſon much as conſiderable one for one as their own, but that of all united and taken together almoſt at the ocean to a drop of water; that we are men and not a ſtock of ſheep forced to follow our fellow, becauſe be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to bear a bell about his neck. The writer has thrown out theſe things from a ſincere and earneſt deſire of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſafety and welfare; he heartily hopes that the ſeed is ſown in good ground, and that it will bear fruit for the benefit of the whole; but if, after all, the hand of fate is upon this nation; if the period approaches in which we are doomed to periſh; if there is at once an incurable madneſs in our councils, and a boundleſs obſequiouſneſs in our proper guardians and protectors; if the conſtitution is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and men of weight and of reſpect abandon their country; I muſt ſay, that his will be done, who governs both individuals and communities. I truſt nevertheleſs, that theſe words will not be ſo loſt, but that they ſhall at leaſt preſerve one private perſon from the charge and the conſciouſneſs of having ſcrupled to ſpeak plainly his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and his expectation of the dangers and the evils im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over the public.</p>

This is another material circumſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, pointed out and preſſed in the foregoing book. I mean now to make no reflections on the ſubject; time will tell, whether the conſequences ſhall alſo be ſuch as are there ſuppoſed or conceived.

of the late acts of parliament, and if the ſame ſhould be attempted to be carried into execution by force, all America ought in ſuch a caſe to ſupport them in their oppoſition.</q> This neither needs nor admits of any comment; but how amply does it fulfil what we were on that head forewarned! However, let us at leaſt not neglect the caution which it contains, for the time to come. It is likewiſe almoſt impoſſible for an Engliſhman not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, with the moſt ſincere regret, that the firſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a new and an eſſential aſſembly among ourſelves have been ſuch, as muſt by all men in our America be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to approve and to maintain, in the higheſt and the harſheſt of language, the meaſures carrying on againſt them. It becomes the writer to receive with reſpect theſe reſolves of our legiſlature; however I ſhall, in regard thereto, deſire once more every perſon having for his country any concern, moſt ſeriouſly to conſider, whether humble, conſtitutional, general and univerſal petitions, are not our laſt and our only remaining, although at the ſame time our ſure and our certain reſource, if they ſhall duly and properly be employed and applied.</p>
