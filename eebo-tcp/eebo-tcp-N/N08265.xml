            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Invention of this most useful Instrument, (by the Help whereof the glorious Gospel hath been transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the most dark and distant Corners of the Earth) some attribute to one <hi>Iohn Goia,</hi> or <hi>Flavia Gola,</hi> as others stile him, of <hi>Amalphi,</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> who only accommodated the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfices thereof with eight Points; that is, four cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and four collateral, and so left the Improvement of this Invention to be attempted by Posterity; others do intitle the Invention thereof to the People of <hi>China.</hi> Doctor <hi>Gilbert,</hi> in his Book de Magnete, asserts, that <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> transported it first into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Year 1260, having learnt it from the <hi>Chinese</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> in his Book, entituled the Navigator's Supply, in 1597, relateth a Story of two East-Indians, that he had personal Conference with, (one of them was of <hi>Manilla,</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Laron,</hi> the other of <hi>Miaco,</hi> of <hi>Iapan,</hi>) who declared, that instead of our Compass, they used a magnetical Needle of six Inches, and longer, upon a Pin, in a Dish of white China Earth, filled with Water, in the Bottom whereof they have two Cross Lines for the principal Winds, the Rest of the Divisions being left to the Skill of their Pilots.

            <p>Let the Invention be attributed to whom it will, it's manifestly known to have received it's absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in <hi>Europe:</hi> but more particularly, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of this Invention, is annexing to the Compass Twenty Four subordinate Winds or Points, and also on the Limb thereof Three Hundred and Sixty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which are numbered from North and South, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East and West, with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. so that it appeareth that every Point containeth Eleven Degrees, and Fifteen Minutes. Upon the North Point there is a Flower-de-Luce, to distinguish it from the Rest of the Points.</p>
            <p>Now after all that hath been said about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, or rather all the Thirty Two Points thereof, it would have been of little or no Service at all without the Addition of the Magnetical Needle; the Two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether makes one of the most valuable Instruments in the known World, if rightly used; and on the other Hand, if it be applied to bad Designs and Purposes, more hurtful than Gun-Powder.</p>
            <p>Now in the next Place, it may not be improper to speak some Things of the Variation of the Compass, and of the natural Cause thereof; with some Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the Variation. The Variation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,

            <p>This Variation of the Compass, was formerly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to remain the same; which I suppose hath given Rise to the Opinion of the first Author thereof, Mr. <hi>Seller,</hi> who (as it appears by former Impressions of his Book) supposed the Variation of the Compass to be occasioned by the Excavation of some Parts of this Terrestrial Globe; and by Magnetical Veins colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally respecting the Needle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But now the Variation is known to vary in all Places, as appears by the following Observations of the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Compass near the City of <hi>London,</hi> for above One Hundred and Seventy Seven Years last past.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> comparing several Observations, made at <hi>Lime-House, October</hi> the 16th, 1580, and found the mean Variation to be Eleven Degrees and Seventeen Minutes, easterly.</p>
            <p>By Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi>'s Observations at the <hi>Lime-House, Iune</hi> the 13th, 1622, the mean Variation was then Five Degrees and Fifty Five Minutes, easterly.</p>

he knew her afterwards. To which others (among whom is the excellent Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi>) make, as they think, a very clear reply, namely, that from parallel Expressions in the Scriptures, it appears, that there is no Necessity for such an Intimation: But we beg Leave to observe, that in the various Instances they produce, there is not one parallel to the Case before us; for if in them no such Intimation presents itself, it is because there is an obvious, an apparent Reason for it. To give you a Specimen, in first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> xv.35, we read,
<q>and <hi>Samuel</hi> came no more to see <hi>Saul,</hi> until the Day of his Death;</q>
now since the Passage signifies that <hi>Samuel</hi> came no more to see <hi>Saul</hi> as long as he lived, there is a parallel Reason, why it cannot be intimated, that he came to see him afterwards; namely, because it was impossible he should; whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Our Lord, say some is called the first-born Son of <hi>Mary</hi>; and the mention of a First (say they) implies a Second; but this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is readily confuted by the Scripture usage of the Phrase, as may appear from <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii.2, sanctify to me all the first-born; for they who had but one Child, were from that Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oblig'd to sanctify him to God.</p>

Continue this method of purging three or four times, but let there be two or three days between each purge. Where the patient is weak, purge with <hi>extractum rudii,</hi> giving two or three pills every other night; the pills to be about the size of a garden pea: If the patient is weak and unable to bear it, there must be a longer intermission.

               <p>Give the patient a gill and an half first in the morning, and the same quantity going to bed, at night.</p>
               <p>The patient must take particular care to keep to a strict diet, such as, wheat bread well raised, or good bisk<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>FIRST, when the patient is taken, let ten ounces of blood be drawn from the arm of the side opposite to that affected with the disease, and presently give three spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the decoction of rattle-snake root, which must be repeated every six hours, till the symptoms abate in a great degree. But if they should return notwithstanding, which happens sometimes, bleeding is to be repeated in the same quantity as at first, and so in like manner a third and fourth time, or oftener; though it seldom happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the breast is only affected with the pain, or both sides and the breast affected at once, the same method is to be followed as wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n one side is only affected, the disease being the same notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that difference in the symptoms. For ordinary drink, give hysop decoction, or a tea drawn from marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow roots, sweetened with honey; but in case of a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attending the case, let the drink be sweetened with double refined sugar, and the cinamon and hartshorn before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, are to be given with the powdered rattle-snake root in a little of it; and it is to be observed, that both the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the root and tea are given warm. If the patient be troubled with a vomiting, or nausea, give one spoonful and an half of the decoction every three hours, or if that should be immediately thrown up, give half a spoonful of the decoction every hour; observing in such case to bleed as before advised. There is a disease called a pleurisy, wherein bleeding is of ill consequence, which may with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be called a latent or spurious peripneumony; yet the above method with the decoction of the root, is a very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

This disease personates a pleurisy or peripneumony, to a superficial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server, the symptoms being the same, only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the pulse is always low, which in an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pleurisy or peripneumony, is so only upon the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, or when the disease is upon terminating in death:— But it is to be noted for a mark of this latent peripneumony, that upon its first approach the patient is cold, convulsed, and very much inclined to sleep, and also that it attacks in autumn after excessive hot summers attended with much rain; and towards February, or sooner, if the winter sets in very cold, translates to an inflammatory pleurisy or perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumony. The operation of this root is different according to the circumstances of the constitution and disease; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is by vomit, at other times by sweat, urine and stool, and in some cases, such as a latent peripneumony, it has none of these operations in any degree; yet the patient is surprizingly recovered; which shews that it strongly atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the blood. The success of the aforesaid method is proved from experience to be so great, that an intermitting fever is not carried off with more certainty with Jesuits bark, than a pleurisy or peripneumony is with the seneka rattle-snake root. And the cure is often effected the third day, if the method be followed up from the first attack of the distemper, and also that the patient will find great relief in the space of an hour after the decoction; though every one may not, yet it has that effect very often: And whether the disease be in the beginning, increase, or last state, the medicine has like effects, and answers to perfection the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of all the methods prescribed by authors of the best note for these different stages.</p>
               <p>The decoction of seneka rattle-snake root is made by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three ounces of it in a quart of water over a slow fire till near one half is evaporated; then strain the liquor thro' a cloth. The root must be reduced to a gross powder, that, the water may fully draw its efficacy. The plant grows plentifully in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, in the freshes and hilly grounds, and affects a light and tolera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The root is of a light yellow colour, resembling ippecacuana in its texture and shape, but it is larger, has a strong pungency without heat, but does not communicate that property upon chewing it immediately. The leaves are something like green tea, and the stalk is commonly from six to twelve inches high, on the top of which are white flowers something like the rattles of a snake, while in bud,
<pb facs="unknown:010551_0020_0F8092580533F090"/>
which appear among the first flowers in the woods: And there are no branches from the stalks, but several stalks arise from one root generally, though only one stalk from a root may be seen sometimes.</p>
