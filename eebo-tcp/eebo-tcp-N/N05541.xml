            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Beaver is now very good, and will be ſo two Weeks hence; two Sabbath Days hence Beaver will be as good as when catch'd under the ice. The young Men want to know when Beaver is good.</p>

                     <p>You find that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have faithfully fulfill'd all their Promiſes with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and therefore juſtly expect the like Return from you; and in Conſequence hereof, that you uſe your beſt Endeavours that all our Captives may be forthwith reſtored, that ſo there may be no further Reaſon for Complaint on this Account.</p>

After their Dance was finiſhed,</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſioners drank King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Health, wiſhing that the Peace now ratified might continue as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure.</p>

                     <p>Agreable to our Promiſe the laſt Year, we acquainted the Government of the three Things you then complained of. The firſt was with Reſpect to the Price of Goods, which you have cheaper now than in Governor DUMMER's Time. The ſecond was relating to one <hi>Hall</hi> and his Family, living at <hi>Montinicus,</hi> who you complained of as ſpoiling your Hunting; and he has ſince been removed by Order of the Government. The other was, that ſeveral Engliſhmen from the Weſtward had frequently hunted on your Lands to the ſpoiling of your Game: The Government hath ſince made a Law to forbid any Perſons hunting there under very ſevere Penalties. So that you ſee the three Things the <hi>Penobſcotts</hi> and you complained of are redreſſed; and as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been as good as their Word to you, we expect the like from you; and that by next Spring, according to your preſent Promiſe, you go after the Captives, and bring them in; otherwiſe we ſhall look upon it that you intend to break the Peace now ſubſiſting between us.</p>

                  <p>In Conſequence of theſe Purchaſes, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took Poſſeſſion of ſaid Lands, and made Settlements upon them, and carried on a great Trade, particularly at <hi>Cuſhnoc</hi> and <hi>Teconnoc,</hi> where are now to be ſeen the Ruins of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſes.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> therefore have an undoubted Right to all the aforeſaid Lands, and conſequently have a Right to ſettle them whenever they think proper: And it is expected by this Government, after giving you this Satisfaction, that you do not diſturb the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in any Settlements they are now about or may hereafter undertake on the Lands aforeſaid: And we on our Part promiſe you, that you ſhall not be interrupted in your Hunting &amp; Fiſhing; to which Purpoſe a Law of this Government has been made ſince the laſt Treaty, at your Deſire, forbidding under a very ſevere Penalty all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from Hunting within ſaid Lands, or giving you the leaſt Interruption in that or any other Regard.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Brethren of Penobſcott and Norridgawock,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT my Return to my Government, I found Letters from you to Lieutenant Governor PHIPS, dated the 6th of <hi>July</hi> laſt, from St. <hi>George's-Fort,</hi> and the 13th of the ſame Month from <hi>Fort-Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> in which you deſire that the Conference between this Government and your Tribes may be ſooner this Year than it was laſt Fail, as that was held in your Hunting Seaſon, when but few of you could attend it, which created Jealouſies and Diſſatisfaction among thoſe that were abſent: And in the Letter from St. <hi>George's-Fort</hi> it is particularly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, <q>That if I was returned to <hi>Boſton,</hi> you ſhould be glad you might ſee me, which would be a great Satisfaction to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to theſe Letters, I informed you in mine dated the 11th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> of my Arrival at <hi>Boſton</hi>; and that the Buſineſs of my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would not permit me to meet you in Perſon this Year; but that I ſhould endeavour to ſend Commiſſioners to you as early as poſſible, with the Preſents which this Government hath agreed to diſtribute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually among you, ſo long as you ſhall maintain good Faith &amp; Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with it. And I have ſince receiv'd Letters from you in Anſwer to it, dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 23d from St. <hi>George</hi>'s, and the 20th from <hi>Richmond,</hi> wherein you tell me, you rejoice at my Return from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that you are ſorry the Buſineſs of my Government will not admit of my meeting you this Year, that you like the Contents of my Letter very much, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Commiſſioners may be ſent to you early in this Month, which Time the <hi>Norridgawock</hi> Tribe inform me, will ſuit the St. <hi>Francois</hi> Indians well, ſome of them ſent me at the ſame Time a Preſent of a String of Wampum, as a Token of Friendſhip from their Tribe, who deſire to be admitted to the Conference and Treaty with us.</p>
            <p>According to your Deſire, <hi>Brethren,</hi> and my Promiſe to you, I now ſend you Commiſſioners to brighten the Covenant Chain between us, and to diſtribute the Preſents among you, as ſoon as I poſſibly could.</p>

I muſt now, <hi>Brethren,</hi> acquaint you that I have receiv'd a Letter from the Jeſuit <hi>Pierre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the French Miſſionary to <hi>Penobſcott</hi> Tribe, dated the 25th of <hi>August</hi> juſt from St. <hi>George's</hi> Fort, in which he tells me, <q>That he underſtands I deſign to have a Treaty with you, and deſires me not to mention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Interview any more; that he had a great Deal of Trouble ſince the laſt Interview, to prevent the Jealouſy of thoſe Indians who were not preſent at it, from having a very miſchievous Effect; and that the moſt ſure Way to maintain Peace between you and us, would be for to let him know our Will, and that he would take Care to let me know your's; and he intreats me, that if I write to him, and think proper to pay any Regard to what he ſhall write to me in Anſwer, that it may be tranſacted between us as ſecretly as is poſſible, for that he deſired nothing ſo much as to maintain Peace:</q> As you will ſee by his Letter under his own Hand.</p>
            <p>I muſt alſo apprize you, that I have receiv'd a Letter from an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, informing me, that the ſame Jeſuit aſſur'd him, a War would ſoon break out between the two Nations, and between us and you, and urg'd him to write to me, to prevent the Commiſſioners from coming to treat with you; and that he made him promiſe, that he would not let you know what he ſaid, nor that he had wrote to me.</p>
            <p>This Letter and Suggeſtions of the Jeſuit, <hi>Brethren,</hi> the plain Deſign of which is to prevent this Government from having any Treaty with you, and conſequently from making you the Preſents which they have promiſed to give you from Year to Year; being ſo contrary to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire expreſs'd in your Letter to me, and to the Friendſhip which this Government hath for you, and is deſirous to maintain with you: I thought proper, tho' this Prieſt, deſires they may be kept ſecret from you, to communicate to you by the Commiſſioners, that you may judge for your ſelves, Whether inſtead of uſing his Endeavours to preſerve Peace between us, as he ſolemnly profeſſes in his Letter, he is not uſing Artifices to break it; Whether he is really ſeeking to promote your Welfare by doing thus, or the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> at your Coſt, and How far you may confide in the Sincerity of this holy Father your Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>I can further aſſure, <hi>Brethren,</hi> that this Prieſt's Suggeſtion, that War will ſoon break out between the two Nations, is groundleſs, and that there was no Sign of it in <hi>France,</hi> whilſt I was there about a Year ago, nor in <hi>England,</hi> which I left a few Months ſince: I doubt not but the <hi>French</hi> may be deſirous of involving you and us in a War, if they can, by their Artifices; but I have Reaſon to think, that they will not be fond of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a War themſelves with us very ſoon, leaſt they ſhould looſe <hi>Canada</hi> in it, as they did <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> in the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007025_0025_102AEBE4D56A50A8"/>
I have only to add, that if the Buſineſs of my Government will permit, I will endeavour to have the Satisfaction of an Interview with you my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the next Year, and recommend it to you, to preſerve Peace and good Faith with us in the mean Time, in which Caſe you may depend upon all reaſonable Acts of Kindneſs and Friendſhip on the Part of this Government, for promoting your Welfare and Proſperity.</p>

I had a great deal of Trouble after the laſt Interview, to prevent the Jealouſy of thoſe who were not preſent at it, from having a very bad Effect. The moſt ſure Way to maintain Peace between you and the Indians, would be to let me know your Will, and I would take Care to let you know that of the Indians. I pray only, that if you write to me, and if you think fit to pay any Regard to what I ſhall Anſwer, we may do it as ſecretly as poſſible, for I deſire nothing ſo much, as to maintain the Peace now ſubſiſting. I will do all I can to this End, being no more engag'd for the Service of the King of <hi>France,</hi> than I am for that of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
