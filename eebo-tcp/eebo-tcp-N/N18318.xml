            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MARY.</speaker>
               <p>I AM glad to ſee you my Siſter, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Diſcourſe may be for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and I deſire to know whether you are well in body, but more eſpecially whether your ſoul is in health and proſperity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MARTHA.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive, Siſter, your enquiry after my health requires a more deep and ſolemn anſwer than is common at the meeting of friends, who uſually enquire only after the welfare of the mortal body, as tho' that was a matter of the greateſt importance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MARY.</speaker>
               <p>Truly it is ſo: But why are we not more concerned for the immortal ſoul than the mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our friend? Is it not becauſe we are apt to look more at things that are ſeen, which are temporal, than at the things that are not ſeen, which are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Could the clouds be removed, and the veil drawn aſide that hides eternity from our ſight, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſhould often be apt to forget to enquire whether this mortal body was healthy, and our firſt and laſt diſcourſe when we met together would be concerning our ſoul's health, and that eternal life that ſhall never end. But you have not yet told me whether you are well.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MAR.</speaker>
               <p>I can anſwer concerning my body; thro' the mercy of GOD I am well. But when I think of my ſoul I hardly know what to ſay concerning that; but I cannot ſay it is in health, for it is almoſt ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares of this preſent life, which makes me feel unfit for the ſervice of GOD or man. I long to have it otherways, but I cannot obtain my deſire: If you can tell me of any way to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>O how happy I ſhould be if I had nothing to do but to ſit at JESUS' feet and hear his words; but there is ſo much neceſſary ſervice for me to do in the affairs of this world, that it not only takes up my time, but takes up my mind alſo too much, and cauſes many troubles: So that I am ſometimes ready to wiſh that I had wings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <sp>
               <speaker>MARY.</speaker>
               <p>You ſeem to think you ſhould be happy if you had nothing to do but to ſit at JESUS' feet and hear his words, but I can tell you we ſhould always be at the feet of JESUS, let our work be what it will. Our trouble does not conſiſt in what we have to do or ſuffer; but ſin is the cauſe of all our trouble. We may be as truly at the feet of CHRIST, and take as much pleaſure when we are doing his will, as when we have nothing to do but to ſit and hear his words. It is pleaſant to know what our LORD commands us to do, but much of our happineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in doing his will. Therefore you are unwiſe to wiſh for wings to fly away to find reſt; for true reſt is only to be found in the place where our wiſe LORD ſees fit to put us: There is the beſt place in all the world for us to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, if we can but caſt our troubleſome ſins away.</p>

               <p>Truly the Scriptures are full of ſuch conſolations; I ſee they fully prove more than you have ſaid. Our glorious Redeemer takes ſuch conſtant care and particular notice of his children, that there ſhall not an hair of their head periſh without his leave. And he hath ſurely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed over and over, by many words, that he will do them good. I ſee that I am a fooliſh child. I have troubled myſelf about things that did not belong to me. I mourn to think of what I have done. I have been as it were trying to take the LORD's work out of his hands, and the work he hath appointed for me to do I have too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. O that I could always live as happy as

you do when you ſit weeping at the feet of our lovely JESUS! I know by experience that's a joyful place to ſit at So joyful that I believe none ever ſit there long before they weep for joy. Tho' I am too careful and troubled about many things, yet at ſome happy moments I have known the joy of weeping at my Maſter's feet. At firſt I began to weep for ſorrow, but as ſoon as I heard his ſoul-reviving voice I began to weep for joy. And while you have been telling how happy we might live, my own experience appears and gives in a witneſs of the truth of what you ſay.</p>

I think I ſhould be thankful if I may be permitted like a dog to pick up the crumbs that fall from the bleſſed Maſter's table, where he feeds his children.

I conclude I am more eaſily led aſtray than any other mortal that ever taſted of the love of JESUS. For when at any time my dear LORD leads me away from all my troubles into the field of pleaſure, and there my ſoul begins to feaſt and take delight, then ſome trifling care, or ſome vain temptation comes and takes me by the hand, and I am ſo fooliſh that away I go, and forſake the paths of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to walk in the ways of darkneſs: Then I am in trouble, and many ſorrows compaſs me about. Thus I deſtroy myſelf; but I cannot help my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. What ſhall I do in ſuch a caſe? How ſhall I get back when I have run away from CHRIST?</p>

to the teſtimony of Scripture, and the witneſs of experience. It is a mournful and a ſhameful thing to run away from the bleſſed JESUS, who is the ſpring of all our life, joy and pleaſure. But ſince we are ſuch fooliſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that we are very apt to leave our Father's rich table to feed among the ſwine, how ſhall we get back again? We can run away from CHRIST, but we can never return to him again without his ſpecial aſſiſtance; but yet there is a duty for us to do, tho' fallen never ſo low. We are active creatures, and therefore we muſt be active in returning again to our Father's houſe. Tho' we are ſunk as low, and bound as faſt as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was, yet from thence we muſt look towards his holy temple, and cry to him that is able to help us.</p>

               <speaker>MARTHA.</speaker>
               <p>But ſometimes I am in a worſe caſe than <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he was in the whales belly: for tho' he had no way to help himſelf, yet he had praying breath, ſo that he could cry to the LORD for help and was heard and ſoon relieved. But as for me I am often ſwallowed up by worldly cares or carnal ſecurity, or ſomething as bad, and carried down the ſtream againſt my will, and yet I have no heart to pray, and it ſeems like mockery to aſk for help in words when the LORD knows my heart is not engaged therein.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MARY.</speaker>
               <p>This is a ſad caſe indeed; but even in ſuch a caſe we ought to pray and not to faint. If we ſtay here and yield to ſin, and give over trying to aſk for help we ſhall be in danger of growing harder and harder, until our laſt ſtate is worſe than the firſt. (Not that I think any will utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall from ſaving grace; but grace will ſurely
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023767_0011_0FC11613F0B567F8"/>
teach all that poſſeſs it to pray.) Therefore we muſt exert all our power in begging and pleading to the LORD for help, and never give over tho' he gives us no anſwer, or tho' the enemy tells us to hold our peace, yet let us cry ſo much the more. Tho' the bleſſed JESUS ſhould long hide his face; and at length frown upon us and tell us it is not meet to give children's bread to ſuch dogs as we he; yet we muſt not give out for that, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth thereof; yet plead with the dogs to be permitted to eat of the children's crumbs. We muſt, like the poor prodigal, reſolve to return, tho' we feel ourſelves a great way off in a foreign land and our compaſſionate Father will run to meet his returning children. He pities them when he ſees them toiling all night for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and he is pleaſed with their earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, tho' he knows that without him they can do nothing. The love of our Redeemer is ſuch, that when he ſees we can live no longer without him, he will appear and turn our night into day, and our ſorrow ſhall be ſweetened with joy. O how our hearts rejoice to ſee our LORD again, after we have been encloſed in clouds and thick darkneſs! Glory to his name that he blots out as a cloud our tranſgreſſions, and as a thick cloud our ſins, and comes for our relief: When all other refuge fails us, the Beauty of Heaven comes leaping on the mountains, and ſkipping on the hills. Then we mourn and rejoice at the ſame time; our own works make us mourn, and cauſe us ſhame. We ſee that to us belongs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhame and confuſion of face becauſe we have ſinned againſt ſuch a holy GOD; but we rejoice in the LORD who is the rock of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023767_0012_0FC1161725411C00"/>
Then we reſolve never to run away from our lovely JESUS again. We long to get more near to him ſtill. His love is ſo attracting, that the more we ſee of his glory, the more we long to ſee.</p>

               <speaker>MARY.</speaker>
               <p>None but the LORD can keep us, yet he hath appointed a work for us to do, ſo that we ought to be as active as tho' we could do all our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We muſt work out our own ſalvation with fear and trembling; yet every ſoul that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys this command knows it is GOD that works within them both to will and to do of his good pleaſure. This is a miſtery that cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded by words as it may be underſtood by feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth thereof by experience. I think by Scripture and experience that the only way to live in the ſenſible poſſeſſion of the love of GOD, is to keep his commands: As JESUS ſays, <hi>He that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me will keep my commands, and my Father will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him.</hi> We muſt watch and pray continually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' at ſome happy moments we may feel as tho' the danger is all paſt, and the enemies are all dead; but there is never more need of watching than at ſuch a time; for our enemies are ſtill alive and lie hid waiting to ſee us led down our watch. Therefore let us hold faſt what we have received, and ſee that we do not loſe the ground that thro' grace we have gained. We muſt pray without ceaſing, for all our ſtrength and help comes from CHRIST. We muſt watch and ſearch, and ſtudy and pray to know what our LORD would have us to do. Our happineſs greatly conſiſts in doing his will. It was the meat of our great Redeemer to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023767_0013_0FC1161CF096F700"/>
do his Father's will and to finiſh his work: And O how ſweetly do his children grow when they feed upon the ſame heavenly meat! If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them. If we long to glorify GOD let us bear much fruit. We muſt alſo watch againſt every motion of ſin: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the firſt vain thought that comes: Keep our hearts with all diligence: Take heed leſt our evil hearts depart from the LORD. And tho' our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are lively and ſtrong, too ſtrong for us, yet the weapons of earneſt prayer will prevail when nothing elſe will do, if we are but conſtant to fight againſt our ſpiritual enemies, through the ſtrength of CHRIST, we ſhall ſurely prevail againſt them. Reſiſt the devil and CHRIST will make him flee. I ſpeak by experience (and I think it agrees with the Scriptures.) Whenever I have been engaged in war againſt my ſins, tho' I had no ſtrength of my own, yet the LORD ſuffered not my enemies to triumph over me; but as ſoon as I grew careleſs and laid down my weapons, my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies prevailed and brought me into bondage; and there my wiſe LORD let me be, until I ſaw my folly and taſted the bitter fruit of unwatchfulneſs.</p>

               <p>My experience bears witneſs to the truth of theſe things, and I reſolve to try to be more watchful than I have been; but I know I can do nothing in my own ſtrength. I think I ſee the narrow way, and it looks exceeding bright and beautiful, and I long to walk therein. But there is nothing more baſe than I am. I ſee I am much defiled with ſin. O for deliverance from ſin! It is ſin is the cauſe of all my trouble. I would do good, but evil is preſent with me. I know that in me, that is in my fleſh dwells no good thing.
