            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>And indeed while we Congratulate Your Excellency's Arrival unto this part of Your Government, We do but Congratulate our own Felicity, in having the Helm of the Government, by His Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, put into the Hands of One, who is Adorned with so Charming an Image of His Own Royal Vertues.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty hath for ever obliged the Engliſh Nation, by His Royal Aſſent to thoſe Acts of Parliament, which have Enriched it with Bleſſings richly worth all the Expences of the Late Happy Revolution. But Your Lordſhips Moſt Generous, and Proſperous Conduct, in labouring to bring about thoſe Acts, hath laid <hi>England</hi> under the ſame Obligation to Your Lordſhip, that <hi>Ireland</hi> hath to Your Illuſtrious Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>From doing of Benefits to the beſt Iſland and Garden of the other Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, Your Excellency is now come to be a Benefactor, unto the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and Countries that have ſubdued an <hi>American</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to be a ſignificant part of the <hi>Engliſh Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty in His Royal Wiſdom diſcerned, That the rare Temper, which qualifies Your Excellency, for the moſt Honourable Undertakings, would beſt of all expreſs His own Gracious Intentions, to this part of His Dominions. And the Prudence and Goodneſs, with which Your Excellency hath managed the Affairs of <hi>New-York,</hi> is an actual Demonſtration of His Majeſties Wiſdom in the Choice of an Healer for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000872_0002_0FAC931D62D0FAA8"/>The Condition of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath been ſo conſider'd by His Majeſty, That He hath not only conſented unto their Laws, which have Eſtabliſhed their Church-Government, as 'tis now Reformed; but more than once or twice aſſured them of His Reſolution to maintain that Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them. This Greateſt of Monarchs that ever Sat on the Throne of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and beſt of Kings at this Day Swaying a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Earth, hath now given Your Excellency the Command over <hi>New-England</hi>; and a People that are a Nation of <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> which thoſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> juſtly look upon as their <hi>United Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Excellency expreſſing ſo much good will as You have done to the Late Act of Parliament, which hath made the Non-conformiſts in <hi>England,</hi> Legal Parts of the Church in <hi>England</hi>; well knew what Hearty Friends, the vaſt Body of <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> are to the <hi>Engliſh Liberties</hi>; and what Loyal Subjects to the High and Mighty Prince, unto whom (under God) We are all Indebted, for the Recovery of thoſe Liberties; and how much an Union between all Good Men, whether Conformiſts or Nonconformiſts, will contribute unto the Strength of the Proteſtant Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And we believe, That Your Excellency will on all occaſions expreſs the good-will of a Common Father unto the Churches of <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> (if where they bear the proportion of more than One Hundred unto One, it be proper to call them <hi>So</hi>) in <hi>New-England</hi>: Churches wherein the pure Doctrine in the famous <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> is Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Preached with all poſſible Purity; and the <hi>Primitive Diſcipline</hi> which even the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> wiſheth to ſee Reſtored, is practiſed.</p>
