            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Charge it self,</hi> which is given: <hi>Keep thy Heart,</hi> the word signifies, to <hi>Fortifie, Protect,</hi> and <hi>defend</hi>; to keep a thing with <hi>Locks,</hi> and <hi>Barrs,</hi> and a <hi>strong Guard,</hi> as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition</hi> or <hi>Treasure</hi> is kept, when an <hi>Enemy</hi> is expected to make an <hi>Assault</hi> upon it, see <hi>Nah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.1.</hi> A <hi>Noun</hi> from this <hi>Verb</hi> is translated a <hi>Watcher</hi> or <hi>Watch-man,</hi> Jer. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Danger,</hi> or else the work were <hi>Superfluous,</hi> and this danger is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Heart is exposed to <hi>Enemies</hi> which will seek the <hi>Life of it,</hi> who are alwaies <hi>watching</hi> to make a <hi>surprize</hi>: where no Enemy needs to be suspected, no <hi>garrison</hi> needs to be <hi>kept,</hi> to train up Souldiers in times of peace, were an <hi>Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Flourish,</hi> were it not that <hi>Warr</hi> may arise; The Spirit of God would not have us to be secure: or think our selves to be beyond the reach of <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> to do us harm, but to account that we dwell among <hi>Murderers,</hi> and in the midst of <hi>deadly Enemies,</hi> who seek, and would gladly rob us of the Life of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to lose the heart to those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wait for it, is a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>sore Loss</hi>; that it is not a piece of <hi>Lumber,</hi> which is little to be Cared for, but a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owel</hi> to be preserved with utmost Care. In times of danger, it is better to draw off from, and abandon such places as are of no Consequence, then to Expend fruitless and Excessive Charges for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000227_0005_0FA36B66B2C767A8"/>
of them; where the Charge out-bids the <hi>Rational Benefit,</hi> it is foolishly laid out, it's better left to the <hi>Enemy,</hi> but is not thus in regard of the heart, and therefore we are Commanded not to seek a <hi>safe Retreat</hi> from it, but <hi>stoutly</hi> to stand to it, and upon no Terms to forgoe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Duty,</hi> summarily Conteined in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Heart is to be kept for God,</hi> whose <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> it is to have the Rule over, and obedience of it: he challengeth it as his own, <hi>Prov. 23.26. my Son give me thy heart</hi>; he requires it as our duty of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as the performance and discharge of our <hi>Sacramentum mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> to look after it, neither are we to account any Service tedious, or hazards <hi>superstuous,</hi> that we undergo in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is to be kept from all those that would rob him of the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> over it, all that would usurp his Title, and Challenge to themselves <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Soul: <hi>we cannot serve two Masters,</hi> if we are for God, we must be for no other, there are many that bid much for this <hi>Rule,</hi> and would fain hold the Scepter, and have the Command of the heart; But, <hi>socium habet neminem,</hi> he must have the sole and whole ordering of it, according to his own <hi>good pleasure</hi> without <hi>Controul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.
