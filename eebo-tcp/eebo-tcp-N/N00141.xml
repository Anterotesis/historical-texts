            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe God of our Fathers hath done great things for this his people, in the sight of the Nations. We have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work God did in their dayes, how he did drive out the Heathen with his hand, and <hi>Planted</hi> them, how he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the people and cast them out: for they got not the Land in possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them, but his right Hand and his Arm, and the light of his Countenance, because he had a favour to them. Yea, the Lord hath given us his good Spirit to instruct us, and hath not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Manna from us, but hath turned this Wilderness into a <hi>Canaan,</hi> and here hath he given us <hi>Rest</hi> (the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome rested longer) fourty years and more: and all this while hath he been feeding and leading of us, by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; of <hi>Aaron.</hi> It would fill a Volume, to declare in how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Lord hath dealt with us, as he did with his people in the dayes of old. He that hath said, <hi>I will make the Wilderness a Pool of water, and the dry lands Springs of water, I will plant in the Wilderness a Cedar,</hi> hath in an eminent degree fulfilled that word before our eyes. And we may conclude, that the Lord intended some great thing, when he planted these Heavens, and laid the foundation of this Earth, and said unto <hi>New-England</hi> (as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Sion) Thou art my People</hi>: And what should that be, if not that so a <hi>Scripture-Pattern of Reformation,</hi> as to <hi>Civil,</hi> but especially in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> respects, might be here erected, as a <hi>First fruits</hi> of that which shall in due time be accomplished the whole world throughout, in that day when there shall be one Lord, and his Name one over all the earth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000197_0003_0FA315FBC73B7890"/>Upon all which accounts, our not answering Divine Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning us, hath the more of evil, and of dangerous consequence in it. <hi>Apostacy</hi> in any people is a great provocation to the eyes of Gods glory, but much more in a people whom he hath brought under such manifold Engagements to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as is to be affirmed of us, in these goings down of the Sun. It must be confessed to the praise of his glory, that the Lord is not yet wholly gone from us, and there are grounds of hope, that he will not leave us nor forsake us, at least-wise that as yet it shall not be: For there are some (though alas! now but few) of <hi>the first Generation</hi> still surviving, who went after the Lord into this Wilderness, when it was a Land not sown, whose kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness God doth remember; and it may be hoped, that there shall be Peace and Truth in their dayes. It must likewise be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that as for our <hi>Israel, the Leaders thereof,</hi> both in our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Ecclesiastical state, are in some measure faithful. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous evils when they break forth, are born witness against, and therefore the Lord will not impute them to the Land where they are committed. When did the Lord ever give up any people to utter destruction, but that first their Magistrates and Ministers were become corrupt? Therefore as yet our <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall not <hi>become heaps, and the Mountain of the Lords house as the high places of the forrest.</hi> Also the Lord who was still wont, as there were any <hi>beginnings of Apostacy</hi> in his people of old, to <hi>testifie against them by his Spirit in his Prophets,</hi> hath raised up those in this Land, unto whom he hath given grace, and a Spirit of faithfulness to do the like, (witness the ensuing <hi>Sermon</hi>) which is a token for good.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, there are on the other hand awful Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may cause us to fear vvhat the end vvill be; O that vve vvere vvise, that vve understood these things! We have been, and (through grace) to this day are, <hi>a people near unto the Lord</hi>; but in that respect, vve have the greater cause not to be secure. It is a very solemn Observation, vvhich I remember
<pb facs="unknown:000197_0004_0FA315FC87337D98"/>
               <hi>Commenius</hi> hath, speaking of those once-famous and glorious Churches in <hi>Bohemia, viz.</hi> That they were <hi>nearer to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> then other Churches, by reason of a more <hi>pure Discipline</hi> by them owned and professed; and therefore when <hi>Contentions</hi> and <hi>Apostacies</hi> prevailed amongst them, the Lord poured down his righteous Displeasures on them, and hath set them forth as sad Examples before other Churches. Let us lay it to heart. And it greatly concerns us so to do, for that there are sad evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our departures from the Lord in a woful degree, and awful symptomes of the Lords departure from us.

How many <hi>stands</hi> did the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi> make, e're it was quite removed, never more to return in the former lustre? Is it not so with this people? In what place can vve behold the glory of the <hi>first Temple?</hi> Do not the ancient men that have seen the <hi>first House,</hi> weep over this?

Our sins testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie against us, and as for our iniquities vve know them: And yet vvhen it cometh to particulars, vve shall finde those calling that <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Defection,</hi> vvhich the Lord Jesus (I doubt not) will own for Truth and laudable Constancy another day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently vvould have that put in practise for <hi>Reformation,</hi> which Christ vvill never own. <hi>Brownism, Libertinism, or undue straitning and confining the grace of that Covenant,</hi> vvhich God hath made vvith our Fathers, is far from being the <hi>Interest of N.E.</hi> and most of all from being the Interest of <hi>Massachusets Colony.</hi> Were our now glorified Fathers (<hi>Winthrope, Dudley, Cotton, Hooker,</hi> vvith the rest of those blessed Worthies, vvho vvere the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under God, of laying the Foundation both of our Civil and Ecclesiastical State) here amongst us, they would say so. Let their Manuscripts and printed Books, which they have left behind them to succeeding generations, come in for Witnesses; and witness the <hi>Platform of Discipline,</hi> agreed on by the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Messengers</hi> of all the Churches in this Colony, yea of all these <hi>United Colonies.</hi> Well did our blessed <hi>Mitchell</hi> also give in his Testimony, when speaking in the Name of the Lord, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like solemn Occasion as this Sermon was Preached on; <hi>Do not</hi> (said he) <hi>wrong and marre an excellent work and Profession, by mixing and weaving in spurious Principles and Practices, as those of</hi> Separation, Anabaptism, Morellian (Anarchical) <hi>Confusion, and licentious Toleration. If any would secretly twist in, and espouse such things as these, and make these part of our Interest, we must needs renounce it as none of our Cause, no part of the End and Design of the Lords faithful Servants, when they followed him into this land which was not sown. Separation and Anabaptism are wonted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders and seeming Friends, but secret fatal Enemies to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as</hi> Paul <hi>in a case not much unlike,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10â€” 15. <hi>In this
<pb facs="unknown:000197_0006_0FA315FE047ECD78"/>
work here on foot, there was a good Foundation laid,</hi> viz. <hi>Christ as the onely Law-giver in his Church, and Reformation designed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will, and Apostolical Pattern. If you should build the Hay and Stubble of such things as those, then verily (though sincere persons will be saved, and the main of the work may be saved and revived at last) yet sooner or later, there will come a fire that will burn up this Stubble, and then your poor Leaders, that would have led you the right way, may be remembred when it is too late. Do not under pretence of avoiding Corruption, run into sinfull Separation from any of the true Churches of God, (and what is good therein) or from the Children of the Covenant. Prize and hold fast the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to you and yours.</hi> Thus that blessed man. It doth then concern us to take heed, that we do not mistake as to that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> which is, and the <hi>Anastacy</hi> which ought to be amongst us. And surely it is a safe and undoubted Principle, which runs through that practical and profitable Discourse, to the which these lines are prefixed, <hi>viz.

The acceptance also which this Sermon when delivered found with all good men, though of different perswasions, is an evidence, that the Preacher was under a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial guidance and influence from the Spirit of Christ the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.

               </gap>tion of the Epistle; which are vulgar with Expositors. The way to our Text is easie and open: it lyes in that part of the Epistle which is <hi>Narrative.</hi> The words (as to Mode of expression) they are <hi>Monitory,</hi> and withall highly <hi>Imperative</hi> or Commanding. The duty commanded, it is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (according to direction given) unto a full and through Restitution from that Declension and Defection in Religion, which that Church was fallen into. In order hereunto, three things are proposed in the words, as parts of the work and duty commanded to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An awakening sight and sense of their declension and defection</hi>; (in these words) <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> The word <hi>Remember</hi> here, it imports an awakening, convincing Remembrance: it is often used in Scripture to express a conscience and conviction of sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61, 63. â€”<hi>from whence thou art fallen,</hi> or elapsed, slidden, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidden; plainly signifying, Backsliding and Apostacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A penitential Confession of, and humiliation under the sin of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nsion and defection</hi>; in this word, <hi>Repent.</hi> It signifies Repentance in the proper act of it, which is <hi>a sad and solemn recognition of, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon our past evil actions, with Confession and Humiliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reformation</hi>; in these words, <hi>Do the first works:</hi> which signifie <hi>Reformation</hi> in the proper act of it, positive, practical Reformation; â€” <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, repent, and do the first works.</hi> It is as if our Lord Jesus Christ should have said unto this Angel and Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Although thou hast been commendable (and I have commended thee) for thy strong and stedfast perseverance, by the great labour of thy Faith and Patience, in the sincere, pure, and powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospel, respecting both Doctrine and Worship, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Zeal against Heresie and Apostacy, Hereticks and Apostates, and that also with extraordinary Courage and Constancy, under many great Temptations, and much and great Tribulation: and although thou hast been extraordinarily beautified and blessed with my Presence, in the exercise of my Kingly and Prophetical Office; though thou hast been Eminent, yea Excellent among the Churches; and although thou dost yet hold up thy Profession in the external Form of it, and dost there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore still deserve some Commendation: Yet know, O <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that thou art fallen; thou hast left thy first love, thou hast lost thy first life, thou hast deserted thy first works; thou art not what thou hast bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thou art fallen into a state, frame, and way of backsliding and Apostacy. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and labour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy self speedily from thy declension and defection, and to retrive thy pristine and primitive Profession and practise of Religion, unto its former internal and spiritual Life and Power, from which it is chiefly that thou art fallen, or else I will withdraw my gracious Presence from thee, and come unto thee quickly in my wrath, and devest thee of all thy Priviledges, Church-Order, Ordinances and Administrations, of the Dignity and Beauty, yea of the very Being of a Church, by the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Candlestick: <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen,</hi> &amp;c. The words thus plainly opening themselves unto us, afford us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is the present, and most important Duty and Concernment of any Collapsing or Back-sliding Church or Churches, to labour (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Awakening, Convincing sight and sense (or under an Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conviction) of their Declension and Defection) unto a full and through Restitution from it, by Repentance and Reformation.</q>
            <p>The Text it self is so good a Doctrine, it doth seem needless to invert the terms of it. It is enough to say, That it is the work and duty of any Church or Churches, which are in the like declining and decaying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was in, to Remember from whence they are fallen, to repent, and to do their first works. It is the present, instant, and most important duty, it is indeed all the work and duty which our Lord Jesus Christ doth commend and propound unto, and press upon this Church in this whole Epistle, and so unto and upon all other Churches in the like state: and he doth propose it plainly and fully in all the parts of it, that they might have a full and distinct understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and direction unto it; that they might be through and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in the pursuance and performance of it. He proposeth it also as a most important duty and concernment, as that upon which depended their very Being and Standing as a Candlestick amongst the Candlesticks, as a Church among the Churches. He proposeth it as a work and duty which they had yet great advantage and encouragement to labour in, under the powerful exercise of his Kingly and Prophetical Office; and therefore he represents himself unto this declining Church (for their encouragement) as <hi>walking amidst the golden Candlesticks,</hi> and <hi>holding the Stars in his right hand</hi>; that is, in his full and whole Sufficiency to uphold his Church, in its Constitution, and in the pure and powerful Administration both of Doctrine and Worship; and by a powerful and effectual dispensation of his Spirit and Grace, to restore and recover
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000197_0011_0FA31601C6D4C398"/>
them from their present declension and defection. He also proposeth it as a work and duty requiring present, instant dispatch, which must be quickly done: and he presseth it, upon penalty of Unchurching Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so upon peril of gross, open, total, and final Apostacy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the removal of the Candlestick, and finally moving of them hereunto, by a great and most gracious Promise of perseverance in case of obedience, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> Thus you see how full both the Text and the Context are of this Doctrine. And this is also the great work and duty, which God did propound and press by all his Prophets, upon the Church of old, in their <hi>declining and decaying state,</hi> which for many Ages together they were in. It was Gods great work by the Ministry of those great Prophets, whose Prophesies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, to convince them of their <hi>Back slidings and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,</hi> and to perswade them to return by <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> The general word of the Lord by those Prophets, it was <hi>Turn, O back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding children; Return, O backsliding Israelâ€” Repent, and turn ye; Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 14, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.11. <hi>Ezek</hi> 14.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.11. <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1. It was the great work of those Prophets, to bring back this people unto God: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Yet he sent Prophets to them, to bring them again to the Lord.</hi> It was the general cry of all the Prophets, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Turn ye now unto me, saith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets cried, Turn ye now</hi>â€” Observe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Repentance and Reformation it was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cry of the Prophets to that backsliding people: whence it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it was their great and main work and duty, to Repent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. I might further <hi>demonstrate,</hi> argue, and prove this Doctrine from the suitableness of this work and duty, unto a <hi>back-sliding</hi> people, (it is the proper work of such a people;) as also from the necessity of it, and from the good and benefit of it, and from all <hi>Topicks</hi> of Reasons and Arguments: but it being of undeniable, and therefore of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable verity, I shall take leave (for brevity's sake) to pretermit what might or ought to be spoken for the more full <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Explication</hi> thereof, and proceed unto <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein, I shall apply my self unto the Churches, and unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>New-England,</hi> so far (at least) as they may be spoken unto in one <hi>General Assembly</hi>; and I shall address my self unto You, as in the Name, so in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, by this threefold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000197_0012_0FA3160287098F38"/>
were directed to the Churches: Christ requires and calls for the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches.</hi> I am emboldened therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and press this general Exhortation, unto and upon the Churches, because the Text, the Doctrine, the Occasion and the Opportunity do lead me unto it; and because I have also thought, that God doth call me unto it, in the Improvement of such a Text, upon such an Occasion, in such an Assembly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> I. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> Let this be an Awakening Watch-word from our Lord Jesus Christ, unto these slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering Churches in this Midnight of deep Security, wherein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality both of Christians and Churches, are disposing, yea composing of themselves to sleep, by indulging themselves unto carnal rest and ease, shutting their eyes against all awakening discoveries, and stopping their ears against all awakening voices; yea, although it be the voice of their <hi>Beloved:</hi> as the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>I sleep, but my heart waketh, it is the voice of my Beloved that knockethâ€” I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</hi> Surely an Awakening Watch-word is then most necessary and seasonable; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more, then in sleepy and sleeping Times, when <hi>Judicial Security</hi> seemeth to be both one of the greatest <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> of the Times; when God in just Judgement is <hi>pouring out of a spirit of deep sleep, and closing the eyes of men,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.10. and <hi>giving a spirit of slumber, Rom.</hi> 11.8. No doubt but this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was deeply secure, under her deep declension: Spiritual declension doth incline both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Churches unto Security; whilst the wise Virgins lamps want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trimming, and the foolish Virgins lamps were gone out, <hi>they all slumbered and slept,</hi> Mat. 25.5. as Christians or Churches decline, so they grow secure, and fall asleep. The Church of old, both <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> were most prodigiously secure in the depth of their Apostacy: the Prophets did prophesie Peace, and the people did promise themselves peace, untill they had consummated both their Apostacy and Misery, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10, 16. Truly thus it is (too much) with us, the more sinful we grow, the more secure; the generality of the Generation growing more and more sensless, supine, stupid, sottish in their security. Hence, although we hear all kinde of Awakening Voices, and see many Awakening Sights; though the voice of God doth <hi>Cry</hi> by his Word, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.4. yea though it doth <hi>Roar</hi> by his Works, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. yet we are not awakened: Though there be a grievous and general Complaint and Cry of the great &amp; Crying sins of the Times, yea

God hath made it the work of divers of his faithful Servants, whom he hath of late sent and set to speak upon this Occasion in this general Assembly, to Awaken, and to Convince, to Plead with us in a way of Conviction, to <hi>Cry aloud, not to spare, to lift their voices like a Trumpet, to shew</hi> New-England <hi>their transgressions, and this people their sins,</hi> Isa. 58.2. and surely untill we are thus awakened and convinced, there will be no hope of <hi>Reformation.</hi>

of Religion in this next succeeding generation? If you live and die under your declensions, as truly many Christians are likely to do, being fallen into such deep security under their declensions, that they are not like to be awakened, untill the Cry be made at Midnight, <hi>The Bridegroom cometh,</hi> and must bestir themselves very hard to trim their Lamps, in time, to enter in with him. O Christians, <hi>It is your Spiritual Declension that is the main root of the degeneracy of this Noble Vine,</hi> Jer. 2.21. It is your leaving of your first love, which doth make way for the removal of the Candlestick; your Spiritual declension will lead the way unto, and lay the foundation for, the general and total defection of these Churches in succeeding generations: therefore, as the defection hath been in part begun by your declension; so the work of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it must be begun by your <hi>restitution.</hi> It is impossible that ever these Churches should be restored unto their first Spiritual prosperity, and flourishing state, unless Christians do first recover their first love, life, sincerity, fervency, purity, activity, eminency in the exercise of grace, and in the performance of duty, and in all practical piety, both in heart and life. O how can you hope to lye down in your Graves with peace and comfort, before you have done what in you lyeth in the Work of Reformation? How can you die in peace, under your Spiritual declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and thereby leave Religion decaying and dying, and these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and this Generation, your poor Posterity, sinking under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and total defection? Sure, in vain, and frustrate will be all your prayers, desires, hopes of a Reformation, except that you Christians do thus begin, and lay the foundation of the work in your own hearts before you die.</p>

any generation, whereby it is wholly turned into the degenerate plant of a strange Vine, unto the Lord. Here will be our deepest, and most dangerous defection, and that which will prove inevitably ruining unto these Churches, unless the Lord have mercy upon us. O our unbelief, and disobedience unto the Gospel, our rejection of Christ and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome! It is <hi>a most sad and lamentable sign,</hi> that these Churches, and Religion, are falling into an irreparable, irrecoverable decay, That there are so <hi>many of the generation growing up under the Ministry of the Word, and the improvement of all means of grace, in their Vnregeneracy,</hi> under the prevailing power of Spiriritual Apostacy and (as we have cause to fear) under a dreadful dispensation of divine Justice, by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Plagues and Judgements, being justly given up by God, unto a spirit, frame, and way of unprofitableness under a <hi>Judicial Ministry,</hi> sent <hi>to make their heart fat, lest they should be converted,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.10â€” O it is a fearful word, <hi>Lest they should see with their eyes,</hi> &amp;c.â€” <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and be healed.</hi> Observe, there is no help, no healing for any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of very sad Consideration unto us, that the work of <hi>Conversion</hi> doth fall, and is failing more and more, in many (if not) in most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: although we have cause, with thankfulness, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Presence and Power of the Spirit of God (so far) with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that there is yet some fruit of their labour appearing in the work of Conversion; but alas! not with proportion unto the great increase of the generation. O how rarely do we hear of a sound work of Conversion, held forth with full and clear demonstration of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of it! O how few such Converts are there, as do evidence their Conversion by a powerful, practical Profession of Religion? Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there are growing up in their Ignorance, Atheism, Unbelief, and Profaneness, who receive no impression at all by the Word of God; and many others who do receive some degrees of common grace, who yet fall away by Spiritual Apostacy, who prove either vain, profane Professors, or close Hypocrites, or gross Apostates. Truly, unless God in infinite Mercy revive and uphold the work of Conversion, there will be no hope, we shall perish under this our Spiritual Apostacy, which is begun: for if the work of Conversion fail, all the sins of the Times will be multiplied and aggravated; and unconverted sinners will be in just Judgement given up to God, unto the power of those sins, so that our sins will become our plagues, and those incurable. O that all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted sinners might be moved, to wait earnestly upon God in the improvement of all means for converting grace, and bemoan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

It was Gods design and work, not only to set up his Worship in <hi>New-England,</hi> but to set it up in the purity of it, by a <hi>purging, refining Reformation.</hi> God did therefore qualifie his Reformers with extraordinary Humility, Sincerity, and holy Zeal for purity of Worship; and made extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary discoveries of his Minde and Will, concerning his Worship, unto them: He did shew them the <hi>Pattern,</hi> the Platform (as I may say) of his House, that they might shew it unto us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11. O how much then are we engaged to preserve purity of Worship?

It makes the Church to appear in her Spiritual Beauty, in her ornaments, as a Spiritual Bride adorned and trimmed for her heavenly Bridegroom. That purity of Worship, which shall be after the destruction of Antichrist, will be the chief perfection, if not the consummation of the Gospel Dispensation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.11. Then let us be moved to prize and preserve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Worship. And to this end, we must subject our selves, our very Souls, freely, fully, &amp; most sincerely, unto the Power, Authority, Rule and Government of Christ, as it is Regularly, Ministerially exercised and administred in his Church, in the Administration of all his Ordinances. Exalt Christ in the Exercise of his Kingly office in his Church: whilst Christ is walking amidst the Churches, holding the Stars in his right hand, they will remain golden Candlesticks.

It is our Spiritual and Heart-Apostacy, from internal, spiritual power and purity of Worship, that is the deep and most dangerous defection of these Churches in Worship. And although we do yet retain purity of Worship in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Form of it, yet if we do not speedily recover that which we have lost, of the internal, spiritual power and purity of Worship, but persist in our spiritual Apostacy from it, whatever our pretended, professed zeal for visible and external purity of Worship may be, we shall let go, &amp; lose all, pull down all, and bury our selves in our own ruines: <hi>New-England</hi> will be no more unto God, then any other people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moabâ€” for all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More especially, God expecteth that you should promote the Work of Reformation, in your several Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, by the regular and thorough exercise of the Power of Christ (committed unto you) in the Administration of Doctrine and Worship, which is the great Trust and Charge committed unto you to keep, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 20.

O that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline might be restored, unto the full and effectual exercise of it, in the Spirit and Power of it, unto all the saving Ends of it, in these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches! it would work a great Reformation. And O that this poor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which is committed Chiefly to the Charge of this Ministry, may be generally cared for in all the Churches. They are the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you are called to labour with and for, amongst whom you hope to have the fruit of your Labours in the Work of the Ministry, and whom you are to stand in Judgement with, and to give an account of, in the day of Account. O what Account will be given of them, if many, or the generality of them, should perish, under the neglect of the due exercise of the Ministerial Power of Christ towards them, in any of the Churches? Most of all the Work of Reformation, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the faithful and successful Labours of this Ministry, in the work of Conversion; the travail of your Souls in that work, your travailing wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yes, Endeavours, and Labour therein, and thereunto, will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vain and void. If God make this Ministry a <hi>Converting Ministry</hi>; the Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> will be again revived; but if God suffer it to be a <hi>Judicial Ministry,</hi> a Ministry sent in Judgement, <hi>to make the heart of this people fat</hi>â€” then there will be no hope, the Generation will grow sick at heart, under <hi>Spiritual Plagues and Judgements,</hi> under <hi>a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death,</hi> by this Ministry, and so die in their sins. <hi>A Judicial Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry hath alwayes been the fatall Cause of the finall Ruine of such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. And therefore, how are all such, who have the Charge of Souls in such a dangerous time, amongst a declining people, concerned to Labour, to Pray, to Preach, to be instant in season, out of season, in private, in publick, to spend their Souls, to bend the strength of their Ministerial Labours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Conversion of Souls? How did the Prophets of old labour, in like case, with a declining people, and dolefully lament the loss of their labour; so <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa 49.4. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 6.10. yea, our Lord Jesus Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jerusalem, â€” how often would I have gathered thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>â€” Truly, it is a most doleful discouragement to the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, in many Congregations, to see so many Souls fatting, hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, immortal Souls dying and perishing under their hand, Care and Charge; but yet they must labour, and Agonize in Prayer unto God, for a dispensation of Converting grace by their Ministry, that the Work of Conversion, and so the Work of Reformation, may be revived: for
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000197_0042_0FA31619057A8AC8"/>
if not, it is much to be feared, that <hi>the Sun</hi> will quickly <hi>go down over the Prophets:</hi> I allude unto <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.6.â€” I mean, that our day of grace will expire, and <hi>the Sun set upon these Churches,</hi> by the departure of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and so <hi>our house be left unto us desolate,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.38, 39. The Prosperity of these Churches, dependeth much upon the success of the Labours of this present Ministry: and therefore, the hopes, desires, and prayers of all the faithful people of God in these Churches are, That you may alwayes remain as <hi>Stars in the right hand of Jesus Christ,</hi> fixed in your Orb, full of Light, Regular in all your Motions, Powerfull in all your Influences, shining in all your Appearances, with the Splendor and Lustre of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in whose hand you are: And that there may be no such <hi>Wandering Stars,</hi> spoken of <hi>Jude</hi> v. 13. whose Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratick Motions should disturb the Coelestial Order and Harmony of our Ecclesiastical Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I propose this Exhortation also unto <hi>All the People of the Land,</hi> who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every one, that hath a Soul to save, or hath any care of his Salvation, is concerned in this Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of what degree, rank or order whatsoever; every one must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in his own person, in his proper place, by the utmost improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power, interest and influence, to help forward the work; every one must set his hand and heart unto the Work of Reformation, in Families, Towns, Churches, throughout the Country. The Work of Reformation, it must run through all our hearts and wayes, in every Station and Relation, in every Calling and Imployment, through all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both Civil and Religious, in all our converse with God and man.

So also do all Factious, Seditious, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons, who make it their design and work to foment Divisions, and to uphold dividing Parties and Interests, unto the shaking of very Foundations. So also do all corrupt Worshippers, and corrupters of the Worship of God. In a word, so do all Carnal, Formal, Hypocritical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors. And so do all the Capital leading sinners of the Times, and of the Generation. These are all publick Enemies unto these Churchesâ€” more dangerous and destructive Enemies unto this great Work of the Lord, then <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and the rest of old, were unto the Building of the City or the Temple. <hi>Wo to those by whom Offences come,</hi> who are Leaders in our great and general Defection, and hinderers of the Work of <hi>Reformation. As for such who turn aside unto their crooked wayes, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel,</hi> Psal. 125.5.</p>

You have also seen and observed, the gradual declension and defection of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and therefore you cannot chuse but be most sadly and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sensible of our present necessity of <hi>Reformation.</hi> O then be moved to do what in you lyeth, by your Faith, Prayer, Life and Example, to revive the Work of Reformation again before you die. You also who are the present <hi>standing Generation,</hi> the next and immediate Successors unto those <hi>first Reformers,</hi> who have been actually betrusted with Church-Order, Ordinances, and Administrations, with the whole Cause of God, Kingdome of Christ, and Interest of Religion, and so with this great and glorious Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and who are likely to be found

And truly, if we should desert, or be slight and negligent therein, it will soon fall to the ground, and sink past recovery; and we shall thereby, at once, cut off the hope of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and lay the Foundation of the Ruine of <hi>Succeeding Generations,</hi> utterly <hi>undo</hi> all Posterity. O let us therefore make it our Prayer, which is in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.57, 58. <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers; let him not leave us, nor forsake us, that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. And you who are of the Rising Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Adult Youth, and Young men, You are many of you, if not most of you a <hi>Third Generation,</hi> from those whom God first brought out into this Wilderness; You are they who are likely to out-live <hi>Joshua, and all the Elders of Israel that out-lived Joshuaâ€” and all that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it is said of them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9.

And alas! upon you is likely to fall all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and Misery of this Apostacy which is begun, you will see and feel the sad and lamentable Effects of it. O therefore that Youth and Young persons, could lay this Consideration unto their hearts; and be moved also, to engage in this Work of Reformation, before it be too late, by labouring unto a sound Conversion, and a religious Conversation, in the dayes of their Youth.
