            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>NARRATIVE,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON the 29th of March I was prevented from going on with my Character for the Evening, by a Part of the Audience calling for Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> formerly an Actreſs in the Company, but who, for Reaſons which will hereafter appear, was no longer under any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> contrary to the Regulations of the Theatre, and to an expreſs Article ſigned by Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> came through the private Door into the Theatre, and, on the Stage, where ſhe was ſupported by Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> a Performer and principal Proprietor of the Theatre, who addreſſed the Audience, and obtained Permiſſion for her to read a Paper intended for their hearing; the Purport of which was, a Complaint of having been <hi>driven</hi> unjuſtly from the Stage, after having been ten Years on it, without any <hi>ſufficient</hi> Cauſe; intimating all this had been effected by my Agency. In the Confuſion which followed, I was not allowed to juſtify myſelf. After ſome Time, I ſubmitted, engaging to exculpate myſelf by a Publication in the Papers, or elſewhere.</p>
            <p>THE Proceedings of this Evening, in Connection with what had paſſed in the Courſe of the Winter, left no Room to doubt of Concert between ſome of the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators and Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Hallam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the 31ſt, a ſtill larger Party attended the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation at the Theatre, with an apparent Determination to prejudge and condem me. Marks of this Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were ſo renew'd and repeated, that I thought it no longer poſſible for me to continue on the Stage. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for me to fulfil my Engagement with the Public: For this Purpoſe I ſhall exhibit a brief Narrative of my whole Connection with the American Theatres. The
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032263_0003_0FF1AEF378F03BA0"/>
Reſult will ſhew, that ſo far from having conducted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly towards Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> and the Public, in Regard to her, that ſhe has been the Source of the principal Troubles which have ariſen: that my Conduct in this Reſpect, at leaſt, has been becoming my Situation, and that it is I, and not ſhe or Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> who have been injured on the preſent Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I was engaged from one of the firſt Theatres in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by the late Mr. <hi>John Henry,</hi> as a principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former for the New-York and Philadelphia Theatres, and arrived in this Country September 5th, 1792. An Idea inſtilled into me, that every Article of Life was full as cheap again here as there, made me accept a more moderate Salary than I ſhould have done, had I been rightly informed. I was to remain for two Years and ſix Months, at three Guineas and a Half weekly; to be ſecured to me for ten Months in the Year. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract I fulfilled on my Part, though violated in ſeveral Inſtances by the Managers, <hi>Hallam</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and eleven Weeks of Salary due at this Hour to me and my Family from them, on my original Agreements.</p>
            <p>I found the Theatre under Regulations widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from my Expectations; the Managers and their Families did not know each other out of the Profeſſion; and when they met in it, their whole Study ſeemed to be the ſowing Diſſentions and creating different Intereſts —a Syſtem of Government avowed and recommended by Mr. <hi>Hallam.</hi> The Conſequence of this was <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Party,</hi> and <hi>Strife.</hi> I ſoon was given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this had <hi>always</hi> been the Caſe. Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Conduct and Behaviour ſeemed ſo different from the Gentleman, I had converſed with in England, that I could not avoid forming Prejudices againſt him, and in favour of <hi>Hallam.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> ſaw, and took an Opportunity of telling me I misjudg'd him; and that Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> though appearing perfectly mild and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſecretly gave him every Diſquiet and Miſery, and had utterly broke his Temper. The Want of Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

               </gap> to a total Subverſion of all Order: Pieces were given out, and no Manager attended to point a ſingle Direction. The Orcheſtra was compoſed of about ſix Muſicians, ſome of whom were incapable of their Buſineſs, and had I not been induced by Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for my own Reputation as an Actor, to take Care that the Stage Department was not totally deſtroyed where I was concern'd, this neglect would have been more apparent than it was! Notwithſtanding my Exertions, the Theatre was nearly deſerted. Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> ſaid he could not exiſt under ſuch Torment longer, and offered to ſell his Share of the Property. I urged Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> to negotiate for it, and offered to become a Purchaſer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from him, and that I would undertake the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Theatre. The Terms of Sale were left for Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> to arrange with a Friend of Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s; and at this Period I ſaw a Letter of his, requeſting a ſpeedy End to the Buſineſs; for that, ſooner than be concerned any longer where Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> was, he would tranſport himſelf to Botany Bay. I deemed this the Effect of violent Anger or Prejudice, and ſuffered it to make no Impreſſion on my Mind at the Time.</p>
            <p>IN the Month of May, 1794, Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> ſold to Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> all his Share of the theatrical Property within the United States of America, for £ 4000, payable by four annual Inſtalments of £ 1000 each.</p>
            <p>IN the ſame Month, I purchaſed from <hi>Lewis Hallam</hi> one Half the Property of the Old American Company within the United States, for £ 4000, payable by four annual Inſtalments of £ 1000 each.</p>
            <p>DURING the Summer, I endeavoured to make ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the Company as were neceſſary; and on the 22d of September commenced my unfortunate Career as a Manager and Proprietor in the City of Philadelphia. On the 20th October, Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> performed Lady Rackett, in too degraded a State to be ſeen; and on obſerving that ſome of the Ladies of the Theatre noticed her Situation, gave them ill Language, and finiſhed with this Expreſſion —"Wretches that I ſupport by my Labours!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032263_0005_0FF1AEF6D374C620"/>ON the 27th of October, in a violent Fit of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> was quarreling with Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> a Member of the Company; and as the Performance of "Wild Oats," was then proceeding, I mildly interfered, and begged her for the Preſent to treat whatever the Matter was as not worth her Notice. She immediately commenced a ſtrain of Invective and Abuſe, ſuch as I had never heard, or ever did expect to hear, from the Mouth of a Female <hi>Raſcal! Scoundrel! Swindler</hi> of her Huſband's Property! and other Epithets equally unjuſt, for two Hours was I baited with; and during the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the After-piece, "Don Juan," every Mock and Ridicule that could be was caſt on my Endeavours to conduct ſo troubleſome a Pantomime to its Cloſe. Some of the Performers then with us, ſtill remain.</p>
            <p>ON the Morning of the 28th, I wrote Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> a Letter to the following Effect: "That having taken twelve Hours to pauſe on the unmerited Treatment I had received, I muſt beg to decline any further official Capacity in the Old American Company: obſerving, that the Property had been ſo little a Time in my Hands; Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> could receive no Inconveniency by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it back on the ſame Terms I had purchaſed; that I had no Wiſh to diſtreſs him by an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, but would ſtay with him upon the Fulfilment of my original Engagements to the Expiration of them, or the concluſion of the following York Seaſon." To this Letter Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> wrote the following:

I was at the Theatre, and could not attend Mrs. <hi>Hallam.</hi> She ſent my Servant back to ſay ſhe muſt ſee me, and that if I would not wait on her then, ſhe would remain till I ſhould come Home. I determined on ſeeing her: She began with Tears, a very ſtrong Apology for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and ſaid ſhe was utterly ruined with Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> if I perſiſted in reſigning the Property. I aſked her if ſhe remembered the Events of the preceding Evening? She replied, ſhe had no Recollection of them, and that my Letter to her Huſband was a Thunderbolt to her. I repeated the Epithets ſhe had made uſe of, and ſhe <hi>ſeemed</hi> very much ſhock'd. She begged my forgetfulneſs of the paſt, ſolemnly aſſerting ſhe ſhould look upon herſelf as the verieſt Wretch exiſting, ſhould ſhe ever, by ſimilar Imprudence, riſk a future Miſunderſtanding. I forgave her ſincerely, and we parted. I dined the ſame Day at a Tavern, with Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> according to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſeemed, and I believe was moſt ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I recollect made uſe of the following Expreſſion:
<q>I know that Girl ſo well, I'm ſure ſhe never will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give herſelf, or drink any Thing but Water as long as ſhe lives.</q>
I told Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> it was a Failing that, if not put an effectual Stop to, would deſtroy every Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of my Continuance in the Company, or Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I proceeded, as uſual, in my Capacity of Acting-Manager, and on the 14th of November ſhe was again intemperate and abuſive when performing Lady Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, in the Comedy of "Love's Frailties." My Wife alſo now began to feel the Effects of her Pride, and was frequently treated with every Contempt. I cloſed that Theatre on the 4th of December, after ten Weeks of woeful managerial Experience.</p>
            <p>I commenced in New-York, December 15th, and on the 20th Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> was again in a State which incapacitated her for performing Miſs Walſingham, in the "School for Wives," in a ſuitable Manner. On the 29th ſhe was conſiderably worſe in the Character of Marianne, in the "Dramatiſt." On the 5th of January,

1795, we performed "Percy," and in the Fight with Douglas, I, by Accident, cut Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Hand: Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> came behind the Scenes in a violent Rage, and on being aſked what had diſturbed her, replied, "Why! that damn'd Butcher has cut Mr. <hi>Hallam!</hi>" On the 6th of January, I wrote Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> the following Letter:

                     <p>ON ſo diſagreeable a Buſineſs, as it is my Duty to come to a perfect Explanation with you, I was in hope I might gain an Opportunity of perſonal Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance: But no—you ſeem to ſhun me! I had adopted a certainty that after the very unmerited and illiberal Language heaped on my by Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> in Philadelphia, and her ſolemn Oath, I never ſhould hear a Repetition, it would have ceaſed. Why, Sir, am I ſo frequently the Cauſe of her preſent Vengeance? And why do you not take Meaſures to prevent ſuch Conduct? Is it becauſe every Moment of my Life is dedicated to promoting our mutual Intereſt? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am inceſſantly ſtudying to make the Theatre reſpectable, and increaſe your Welfare and Proſperity? Why, Sir, laſt Night, for an Accident of trivial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had I the very delicate Term of <hi>Butcher</hi> applied to me? And why, a few Evenings back again, that of <hi>Swindler</hi> and <hi>Raſcal?</hi> Good God, Sir, if either have a Claim on the other for Gratitude, I think it is due from you, and that your Property by this Time, had I not ſtepped in and prop'd it, would have fallen to the Ground. It becomes no Plea to aſſert that <hi>Reaſon</hi> has no Share in theſe Declarations: They are private Sentiments, which Reaſon ſmoothers, and that baniſh'd, the Soul is thrown open undiſguiſed. I feel your Situation, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>: I am cut to the Heart to ſee it, but I cannot, will not, remain indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to my own. My Wife, Sir, is not permitted nor does ſhe endeavour or wiſh to know more of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032263_0008_0FF1AEFE1933D010"/>
than I caſually communicate; and as I cannot compliment Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> with a better Head than my own, I dont think ſhe can fairly judge my Actions, and I am certain you <hi>ought</hi> not to permit her; at any Rate I <hi>will</hi> not; and I think it but honeſt to inform you, the next Time I hear <hi>her</hi> make Uſe of my Name undeſervedly, I will immediately throw up the Buſineſs, and call the Public as an Umpire between us. Let Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> vent illiberal Language on her Dependants, if ſhe muſt uſe it; I am <hi>none:</hi> And as to the Property which ſhe is weak enough to imagine ſo infallible, I would rather give it up than have another Hour's concern where ſhe is or will be a Meddler.— Sir, we are a City Talk; and it would certainly be better to endeavour that Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> ſhould be kept at Home, than ſuffered to expoſe us and herſelf, when ſo unfit to be ſeen. I know, Sir, I am ſpeaking in plain Terms; I think it my Duty to do ſo. Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when we throw apart ourſelves, we cannot expect others to preſerve for us: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Once more, Sir, be aſſured, my Friendſhip and good Wiſhes are undiminiſhed; ſo much ſo, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it an indiſpenſable Duty to uſe no Reſerve; but, pointing out the Obſtacles that deſtroy our Harmony, give an Opportunity of removing them, or breaking the Whole at once.</p>

On the 10th of January, Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> (again in a State of partial Intoxication) performed Lady Euſton, in "I'll tell you What." On the 28th equally ſo in the Marchioneſs Merida, "Child of Nature." On the 25th February, I brought forward the Comedy of the "<hi>Jew,</hi>" for the firſt Time in this Theatre; and in the elegant chaſte Character of Eliza Ratcliffe, the Audience witneſſed an Exhibition too diſguſtful to remember, and too diſgraceful to the Stage to be dwelt upon. The general Cry ſeemed to be—"She muſt inſult us no more!" I informed Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> of this, in Company with a Gentleman who has been long his Friend, and both our Opinions were, that if Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> riſked ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Appearance, the People would ſhew their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> determined on withdrawing her, and begged from me the diſagreeable Office of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her the Reſolution. I undertook this, and a Scene ſo diſtreſſing, ſo harraſſing to the Feelings, I ſcarce ever did witneſs, and hope never may again. She was from before the Public one Month, and the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre progreſſed with every poſſible Harmony and Credit. During this Time, a Report was induſtriouſly circulated that Laudanum was the Cauſe of Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s frequent Incapability. The Public Voice turned, and there was a Wiſh to ſee her again. Convinced, <hi>whatever was the Cauſe,</hi> it would be her Study in future to avoid that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Thing, which brought her Weakneſs before the Public Eye, I took Advantage of this Prepoſſeſſion, and told Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> I was certain, if ſhe appeared, ſhe would be greatly received. I did this becauſe I felt Conviction her late Mortification muſt have been a ſtrong Monitor, and poſſibly a Reformation muſt enſue, both in Conduct behind the Scenes and on the Stage. On the 25th of March ſhe reaſſumed her Profeſſion in Lady Teazle. The ſecond Character ſhe repreſented was Cordelia, March 30th, in which ſhe was not perfectly herſelf. On
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032263_0010_0FF1AF0469920760"/>
the 10th of April ſhe performed Louiſa, in the "World in a Village," and ſeveral People in Diſguſt left the Theatre. On the 11th of May ſhe performed Miſs Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, in "Know your own Mind," a Comedy got up by me, about a Fortnight before, for Mrs. <hi>Hodgkinſon</hi>'s Benefit. My Wife dreſſed in the ſame Room, and a little Time after Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Arrival, ſhe commenced her abuſe of me, and of the Character ſhe was going to repreſent; and, looking in my Wife's Face, cried, "Damn the Play; damn the Perſon who got it up, and damn the Perſon for whom it <hi>was</hi> got up." The next Day I requeſted Mrs. <hi>Hodgkinſon</hi> to quit that Room. I then wrote to Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> the following Letter:

                     <p>I have delayed, till Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Benefit was paſt, communicating my Determination on our future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. After the moſt minute Inveſtigation on the Poſſibility of Friendſhip or Harmony exiſting, I find none. There are Obſtacles inſurmountable. I have combated them in Hope; I have borne them from ſincere Attachment. When I became a Partner in this Theatre, it was not with the Hope of bettering my Situation: It was to make it permanent; it was to ſupport, as far as I could, <hi>you</hi>; becauſe I conceived you injured and oppreſſed by your former Connection. My Opinion now is, that whatever might have been Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s other Failings, he ſaw you your own Enemy, and was convinced an unworthy Influence made you other People's. I will not dwell on what, with me, is fix'd as Fate: We muſt ſeparate. I am anxious to regain that Peace which as a private Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual no Man poſſeſſed in a higher Degree. I wiſh to reſign the Management. If you will not take the Property on the Valuation of three unprejudiced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I will certainly advertiſe my Share to the higheſt Bidder.

            <p>ON Monday, May 18th, the Comedy of "Which is the Man?" was performed; and the Hair-Dreſſer who attended Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> came to my Room to ſay that it was impoſſible for her to go on the Stage that Night, for ſhe was ſo ſenſeleſs ſhe could not ſit in her Chair! It was a Benefit, and therefore the Audience could not well be diſmiſſed. When the Hour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing arrived, I was requeſted, three ſeveral Times, to delay the Performance, while ſhe had Vinegar and ſtrong Green Tea given, to reſtore her as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When ſhe did come forward, let thoſe who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the Spectacle declare the Shame of it.</p>
            <p>I had ſoon after a Meeting with Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> at the Houſe of one of the moſt reſpectable Characters in this City; and two other Gentlemen, as mutual Friends, attended to give their Advice. I ſtated my Grievances plainly before them, and they uniformly agreed it was impoſſible for me to remain any longer in the Theatre if Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> did; and one of them obſerved,—
<q>Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> I have heretofore been anxious to ſuppreſs and do away Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Misfortune, as a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but, Sir, I was preſent at the Repreſentation of <hi>Which is the Man?</hi> and when I ſaw her come on the Stage, I immediately left the Houſe; and had any one plunged a Sword through my Heart, it could not have given me a keener Pang than I felt at that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> ſaid he had no Reply to make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could not deny any Thing I had aſſerted, and that he knew my Situation to be dreadful! I offered him, once
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032263_0012_0FF1AF0D2B2C4EA0"/>
more, the Property on the ſame Terms that I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it. This he declined, and promiſed, before the Gentlemen who had intereſted themſelves, to withdraw Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> from the Stage totally at the Concluſion of the Seaſon; commiſſioning me, at the ſame Time, to procure an Actreſs in her Place from England. I wrote, by the earlieſt Veſſel, for Mrs. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and ſhe arrived here on the firſt of October following. The Calamity that afflicted this City in the Autumn of 1795 compelled us to make a Treaty for the Boſton Theatre; and I was not a little ſurpriſed, while in Hartford, to hear that Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> had returned to the Stage, and was performing at Providence, with Mr. <hi>Hallam.</hi> Some few Days after our arrival in Boſton, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> waited on me, to ſay, that he ſhould make his firſt Eſſay before that Audience in Lord Ogleby, and that Mrs. <hi>Hallam muſt</hi> perform the Character of Miſs Sterling! I made no Reply; I was too much aſtoniſhed! I parted with him to reflect on what had paſſed. I made Enquiries of the Performers reſpecting Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Conduct at Providence. They were all agreed it had, if poſſible, been worſe than ever. I felt ſhock'd at Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Duplicity: a manifeſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Word, without even an Attempt at Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; without any Reaſon but "it muſt be ſo!" Entire Strangers, as we were, a Miſunderſtanding, immediately on our Appearance before the Public, would have been Ruin. I ſubmitted in Silence. In the mean Time I ſtood highly implicated to Mrs. <hi>Johnſon</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had come three thouſand Miles to ſupply a Line of Characters Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Inſincerity would deprive her of. Mrs. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> however, with the greateſt Generoſity, in Part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me, by ſaying that Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> might retain all the Characters ſhe <hi>had</hi> performed: but that, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of new Pieces, ſhe ſhould expect her Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fulfilled, by being given the elegant Characters in Comedy. This I not only promiſed, but ſtood pledged to. My Situation as Manager now became more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than ever. Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> quarrelled with me becauſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032263_0013_0FF1AF0ECA980D28"/>
he did not perform many of the young, Firſt Rate Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which he ſaid he had ſupplied ſince his firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in America, and that he had not reſigned them, nor ever would. Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> poured on me every odious Epithet that Intemperance could ſuggeſt. An Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered of releaſing myſelf from this Miſery, by an Offer of Connection with the Boſton Theatre; but, after ſome Reflection, my Reſpect for the Patronage I had experienced from the Citizens of New-York determined me on not accepting it. Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> was taken ill, and I felt ſome Alarm, that as yet he had never conveyed my Share of the Property to me, though I had frequently ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to have it done, and had paid a Part of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Money. He recovered, and I again applied. He begged it might be poſtponed till our Arrival in New-York. I agreed reluctantly. When we <hi>did</hi> arrive in New-York, I repeated my Requeſt. I was not ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, till, finally, I ſent Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> Word I would not enter the Theatre till the Deeds were executed. I got legal Poſſeſſion laſt March, 22 Months after the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe had been made. I think it but Juſtice to declare, that I was <hi>informed</hi> this Conduct was not Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Will, but that Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> could not be prevailed on to ſign. I had frequently converſed with Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting my Situation, and the Torture I laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and as I knew him to be attached to the Theatre, in one of our Converſations, I offered to ſell him Half my Share, if he would undertake the Acting Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that I had more Labour than the Mind or Body could poſſibly ſuſtain. I had applied to Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> to know what he meant to allow me for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Fatigue, and he had peremptorily refuſed any Compenſation; which I thought hard, becauſe, on the firſt Commencement of Theatrical Buſineſs after our Partnerſhip, we had paid a Gentleman <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> for acting as Treaſurer and Book-keeper only ten Weeks. And here I hope it will not be deemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Digreſſion, if I mention what my Situation
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032263_0014_0FF1AF11FB543F68"/>
exactly was. I had to caſt and arrange the Buſineſs of every Play brought forward. I had the various Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Rivalſhips, and Ambitions of thirty or forty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to encounter and pleaſe. I kept all the Accounts; I made all Diſburſements, and was made, in all Money Tranſactions, ſolely reſponſible. My profeſſional La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were extreme, and I never finiſhed them for the Evening that I did not attend to take the State of each Night's Receipts. Nay, inſtead of enjoying my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Hour of ſocial Intercourſe with my Family, on my Arrival Home, I had a Check Account to take, and to make the regular Entries in my Books. I wrote and corrected every Play-Bill for the Printer. I planned and copied every Scene-Plot for the Carpenter. I attended every Rehearſal, to give Directions. I went through a varied and extenſive Line of Characters on the Stage. I found principally my own Wardrobe for them; and my Salary, for all this, was twenty Dollars per Week, paid only when we performed! Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> received the ſame, and had no Share in the Fatigue. His Anſwer to me, on Application to know what he would allow me, was, that "he would quit the Theatre the Moment any Man received a Shilling more than him." An idea exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly unjuſt; for at the Time of his Purchaſe from <hi>John Henry,</hi> the Shares were, Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> Four and a Half, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> Three and a Half; and when Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> agreed with me, he reſerved the Difference: for the whole Property being equally divided between us, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> gained a Sixteenth; as he paid Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> no more for Four and a Half Shares, than I did him (Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>) for Four Shares.</p>
            <p>To return to my Narrative: Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to treat with me, and finally was introduced, as Acting Manager, into the Theatre, with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> and to receive my Aſſiſtance. I flattered myſelf I was now ſome little Diſtance removed from my Diſquiets; but I was diſappointed. Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi>'s
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032263_0015_0FF1AF152E0FCF20"/>
Inexperience compell'd me ſtill to be the Director in the Stage Department, according to Agreement, and I never gave an Order in Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s hearing that ſhe did not pointedly ridicule and inſult me. My Wife never paſs'd her, that ſhe was not treated with every Mark of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and thoſe who may lack Information on this Part, or labor under a different Impreſſion, I here inform, that ſhe never made one Word of Reply. I now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> it was impoſſible for me to ſtay and perform my Agreements with him; and a very, very irkſome and diſagreeable Correſpondence took Place, between us in Conſequence: I offer'd to ſell him the remaining Share I held, or to put it into his Hands as a Truſt and Security, that he ſhould not be a Loſer by my Abſence: He accepted the latter, and I wrote to the Philadelphia Managers my Reſolution, and of my Wiſh to gain a Situation in their Theatre. They, I preſume, thought my Services of ſome Value for both arriv'd Poſt here, and convers'd perſonally with me on the Buſineſs. I aſked my Terms, and to their Honor let me thus publicly declare, I never did experience in any Negociation more Candor and Liberality; and had I left New-York, their Acquieſcence in my Demands muſt have prov'd to me and my Family infinitely more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than any Thing I ever did, or probably may hereafter attain. About this Time Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> waited on me, to ſay, that if I could not remain in the Company, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my firſt Contracts with him, he muſt relinquiſh his Purchaſe, tho' ſubjected to very great Loſs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience thereby: He alſo informed me, he had <hi>written Mr.</hi> Hallam, <hi>that Mrs.</hi> Hallam<hi>'s Continuance in the Theatre was an inſuperable Objection to his making any Arrangement with him.</hi> I replied, I <hi>could</hi> not—I <hi>would</hi> not ſtay; and that I preferr'd retiring peaceably, to waging open Controverſy with Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>; who, in my Opinion, from his long Services, had an unqueſtionable prior Right to his Situation:—that I felt the Injuries of Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> and his Family forcibly; but that I was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032263_0016_0FF1AF16CB80EA70"/>
better able to provide for, and bear the Evils of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than he was, and I would not retaliate. I relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd the Sale I had made to Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> and he quitted the Buſineſs. On the 17th of June laſt, I wrote Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> the following Letter:

<q>he knew the Cauſe of our Differences, but they ſhould ceaſe; for he would withdraw Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> from the Stage, which he preſumed would reconcile the Whole.</q>
I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mr. <hi>Ten Eyck,</hi> that it would not; that Mrs. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>'s being withdrawn was no Stipulation of mine; for as Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> had once before openly broke his Word with me on that Score, I had thought it needleſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a Difficulty, what if promis'd to be remov'd, would not be long maintained: That Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> I believed, had quitted the Theatre, upon finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032263_0018_0FF1AF1A18ED87E0"/>
to conduct it with Propriety, if Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> continued, and had written Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> a Letter to that Effect: That Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s laſt Difficulty with me was, his having laid Claim to many of the moſt principal and youthful Characters in the Drama, which I thought he had reſigned long ago, ſuch as Hamlet, Ranger, Zanga, Oreſtes, Benedick, Don John, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> and his informing Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> that I had injured him, by not giving him out for them; but that now he expected them to be brought forward; and that all that I wanted from Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> now, was an Anſwer reſpecting my Propoſal of our Property. Mr. <hi>Ten Eyck</hi> obſerved, he was no Way privileged to ſpeak on that, as he had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> the great Objection. I replied, ſhe was ſo; but remarked again, I had conceived no Uſe in mentioning an Impoſſibility. Mr. <hi>Ten Eyck</hi> requeſted Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> to accompany him to Mr. <hi>Hallam:</hi> They went together, and, ſome Time after, Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, with Information, that Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> was not only willing to take Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> from the Stage, but to leave the caſting of all Pieces to his (<hi>Dunlap</hi>'s) Judgment; and that he was willing to enter <hi>into Contracts,</hi> with <hi>any Penalty,</hi> for the Performance of what ſhould be agreed on, as the beſt Mode to ſecure our future Peace. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, wearied by my repeated Diſappointments, I wiſhed no further Connection with Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>; and that I conceived I had proceeded too far in my Philadelphia Engagement to honourably recede. Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with me in this, and remarked, that he had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Buſineſs, in Part, to purchaſe my Property; and that he muſt inevitably experience great Loſs by my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: That while he ſaw no Proſpect of my Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances being redreſſed, he was content to ſubmit; but, now that there was a Certainty of their being remedied, he muſt in Duty call on me to fulfil my Engagements wih him, or that he ſhould be compelled to ſeek for Reſtitution in ſome other Way. Finally, I broke off my Philadelphia Negociation, and concluded to remain
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032263_0019_0FF1AEECE3DF6150"/>
once more. Contracts were ordered to be drawn up; and I inquired of Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> if Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Name was to be inſerted? He replied, it would be more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to omit her Name, as they could be made equally forcible, without mentioning <hi>her.</hi> I applauded the Idea. The following are the Articles, which Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> had three Days in his Poſſeſſion, previous to ſigning; and they were made to extend to <hi>Two Years, at his own Requeſt</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:032263_0022_0FF1AF25EBA7C030"/>IN the Courſe of the preſent Winter, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> has appeared much diſſatisfied. It was many Times ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured that he intended to force his Wife on the Stage: But about the 9th or 10th of February, Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> had called on him, to let him know that Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> ought to be engaged: And on Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi>'s replying, that he thought "that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been ſettled in June laſt," had only anſwered by charging me with ſending him in an Account of Money due to me; and by aſſerting the Injuries done to his Wife; concluding with ſaying, that—<hi>he had prevented Diſturbances in the Theatre; but he would do ſo no longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT the 14th of February, Mr. <hi>Dunlap</hi> informed me that he had waited on Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> having requeſted a Gentleman to witneſs the Converſation; when Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> confirmed the above Determination; and, on being reminded of his Engagements, ſaid, "I did tell Mr. <hi>Ten Eyck</hi> that I would withdraw Mrs. <hi>Hallam,—but I did not ſay for how long</hi>:" That he told Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> that he ſhould conſider his Attempt to force Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> on the Stage as a Violation of the Articles; and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>he might</hi> THINK <hi>as he pleaſed:</hi> That he told Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> that if there was any Diſturbance in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, on Account of Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> after the Avowal that ſhe had waited upon a Number of Ladies, who had eſpouſed her Quarrel, he ſhould conſider him <hi>(Hallam)</hi> as the Cauſe; and was anſwered, <hi>he might</hi> THINK <hi>as he pleaſed:</hi> That on ſaying he <hi>(Dunlap)</hi> muſt take Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the Security of his Property, he was anſwered, <hi>he might</hi> DO <hi>as he pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FINDING that the Diſſatisfactions of Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; hearing that he intended to introduce his Wife on the Stage, during the Benefits; and convinced that the Diſſolution of the Company muſt be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to the great Injury of the Performers, as well as of the Proprietors; I determined, with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> and the Advice of Gentlemen whom I ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s Friends, to make him
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032263_0023_0FF1AF2856215438"/>
Propoſals that might prevent Violence, and terminate all Differences to his Satisfaction. Many Modes were premiſed by theſe Friends, and they can vouch I did not, I would not liſten to any, that had not for its End the <hi>future Comfort and Independence of Mr. Hallam.</hi>— With this View the following Letter was ſent to him:

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:032263_0025_0FF1AF31B50C7990"/>ON the Monday Evening following, Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> came into my Dreſſing-Room, and told me he did not chuſe to comply with thoſe Rules. I told him I was ſorry to hear it, and that I ſuppoſed he could not violate them, without violating alſo the Contracts that exiſted between us! He replied, he choſe to violate them, and that he had torn them down, and ſet us at Defiance.</p>
            <p>THE Wedneſday following, the Tranſaction took Place which I have briefly ſtated as the Motive for this Narrative, in which I truſt it will appear,—1ſt, That, by Articles entered into voluntarily by Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> the Purport of which was known to him, and to which he was explicitly adviſed by his Friends, Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> had no Right to come on the Stage, or Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> to demand it: —2d, That Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> had not been withdrawn by any Stipulation of mine, at the Time of the preſent Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but by Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi>'s own free Offer and apparent Conviction, that her Conduct had made it improper for her to remain before the Public, and impoſſible for a reſpectable Stage to be where ſhe was a Performer:— 3d, That Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> in favouring the Attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produce Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> on the Stage, and in attempting himſelf to introduce her; as well as by tearing down the Regulations of the Acting-Manager; has not only vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his Contracts, but treated the Public with Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and the other Proprietors with Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>IN Regard to the Proceedings of the 29th and 31ſt of March, I can only obſerve, the Prejudice and Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation that unhappily prevailed, have compelled me to the <hi>moſt painful and irkſome</hi> Mode of juſtifying myſelf— that of expoſing <hi>many</hi> Tranſactions, to public View, which none but the Parties concerned ever ought to have been made acquainted with, or intereſted in; and I truſt my prior Determinations of quitting my Situation, rather than make this Expoſure, will convince every Reader, the Differences ſtated would never have been known thro' me, had not every Means been tried to render my Conduct completely odious to the Parties who came

forward on this Occaſion, that <hi>Calumny</hi> could ſuggeſt. I have been made <hi>accountable</hi> for an Action I was not concerned in, or in my Power ſolely to remedy! as a ſecond Peruſal of our Contracts will <hi>convince.</hi> It has been alſo aſſerted, that Mr. <hi>Hallam</hi> only <hi>applied</hi> to have Mrs. <hi>Hallam</hi> perform at his Benefit: This is not a Fact.— Mr. HALLAM <hi>has never</hi> made <hi>any</hi> Application, but that to Mr. <hi>Dunlap,</hi> in which he ſtated Mrs. HALLAM <hi>ought to be engaged in the Company!</hi> His Son applied on his own account, but Mr. <hi>Hallam,</hi> ſen, was never mentioned.</p>
            <p>I beg Leave alſo further to remark, that the Situation I was placed in was ſo peculiarly trying, none but an Actor, or a Perſon who has made himſelf reſponſible for a <hi>well regulated Entertainment,</hi> can poſſibly feel or judge.</p>
            <p>I was received, for the firſt Time in my Life, with pointed diſapprobation, before I could even ſpeak. A Perſon who had no Connection with the Stage, whoſe own Faults had deſervedly baniſhed her from it—was called for—was ſecreted, ready to burſt forward—was protected—ſupported by her own Huſband, in direct Violation of his moſt ſolemn Contracts—was allowed to addreſs the Audience—and I not ſuffered to explain or to defend myſelf, when I was the Party, and the only Party injured! If, at ſuch a Criſis, I betrayed any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Marks of Impatience, I truſt they were ſuch as few Men could refrain from, under ſuch diſtreſſing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>THE Situation of a Theatrical Performer ſeems here to be peculiarly unfortunate: Strong Prejudices are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained againſt the Profeſſion, and againſt the Drama itſelf, by many. There are alſo thoſe who conſider Actors as Public Slaves, who are to have no Will of their own, but are bound to be the obedient and ſubmiſſive Victims of their Caprice; and ſo wide is the Prepoſſeſſion againſt the Calling, that <hi>many</hi> look upon an Actor as Something different from his fellow Men.</p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of theſe Prejudices, that is deemed <hi>Inſolence</hi> in an Actor, which would ſcarcely be called
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032263_0027_0FF1AF356EE83978"/>
Spirit in another Man; and thus a Profeſſion, which, to excel in, requires the Union of many Talents and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and in particular <hi>Feeling,</hi> the Profeſſor, on ſome Occaſions, is not allowed to <hi>feel at all.</hi> But this is certainly unjuſt: Reſentment ſhould always be meaſured by the Nature of the Injury, not the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. I felt myſelf aggrieved: I was not allowed to defend myſelf: Few Men are ſo much Maſters of their Temper, as to conduct with perfect Propriety in ſuch Circumſtances! I might fail in this; if I did, it muſt be aſcribed to the peculiar Irritation of the Moment; for I hope I ſcarce need add, I could never entertain an Idea, of treating with indecorum, that Public, from whom I have receiv'd the moſt conſtant and flattering Marks of Approbation—to whoſe Juſtice I now make my laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whoſe Candor will, I am convinced, acquit me after this hearing, and whoſe</p>
