            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Legiſlature of the UNITED STATES, by the act lately paſſed for an Uniform Syſtem of, Bankruptcy, having adopted the Principles of the Bankrupt Laws of England, the Author of this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, conceived that a ſet of Precedents adapted to the Practice, would be acceptable to the Gentlemen of the Profeſſion, and others who may be concerned in proſecuting Commiſſions under the ſaid Act.—The following are therefore offered to the Public, which have been ſelected chiefly from thoſe now in uſe in England; but where circumſtances vary he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to form others, which it is preſumed will anſwer the purpoſes or which they are deſigned.—The Engliſh forms of legal Proceedings, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered too redundant for the Practice of this Country, the Author has aimed at brevity, as much as appeared to him conſiſtent with neceſſary expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—A few Obſervations are interſperſed with a view to facilitate a regular mode of Practice, and it is expected the work will be found of ſome utility.</p>

            <p>BEFORE a Commiſſion is applied for, it will be proper to conſider whether the perſon againſt whom it is intended, is of ſuch a Buſineſs that a Commiſſion may be taken out againſt him, and that he has been guilty of an act of Bankruptcy, alſo that the perſon petitioning is, by himſelf or in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip a Creditor for 1000 Dollars, two 1500 Dollars, or more than two 2000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.—If a Creditor ſues out a Commiſſion and fails in either of theſe points, the Debtor will be entitled to recover ſuch damages as mentioned in the 2d Section of the Act.</p>
            <p>In order to obtain a Commiſſion of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the Creditor muſt firſt make an affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, or <hi>(being a Quaker)</hi> an affirmation, of his Debt before the Judge of the Diſtrict Court of the United States, for the Diſtrict where the Debtor reſides or uſually reſided at the time of committing the act of Bankruptcy, which affidavit may be in the following form.</p>
