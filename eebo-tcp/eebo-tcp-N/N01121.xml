            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>O wretched Man that I am: who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words are the doleful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of one of the moſt holy Men that ever lived: It is no leſs a Perſon than the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that Great and Excellent Servant of Chriſt, who is here bitterly bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In this his Self-lamentation Obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Matter</hi> of his Lamentation, or that which he complains of, Namely, <hi>The Body of Death in him:</hi> that's the <hi>Gravamen,</hi> the burden of his holy Soul. By the <hi>Body of Death</hi> is meant <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Corruption,</hi> which he ſometimes calls <hi>Sin, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin,</hi> a <hi>Law of Sin.</hi> — 'Tis called a <hi>Body,</hi> partly, becauſe it overſpreads the <hi>whole Body</hi> of Man. <hi>Original Sin</hi> eats into the <hi>Body,</hi> &amp; diffuſes
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001336_0003_0FB2885AB51A48B8"/>
it ſelf thro' every Member thereof, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them as inſtruments to act by. Partly, becauſe it conſiſts of many <hi>Members</hi> or Parts. A <hi>Body</hi> is made up of many <hi>Members</hi> united one to another. Thus <hi>Original Sin</hi> has a great many <hi>Members</hi> and Branches: 'tis a <hi>Maſs</hi> of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Collection of Luſts. The <hi>Members</hi> of this <hi>Body of Sin</hi> are far more numerous than the Members of our <hi>Humane Bodies:</hi> for there are <hi>many Luſts</hi> that have Poſſeſſion of, and act by, each ſingle <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> There is but <hi>One Tongue</hi> in the Body, yet the Sins of the <hi>Tongue</hi> are numberleſs.</p>
            <p>Tis called a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> Partly, becauſe it makes men <hi>Dead</hi> unto and in Spiritual Duties. As for Natural men it makes them altogether <hi>Dead</hi> unto Spiritural Duties; either they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them not at all, or they diſcharge them in a manner wholly <hi>Dead</hi> and Lifeleſs. As for the Regenerate, Indwelling Sin cauſes in them a great deal of Averſeneſs to and <hi>Deadneſs</hi> in Religious Duties; they do not diſcharge Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with that Life, Vigour and Activity which they ought to do; and this is from the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Influence of <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It is called a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> becauſe it tends to and iſſues in <hi>Death.</hi> Original Sin is a <hi>Deadly</hi> Principle. As for the Godly, it brings <hi>Temporal Death</hi> upon them: Becauſe they have <hi>Sin</hi> in them, they have the Seed of <hi>Death</hi> in them. As for the Unregenerate, this Indwelling
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001336_0004_0FB2885C9626AF50"/>
Sin does bring upon them <hi>Eternal Death:</hi> It ceaſes not till it has accompliſhed their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction. 'Tis this <hi>Body of Death</hi> whereof the Apoſtle complains, which is the firſt thing Obſervable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His complaint concerning it, <hi>O Wretched Man that I am:</hi> He cryes out and complains of himſelf as <hi>Wretched</hi> on the account of this Body of Death. <hi>Wretched,</hi> does not ſignify Curſed or Unhappy, but Weary and Tired: like a man that had fought till ſpent, and ready to ſink, unleſs ſome One come in to his help and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His earneſt Deſire of Deliverance from it, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> This is not the Voice of one <hi>Doubting</hi> of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, or at a loſs where to go for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for he was ſure of Deliverance in due time, and knew from whom his Deliverance would come; as the next Verſe ſhows, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> It is therefore the Voice of one that longs for, that breathes and pants after Deliverance.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>DOCT. <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi>
                  </hi> is one matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation, and what he much longs to be Delivered from.</head>
               <p>This Doctrine may be ſpoken to under three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001336_0005_0FB2885E0D9A77B8"/>PROP. I. <hi>Every Godly Man has Sin dwelling in him.</hi> All men have a corrupt Nature handed down to them from our firſt Parents. They are <hi>Conceived in Sin and brought forth in Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. This <hi>Sin of mans Nature</hi> is not perfectly removed in the Work of Regeneration and Sanctification: The beſt of Men have the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Corruption</hi> in them as long as they continue in this World. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> was, it may be, inferior to no meer man as to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart and Life, and yet he does in our Text and Context confeſs that he had Sin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtirring in him. It is <hi>Self-Deluſion</hi> to think or ſay, <hi>That we have no Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. There is no <hi>Sinleſs Perſon</hi> on this ſide Heaven: and therefore the <hi>Mortification of Sin,</hi> is a work wherein Saints are to be engaged, all the dayes of their Lives.</p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>This Indwelling Sin is One matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation.</hi> The renewed Soul of the Apoſtle does in the Text Sigh &amp; Groan over the remainders of Sin in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Herein he is a Pattern of all true Believers; every holy man is like him in this point.</p>
               <p>Two things may here be Enquired into.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>How do the Godly Lament Indwelling Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1. <hi>Principally.</hi> The Body of Death is the <hi>Chief Matter</hi> of their Lamentation. There is nothing which a Godly Man does more bitterly bewail than this <hi>Plague of his own Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001336_0006_0FB28860F515D030"/>1. He Laments this more than any <hi>Outward Affliction. Corruption within</hi> cauſes more heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſorrow in his Spirit, than all <hi>Troubles Without.</hi> This we may ſee Verifyed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> He was a man exerciſed with as various &amp; great <hi>Calamities</hi> as moſt men. Scarce any, if any, did ſuffer more than he did in his time: he himſelf gives us a Summary account of his many &amp; grievous ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Now tho' he was a Man of ſuch <hi>Sufferings,</hi> yet we do not find that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained under them: he never cryed out of his ſharp Afflictions bemoaning himſelf on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. No, inſtead of lamenting them he <hi>Rejoyced</hi> and <hi>Gloried</hi> in them; they were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> matter of his <hi>Triumph,</hi> not of his <hi>Sorrow.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> now, when he gives us an account of the <hi>Body of Death and Sin</hi> in him, he cryes out, <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> The <hi>Body of Death</hi> is a Saint's <hi>greateſt Burden:</hi> He groans more under the weight of that, than of any burden of Affliction. Hence it is that he is willing that God ſhould lay any <hi>Afflictions</hi> upon him which may mortify his <hi>Corruptions:</hi> He is content God ſhould uſe the ſharpeſt <hi>Remedies</hi> that may kill his Luſts. Let God take away the Health and Strength of his <hi>Body,</hi> let God do any thing with him, <hi>If it may ſlay Sin, he is ſatisfyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He Laments this more than any <hi>Actual Sin. Acts of Sin</hi> are to be bewailed, but the <hi>Principle of Sin</hi> much more; And a Godly Man is in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001336_0007_0FB2886856A35960"/>
of Spirit for his <hi>Actual Iniquities,</hi> but more for <hi>Original Sin.</hi> He grieves that he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Sin, but he grieves more that there is ſuch a corrupt heart in him which carryes him to ſuch Sins. <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> is much worſe than any <hi>Actual Sin.</hi> The Luſts of the heart are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Evils than the <hi>Sins of the Life,</hi> as ſhall preſently be proved. There is therefore more cauſe to bewail Sin in us, than Sin acted by us. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a Godly Man, is by his <hi>Actual Sins</hi> led up to the Conſideration of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and he Principally Mourns over that. When <hi>David</hi> had been guilty of Murder and Adultery, he bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly bewailed thoſe horrid Sins; but his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Eye did eſpecially look to, and weep over that <hi>Vile Heart</hi> from whence they proceeded, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me. Behold!</hi> Says he. He points his finger to, and takes ſpecial notice of, his Natural Corruption: and tis as if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>Ah Lord! What a Curſed and Sinful Nature have I that is prone to ſuch Monſtrous Abominations?</q> The vileneſs of his <hi>Heart</hi> was that which moſtly abaſed him. Thus the Apoſtle in the context makes a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mention of the many <hi>Actings</hi> of Sin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was guilty, but at length his moſt bitter complaints are made againſt the body of Death, <hi>O wretched man that I am: who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> The ſtrength of his Sorrow is ſpent on this: He ſtops not till he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001336_0008_0FB2886AC34B9120"/>

               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> directly oppoſes the <hi>whole Law of God.</hi> It is contrary not only to <hi>Some</hi> of Gods Commands, but to <hi>Every One</hi> of them. It is an Univerſal contrariety to the holy Law of God: It conſiſts in an Averſation to <hi>Every thing</hi> that God requires, and an Inclination to <hi>Every thing</hi> that God forbids. There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>All Good,</hi> and a fulneſs of <hi>All Evil</hi> in <hi>Original Sin.</hi> There are as <hi>many Luſts</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin, as there are <hi>Laws</hi> in the Word of God: To every <hi>Law</hi> there is an oppoſite <hi>Luſt.</hi>

Does God require <hi>Faith?</hi> Oppoſite to this is the Luſt of <hi>Unbelief.</hi> Does He require <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</hi> Oppoſite to this is the <hi>Luſt</hi> of <hi>Pride.</hi> Does he require <hi>Hope</hi> in His Mercy, mutual <hi>Forgiveneſs, Patience</hi> under Trials, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theſe are the Luſts of <hi>Deſpair, Revenge, Impatience,</hi> &amp;c. So that <hi>Original Sin</hi> is as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as the holy Law of God: It is then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the whole Law of God in every part of it. In this reſpect it is far worſe than any <hi>Actual Sin:</hi> for Actual Sins are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to ſome particular Commands only. But Indwelling Sin is an <hi>Entire Body of Luſts,</hi> which is contrary to the <hi>Entire Body of Divine Laws.</hi> There is no Law, which Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, does not in one branch or other, ſtand in a direct Oppoſition unto.

'Tis <hi>Luſt</hi> within that <hi>conceives and brings forth Sin,</hi> Jam. 1.14, 15. For this cauſe all Sinful Deeds are called the <hi>Deeds of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. Neither God, nor the Devil, nor the World, are the Authors of our Sins; but our own <hi>Corrupt Hearts:</hi> theſe are the next and immediate cauſes of every iniquity committed by us. This <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> is then the radical Sin, the <hi>Root of Bitterneſs</hi> upon which all Sin grows; Tis the <hi>Sin of Sins,</hi> the Mother and Nurſe of all Sins, ſeminally containing in it every ſort and kind of Sins; it is therefore more evil than all <hi>Actual Sins;</hi> for there is more of Evil in the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> than in the <hi>Effect;</hi> more Poiſon in the <hi>Fountain,</hi> than in all its <hi>Streams;</hi> It is but <hi>Some degree</hi> of the Venome and Malignity of <hi>Original Sin</hi> that is diffuſed into all <hi>Actual Sins.</hi> Surely, ſuch a principle as this, which is productive of all manner of Evils, is to be greatly lamented.</p>

The more God forbids a thing the more eager it is after it, and therefore will do it <hi>becauſe God forbids it.</hi> The more God requires a thing the more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tis to it, and <hi>Therefore</hi> will not do it <hi>Becauſe</hi> God requires it: It <hi>takes occaſion from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to work all manner of Iniquity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcovers it ſelf to be <hi>Out of meaſure Sinful,</hi> Rom. 7.11, 13.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it prompts to <hi>Sins of Omiſſion,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw us off from that duty which God requires of us; and if it cannot prevail to a neglect of duty, it labours to make us <hi>Careleſs,</hi> Slighty and Formal in the diſcharge of it: and if it cannot work us up to this frame, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>Obſtruct</hi> and <hi>Diſtract</hi> us in the duty as much as it can, Rom. 7.21. <hi>I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> He experimentally found the ſtirrings of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the very time of his diſcharging Duties, that he could not do them as well as he would.

Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> is a principle directly contrary to <hi>Grace.</hi> It is every way oppoſite unto it, in its original, operations and tendency. <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> wages a <hi>Continual War</hi> with <hi>Inherent Grace,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Gal. 5.17. It ſtrives to hinder the actings of <hi>Grace;</hi> it endeavours to weaken and ruine the principle of <hi>Grace.</hi> If the good Spirit of God excites any <hi>Good Motions</hi> in the Soul, Indwelling Sin labours to kill them in their <hi>Birth,</hi> as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> the Male Seed of <hi>Iſrael.

               <p>PROP. III. <hi>As a Godly Man greatly bewailes, ſo he much longs to be delivered from Indwelling Sin.</hi> He is ſo wearied with it, as that his very Soul deſires to be <hi>delivered</hi> from it. Now there are three things reſpecting <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> which he longs to be delivered from.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He deſires to be <hi>Delivered</hi> from the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Power</hi> of <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi> It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a true Believer is <hi>Delivered</hi> from the <hi>Reigning Power</hi> of Indwelling Sin: It does not <hi>Lord</hi> it over him, ſo that he ſhould willingly, readily and chearfully obey it, as he did in his State of Unregeneracy. A Convert ceaſes to be a <hi>Servant of Sin,</hi> and is freed from its abſolute rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, 18. And Sin Within ſhall never more have a plenary <hi>Dominion</hi> over them, <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. Nevertheleſs Sin within is capable of <hi>Prevailing</hi> over Believers, and oftentimes does actually <hi>Prevail:</hi> It carryes them away to great and Scandalous Sins, as the Scriptures do teſtify in many inſtances. Now the truely Godly do earneſtly deſire that they may be Saved from Sins prevalency. And hence they are much in <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for preſervation from the <hi>Power</hi> of Luſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>and</hi> 119.133. And hence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001336_0016_0FB288867AF69EA8"/>
it is that they exerciſe themſelves in endeavours to <hi>Keep under the Body of Sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. A Godly Man is one that has heartily renounced Subjection to the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> and deſires that it may never more over-power him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He deſires to be <hi>Delivered</hi> from the <hi>Terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power</hi> of <hi>Indwelling</hi> Sin. This Sin is many times a principle of <hi>Terrour</hi> to the truly Godly: It ſo darkens their Minds, ſo deadens their Hearts and Affections, ſo ſtirs and works in them, as that it fills them with perplexing doubts and fears. It many times lays them unto diſmal apprehenſions about themſelves: they are made to <hi>Fear</hi> whether God be their reconciled Father and Friend, whether they have any intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>Grace,</hi> whether they have any title to or well-grounded Hopes of Heaven. They are ready to account themſelves <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and to Deſpair of Salvation thro' the horrid workings of Inherent Corruption. Now that which <hi>Delivers</hi> them from theſe <hi>Terrours,</hi> is the ſence and aſſurance of Gods Love; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do earneſtly deſire that the Lord would lift up the light of his Countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Give to them the Joy of his Salvation,</hi> and <hi>make them to hear the Voice of Gladneſs,</hi> Pſal. 51.8, 12. They cry to God for thoſe freſh gales of the Spirit, which may ſcatter thoſe <hi>Fogs</hi> and <hi>Miſts,</hi> which <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> has covered their Souls withal.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001336_0017_0FB28888C5FD18A8"/>3. He deſires to be <hi>Delivered</hi> from the very <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi> Nothing ſhort of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Deliverance</hi> will content a Godly man. The <hi>Body of Death</hi> is ſuch an Annoyance to an holy man, as that he would fain be perfectly and eternally rid of it.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis only in <hi>Glorification</hi> that a Believer comes to be fully ſet at liberty from this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inmate: In this Life it will be and abide in us, but when we leave this World and go to <hi>Glory,</hi> then we ſhall be altogether <hi>Sinleſs;</hi> Sin ſhall no more have a Being in us; for this cauſe a Godly man deſires and pants after <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.2, 4. Their being <hi>Buraned with Indwelling Sin,</hi> makes them <hi>Groan</hi> for that future State, wherein they ſhall have all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> quite done away. One great thing which makes <hi>Heaven</hi> deſireable to a Saint, is, That <hi>Perfect Innocency of Nature</hi> which he ſhall there be reſtored to: <hi>Heaven</hi> is not ſo much deſired by an holy Man, becauſe he ſhall there be freed from <hi>All Sufferings,</hi> as becauſe he ſhall be freed from <hi>All Sin.</hi>

When a Man is truly Converted, he bitterly bewailes <hi>Indwelling Sin,</hi> he cryes out of it as an intolerable burden, and <hi>Groans in Spirit</hi> for a full deliverance from it. How wonderful is the <hi>Change</hi> wrought in ſuch an Heart!

Yea, he exalts them <hi>Above GOD</hi> in his affections, 2 Tim. 3.4. <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God:</hi> The very Life and all of a Sinner is bound up in his <hi>Luſts;</hi> he is never more at eaſe, nor in the enjoyment of greater Satisfaction, than when he is fulfilling the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the fleſh. But now, when he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, his Love to Luſt, like <hi>Amnons</hi> to <hi>Tamar,</hi> is turned into the greateſt Hatred: He ſayes to his beloved Luſts, <hi>Ariſe, be gone;</hi> and he calls upon God to put them out from him and to bolt the door of his Heart after them. O <hi>Strange Alteration!</hi> How comes it about that all on a ſudden the <hi>Inclination,</hi> bent, frame and whole poſture of the Soul is thus turned another way? Surely, 'tis <hi>God</hi> that does this; an <hi>Almighty Hand</hi> muſt needs effect it. None has ſuch power over the Heart, but that God in whoſe hands the Hearts of all Men are, and who turns
