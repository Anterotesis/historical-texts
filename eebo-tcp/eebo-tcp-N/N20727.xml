            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</head>
            <p>GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 11th of February (old ſtyle) 1732, at the pariſh of Waſhington, in Weſtmoreland county, in Virginia. His father's family was numerous, and he was the firſt fruit of a ſecond marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. His education having been princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conducted by a private tutor. At fifteen years old he was entered a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman on board of a Britiſh veſſel of war ſtationed on the coaſt of Virginia, and his baggage prepared for embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the plan was abandoned on account of the reluctance his mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to his engaging in that profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:027221_0005_0FD58E58C96B6468"/>
Previous to this tranſaction, when he was but ten years of age, his father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his eldeſt brother, a young man of the moſt promiſing talents, who had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the colonial troops employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Carthagenia, and on his return from the expedition, named his new pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial manſion MOUNT VERNON, in in honour of the admiral of that name, from whom he had received many civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities. He was afterwards made Adjutant General of the Virginia militia, but did not long ſurvive. At his diſceaſe (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there are heirs of an elder branch who poſſeſs a large moiety of the paternal inheritance) the eldeſt ſon by ſecond marriage inherited this ſeat and a conſiderable landed property. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the extenſive limits of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, the vacant office of Adjutant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral was divided into three diſtricts, and the <hi>future Hero of America,</hi> before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his twentieth year, began his mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary ſervice by an appointment in that department, with the rank of major.</p>
            <p>When he was little more than twenty one years of age, an event occurred which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027221_0006_0FD58E7B9EE58008"/>called his abilities into public notice. In 1753, while the government of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony was adminiſtered by lieutenant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Dinwiddie; encroachments were reported to have been made by the French, from Canada, on the territories of the Britiſh colonies, at the weſtward. Young Mr. Waſhington, who was ſent with plenary powers to aſcertain the facts, treat with the ſavages, and warn the French to deſiſt from their aggreſſions, performed the duty of his miſſion with ſingular induſtry, intelligence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. His journal, and report to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Dinwiddie, which were publiſhed, announced to the world that correctneſs of mind, manlineſs in ſtyle, and accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the mode of doing buſineſs, which have ſince characteriſed him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of more arduous affairs. But it was deemed, by ſome, an extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that ſo juvenile and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a perſon ſhould have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a negociation, with which ſubjects of the greateſt importance were involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſubjects, which ſhortly after became the origin of a war between England and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027221_0007_0FD58E5A8397A998"/>France, that raged for many years through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every part of the globe.</p>
            <p>As the troubles ſtill ſubſiſted on the frontiers, the colony of Virginia raiſed, the next year, a regiment of troops for their defence. Of this corpſe, Mr. Fry, one of the profeſſors of the college, was appointed colonel, and Major Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton received the commiſſion of Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Colonel. But Colonel Fry died the ſame ſummer, without ever having join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and of courſe left his regiment and rank to the ſecond in command. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Waſhington made indefatigable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to form the regiment, eſtabliſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, and open roads ſo as to pre-oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the advantageous poſt at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Alleghany and Mononga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hela rivers, which he had recommended for that purpoſe in his reports the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding year. He was to have been join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a detachment of independent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars from the ſouthern colonies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome companies of provincials from North-Carolina and Maryland. But he perceived the neceſſity of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and without waiting for their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, commenced his march in the month
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027221_0008_0FD58E7CC0788B60"/>of May. Notwithſtanding his precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted advance, on his aſcending the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel-hill, fifty miles ſhort of his object, he was adviſed that a body of French had already taken poſſeſſion and erected a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which they named fort <hi>du Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> He then fell back to a place known by the appellation of <hi>the Great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> for the ſake of forage and ſupplies. Here he built a temporary ſtockade, merely to cover his ſtores; it was from its fate called fort <hi>Neceſſity.</hi> His force when joined by Captain M'Kay's regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, did not amount to four hundred effectives. Upon receiving information from his ſcouts that a conſiderable party was approaching to reconnoitre his poſt, he ſallied and defeated them. But in return he was attacked by an army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have been fifteen hundred ſtrong, and after a gallant defence, in which more than one third of his men were killed and wounded, was forced to capitulate. The garriſon marched out with the honours of war, but were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Indians, in violation of the articles of capitulation. After this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, the remains of the Virginia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glment
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027221_0009_0FD58E5BCCF90798"/>returned to Alexandria to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited and furniſhed with neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
            <p>In the year 1755, the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent to this country General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, who, by the junction of two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran regiments from Ireland, with the independent and provincial corps in America, was to repel the French from the confines of the Engliſh ſettlements. Upon a royal arrangement of rank, by which "no officer who did not <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> derive his commiſſion from the king, could command one who did, "Colonel Waſhington relinquiſhed his regiment, and went as an extra Aid-de-Camp into the family of General Braddock. In this capacity, at the battle of Monon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gahela, he attended that General, whoſe, life was gallantly ſacrificed in attempting to extricate his troops from the fatal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade into which his over-weening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence had conducted them. Braddock had ſeveral horſes ſhot under him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell himſelf; and there was not on officer whoſe duty obliged him to be on hors back that day, excepting Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Waſhington, who was not other killed or wounded. This circumſtance
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027221_0010_0FD58E61F404F4A0"/>enabled him to diſplay greater abilities in covering the retreat and ſaving the wreck of the army, than he could otherwiſe have done. As ſoon as he had ſecured their paſſage over the ford of the Monon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gahela, and found they were not purſued, he hallened to concert meaſuers for their further ſecurity with Colonel Dunbar, who had remained with the ſecond divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and heavy baggage at ſome diſtance in the rear. To effect this, he travelled with two guides, all night, through an almoſt impervious wilderneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the fatigues he had undergone in the day, and notwithſtanding he had ſo imperfectly recovered from ſickneſs that he was obliged in the morning to be ſupported with cuſhions on his horſe. The public accounts in England and America were not parſimonious of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe for the eſſential ſervice he had rendered on ſo trying an occaſion.</p>
            <p>Not long after this time, the regulation of rank, which had been ſo injurious to the Coloniel officers, was changed to their ſatisfaction, in conſequence of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and the remonſtrance of Colonel Waſhington; and the ſupreme authority
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027221_0011_0FD58E633874B2A0"/>of Virginia, impreſſed with a due ſenſe of his merits, gave him, in a new and extenſive commiſſion, the command of all the troops raiſed, and to be raiſed in that colony.</p>
            <p>It would not comport with the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brevity of this ſketch, to mention in detail the plans he ſuggeſted or the ſyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em he purſued for defending the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, until the year 1758, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the van brigade of Gen. Forbes's army in the capture of Fort du Queſne. A ſimilar reaſon will preclude the recital of the perſonal hazards and atchievements which happened in the courſe of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The tranquility on the frontiers of the middle colonies having been reſtored by the ſucceſs of this campaign, and the health of Colonel Waſhington having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extremely debilitated by a inveterate pulmonary complaint, in 1759 hereſigned his appointment. Authentic documents are not wanting to ſhew the tender regret which the Virginia line expreſſed at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their commander, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regard which he entertained for them.</p>
            <p>His health was gradually re-eſtabliſhed.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027221_0012_0FD58E81925BA178"/>He married Mrs. Cuſtis,
<note n="*" place="bottom">General and Mrs. Waſhington were both born in the ſame year.</note> a handſome and amiable young widow, poſſeſſed of an ample jointure; and ſettled as a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and farmer on the eſtate where he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſides in Fairfax county. After ſome years he gave up planting tobacco, and went altogether into the farming buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He has raiſed ſeven thouſand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels of wheat and ten thouſand buſhels of Indian corn in one year. Although he has confined his own cultivation to this domeſtic tract of about nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres, yet he pofleſſes excellent lands in large quantities, in ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counties. His judgment in the qualities of ſoils, his command of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to avail himſelf of purchaſes, and his occaſional employment in early life as a ſurveyor, gave him opportunities of making advantageous locations; many of which are much improved.</p>
            <p>After he left the army until the year 1775, he thus cultivated the arts of peace. He was conſtantly a member of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, a magiſtrate of his county, and a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027221_0013_0FD58E64D37A38A8"/>judge of the court. He was elected a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate to the firſt Congreſs in 1774; as well as to that which aſſembled the year following. Soon after the war broke out he was appointed by Congreſs comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief of the forces of the United Colonies.</p>
            <p>It is the leſs neceſſary to particulariſe in this place his tranſactions in the late war, becauſe the impreſſion which they made is yet freſh in every mind. But it is hoped poſterity will be taught, in what manner he transformed an undiſciplined body of pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry into a regular army of ſoldiers. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on his campaigns would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be highly intereſting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to future generations. The conduct of the firſt campaign, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Britiſh troops to abandon Boſton by a bloodleſs victory, will mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a minute narration. But a volumn would ſcarcely contain the mortifications he experienced and the hazards to which he was expoſed in 1776 and 1777, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt the proweſs of Britain, with an inadequate force. His good deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and conſumate prudence prevented want of ſucceſs from producing want of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027221_0014_0FD58E82B9DF5E60"/>confidence on the part of the public; for want of ſucceſs is apt to lead to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pernicious counſels through the levity of the people or the ambition of their demagogues. Shortly after this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod ſprang up the only cabal that ever exiſted during his public life, to rob him of his reputation and command. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as impotent in effect as it was auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in deſign. In the three ſucceeding years the germ of diſcipline unfolded; and the reſources of America having been called into co-operation with the land and naval armies of France, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the glorious concluſion of the campaign in 1781. From this time the gloom began to diſappear from our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical horizon, and the affairs of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion proceeded in a meliorating train, until a peace was moſt ably negociated by our ambaſſadors in Europe, in 1783.</p>
            <p>No perſon who had not the advantage of being preſent when General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington received the intelligence of peace, and who did not accompany him to his domeſſic retirement, can deſcribe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which that joyful event brought to his labouring mind, or the ſupreme ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027221_0015_0FD58E663604C410"/>with which he withdrew to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. From his triumphal entry into New-York, upon the evacuation of that city by the Britiſh army, to his arrival at Mount Vernon, after the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his commiſſion to Congreſs, feſtive crowds impeded his paſſage through all the populous towns, the devotion of a whole people purſued him with prayers to Heaven for bleſſings on his head, while their gratitude ſought the moſt expreſſive language of manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf to him, as their common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and benefactor. When he became a private citizen he had the unuſual feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to find that his native ſtate was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt zealous in doing juſtice to his merits; and that ſtronger demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of affectionate eſteem (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) were given by the citizens of his neighbourhood, than by any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of men on the continent. But he has conſtantly declined accepting any compenſation for his ſervices, or proviſion for the augmented expences which have been incurred by him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his public employment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though propoſals have been made in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027221_0016_0FD58E8451A5E9F0"/>moſt delicate manner, particularly by the ſtates of Virginia and Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>The virtuous ſimplicity which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the private life of Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, though leſs known than the daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſplendour of his military atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; is not leſs edifying in example, or worthy the attention of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The conſpicuous character he has acted on the theatre of human affairs, the uniform dignity with which he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his part amidſt difficulties of the moſt diſcouraging nature, and the glory of having arrived through them at the hour of triumph, have made many offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and literary perſons, on both ſides of the ocean, ambitious of a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with him. Theſe correſpondencies unavoidably engroſs a great portion of his time; and the communications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, combined with the numerous periodical publications and news-papers which he peruſes, render him, as it were, the <hi>focus of political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence for the new world.</hi> Nor are his converſations with well informed men leſs conducive to bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the various events which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027221_0017_0FD58E6ACE34EAC8"/>happen in different countries of the globe. Every foreigner of diſtinction, who travels in America, makes it a point to viſit him. Members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and other dignified perſonages do not paſs his houſe, without calling to pay their reſpects. As another ſource of information it may be mentioned, that many literary productions are ſent to him annually by their authors in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; and that there is ſcarcely one work written in America, on any art, ſcience, or ſubject, which does not ſeek his protection, or which is not offered to him as a token of gratitude. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical inventions are frequently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him for his approbation, and natural curioſities preſented for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation. But the multiplicity of epiſtolary applications, often on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ſome buſineſs which happened when he was commander in chief, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on ſubjects foreign to his ſituation, frivolous in their nature, and intended merely to gratify the vanity of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by drawing anſwers from him is truly diſtreſſing and almoſt incredible. His benignity in anſwering, perhaps,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027221_0018_0FD58E872CDC5060"/>encreaſes the number. Did he not huſband every moment to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, it would not be in his power to notice the variety of ſubjects that claim his attention. Here a minuter deſcription of his domeſtic life may be expected.</p>
            <p>To apply a life, at beſt but ſhort, to the moſt uſeful purpoſes; he lives as he ever has done, in the unvarying habits of regularity, temperance and induſtry. He riſes, in winter as well as in ſummer at the dawn of day; and generally reads or writes ſome time before breakfaſt. He breakfaſts about ſeven o'clock, on three ſmall Indian hoe-cakes and as many diſhes of tea. He rides immediately to his different farms, and remains with his labourers until a little paſt two o'clock, when he returns and dreſſes. At three he dines, commonly on a ſingle diſh, and drinks from half a pint to a pint of Madeira wine. This, with one ſmall glaſs of punch, a draught of beer, and two diſhes of tea (which he takes half an hour before ſun-ſetting) conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates his whole ſuſtenance until the next day. Whether there be company or not,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027221_0019_0FD58E6D013B3B38"/>the table is always prepared by its ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and exuberance for their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the General remains at it for an hour after dinner, in familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and convivial hilarity. It is then that every one preſent is called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to give ſome abſent friend as a toaſt; the name not unfrequently awakens a pleaſing remembrance of paſt events, and gives a new turn to the animated colloquy. General Waſhington is more chearful than be was in the army. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his temper is rather of a ſerious caſt, and his countenance commonly carries the impreſſion of thoughtfulneſs, yet he perfectly reliſhes a pleaſant ſtory, an unafected ſally of wit, or a burleſque deſcription which ſurpriſes by its ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs and incongruity with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary appearance of the object deſcribed. After this ſociable and innocent relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he applies himſelf to buſineſs; and about nine o'clock retires to reſt. This is the <hi>rotinc,</hi> and this the hour he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, when no one but his family is preſent; at other times he attends po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely upon his company until they wiſh to withdraw. He keeps a pack of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027221_0020_0FD58E6E78BAA4E0"/>hounds, and in the ſeaſon indulges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with hunting once in a week; at which diverſion the gentlemen of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria often aſſiſt.</p>
            <p>Agriculture is the favourite employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Generel Waſhington, in which he wiſhes to paſs the remainder of his days. To acquire and communicate prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical knowledge, he correſponds with Mr. Arthur Young, who has written ſo ſenſibly on the ſubject, and alſo with many agricultural gentlemen in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. As improvement is known to be his paſſion, he receives envoys with rare ſeeds and reſults of new projects from every quarter. He likewiſe makes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious notes, relative to his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſtate of the ſeaſons, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoils, the effects of different kinds of manure, and ſuch other topics as may throw light on the farming buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>On Saturday in the afternoon, every week's reports are made by all his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, and regiſtered in books kept for that purpoſe: ſo that at the end of the year, the quantity of labour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce may be accurately known. Order
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027221_0021_0FD58E7055891790"/>and oeconomy are eſtabliſhed in all the departments within and without doors. His lands are encloſed in lots of equal dimenſions, and crops are aſſigned to each for many years. Every thing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken on a great ſcale; but with a view to introduce or augment the culture of ſuch articles as he conceives will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt beneficial in their conſequences to the country. He has, in one year raiſed two thouſand lambs, ſowed twenty ſeven buſhels of flaxſeed, and planted more than ſeven hundred buſhels of potatoes. In the mean time, the public may reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that there is manufactured under his roof, linen and wollen cloth, nearly or quite ſufficient for the uſe of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous houſhold.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</head>
            <p>GENERAL Montgomery deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a reſpectable family in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to liberty was innate, and matured by a fine edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and an excellent underſtanding. Having married a wife, and purchaſed an eſtate in New-York, he was, from theſe circumſtances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the juſtneſs of her cauſe, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to conſider himſelf as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cauſe, and quitted the ſweets of eaſy
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027221_0025_0FD58E7756DD31F8"/>fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philoſophical rural life, with the higheſt domeſtic felicity, to take an active ſhare in all the hardſhips and dangers that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſoldiers life.</p>
            <p>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the ſervice of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and had ſucceſsfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, in the war of 1756, on the very ſpot, where, when fighting under the ſtandard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms againſt her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conteſt, was more ſincerely, or more univerſally lamented. And what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, the moſt eminent ſpeakers in the Britiſh parliament, forgetting for the moment, that he had died in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their cruel and oppreſſive meaſures, diſplayed all their eloquence in praiſing his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his in the French war of 1756, ſhed abundance of tears, while he expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on their paſt friendſhip and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exchange of tender ſervices in that ſeaſon of enterpriſe and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027221_0026_0FD58E8D41D00128"/>
All enmity to this veteran ſoldier ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with his life; and reſpect to his private character prevailed over all other conſiderations. By the orders of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Carlton, his dead body received eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible mark of diſtinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the firſt day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave ſoldier.</p>
            <p>Congreſs were not unmindful of the merit of this amiable and brave officer, nor remiſs in manifeſting the eſteem and reſpect they entertained for his memory. Conſidering it not only as a tribute of gratitude juſtly due to the memory of thoſe who had peculiarly diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the glorious cauſe of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to perpetuate their names by the moſt durable monuments erected to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but greatly conducive to inſpire poſterity with emulation of their illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, that honourable body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>"<hi>Reſolved,</hi> That to expreſs the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the United Colonies for their late General, RICHARD MONTGOMERY, and the deep ſenſe they entertain of the many ſingnal and important ſervices of that gallant officer, who, after a ſeries
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027221_0027_0FD58E7837044E08"/>of ſucceſſes, amidſt the moſt diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulties, fell at length in a gallant attack upon Quebec, the capital of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada; and to tranſmit to future ages, as examples truly worthy of imitation, his patriotiſm, conduct, boldneſs of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, inſuperable perſeverance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of danger and death; a monument be procured from Paris, or other parts of France, with an inſcription ſacred to his memory, and expreſſive of his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character, and heroic atchievments, and that the Continental treaſures be directed to advance a ſum not exceeding 300<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, to Dr. Franklin, who is deſired to ſee this reſolution properly executed, for defraying the expence thereof."</p>
            <p>This reſolve was carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Paris, by that ingenious artiſt, Mr. Caffiers, ſculptor to the king of France, under the direction of Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. The monument is of white marble, of the moſt beautiful ſimplicity, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible elegance, with emblamatical devices, and the following truly claſſical inſcription, worthy of the modeſt, but great mind of a Franklin.</p>

TO THE GLORY OF RICHARD MONTGOMERY, Major General of the armies of the United States of America, Slain at the ſiege of Quebec, the 31ſt of December, 1775, aged 38 years.</p>
            <p>This elegant monument has lately been erected in front of St. Paul's church in New-York.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable circumſtance connected with the fall of this brave offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, that merits to be recorded, becauſe the fact is of a very intereſting nature, and will ſerve to perpetuate the memory of a very amiable and deſerving charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was alſo a martyr in the cauſe of his country. The circumſtance is this:</p>
            <p>One of General Montgomery's Aides<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-Camp, was Mr. Macpherſon, a moſt promiſing young man, whoſe father reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Philadelphia, and was greatly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in privateering in the war of 1756. This gentleman had a brother in the 16th regiment, in the Britiſh ſervice, at the time of Montgomery's expedition into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and who was as violent in favour of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027221_0029_0FD58E31ECF16EA0"/>the Engliſh government, as this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Aid-de-Camp was enthuſiaſtic in the cauſe of America; the latter had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his General a day or two previous to the attack in which they both loſt their lives, to view and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the ſpot where Wolf had fallen; on his return he found a letter from his brother, the Engliſh officer, full of the bittereſt reproaches againſt him, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered into the American ſervice, and containing a pretty direct wiſh, that if he would not abandon it, he might meet with the deſerved fate of a rebel. The Aid-de-Camp immediately returned him an anſwer, full of ſtrong reaſoning in defence of his conduct, but by no means attempting to ſhake the oppoſite princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his brother, and not only free from acrimony, but full of expreſſions of tenderneſs and affection; this letter he dated, "From the ſpot where Wolfe loſt his life, in fighting the cauſe of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>in friedſhip with America.</hi>" This letter had ſcarcely reached the officer at New-York, before it was followed by the news of his brother's death. The effect was inſtantaneous, nature, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027221_0030_0FD58E94EA643410"/>reaſon prevailed; and a thouſand, not unworthy ſentiments ruſhed upon his diſtreſſed mind; he quitted the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſervice, entered into that of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and ſought every occaſion of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing himſelf in her ſervice!</p>

               <p>FATHER of all! Thou who ruleſt the armies of Heaven above; look down upon us we beſeech thee, and bleſs all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men in this lower world. In a particular manner we pray for our own country: Bleſs the Congreſs of theſe United States, and all our rulers; May they rule wiſely, love mercy, and do juſtice at all times. Unite us more and more we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee; lead us in the right way, and make us a great and a happy people.</p>
               <p>Bleſs all religious orders of men, O our heavenly Father! enlighten their minds, ſubdue ſuperſtition, and grant that they may all unite to worſhip thee in truth, with one heart and one voice.</p>
               <p>Send diſcord far from us, we beſeech thee, both from church and ſtate, and give us hearts of unity and peace. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the happy time when thy will ſhall be done here on earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: When ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more: When all the inhabitants of the earth ſhall be bleſſed; and join in ſongs of praiſe to thee the only wiſe God, for ever and ever.
