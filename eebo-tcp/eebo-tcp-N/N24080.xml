            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT the ſubject here diſcuſſed is of ſufficient importance to demand ſerious attention, whether the principle defended be true or falſe, muſt be admitted by every competent judge; becauſe of its intimate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the doctrine of juſtification before God: for that has ever been conſidered, by our moſt eminent Proteſtant writers, both Lutherans and Calviniſts, as an article of the greateſt moment. Thus, for inſtance, Dr. JOHN OWEN:
<q>In my judgment, LUTHER ſpake the truth when he ſaid, <hi>To loſe the article of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would at once be the loſs of the whole Chriſtian faith.</hi> And I wiſh he had not been a true prophet, when he foretold that, in the following ages, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hereof would be again obſcured <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification. General Conſidertions,</hi> p. 103. Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, 1760. Thus, alſo, that celebrated foreigner, WITSIUS:
<q>Diffundit ſe Juſtificationis doctrina per totum theologiae corpus, et prout fundamenta hic, vel bene, vel male, jacta ſunt, eo uni verſum aediſicium vel ſolidius auguſtiuſque aſcendit, vel male ſtatuminatum foedam minitatur ruinam.</q>

<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031844_0003_0FEF1CC256885368"/>
alſo, with Chriſtian experience, with devotional practice, and with general obedience to God. The better that principle is underſtood, and the more its practical influence is felt; the more benign will its genuine tendency appear, with regard to peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and liberty in devotional duties; to the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exerciſe of holy affections, and a courſe of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the divine commands. It is, by the Author at leaſt, conſidered in this light.</p>
            <p>That prudence and caution are neceſſary, however, in ſtating and defending the ſentiment here adopted, the Writer preſumes, will be acknowledged: becauſe it is a kind of <hi>middle point,</hi> between Arminianiſm, and Antinomianiſm—between ſeeking acceptance with God, <hi>as it were, by the works of the law</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. ix. 32.</note>; and renouncing obedience to the divine precepts, as if they had loſt their obliging power, or as if our perſonal obedience were of no importance in any reſpect. The former of which is pernicious legality; the latter, deſtructive licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. Whether the Writer have handled the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with all that wiſdom and care, which its delicacy and importance demand, he dares not aſſert: but, with ſincerity he can declare, that the diſcuſſion of it has been attended with much thought, and with frequent prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:031844_0004_0FEF1CC849D8D408"/>Though the Author deteſt the <hi>real</hi> principles of what is properly called <hi>Antinomianiſm;</hi> though, many years ago, in the moſt public manner, he laboured to explode thoſe pernicious principles<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>The Death of Legal Hope, the Life of Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Sect. VII. Edit. 3d.</note>; and though, in the preſent Performance, he have endeavoured to guard againſt being miſunderſtood; yet he is not without ſuſpicion, that ſome of his readers will be ready to conſider the main poſition defended, as having a licentious caſt. But, ſhould that be the caſe, he is prepared for it, ſo as to be neither offended, nor ſurpriſed. Nay, while fully perſuaded that there is no juſt ground for ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he will conſider it as a preſumption in favour of the point maintained. Becauſe it is evident, that the doctrine of grace, as preached and recorded by Paul, was treated in a ſimilar manner <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 8, 31. vi. 1, 2, 3, 15. ix. 14—24.</note>. He has long been of opinion, that whoever exhibits the <hi>true glory</hi> of divine grace, and the <hi>high importance</hi> of Chriſtian duty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the apoſtolic pattern; will be conſidered by many as an Antinomian, and by ſome as an Arminian. Does a miniſter of the goſpel diſplay the abſolute freeneſs, the infinite riches, and the allſufficiency of that grace which is revealed in Jeſus Chriſt, as an immediate ground of encouragement for the vileſt of ſinners to confide in him? the doctrine will be ſtigmatized by
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:031844_0005_0FEF1CCB2E9CDC80"/>
multitudes, as manifeſtly licentious. Does he, as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial duty requires, warmly inſiſt, that, be the profeſſed articles of any one's theological creed ever ſo ſcriptural; yet, if he be not habitually mindful of the divine precepts; if he keep not the example of Chriſt in view; if his heart have not an heavenly turn; he is a ſtranger to the power of evangelical truth, and unworthy to be called a Chriſtian? his preaching will be offenſive to the mere formaliſt; be cenſured as uncharitable; and reproached, by ſome, as deteſtably legal.</p>
            <p>The grand principle here defended, is far from being novel; it having been adopted by many Proteſtant writers of high reputation in the churches of Chriſt: from ſome of whom, and eſpecially from Dr. JOHN OWEN, a number of quotations appear in the following work. To the producing of which quotations the Author was induced, partly for the ſake of that argument which they contain, in proof of his main point; and partly to evince, that the ſentiments here maintained have been eſpouſed by perſons of the firſt eminence, among profeſſed Chriſtians of Calviniſtic principles.</p>
            <p>That the number of quotations, from the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Calviniſtic authors, with regard to the leading poſition, might have been greatly increaſed; every one, much acquainted with their theological writings, muſt acknowledge. Mr. DAVID WILSON, when vindicating
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:031844_0006_0FEF1CCE239C45A0"/>
various Writers, denominated POPULAR PREACHERS, againſt the attacks of groſs miſrepreſentation, of illiberal cenſure, and of ſarcaſtical contempt; in ſpeaking rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the main ſubject of the following pages, ſays:
<q>They [the Popular Preachers] were very ready to acknowledge, that thoſe who are moſt punctual in the external performance of religious duties, are frequently in a far more dangerous condition than publicans and harlots, or thoſe who lead the moſt wicked and flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious lives; becauſe, through the corruption of their own hearts, all their duties, religious ſervices, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and attainments, are too often made ſubſervient to the gratification of their pride, and the cheriſhing of thoſe preſumptuous hopes and imaginations whereby they are hardened in their oppoſition to the true grace of God manifeſted in the goſpel. And they were equally ready to own, that the ſovereign mercy of God, with regard to believers at firſt converſion, does ſtill prevent every good action, motion, or qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them; every thing that can be ſuppoſed to have the leaſt tendency to qualify them for the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation —They affirmed, that the foundation of a ſinner's confidence and comfort lies, not in any good works performed by him; in any conſciouſneſs of his own ſincerity; or any experience of a gracious and ſanctifying work of the divine Spirit upon his own ſoul; but wholly without him, in the promiſes and teſtimony of God in the goſpel—To maintain, that
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:031844_0007_0FEF1CCFAECB9570"/>
ſinners are juſtified freely, through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, and apprehended by faith alone; and yet aſſert, that no man has a ſufficient warrant to rely upon that righteouſneſs alone for juſtification—as exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the word of the goſpel, till he is firſt conſcious of his own godlineſs and ſincerity; is in effect to affirm, that though ſinners in general muſt be juſtified freely by grace, through the imputed righteouſneſs; yet no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in particular ought, or has any warrant to believe, that he is, or ever can be juſtified in that manner, or without a righteouſneſs of his own; or, at leaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in and about himſelf, upon which he may with ſafety bottom an aſſurance of the divine favour, and his own juſtification and ſalvation <note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>Though the Author be fully perſuaded, that a denial of the poſition maintained, is inconſiſtent with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine goſpel, and with thoſe principles on which every truly pious man proceeds in his prayers, reſpecting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God; yet he is far from concluding, that no one is a real diſciple of Chriſt, who does not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly avow that poſition. For he has learned, from experience and obſervation, that perſons will ſometimes <hi>diſpute</hi> againſt a particular ſentiment, the truth of which is habitually implied in their <hi>prayers,</hi> and its importance
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:031844_0008_0FEF1CD56964D510"/>
tacitly acknowledged in their <hi>own experience.</hi> To this effect is the following language of Dr. OWEN, reſpecting certain oppoſers of the doctrine of juſtification merely by grace, through an imputed righteouſneſs:
<q>I doubt they oftentimes diſpute themſelves beyond what they can well abide by, when they return home unto a ſedate meditation of the ſtate of things between God and their own ſouls—I had rather learn what ſome men really judge about their own juſtification, from their <hi>prayers,</hi> than their <hi>writings.</hi> Nor do I remember, that I did ever hear any good man in his prayers, uſe any expreſſions about juſtification, pardon of ſin, and righteouſneſs before God, wherein any plea, from any thing in ourſelves, was introduced, or made uſe of— Whereas we may, and ought, to repreſent unto God in our ſupplications, our faith, or what it is that we believe herein; I much queſtion, whether ſome men can find in their hearts to <hi>pray</hi> over and plead before him, all the arguments and diſtinctions they make uſe of to prove the intereſt of our works and obedience in our juſtification before him; or <hi>enter into judgment</hi> with him, upon the concluſions which they make from them —I judge no men upon the expreſſions that fall from them in polemical writings; wherein, on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they do affront their own <hi>experience,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their own <hi>prayers</hi>—To believe the doctrine of [juſtification by the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt,] or not to believe it, as thus or thus <hi>explained,</hi> is one
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:031844_0009_0FEF1CD893DE6530"/>
thing; and to <hi>enjoy</hi> the thing, or <hi>not</hi> enjoy it is another. I no way doubt, but that many men do receive more grace from God, than they underſtand, or will own; and have a greater efficacy of it in them, than they will believe <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>That no plauſible reaſons may be advanced, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his main theſis, the Author does not ſuppoſe. But, as the writer juſt quoted obſerves;

               <p>WHETHER any holy diſpoſition in the heart of a ſinner be previouſly neceſſary to warrant his believing in Jeſus Chriſt? Or, whether, for that purpoſe, the goſpel itſelf, detached from every conſideration of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory ſanctifying influence, be completely ſufficient? are queſtions on which the miniſters of religion, and the profeſſors of godlineſs, are greatly divided. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> ſentiment is charged, by ſome, with Arminian legality: the <hi>latter,</hi> by multitudes, with Antinomian licentiouſneſs. <hi>That</hi> is diſcarded, as foſtering phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical pride, as veiling the glory of ſovereign grace, and as corrupting the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>This</hi> is deteſted, as encouraging preſumptuous hope, as inimical to true virtue, and as averſe to Supreme authority, expreſſing itſelf in divine law.

Chriſtians, relative to this momentous article of our enquiry!</p>
               <p>After much thought on the ſubject, I cannot but conclude, however, <hi>That the genuine goſpel is a complete warrant for the moſt ungodly perſon to believe in Jeſus; and that no degree of holineſs is neceſſary for that purpoſe.</hi> This poſition, though treated by great numbers as a licentious principle, and as pregnant with dangerous conſequences, I conſider as a capital article of revealed truth, and as eſſential to the genuine goſpel. I adopt it, as expreſſing an important fact, in which the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord's vicarious work, the honour of divine grace, and the peace of diſtreſſed conſciences, are deeply concerned: to the proof and illuſtration of which, the following pages are devoted.</p>
               <p>To prevent miſtakes it is proper to be obſerved, that, by an <hi>holy diſpoſition</hi> is not meant, a ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of religious duty; a conviction of ſpiritual danger; or a deſire of immortal happineſs: for theſe, though they accompany, do none of them come under the notion of an holy diſpoſition. Theſe may all exiſt, more or leſs, in the minds, the conſciences, and the hearts of ſinners, without any principle of true ſanctity. But, by an holy diſpoſition is intended, a <hi>bias</hi> of the will, a <hi>propenſity</hi> of the heart, or a <hi>tendency</hi> of the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in favour of divine authority, and of conformity
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031844_0013_0FEF1CE30DC36448"/>
to the divine image.—By <hi>believing</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, I do not mean a firm perſuaſion of his being the promiſed Meſſiah, and that the Chriſtian religion is from God, though that perſuaſion be preſuppoſed; nor a mere aſſent to any particular propoſition, however true, or important; nor yet an aſſurance of perſonal intereſt in Chriſt, as the only Saviour of ſinners: but <hi>relying</hi> upon him as revealed in the doctrine of grace, for pardon, peace, and every ſpiritual bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Again: The queſtion is not, whether ſanctifying influence, and real holineſs, be previouſly neceſſary to <hi>final felicity?</hi> for that is admitted in its fulleſt ſenſe. Partly, becauſe <hi>without holineſs no one ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> and partly, becauſe without holineſs, intellectual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is impoſſible,—Neither is the inquiry, Whether a pious turn of heart be neceſſary to <hi>communion with God,</hi> in the performance of devotional ſervices? for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, on the part of a Chriſtian, is nothing elſe but the exerciſe of holy affections toward God, as manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt.—Nor, whether an holy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the will be neceſſary, as an evidence of our <hi>having already</hi> believed in Jeſus? for that is cheerfully granted.—Nor, yet, whether a divine influence, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evangelical truth, be neceſſary to a ſinner's <hi>believing</hi> in Chriſt? for that is an important article of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith.—But the queſtion to be diſcuſſed, is; <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Goſpel itſelf be a complete warrant for the moſt

ungodly perſon to believe in Jeſus, without any holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being neceſſary for that purpoſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the term <hi>goſpel</hi> I here intend, <hi>the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by grace, through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> which doctrine is, in the moſt emphatical ſenſe, <hi>good news,</hi> or <hi>glad tidings;</hi> agreeable to the natural import of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as uſed by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Relative to which particular, I will here introduce a few extracts from Dr. GEORGE CAMPBELL. Thus, that learned Author:

                     <hi>nuncium,</hi> always in claſſical uſe, where it occurs but rarely, denotes either <hi>good news,</hi> or the <hi>reward</hi> given to the bearer of good news—The Greek verb <gap reason="foreign">

The appropriation of the word to the religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution called the goſpel, is of later date, and has gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſen out of the former uſage. When etymology and uſe perfectly coincide, we cannot be too literal in our interpretations; when they differ, which does not ſeldom happen, the latter is to be followed, and not the former—The firſt meaning of the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031844_0015_0FEF1CEBEE64C138"/>
chiefly intended: and therefore the word cannot, without a ſacrifice of propriety, be uniformly ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The name, from being expreſſive of an eminent quality in the diſpenſation introduced by the Meſſiah, and from being moſt frequently applied to it, came gradually to ſerve as a name for the diſpenſation itſelf. When it is thus employed, it is in our tongue properly rendered <hi>goſpel</hi>—This [literal and primitive] ſenſe ought to be retained in the verſion, when the word, <gap reason="foreign">

—'The <hi>goſpel,</hi>' ſays LUTHER,
<q>is the doctrine concerning the incarnate Son of God, who was given to us, without our deſerts, for peace and ſalvation. It is the word of ſalvation, the word of grace, the word of comfort, and the word of joy<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>The goſpel, then, properly and ſtrictly ſo called, is the doctrine of <hi>divine grace.</hi> As ſuch, it is contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed to the precepts and prohibitions of divine law, which are the doctrine of <hi>human duty.</hi> But, relative to this diſtinction, and the contraſted light in which the law and the goſpel are placed by it, the following quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from WITSIUS may not be improper. Thus that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031844_0019_0FEF1CF6985589B8"/>
eminent writer:
<q>The <hi>law,</hi> here, denotes that part of the divine Word which conſiſts of precepts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions; with the promiſe of a reward to be conferred on thoſe who obey, and a threatening of puniſhment on the diſobedient. The <hi>goſpel</hi> ſignifies the doctrine of grace, and of complete ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt, which elect ſinners ſhall receive by faith. Every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, therefore, of virtues and of duties; all exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and dehortations; all reproofs and threatenings; all promiſes, likewiſe, of reward to perfect obedience, belong to the <hi>law.</hi> To the <hi>goſpel</hi> pertains every thing that can miniſter hope of ſalvation to ſinful man: that is, the doctrine of the Perſon, the offices, the ſtates, the benefits of Jeſus Chriſt; and all promiſes to which are annexed the pardon of ſin, and the poſſeſſion of grace and of glory, to be obtained by faith in Chriſt. This is the moſt ſtrict notion of each word; to which, through the whole of this diſputation, regard muſt be paid—If we underſtand the word <hi>goſpel</hi> ſtrictly, as it is the <hi>formula</hi> of the Teſtament of Grace, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of mere promiſes, or an abſolute exhibition of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Chriſt; then, properly ſpeaking, it preſcribes nothing as duty; requires nothing; commands nothing: no, not even <hi>believe, truſt, hope in the Lord,</hi> and ſuch like. But it reports, declares, and ſignifies to us, what God in Chriſt promiſes; what he will do, and is about to perform. All preſcription of duty belongs to the <hi>law;</hi> as, after others, the venerable VOETIUS has

—This diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>goſpel,</hi> ſtrictly underſtood, appearing to be both juſt and important, is regarded in the following pages.</p>
               <p>Still further, however, to confirm and illuſtrate the neceſſity of keeping this diſtinction in view, it may be obſerved; that the <hi>law</hi> of God originated in his relation to men, as moral agents; and in his neceſſary dominion over them, of which it is a natural expreſſion: but the <hi>goſpel,</hi> in his royal, ſupreme prerogative; it being the reſult of his mere, ſovereign pleaſure. The <hi>former</hi> conſiders them as rational creatures that are bound to obey: the <hi>latter,</hi> as guilty creatures, who deſerve to ſuffer. The precepts of divine <hi>law</hi> are the language of ſtern autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: the doctrines of the <hi>goſpel</hi> are the voice of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending mercy. In <hi>that,</hi> juſtice unſheaths the ſword, and demands vengeance: in <hi>this,</hi> mercy exhibits pardon, and proclaims peace.

free pardon, opens the lips in gratitude and praiſe. God, in the <hi>law,</hi> addreſſes men agreeably to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal deſerts, their character, and their ſtate: in the <hi>goſpel,</hi> according to the riches of his own grace, the diverſity of their ſpiritual wants, and the vicarious work of Jeſus Chriſt. In divine <hi>law,</hi> the Moſt High exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits himſelf, as inveſted with abſolute dominion, as flaming with eternal purity, and as unchangeably abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of moral evil: in the <hi>goſpel,</hi> as <hi>condemning ſin in the fleſh</hi> of his own incarnate Son <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 3.</note>; as <hi>pardoning iniquity,</hi> in its greatly diverſified forms; as <hi>juſtifying the ungodly;</hi> as <hi>the</hi> JUST <hi>God and the</hi> SAVIOUR <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.

               <p>Hence it appears, that, in addreſſing ſinners, reſpecting their immortal concerns, neither the announcing of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor the enforcing of duty, is publiſhing the <hi>goſpel,</hi> properly ſo called.

                  </gap>, <hi>goſpel,</hi> denotes <hi>glad tidings.</hi> Such is its natural and proper, its delightful and emphatical meaning. It is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly employed, in the New Teſtament, with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reference to the grace of God, and the work of Chriſt, as they appear in the ſalvation of ſinners. Very ſeldom is it uſed by the Apoſtles, to denote the Chriſtian ſyſtem <hi>at large</hi>; but, with a few exceptions, in its grand,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031844_0022_0FEF1D00E54A91E0"/>
appropriate, and emphatical ſenſe, for that part of revealed truth which reſpects the bleſſings of ſalvation, by mere grace, through Jeſus Chriſt. Preaching the <hi>goſpel,</hi> therefore, is proclaiming <hi>glad tidings</hi> of ſalvation for the guilty, the unworthy, and the periſhing.</p>
               <p>Now, the terms <hi>law, precepts, commands, exhortations, threatenings,</hi> and others of a ſimilar kind, are expreſſions of an extremely different meaning, from that of the word <hi>goſpel.</hi> To aſſert, therefore, the authority of God in his laws, whether moral or poſitive; to deſcribe the awful ſituation of unregenerate ſinners? to warn them of their extreme danger; to inculcate, for ſuitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, an impartial regard to all the divine precepts; and to inſiſt, that an habitual want of obedience to the known commands of Chriſt, leaves a perſon deſtitute of evidence that he either loves him, or believes in him; though of <hi>eſſential importance,</hi> in the courſe of a public miniſtry, ought never to be conſidered, ſtrictly ſpeaking, as preaching <hi>the goſpel.</hi> It may be all true; it may be all proper; it may be all neceſſary in its place; and yet, not having the nature of <hi>glad tidings</hi> in it, be very different from the goſpel.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>goſpel,</hi> having long been commonly uſed without any determinate meaning; except, either a denoting the Chriſtian ſyſtem, or ſome doctrine, or precept, pertaining to Chriſtianity; and having become, by modern uſe, a kind of technical term in divinity; is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031844_0023_0FEF1D027617AFD0"/>
applied, in the moſt promiſcuous manner, to all ſorts of religious doctrine, that are conſidered by their abettorn as warranted in the ſacred writings. The public miniſter, and the private profeſſor, whatever their theological creed may be; are equally pleaſed with concluding, that the one preaches, and the other hears, the <hi>goſpel:</hi> though, frequently, neither of them have any fixed or diſtinct notion under the term; and even though their views of Chriſtianity render it nearly akin to Deiſm. It were to be wiſhed, therefore, either that, inſtead of the old Saxon word <hi>goſpel,</hi> the expreſſions <hi>glad tidings</hi> had been uſed in our vulgar tranſlation of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or that the former term were univerſally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in its original ſenſe, as denoting <hi>good news.</hi> For, were that the caſe, it is highly probable, there would be more knowledge, and leſs of ſelf-deception; relative to this momentous affair.</p>

               <p>What a wonderful exhibition is here, of ſovereign, free, and all ſufficient mercy! It extends to the moſt carnal and covetous, the moſt ungrateful and worthleſs of men. It precedes every good motion of their wills,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031844_0030_0FEF1D18D57B0DD0"/>
and every virtuous affection of their hearts. It waits, neither for any reformation of exterior conduct, nor the leaſt melioration of internal character. It finds them under the power of ſtrong diſaffection to God, and with the gain of extortion in their iniquitous hands. Fraught with every ſpiritual bleſſing for thoſe who deſerve to periſh, it pardons their crimſon crimes, and ſoftens their obdurate hearts. It gives a new turn to their wills, and elevates their affections to holy objects. It fills them with ſpiritual comfort, directs their feet into the way of righteouſneſs, and makes them new creatures.

His <hi>thoughts,</hi> relative to pardoning mercy, <hi>are not our thoughts;</hi> nor his <hi>ways,</hi> reſpecting that important affair, like <hi>our ways.</hi> Offences, comparable to a debt of only <hi>fifty pence,</hi> are often with difficulty forgiven by us; while he, through the blood of atonement, freely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terates a debt of <hi>ten thouſand talents.</hi> Among mortals, it is an inſtance of love extremely rare, that any one ſhould lay down his life, even for <hi>a good man,</hi> or a public benefactor; but God <hi>recommends his love to us, in that, while we were yet ſinners,</hi> and his enemies, he ſent his own Son <hi>to die for us.</hi> Far from regulating the manifeſtations of his compaſſion, according to the puny inſtances of human kindneſs; he not only bleſſes, but aſtoniſhes, by the diſplays of his matchleſs favour to ſinners.—Yes, <hi>God is</hi> LOVE; and, therefore, he <hi>delighteth in mercy.</hi> What, then, could be more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging; or what, by neceſſary conſequence, could more ſtrongly authoriſe, a guilty, ungodly, periſhing wretch, to rely on the Lord Jeſus, in whom this boundleſs mercy is manifeſted?</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:031844_0036_0FEF1D295B042B10"/>On this delightful and important ſubject, Dr. OWEN expreſſes himſelf as follows:
<q>This <hi>forgiveneſs that is with God,</hi> is ſuch as becomes him; ſuch as is ſuitable to his greatneſs, goodneſs, and all other excellencies of his nature; ſuch as that therein he will be <hi>known to be</hi> GOD. What he ſays concerning ſome of the works of his Providence, <hi>be ſtill, and know that I am</hi> GOD; may be much more ſaid concerning this great effect of his grace; <hi>Still your ſouls, and know that he is</hi> GOD. It is not like that narrow, difficult, halving, and manacled forgiveneſs that is found among men, when any ſuch thing is found amongſt them. But it is full, free, bottomleſs, boundleſs, abſolute; ſuch as becomes his nature and excellencies. It is, in a word, <hi>forgiveneſs that is with</hi> GOD, and by the exerciſe whereof he will be known ſo to be—God himſelf doth really ſeparate and diſtinguiſh <hi>his</hi> forgiveneſs from any thing that our thoughts and imaginations can reach unto; and that becauſe it is <hi>his,</hi> and like <hi>himſelf.</hi> It is an object for <hi>faith</hi> alone; which can reſt in that which it cannot comprehend. It is never ſafer, than when it is, as it were, overwhelmed with <hi>infiniteneſs</hi>— Were not forgiveneſs in God ſomewhat beyond what men could imagine, no fleſh could be ſaved. This himſelf expreſſeth, Iſaiah lv. 7, 8, 9. They are, as is plain in the context, <hi>thoughts of forgiveneſs,</hi> and <hi>ways of pardon,</hi> whereof he ſpeaks. Theſe, our apprehenſions come ſhort of: we know little, or nothing, of the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031844_0037_0FEF1D2D9B7AD5F8"/>
                     <hi>infinite largeneſs of his heart</hi> in this matter. He that he ſpeaks of, is an <hi>impiouſly wicked man,</hi> and <hi>a man of deceit,</hi> and perverſe wickedneſs. He whoſe deſign and courſe is nothing but a lie, ſin, and iniquity. Such an one as we would have little or no hopes of; that we would ſcarce think it worth our while to deal withal about a hopeleſs converſion; or can ſcarce find in our hearts <hi>to pray for him</hi>; but are ready to give him up, as one profligate and deſparate. But let him turn to the Lord, and he ſhall obtain <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi> But how can this be? Is it poſſible there can be mercy for ſuch an one? Yes; for the Lord <hi>will multiply to pardon.</hi> He hath forgiveneſs with him to outdo all the multiplied ſins of any that turn unto him, and ſeek for it. But this is very hard, very difficult for us to apprehend. This is not the way and manner of men: we deal not thus with profligate offenders againſt us. True, ſaith God: but <hi>your ways are not my ways.</hi> I do not act in this manner like unto you; nor as you are accuſtomed to do—For the moſt part, when we come to deal with God about forgiveneſs, we hang in every briar of diſputing, quarrelſome unbelief. This or that circumſtance, or aggravation; this or that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled particular, bereaves us of our confidence. Want of due conſideration of Him with whom we have to do, meaſuring Him by that line of our own imaginations, bringing Him down to <hi>our thoughts</hi> and <hi>our ways,</hi> is the cauſe of all our diſquietments.

we find it hard to forgive our <hi>pence,</hi> we think he cannot forgive <hi>talents.</hi> But he hath provided to obviate ſuch thoughts in us, (Hoſea xi. 9.) <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of my wrath; I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim;</hi> FOR I AM GOD, AND NOT MAN. Our ſatisfaction in this matter, is to be taken from his <hi>nature.</hi> Were He a <hi>man,</hi> or as the ſons of men, it were impoſſible that, upon ſuch and ſo many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he ſhould turn away from the fierceneſs of his anger. But he is God. This gives an <hi>infiniteneſs,</hi> and an inconceivable <hi>boundleſſneſs,</hi> to the forgiveneſs that is with him; and exalts it above all our thoughts and ways<note n="*" place="bottom">On the Hundred and Thirtieth Pſalm, <hi>p. 220, 221, 222.</hi>

               <p>Thus Mr. CHARNOCK, with reference to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
<q>That fear that Adam had, when, frighted at the voice of God, he hid himſelf among the trees of the garden, hath remained in part with his poſterity, when they reflect upon their crimes. We meaſure the nature of God by the qualities of our own; and becauſe we are not forward to remit men's offences againſt us, we are apt to imagine that God hath not clemency enough to pardon the faults committed againſt him. Hence it is that perſons, deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under a ſenſe of the curſes of the law, are ready to lick up the duſt under the feet of Chriſt, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031844_0039_0FEF1D321B037760"/>
an abſolute neceſſity of him, are with much ado brought to believe. Though the deſign of God in ſetting out Chriſt for a propitiation be declared to them, the ſufficiency of his merit, the acceptation of it by God, the fruits others have found of it, that the deſign of Chriſt's coming was to eaſe thoſe in that condition; yet they are hardly induced to lay aſide thoſe jealouſies they have of God—When men are ſoundly convinced of the nature and evil of ſin, they become vile in their own eyes. Their ſin galls them; the law terrifies them; the notions of God's juſtice are awakened in them, and lie cloſe to them. They are ſenſible of the degenerateneſs and rebellion of their nature: they think God cannot but hate them, and they expect from him only the ſeverity of a judge: and when evangelical mercy is declared, it ſeems incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to them, becauſe it exceeds their nature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. The greatneſs of the mercy proffered makes them ſtagger: they believe not God to be ſo merciful, becauſe they cannot be ſo; (for in all conditions of men, it is natural to limit God according to their own petty dimenſions; and not elevate their thoughts to his, but judge of his thoughts by theirs:) and although his mercy is above the mercy of a creature, we are apt to think his nature as incapable of a largeneſs as our own. Since man has become vain in his imaginations, he is apt to meaſure divine things according to thoſe principles which are in his own fancy. Hence God

               <p>It is hence apparent, that God, in the beſtowment of bleſſings on the children of men, is not influenced by the purity of their hearts, the piety of their lives, or the worthineſs of their characters; but by a regard to his own eternal perfection; to the ſupreme excellence of his own revealed Name; and to the everlaſting honour of his own immenſe goodneſs. No: the bleſſings of ſalvation, on whomſoever conferred, are never to be conſidered as diſtinguiſhing worth, and rewarding merit; but as deſigned to diſplay the riches of divine mercy, and the glory of the divine character, by relieving the wretched, and ſaving the unworthy.—Now, the Divine Majeſty having revealed himſelf as exerciſing mercy, and granting ſpiritual bleſſings, for his <hi>own ſake;</hi> the polluted, ungodly, and periſhing ſinner is completely warranted to rely on that mercy, as manifeſted in the atonement, for pardon, acceptance, and peace, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of every other conſideration. This perfectly ſuits, not only the apoſtate ſtate of man, but the peerleſs majeſty of God. For as he is poſſeſſed of boundleſs Being; as all creatures received their exiſtence from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031844_0050_0FEF1D545DBBF428"/>
his power, and are entirely dependent on his pleaſure; and as the ſum total of all created exiſtence is but an atom, in compariſon with him; ſo he acts perfectly agreeable to his own character, in making himſelf the ultimate end of his whole conduct, and in all things conſulting his own glory.</p>
               <p>The paſſages here produced, being all extracted from the Old Teſtament, are quite ſuitable to that revelation which God made of himſelf under the Jewiſh Oeconomy; and to the import of his name JEHOVAH, by which he made himſelf known to the choſen tribes. For that Name was, in a peculiar manner, <hi>his</hi> OWN <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. vi. 2, 3. Pſalm lxxxiii. 18.</note>: by which he was diſtinguiſhed, as the only Object of Iſrael's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and as their King, from all the Deities and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of the ancient Heathens. This moſt Auguſt Name, together with its glorious import, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to Moſes in the moſt ſolemn and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiii. 18, 19. xxxiv. 5—8.</note>: to which Name, and its comprehenſive ſignificancy, reference is apparently had in many of the texts juſt adduced.

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xviii. 10.</note>, or an impregnable fortreſs, for the encouragement and confidence which they derived from it.

                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſ. ix. 10.</note>.—Now, if the revealed character of God, under the Old Oeconomy, was preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with encouragement for miſerable ſinners to rely on his mercy for pardon and ſalvation; it cannot be ſuppoſed that evangelical truth, under the Chriſtian ſyſtem, is leſs favourable to the cauſe of human hope.— Relative to the name JEHOVAH, Dr. OWEN ſays:

the perſonal dignity of Chriſt, as <hi>the Son of God;</hi> on the unchangeable intereſt he had in his Father's love; and on the Father delivering him up to an execrable death for mere ſinners; we ceaſe to wonder that, with Him, he freely beſtows all ſpiritual bleſſings, without any regard to worthineſs in them on whom they are conferred.

               <p>This oppoſition between divine mercy, and human works; the grace of God, and the worthineſs of man; is very obſervable, and extremely important. For the contraſted view that is here given of theſe particulars, is far from being an incidental thing. We do not find it, in the Apoſtolic Writings, once or twice only; and that with reference to articles of comparatively ſmall conſequence; but, in <hi>many</hi> places, in an <hi>argumentative</hi> manner, and relative to bleſſings of the <hi>higheſt</hi> moment. The ſentiment, therefore, which is conveyed by this contraſted form of expreſſion, is to be conſidered as a <hi>grand principle</hi> of the apoſtolic doctrine; and this mode of ſpeaking, as the current language of Inſpiration, relative to thoſe capital bleſſings, election, converſion, pardon, and juſtification.</p>
               <p>Now, reſpecting the objects of God's eternal choice, their converſion to Chriſt, their complete forgiveneſs, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031844_0055_0FEF1D61DB0EC9D0"/>
their perfect acceptance with the Moſt Holy; the reaſonings of Paul, where this kind of language is uſed, plainly ſhow, that his deſign was entirely to exclude, not only all <hi>merit</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but all <hi>comparative</hi> worthineſs. Yes, he intended to prove, that God, in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe bleſſings, has not the leaſt regard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal holineſs, or moral worth, in the favoured objects of his kindneſs; but conſiders them as equally unworthy with thoſe who finally periſh. Nay, in the laſt of theſe inſtructive paſſages the Apoſtle proves, profeſſedly and in a formal manner, that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> or divine favour and comparative human worthineſs, are ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one to another, that it is impoſſible for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in procuring the ſame bleſſings. So that whoſoever conſiders himſelf as diſtinguiſhed from others, by virtuous habits or pious performances, and thence derives encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to look for acceptance with God through the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, confounds the moſt oppoſite ideas relating to an affair of the higheſt moment; rejects the determination of Paul; and muſt be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſappointed.—I ſaid, COMPARATIVE <hi>human wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs:</hi> for that is all which the nature of the caſe admits. Becauſe <hi>worthineſs</hi> of divine bleſſings, in a ſtrict, legal, abſolute ſenſe, and eſpecially as to <hi>apoſtate</hi> creatures, is impoſſible. Conſequently, the goſpel, in which this contraſt between grace and works is thus frequently formed, muſt be conſidered as authoriſing the ungodly to believe in Jeſus.</p>

believe in our Almighty Saviour. For it is not eaſy to conceive of more flagitious characters, than ſome of thoſe that are here ſpecified. Yet they were encouraged to believe in Jeſus.

               <p>As, in that moſt wonderful of all works, REDEMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, the deſign of God was to manifeſt, illuſtrate, glorify, his own grace; as the glad tidings of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt reveal that grace, in connection with its deſign; and as no doctrine deſerves the name of <hi>goſpel,</hi> which does not exhibit the grace of God, as abounding, reigning, glorious—worthy of everlaſting admiration and praiſe; the genuine goſpel muſt be conſidered as encouraging, inviting, warranting, the moſt ungodly to believe in Jeſus. For divine grace, in election, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, regeneration, and juſtification, has no concern with any beſides the abſolutely unworthy. To this its very nature, and the deſign of God in diſpenſing the bleſſings proceeding from it, are completely adapted. <hi>Its very nature.</hi> For it is not merely <hi>grace,</hi> though as ſuch it muſt be ſovereign; but it is grace with a GLORY around it—<hi>The</hi> GLORY <hi>of his grace,</hi> is the language of Paul.

               <p>'If there be any pardon with God,' ſays Dr. OWEN,
<q>it is ſuch as becomes him to give. When he pardons, he will <hi>abundantly pardon.</hi> Go with your <hi>half</hi>-forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, limited, conditional pardons, with reſerves and limitations unto the ſons of men: it may be, it may become them; it is like themſelves. That of God is abſolute and perfect; before which our ſins are as a cloud before the Eaſt wind, and the riſing ſun. Hence he is ſaid to do this work, with his <hi>whole heart</hi> and with his <hi>whole ſoul</hi>—This forgiveneſs is in or with God, not only ſo as that we may apply ourſelves unto it, if we will, for which he will not be offended with us; but ſo, alſo, as that he hath placed his <hi>great glory</hi> in the declaration and communication of it: nor can we honour him more, than by coming to him to be made partakers of it, and ſo to receive it from him. For the moſt part, we are, as it were, ready, rather to <hi>ſteal</hi> forgiveneſs from God, than to receive from him, as one that gives it freely and largely. We take it up, and lay it down, as though we would be
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031844_0066_0FEF1D86959A9808"/>
glad to have it, ſo God did not, as it were, <hi>ſee</hi> us take it: for we are afraid he is not <hi>willing</hi> we ſhould have it indeed. We would ſteal this fire from heaven, and have a ſhare in God's treaſures and riches, almoſt without his conſent. At leaſt, we think we have it from him <hi>aegre,</hi> with much difficulty; that it is rarely given, and ſcarcely obtained. That he gives it out with a kind of <hi>unwilling willingneſs</hi>; as we ſometimes give alms without cheerfulneſs: and that he looſeth ſo much by us, as he giveth out in pardon. We are apt to think, that <hi>we are very willing</hi> to have forgiveneſs; but that <hi>God is unwilling</hi> to beſtow it; and that, becauſe he ſeems to be a looſer by it, and to forego the <hi>glory of inflicting puniſhment</hi> for our ſins; which, of all things, we ſuppoſe, he is moſt loth to part withal. And this is the very nature of <hi>unbelief.</hi> But, indeed, things are quite otherwiſe. He hath, in this matter, through the Lord Chriſt, ordered all things, in his dealings with ſinners, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> His deſign, in the whole myſtery of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is to make his <hi>grace glorious,</hi> or to <hi>exalt</hi> pardoning mercy. The great fruit and product of his grace is <hi>forgiveneſs</hi>; the forgiveneſs of ſinners. This God will render himſelf <hi>glorious</hi> in, and by. All the praiſe, glory, and worſhip, that he deſigns from any in this world, is to redound unto him by the way of this grace, as we have proved at large before<note n="*" place="bottom">On the Hundred and Thirtieth Pſalm, <hi>p. 225, 226.</hi>

thoſe firſt miniſters of Chriſt were not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but required, as Providence gave opportunity, to proclaim the glad tidings wherever they came, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception of nation, of rank, or of character.

                  <q>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened. Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools; and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beaſts, and creeping things.

As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God.

<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031844_0072_0FEF1D95A50F9C20"/>
as bearing characters the moſt deteſtable; and as being in a ſtate the moſt awful. Yet this deſcription comes from the hand of one, whoſe heart was fraught with benevolence to his own ſpecies, eſpecially to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; and from a pencil which could not give an exaggerated repreſentation. Of ſuch characters, in the eſtimate of Heaven, did the nations conſiſt, when the Apoſtles, as miniſters of divine truth, received their high commiſſion. Yes, to a world thus deſperately degenerate, and thus lying in wickedneſs, were thoſe Ambaſſadors of Chriſt ſent with tidings of ſalvation. To this abominably wicked world they exhibited the crucified Jeſus; preaching pardon, and announcing peace, through his atoning blood. For, if pardon be not publiſhed, if peace be not proclaimed in the name of Jeſus, the goſpel, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is not preached. As, therefore, it is hard to conceive of characters more hateful, of perſons more criminal, or of a ſtate more awful, (except in the caſe of judicial blindneſs, or of blaſphemy againſt the Holy Spirit;) than thoſe here deſcribed; the miniſters of Chriſt, if they would act agreeably to our Lord's commiſſion, and to the apoſtolic pattern, muſt proclaim glad tidings to the vileſt of men.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II. NO DEGREE OF HOLINESS PREVIOUSLY NECESSARY, TO WARRANT OUR BELIEVING IN JESUS CHRIST.</head>
               <p>WHEN a ſinner is burdened with guilt, and filled with apprehenſions of eternal ruin, his language is, '<hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> or, <hi>How ſhall I eſcape the wrath to come?</hi> Being ignorant of that righteouſneſs which the goſpel reveals for the juſtification of the ungodly, he labours to obtain acceptance with God by his own efforts: till, being better acquainted with the purity of the law, the holineſs of God, and the corruption of his own heart, he deſpairs of being juſtified by the works of the law.</p>
               <p>To a perſon thus convinced of ſin, and apprehenſive of danger, one ſhould ſuppoſe the glad tidings of ſovereign grace, and the doctrine of complete ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt for the chief of ſinners, would be embraced with all poſſible readineſs. Experience and obſervation prove, however, that awakened ſinners are frequently backward to receive encouragement from the glorious goſpel. This ariſes, not from any defect in the grace it proclaims, or in the ſalvation it brings; not becauſe
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031844_0079_0FEF1DAD463A44D0"/>
the alarmed ſinner is under any neceſſity, or in any diſtreſs, for which it does not reveal complete relief; but becauſe he does not behold the glory of that grace which reigns triumphantly in it, and the deſign of God in making the rich proviſion. He wants to find himſelf ſome way <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from others, as a proper object of mercy, by holy tempers and ſanctified affections. This is his grand embarraſſment. In other words he conſiders himſelf as not ſufficiently <hi>humbled,</hi> under a ſenſe of ſin; as not having a ſuitable <hi>ahhorrence</hi> of it; and as not poſſeſſing thoſe <hi>fervent breathings</hi> after holineſs, which, as he ſuppoſes, are neceſſary before he can be warranted to believe in Jeſus, with a well grounded hope of ſucceſs <note n="*" place="bottom">See my <hi>Reign of Grace,</hi> Chap. iv. p. 84, 85. Edit. 4th.</note>—Thus the ſinner, though oppreſſed with guilt, and earneſtly deſirous of ſalvation, oppoſes the deſigns of divine grace, by ardently ſeeking for holy qualifications, and perſonal worthineſs, as prerequiſite to faith in Jeſus Chriſt! But, that no degree of holineſs is previouſly neceſſary, to warrant our believing in the Lord Redeemer, I ſhall in the following paragraphs endeavour to prove.</p>
               <p>Under what conſideration, then, is any degree of holineſs in the heart of a ſinner neceſſary, before he believe in Jeſus? As conſtituting <hi>part</hi> of his juſtifying rigteouſneſs? This cannot be, without admitting, that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031844_0080_0FEF1DB2FAC8B0D8"/>
acceptance with God is, in ſome degree, by our own righteouſneſs.—As the <hi>ſtipulated condition</hi> of acceptance with Chriſt? If ſo, a ſinner, on performing that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may claim Chriſt, and all ſpiritual bleſſings in him, as matter of pactitional debt.
<q>For, as Dr. OWEN ſays, where one thing is the condition of another, that other thing muſt follow the fulfilling of that condition: otherwiſe the condition of it, it is not <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification,</hi> Chap. I. p. 124. Glaſgow, 1760.</note>.</q>
Yes, whether the condition preſcribed be greater or leſs, the punctual performance of it muſt give a legal title to all the bleſſings annexed to that condition: which, in the caſe before us, would be to obtain juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the works of the law.—As the qualification for obtaining an <hi>intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> or a participation of his benefits? But, neceſſary as a pious turn of heart is, to evince that we <hi>are</hi> partakers of Chriſt; it is not either an holy diſpoſition, or faith itſelf, by which we <hi>obtain</hi> an intereſt in the bleſſings of our Lord's media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial work. No; that exalted privilege is not <hi>obtained</hi> by us, but <hi>freely granted</hi> of God, in the decree of election <note n="†" place="bottom">John xvii. 2, 6, 9, 11, 24. Eph. i. 3—7.</note>. For the ſubſtitution of Chriſt, and the whole of his vicarious work, very ſtrongly imply, that all the elect were intereſted in him <hi>before</hi> they poſſeſſed either faith, or holineſs. Nay, genuine faith, and real ſanctity, ought ever to be conſidered, not as the <hi>cauſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:031844_0081_0FEF1DB5E12E8990"/>
but as the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>evidences,</hi> of that intereſt. <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep—He hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John x. 26. Eph. i. 4.</note>. Beſides, were any degree of holineſs the requiſite quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for an intereſt in Chriſt, it muſt be equally ſo reſpecting juſtification by him: which, again, brings us us to the works of the law, as being remotely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of our juſtification before God.—As a <hi>ſtimulus,</hi> urging an application to Jeſus Chriſt? But, friendly as every holy diſpoſition in the heart of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner is, to communion with Chriſt, and to general happineſs; no principal of ſanctity can, with propriety, be conſidered as a requiſite motive to our firſt believing in him. Becauſe holineſs, in the whole of its nature, is as manifeſtly ſpiritual health, as depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and guilt are moral diſeaſe <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. ciii. 3. Iſa. liii. 5. Pſ. vi. 24. 1 Pet. ii. 24. Hoſea xiv. 4.</note>: and every ſinner, in his firſt believing on Chriſt, regards him as the great Phyſician—as <hi>the Lord that healeth</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. ix. 12. Mark ii. 17. Luke v. 31. Exod. xv. 26.</note>. But is it uſual for either health, or the commencement of it, rather than diſeaſe, and the danger attending, to excite an ardent deſire after a ſkilful and compaſſionate phyſician? —As <hi>characteriſing</hi> the only perſons to whom, by divine authority, the goſpel can be addreſſed? Then the Apoſtles muſt be conſidered as having preached ſalvation
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031844_0082_0FEF1DB91ABD90D8"/>
in the name of Jeſus, to the <hi>church</hi> only; not at all to the <hi>world:</hi> whereas their commiſſion was, as we have already ſeen, <hi>Proclaim the glad tidings to</hi> EVERY CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE. —As neceſſary to preſerve the ſinner, after he believes in Jeſus, from <hi>abuſing</hi> revealed mercy? But, as I perceive no ſcriptural evidence of any one really believing in Chriſt, and yet, in the general courſe of his conduct, <hi>abuſing</hi> divine mercy; ſo we have the moſt expreſs, infallible information, that <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation teaches to deny ungodlineſs</hi>; that <hi>faith</hi> in Jeſus <hi>works by love</hi> to God and man; that <hi>faith without works is dead,</hi> and no better than that of devils.—But let us examine the ſubject more at large.</p>
               <p>Every holy diſpoſition is, to a certain degree, <hi>true holineſs.</hi> On ſuppoſition, therefore, that it be neceſſary for a ſinner to poſſeſs any meaſure of real ſanctity, in order to warrant his reliance on Chriſt; it may be juſtly demanded, What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mortal ſhall determine the requiſite <hi>quantum?</hi> Or who ſhall ſay, <hi>Thus much is neceſſary, and no more?</hi> Nor, conſiſtently with the doctrine of juſtification entirely by an imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and merely in a way of grace, is it eaſy to ſay, as appears by the preceding induction of particulars, for what purpoſe it can be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>An holy diſpoſition, in any caſe, or in the leaſt degree, is a diſpoſition to <hi>univerſal and perfect holineſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:031844_0083_0FEF1DBAA6D7D900"/>
For as there cannot be the leaſt holineſs, where there is no ſincere affection for God; ſo, all holineſs radically conſiſts in love to him, as revealed in Jeſus Chriſt. Conſequently, if the contrary of our poſition be true, no ſinner can warrantably believe in Jeſus, until he be cordially diſpoſed to perform all the divine precepts, and have the root of perfect holineſs in him. But, were any miniſter of the word, when ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt as the Saviour of ſinners, expreſsly to ſay;
<q>You, and you <hi>only,</hi> who are heartily diſpoſed perfectly to keep the law, are warranted to believe in Chriſt;</q>
it would, I preſume, be eſteemed a ſtrange kind of goſpel, and little ſhort of an inſult on the diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>As we cannot conceive of holineſs exiſting in any creature, that is entirely deſtitute of love to God; nor of God being loved by any creature, that does not know him; ſo, neither will the Scriptures permit us to conclude, that any of Adam's degenerate offspring ever knew and loved the true God, <hi>except as revealed in the Mediator.</hi> Nor will the Bible warrant our ſuppoſing, that ſinners ever love the Supreme; or that they cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally approve the true character of God; before they believe in Chriſt, as exhibited in the goſpel. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with Thee, that thou mayeſt be feared—We love Him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> For though he deſerve the profoundeſt reverence, and the warmeſt
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031844_0084_0FEF1DBC32FD9AA8"/>
affection, for what he is in himſelf; it is as manifeſting his glory in Jeſus Chriſt, that we either ſincerely love, or truly revere him.</p>
               <p>If, by an awakened ſinner, it be admitted as a fact, and believed as a doctrine, that no one is authoriſed to depend on Chriſt for pardon and peace, until poſſeſſed of an holy diſpoſition; he muſt neceſſarily be more ſolicitous to find evidence of that important requiſite exiſting in his heart, than to underſtand and believe what the goſpel ſays concerning Chriſt. For ſuch a perſuaſion muſt unavoidably direct his attention to the virtuous inclinations he deſires to feel, and the righteous works he wiſhes to perform; rather than to the riches of revealed mercy, and to the all ſufficiency of the Redeemer's work. This mode of proceeding muſt, therefore, while it foſters his legal pride, embarraſs his pained conſcience: which effects are equally foreign from the genius of evangelical doctrine, and from the nature of true faith.</p>
               <p>Our Lord, not being the Saviour of man, as <hi>man;</hi> or of man, as <hi>holy</hi>; but of man, as <hi>depraved, guilty,</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi>; it apparently follows, from the nature of the caſe, that if Chriſt, under his graciouſly ſaving character, ever be regarded at all, in a way of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the ſinner muſt, in his firſt application to him, conſider himſelf as totally baſe and worthleſs. But,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031844_0085_0FEF1DC1D926A8E0"/>
did he poſſeſs the leaſt degree of true ſanctity, that would be a falſe eſtimate of his own character. For holineſs is no other than intellectual <hi>beauty,</hi> moral <hi>worth,</hi> and ſpiritual <hi>excellence.</hi> It is that by which angels are principally diſtinguiſhed from devils: and, conſequently, any degree of it muſt conſtitute a moſt important differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in ſtate and character, between them that poſſeſs it, and thoſe who are entirely unholy.</p>
               <p>According to the ſentiment here oppoſed, no one is authoriſed to believe in Jeſus, until he is <hi>born of God:</hi> for ſuch only, have any degree of real holineſs. Be the conſcience of a ſinner, therefore, ever ſo much burdened with guilt, he muſt have ſome evidence of his being <hi>a new creature,</hi> before he can conſider the goſpel as exhibiting any relief, or as revealing a Saviour in whom he may confide. Conſequently, if, while poſſeſſed of theſe views, and acting conſiſtently with them, he were to believe in Jeſus; it muſt be under the notion of his being <hi>already</hi> a child of God, and of his poſſeſſing true holineſs.— But, were any man, profeſſing faith in Chriſt, expreſsly to declare,
<q>That it was under the notion of his previouſly poſſeſſing <hi>a new heart,</hi> or a ſincere love to holineſs, that he firſt believed in Jeſus Chriſt;</q>
even though his exterior conduct were ever ſo regular, many of thoſe who deny the poſition for which I plead, would be ready to ſuſpect him of ſelfde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For they, I preſume, would be very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031844_0086_0FEF1DC50F2E8150"/>
that his notions were ſelfrighteous, and his hope deluſive. But if, previous to believing in Chriſt, and in order to warrant a dependence upon him, there muſt be an holy turn of heart; why ſhould the perſon ſuppoſed fall under a ſuſpicion ſo harſh? If it be a fact, that none but thoſe who are previouſly born of God, and ſincerely diſpoſed to keep his commands, are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, by the goſpel, to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; it cannot be either unlawful, or improper, from them, under that <hi>very character and conſideration,</hi> to place their firſt reliance upon him. Becauſe it is acting conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, by applying the principle to practice. Whereas, for perſons to maintain, that ſome degree of holineſs is previouſly neceſſary to warrant our believing in Chriſt; who, nevertheleſs, in their firſt application to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves as in danger of eternal ruin, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unworthy, are inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>The principle againſt which I contend implies, that ſinners muſt be <hi>cordially reconciled</hi> to the true character of God, as revealed in the Mediator, before they rely on Chriſt, and before they believe the goſpel. But this is contrary to the apoſtolic doctrine. For, as it is by the goſpel only, that the true character of God is made known to men; ſo the grand mean of reconciling the hearts of ſinners to God, is the doctrine of our Lord's vicarious work. This we are taught, by the following admirable paſſage: <hi>All things are of God, who
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031844_0087_0FEF1DC695E1C6B0"/>
hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation: To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech</hi>

for, that ſuch is the ſtate of each regenerate perſon—of every one diſtinguiſhed and adorned by true holineſs, is plain from the tenour of divine Revelation. To be a child of God, by regeneration; to have pious affection toward God, and a cordial inclination to keep his commands; are, in the eſtimate of Scripture, evidences of a ſafe ſtate, and aſcertain everlaſting felicity to all that are ſo diſtinguiſhed <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John iii. 1.2.</note>.

—Now, that <hi>delight</hi> in the law of God, rightly underſtood; a <hi>true hatred</hi> of ſin, and <hi>real penitence,</hi> are evidences of regeneration, and of genuine holineſs, will ſcarcely be denied. It is equally clear, admitting the doctrine of final perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that perſons of ſuch a character are ſafe, as to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031844_0091_0FEF1DD2B19E0E90"/>
eternity: and yet, according to our Author, ſuch muſt every one be, before he may dare to believe in Jeſus! —Afterwards, however, which proves my aſſertion, the very ſame Gentleman reaſons in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<q>That men are <hi>naturally deſtitute of every degree</hi> of that which has the nature of true holineſs, is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Scripture; in that the promiſes of ſalvation are every where made to them who exerciſe the <hi>leaſt degree</hi> of this, or of that which is oppoſite to ſin: and ſuch have the character of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> perſons, in diſtinction from others. Now, if the <hi>leaſt degree</hi> of goodneſs intitles a man to ſalvation, and denominates him <hi>a good man</hi>; then all men are naturally, wholly, without any degree of this, and ſo wholly corrupt; for all men are repreſented as naturally in a ſtate of condemnation, and wholly deſtitute of that which is neceſſary in order to their ſalvation <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. S. HOPKINS'S <hi>Two Diſcourſes,</hi> p. 23, 24, 106. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington, 1793.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Were any meaſure of holineſs previouſly neceſſary, to warrant our believing in Jeſus Chriſt; pardon of ſin, and peace with our offended Sovereign, ſhould be exhibited in a goſpel miniſtry, as before obſerved, to none but thoſe who are <hi>already born of God:</hi> becauſe none but they poſſeſs the leaſt degree of genuine ſanctity. Nay, the goſpel ſhould be preached to regenerate perſons, <hi>as</hi> ſuch; no other being authoriſed to rely on Jeſus, as revealed in
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031844_0092_0FEF1DD87427E9D8"/>
in it. But, would this anſwer the gracious deſigns of our Lord's command, <hi>Preach the goſpel to every creature?</hi> Preaching the goſpel is, as already obſerved, <hi>proclaiming glad tidings</hi> to guilty, depraved, and ruined creatures— tidings of pardon, of peace, and of ſalvation, through Jeſus Chriſt. Preaching the goſpel, is preaching Chriſt himſelf, or bearing a public teſtimony to his gracious gracious character, and perfect work. Preaching the goſpel, therefore, is proclaiming ſalvation by ſovereign grace—is exhibiting Jeſus, not as willing to ſupply the deficiencies in <hi>upright</hi> characters; nor, merely, as grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſtance to perſons <hi>already</hi> in the way to heaven; but, as the only, the all ſufficient, the abſolutely free Saviour of the condemned, the worthleſs, the loſt.</p>
               <p>Again: Did the Apoſtles preach Jeſus Chriſt, or did they proclaim pardon and peace through his blood, to thoſe only whom they conſidered as <hi>really penitent,</hi> and as having an <hi>holy turn</hi> of heart? The reverſe is a fact: for, as we have before ſeen, they were commiſſioned to proclaim glad tidings to the profligate, impious, and wicked world. Thoſe, however, who are truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and poſſeſſed of real holineſs, are not <hi>of the world,</hi> but <hi>of God;</hi> being manifeſtly called out of their natural ſtate.—When Paul was preaching to his Jewiſh brethren, of whom he had a painful ſuſpicion that, while they wondered at his teſtimony, they would reject it and periſh in their unbelief—even thoſe Jews, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031844_0093_0FEF1DDB6AF3A6B8"/>
are ſaid to be <hi>filled with envy,</hi> to <hi>contradict and blaſpheme;</hi> his language was, <hi>Be it known unto</hi> YOU <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, men and brethren, that through this</hi> illuſtrious Jeſus <hi>is preached unto</hi> YOU <hi>the forgiveneſs of ſins: and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 50.</note>. Now, as it would be a dangerous miſtake to ſuppoſe, that Paul declared the ſins of thoſe ungodly Jews to be <hi>already</hi> forgiven, and their perſons juſtified; ſo it would be inconſiſtent with the nature of his gracious declaration to imagine, that he did not conſider them as authoriſed, by his infallible teſtimony, immediately to believe in Chriſt for pardon and acceptance with God.—I will add, is it ſuppoſable that Paul and Silas conſidered the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian jailor as born of God, and poſſeſſed of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when, in anſwer to his important query, they ſaid; <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved?</hi> There is not, that I perceive, the leaſt reaſon for any ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that kind<note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Reign of grace,</hi> Chap. V.</note>.</p>
               <p>As it was under the character of a <hi>prieſt,</hi> that Chriſt expiated guilt, and made reconciliation; ſo, when a ſinner firſt applies to him, though it be for the bleſſings of ſalvation in general, yet his eye is principally fixed on pardon and peace. Juſtifying faith, ſays Dr. OWEN,
<q>reſpecteth Chriſt in his <hi>prieſtly</hi> office alone, as he was the

<q>When the venom of ſin begins to work in the conſcience, and the thunder of the law alarms it to judgment, and the puniſhment due to ſin is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the horrors of it; the queſtion immediately is, Whether there be any remedy, and where? How forgiveneſs of ſin is to be attained? The only remedy is propoſed in Chriſt, and Chriſt <hi>as a ſacrifice.</hi> It is not Chriſt riſen, or aſcended, or exalted: not Chriſt, only as the Son of God, or the head of angels: not Chriſt, as the creator of the world, or by whom all things conſiſt: but Chriſt, as anſwering the terms of the firſt Covenant; as diſarming juſtice; and this he did, as a <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> By this he bore the curſe; by this he broke down the partition wall; by this he joined apoſtate man and an offended God. This is that true faith pitcheth on, daily revolves, and daily applies to. This is the <hi>firſt</hi> object of the ſoul, Chriſt <hi>made ſin;</hi> Chriſt <hi>bearing the puniſhment</hi>; Chriſt <hi>ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> in the room of the offender—This is that which pacifies God; and only that which pacifies God can pacify the Conſcience <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:031844_0095_0FEF1DE175654408"/>Is it congruous, then, to ſuppoſe, that a criminal, when ſeeking pardon of ſin and peace for his conſcience, muſt neceſſarily apply for them under the notion of his previouſly poſſeſſing a pious turn of heart? Yet, whoever is perſuaded, that any degree of holineſs is abſolutely neceſſary to warrant his believing in Jeſus, cannot but regard the atonement, if, conſiſtently with his principles, he ever do regard it, under the notion of his being poſſeſſed of the requiſite ſanctity.—Were the atonement of Chriſt entirely rejected, and were he revealed as willing to aſſiſt only the weak, but well diſpoſed, in <hi>ſaving themſelves</hi>; then, indeed, it might be eſteemed rational to conclude, that whoever is authoriſed to depend on him for help, muſt be well qualified, by holy inclinations and ſtrenuous exertions. But, for thoſe who conſider the death of Chriſt as vicarious and expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; or as conſtituting the only ground of hope for pardon and peace; to maintain, the neceſſity of holineſs as warranting our dependence on that very death, is extremely inconſiſtent. For, according to the ſentiment oppoſed, though the death of Jeſus be, confeſſedly, an <hi>atonement</hi>; and though, by the very nature of the caſe, it could be intended for <hi>none</hi> but the guilty; yet, before any of that criminal character be permitted to regard it with affiance, they muſt be <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As no one can be thoroughly perſuaded, that, in order to faith in Chriſt for pardon and acceptance, an holy
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031844_0096_0FEF1DE4A3CD19A0"/>
diſpoſition is abſolutely neceſſary, without being anxiouſly concerned to obtain the important requiſite; ſo, no ſooner does he conſider himſelf as poſſeſſing that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, than it becomes to him <hi>the primary ſource of peace.</hi> Yes, his firſt encouragement and hope ariſe,—not from the atonement of Chriſt; not from revealed mercy; nor from the teſtimony of God concerning his incarnate Son, and the work performed by him;—but, from the <hi>change</hi> which has taken place in his own heart; from the <hi>holy tendency</hi> of his will; from the <hi>difference</hi> which ſubſiſts between himſelf and others, that are altogether unworthy. Conſcious that ſome degree of moral worth attaches to his character, and conſidering this as previouſly neceſſary to warrant a ſinner's dependence on Chriſt; his firſt hope is derived, not from divine <hi>grace,</hi> as revealed in the <hi>goſpel;</hi> but from his own <hi>holineſs,</hi> as required by the LAW: which is directly contrary to the grand prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of evangelical truth.</p>
               <p>Our Lord ſays, <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up: that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John iii. 14, 15.</note>. Now here, it is evident, our divine Inſtructor teaches us to conſider the dying ſtate of the Iſraelites, that were bitten by the fiery ſerpents, as an emblem of our periſhing condition by ſin: the brazen ſerpent, elevated
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031844_0097_0FEF1E213765DE98"/>
on a pole, as a type of himſelf expiring on the croſs: the looking of wounded Iſraelites to the brazen ſerpent, as emblematical of condemned ſinners depending on his own death; and the perfect recovery obtained, by viewing the artificial ſerpent, as emblematical of that ſalvation which is through faith in his atoning blood. To this, perhaps, there may be an alluſion, when Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah ſays; <hi>Look unto</hi> ME, <hi>and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xlv. 22. Faith in Chriſt crucified, ſays Dr. OWEN, is

                  </note>. We may infer, however, that as the wounded Iſraelites, without any preparative, except a ſenſe of danger be ſo denominated, were authoriſed to look at the brazen ſerpent, with an expectation of complete recovery; ſo ſinners, while deſtitute of every holy qualification, and as impelled by an apprehenſion of eternal ruin, are warranted to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, with hope of complete ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Very emphatical is the language, and exceedingly rich is the grace which appears, in the following paſſage. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.

us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. v. 6, 7, 8.</note>. —In the work of redemption by Jeſus our Lord, there are two particulars on account of which the love of God to men is principally celebrated by the inſpired Writers: which particulars are, <hi>the ſending of his only begotten</hi> SON, and <hi>the delivering him up to death for</hi> SINNERS <note n="†" place="bottom">John iii. 16. Matt. xxi. 37. Rom. viii. 32. 1 John. iii. 16.</note>. It is to the latter of theſe that Paul directs our attention, in the text before us. Here we have a mode of expreſſion that is very uncommon; and, conſidering of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, it is truly wonderful; <hi>God</hi> COMMENDETH <hi>his love!</hi> He exhibits its brighteſt beauties; he preſents to our view its moſt winning attractives; he diſplays it in the moſt ſurpriſing and charming point of light. As if he ſhould ſay;
<q>Such is MY love! So free, ſo fervent, ſo fruitful of benefits, and ſo becoming my infinite excellence, that I conſider the manifeſtation of it, as the chief glory of all my ways reſpecting the ſons of men! to whom I RECOMMEND <hi>it,</hi> in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the eternal ſource of their happineſs, and as the principal ſubject of their delightful meditation.</q>
— <hi>God commendeth his love</hi> TOWARD US. Wonderful ſaying! That reaſonable creatures ought ever to conſider divine benevolence as the fountain of their felicity, is plain to every thinking perſon: but that the Moſt High ſhould ſpeak of RECOMMENDING <hi>his love,</hi> even though
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031844_0099_0FEF1DED8E7E01B8"/>
it were to <hi>angels,</hi> is truly amazing! How much more wonderful, then, to hear him ſpeak of <hi>commending his love to</hi> MEN—to polluted mortals—to criminals, who deſerve perdition!</p>
               <p>But <hi>how,</hi> or in what <hi>way,</hi> does the Supreme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his own philanthropy? Not by paſſing an act of indemnity in favour of thoſe who lothe ſin, and love holineſs. Not by juſtifying thoſe who have performed qualifying conditions, and by giving heaven to ſaints. Nor does he recommend his love to men, in pardoning their offences, accepting their perſons, and beſtowing immortal happineſs upon them, by the mere exertion of his royal prerogative and ſupreme dominion. No: reſpecting theſe particulars, the admirable text is entirely ſilent. But it was by <hi>ſending his</hi> OWN SON, and by giving him up to death for us, <hi>when we were yet</hi> WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT STRENGTH, to perform any thing truly good; <hi>while we were</hi> YET SINNERS, or entirely deſtitute of every amiable quality; and while we were abſolutely UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GODLY in the turn of our hearts, and the courſe of our lives. In other words, a deteſtable compound of depravity and guilt, of weakneſs and unworthineſs. Of ſuch a nature is that apoſtate ſtate in which we were, when <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love to us,</hi> by the gift of his incarnate Son; and by Jeſus falling a victim, in our ſtead to eternal juſtice!</p>

                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:031844_0100_0FEF1DF0776BFD00"/>Again: It is worthy of obſervation, that Paul does not ſay, God commends his <hi>mercy,</hi> or his <hi>grace;</hi> but, which is yet more emphatical, delightful, and wonderful, his LOVE. It deſerves alſo to be remarked, that the Father's <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>ſending</hi> of his own Son, and the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary death</hi> of Jeſus for us, are moſt commonly aſcribed to the LOVE, not the <hi>mercy</hi> or the <hi>grace,</hi> of the Father, and of the Son <note n="*" place="bottom">John iii. 16. 1 John iii. 16. iv. 9, 10.

Mercy, is goodneſs to the <hi>miſerable;</hi> grace, is goodneſs to the <hi>unworthy;</hi> and love, is goodneſs <hi>delighting in the happineſs</hi> of its objects. When God has completely delivered his people from all the penal effects of their apoſtacy, they will no longer be the objects of his goodneſs, under the ſtrict notion of <hi>mercy;</hi> becauſe mercy has regard to <hi>miſery.</hi> When they are perfectly free from all the unworthineſs attending depravity and guilt, they will no longer be the objects of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under the apoſtolic notion of <hi>grace</hi>

the apoſtolic ſenſe of thoſe terms, when uſed reſpecting ſinners.</p>
               <p>Relative to this diſtinction, Dr. GOODWIN ſays; <hi>Love</hi> is
<q>a deſire to communicate good, the chiefeſt good, unto the creature; but <hi>mercy,</hi> it is to pull the creature out of a depth of miſery—So that mercy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addeth this to love, that it reſpects the creature in <hi>miſery.</hi> Parents, they love their children, ſimply as they are their <hi>children;</hi> but if they be fallen into miſery, then love works in a way of <hi>pity</hi>—It is not mercy only,—but [the Apoſtle] alſo mentioneth <hi>love</hi>; —becauſe that mercy only reſpecteth <hi>miſery,</hi> as I ſaid before: it goes no further, ſimply <hi>as</hi> mercy, than the relieving thoſe that are in miſery—Mercy cauſeth a king to pardon a traitor: but if he ſhall take this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and advance him to the higheſt dignity, place him with him in the throne, as it were; this muſt needs be from <hi>love</hi> too; this is ſuperadding, in that reſpect, unto mercy—God's <hi>love,</hi> it is the greateſt thing of all the reſt; it is more than all his benefits. The <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt was more than his ſufferings; and his ſufferings were more than his benefits: and the love of God, it is more than all his gifts, yet he hath given great things to us, and done great things for us. <hi>Amor eſt primum donum; his love is the firſt gift,</hi> as one well ſaith: in the gift of which all things elſe are yours. The gift of his Son, it was a great gift; but it was founded in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031844_0102_0FEF1DF4C6760998"/>
his love. <hi>He ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Though we, being ſinners, need <hi>mercy,</hi> (that is the next thing we want) and therefore we look to it, O mercy, mercy! becauſe we apprehend ourſelves in miſery: but do you look beyond mercy, and look to <hi>love</hi>; which is a greater thing to you than mercy; raiſeth and enlargeth mercy; and, when mercy hath done with you, will do more, or as much for you as mercy hath done, and guideth mercy— <hi>Love</hi> is a deſire to communicate good unto us—<hi>Mercy</hi> reſpecteth us as we are fallen into ſin and miſery— And then that of <hi>Grace,</hi>—it adds but this, a <hi>freeneſs</hi> unto both. Love and mercy freely beſtowed, that is called <hi>grace,</hi> in either <note n="*" place="bottom">On Eph. ii. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Works,</hi> Vol. I. Part II. p. 129, 130, 132, 138.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. CHARNOCK, thus:
<q>
                     <hi>Love</hi> is a perfection of a higher ſtrain than <hi>mercy:</hi> mercy may be prevalent, where love is abſent—This [goodneſs of God] under the name of his <hi>love,</hi> is rendered [or given as] the ſole cauſe of the redeeming death of the Son: it was to COMMEND <hi>his love</hi> with the higheſt gloſs, and in ſo ſingular a manner that had not its parallel in nature, nor in all his other works, and reaches, in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, beyond the manifeſted extent of any other attribute. It muſt be only a miraculous goodneſs that
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031844_0103_0FEF1DF7B291DCA0"/>
induced him to expoſe the life of his Son to thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the world, and death upon the croſs, for the freedom of ſordid rebels. His great end was, to give ſuch a demonſtration of the liberality of his nature as might be <hi>attractive</hi> to his creature, remove its ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and tremblings, and encourage its approaches to him. It is in this he would not only <hi>manifeſt</hi> his love, but <hi>aſſume the Name of</hi> LOVE. By this name the Holy Ghoſt calls him in relation to this good will manifeſted in his Son: <hi>God is</hi> LOVE. <hi>In this is manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</hi> He would take the Name he never expreſſed himſelf in before. He was JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, in regard of the truth of his promiſe: ſo he expreſſed himſelf of old. He is GOODNESS, in regard of the grandeur of his affection in the miſſion of his Son: and therefore he would be known by the name of LOVE now, in the days of the goſpel<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>If, then, the higheſt demonſtration of divine favour; that which, in the eſtimate of God himſelf, is the <hi>grand</hi> recommendation of his love to men; conſiſt in his giving Jeſus to die for us while we were yet <hi>ſinners, ungodly,</hi> and <hi>without ſtrength;</hi> we may ſafely conclude, that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031844_0104_0FEF1DF940CA83C0"/>
the ſentiment oppoſed cannot be <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> For, how incongruous it is to ſuppoſe, that though the bleſſed God <hi>recommend</hi> his love to us, conſidered as mere ſinners; and though it is in Chriſt only, as dying for mere ſinners, that the admirably glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious properties of divine love are to be ſeen; yet, before thoſe very ſinners for whom Chriſt died, and to whom God recommends his love, are <hi>permitted</hi> to believe in Jeſus, and to behold the wonderful excellencies of that amazing love, they muſt have ſome degree of ſpiritual <hi>ſtrength</hi>—they muſt become <hi>godly</hi>—they muſt be real <hi>ſaints!</hi> for all theſe ideas attach to every one that poſſeſſes the leaſt meaſure of true holineſs. God, in the death of Jeſus, recommends his love to <hi>ſinners,</hi> or the <hi>ungodly</hi>; yet they muſt ceaſe to be ſuch before they regard it!—Should any perſons of ſo baſe a character preſume to approach the dying Jeſus as their only hope, the ungracious genius of that principle againſt which I contend cries in their ears, <hi>Procul ô, procul eſte profani: Hence, far hence, O ye profane!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the glorious God been repreſented as recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his love to the <hi>penitent,</hi> the <hi>upright,</hi> the <hi>virtuous;</hi> we might have concluded, that none but perſons of thoſe amiable characters were authoriſed to regard Chriſt with dependence, and with expectation. But, had that been the caſe, the love of God to us could not, with propriety, have been ſo contraſted, as it is here, with the love of

— Muſt it not be neceſſary, then, for ſinners to regard the atonement of Chriſt as all ſufficient, in which the divine Father appears under that gracious character, <hi>the God of peace;</hi> in order to a well-grounded expectation of ever poſſeſſing the leaſt degree of true holineſs?</p>

For, ſo far as I have obſerved, it is allowed by all who are converſant in theſe affairs, that, previous to believing in Jeſus Chriſt, there is no ſuch union between him and any ſinner.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures teach us to conſider all unbelievers as in a ſtate of enmity to God, and of ſpiritual death. <hi>To the unbelieving,</hi> we are alſo informed, <hi>nothing is pure; but even their mind and conſcience are defiled</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Titus i. 15.</note>. The affirmative, however, of what I deny, ſuppoſes that ſinners muſt be alive to God—the friends of God—and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031844_0109_0FEF1E0C370D7D98"/>
have ſome degree of ſpiritual purity, before they obtain permiſſion to believe in Jeſus.

               <p>I ſaid, <hi>in a</hi> SCRIPTURAL <hi>ſenſe:</hi> becauſe they who poſſeſs the leaſt degree of true holineſs, are not, either in the Old or the New Teſtament, denominated, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>ſinners,</hi> the <hi>ungodly,</hi> the <hi>loſt,</hi> and ſo on; but the reverſe.

               <p>It was the deſign of our Lord, in his admirable para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Prodigal, and in that of the Publican <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xv. 11—32. xviii. 10—14.</note>, to inform us, Under what <hi>character,</hi> or under what <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> of ourſelves, we muſt apply to God for pardon, for peace, and for ſalvation. What, then, are the moſt prominent features of thoſe two parabolical perſons, when viewed as coming to God for acceptance? The Prodigal appears as a ragged, filthy, ſtarving wretch; who, impelled by mere neceſſity, returns to his Father, without any recommendation of perſon, or of character; and as deſerving to be for ever exheridated. The Publican, ſmitten with a ſenſe of enormous guilt; far from conſidering himſelf as poſſeſſing any holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and harraſſed with apprehenſions of eternal ruin; appears as a criminal who deſerves to be damned, and who dares not lift up his eyes to heaven, even when <hi>he cries for mercy</hi> through an atonement. Surely, then, theſe characters, and the ſcope of theſe parables, are far from teaching, that ſinners muſt have ſome degree of holineſs before they be authoriſed to believe in Jeſus.— Nay, in the parable of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:031844_0112_0FEF1E123677B9C0"/>
our Lord ſo deſcribes the former as to ſhow, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver approaches God, with a view to <hi>juſtification</hi> before him, under any other character than that of a <hi>miſerable ſinner;</hi> or as encouraged by any other conſideration, than that of <hi>mercy revealed</hi> in the atonement; is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with ſelfrighteous pride, and ſure to meet with a fatal diſappointment.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, <hi>with a view to</hi> JUSTIFICATION <hi>before God:</hi> for this is the ſingle point under conſideration. Becauſe it was <hi>that</hi> for which our Lord repreſents the Phariſee and Publican, as addreſſing the Moſt High; and becauſe it is <hi>that</hi> which an awakened ſinner principally ſeeks, in his firſt application to Jeſus Chriſt.—Has a perſon <hi>believed through grace?</hi> has he already <hi>received the atonement?</hi> and is he approaching the throne of divine mercy for a freſh application of pardon, with reference to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his duties, the daily operation of his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the backſlidings of which he is conſcious? Or, does he apply for larger meaſures of ſanctifying influence? he may come to God as one of his <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children,</hi> or as <hi>a feeble and very imperfect follower</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, crying, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Nay, when lamenting over his indwelling depravity and actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he may even ſay; <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men,</hi> that are profligates in their conduct; that are dead in ſin; or that are ſeeking <hi>to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs.</hi> For the Phariſee, in this parable, is
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031844_0113_0FEF1E18353304C0"/>
not cenſured, merely becauſe he thanked God for <hi>the difference</hi> which ſubſiſted between himſelf, and the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate part of the world; but becauſe he placed that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the account of his <hi>juſtification before God.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> reſpect, the chaſte lady, and the vile proſtitute; the moſt virtuous characters, and the greateſt profligates, are completely on a level; having only one common ground of hope—<hi>the vicarious obedience of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt, I think, be granted, that when a ſinner firſt believes in Jeſus, he is concerned chiefly about pardon and acceptance with God. But, if ſo, the ſpirit of thoſe inſtructive parables to which I advert, abſolutely forbids our ſuppoſing, that any degree of holineſs is required of a ſinner, to warrant his dependence on Chriſt. We will, however, for the ſake of argument, admit the contrary. We will ſuppoſe that a ſinner, under a perſuaſion of his poſſeſſing ſome degree of true ſanctity, applies to the glorious Jeſus; and that he addreſſes God in prayer, for juſtification, agreeably to this view of himſelf. What, then, will be the ſpirit of his addreſs at the throne of Eternal Majeſty? Muſt it not, either expreſsly or implicitly, be as follows?
<q>
                     <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not</hi> as the multitude of <hi>other men!</hi> Once, indeed, I lived in diſobedience, and loved ſin: but now it is otherwiſe, as to the turn of my heart, and the courſe of my life. Having a pious diſpoſition, my will is under an holy bias; which leads
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031844_0114_0FEF1E19C7009E28"/>
me to revere thy authority, and to keep thy commands. Thus poſſeſſing the requiſite divinely preſcribed to all thoſe that would acceptably believe in Jeſus, and through his merits obtain juſtification; I cannot doubt, either of acceptance with thee, or of admiſſion into thy eternal kingdom.</q>
—This, or ſomething ſimilar, is the genuine language of every one who, in his devotional addreſſes relative to <hi>juſtification,</hi> proceeds on that ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious principle which I oppoſe! There is reaſon to think, however, that many who warmly <hi>diſpute</hi> for the principle, entirely deſert it in <hi>prayer;</hi> and would even be ſhocked to hear a religious addreſs to the Deity, reſpecting juſtification, formed upon it.—But, if the principle in queſtion be an article of divine truth, it muſt be of great importance: for it enters deeply into the doctrine of juſtification. Why ſhould it not, then, by all that embrace it, be avowed in their ſolemn prayers for pardon and acceptance, eſpecially by thoſe who, with the Phariſee, conſider themſelves as poſſeſſing the requiſite holineſs? Why does it not make a conſpicuous appearance in their devotional practice? To ſcruple the propriety of ſuch an avowal, is an implicit condemnation of the principle itſelf.</p>
               <p>Remarkably pertinent, relative to this particular, is the following language of Dr. OWEN. The Phariſee aſcribes
<q>all that he did to God. <hi>God, I thank thee:</hi> although he did all [he mentions,] yet he owned the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031844_0115_0FEF1E1B4AC2DA30"/>
aid and aſſiſtance of God, by his grace, in it all. He eſteemed himſelf much to differ from other men, but he aſcribed it not unto himſelf that ſo he did. All the righteouſneſs and holineſs which he laid claim unto, he aſcribed unto the benignity and goodneſs of God. Wherefore he neither pleaded any <hi>merit</hi> in his works, nor any works performed in his <hi>own ſtrength,</hi> without the aid of grace. All that he pretends is, that by the grace of God he had fulfilled the <hi>condition</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and thereon expected to be juſtified. And whatever words men ſhall be pleaſed to make uſe of in their vocal prayers, God interprets their minds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they truſt in, as unto their juſtification before him. And if ſome men will be true to their <hi>own principles,</hi> this [prayer of the Phariſee] is the prayer which, <hi>mutatis, mutandis,</hi> they <hi>ought</hi> to make.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification,</hi> Chap. XVII.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Paul, when proving the doctrine of juſtification by an imputed righteouſneſs, and when adducing the caſe of Abraham as quite in point, thus interrogates and replies; <hi>How was it</hi> (the Patriarch's faith, or that in which he believed) <hi>then reckoned? When he was in circumciſion? Or in uncircumciſion? Not in circumciſion, but in uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 10.</note>. The Apoſtle's deſign in theſe queries and anſwers was to evince, that juſtification before God is of <hi>mere grace,</hi> by an imputed righteouſneſs; and that no
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031844_0116_0FEF1DEA6E6EF680"/>
duty performed by us, nor any holineſs wrought in us, has the leaſt influence in procuring that ineſtimable bleſſing. Adopting the inſpired Writer's manner of ſpeaking, I may, therefore, interrogate and anſwer thus: How, then, is the vicarious obedience of Chriſt imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſinner? When he is poſſeſſed of <hi>true holineſs?</hi> Or when he is conſidered as <hi>ungodly?</hi> Not when in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> but while in the <hi>latter</hi> ſtate: for the text is expreſs, He <hi>that juſtifieth the ungodly</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 5.</note>. Conſequently, no degree of holineſs is previouſly neceſſary to warrant our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Jeſus Chriſt: becauſe it would be abſurd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider any perſon as <hi>ungodly,</hi> who poſſeſſes the leaſt meaſure of real holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who are in health need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick;</hi> is a maxim of common ſenſe, as well as of Scripture. Now Chriſt is the phyſician of ſouls, whoſe diſeaſe conſiſts in depravity and guilt. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore, that ſinners muſt poſſeſs any meaſure of true holineſs, before they are warranted to believe in Jeſus; is equally incongruous as to maintain, that a patient muſt be in a convaleſcent ſtate, before he can, with propriety, apply to a phyſician. For, I preſume it muſt be admitted, that when any ſinner becomes poſſeſſed of holy inclinations, he is, in a moral ſenſe, <hi>convaleſcent.</hi> His recovery is <hi>begun</hi>: and taking the doctrine of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031844_0117_0FEF1E22C606F800"/>
for granted, certain to be completed. But is it congruous to ſuppoſe, that any ſinner ſhould have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial reaſon to conclude upon his own final happineſs, as the ſentiment oppoſed implies, before he be authoriſed to believe in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The Scripture teacheth, that real holineſs is the <hi>fruit</hi> of evangelical truth underſtood and received <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xiii. 23. John xvii. 17, 19. Eph. iv. 24. <hi>Gr.</hi>
                  </note>. But the ſentiment againſt which I contend implies, either, that the goſpel may be received, without relying on Chriſt; or, that holineſs may exiſt in the heart of a ſinner, who does not believe the truth: neither of which can be ſupported by the word of God. Not the <hi>former:</hi> for the genuine goſpel is the teſtimony of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt. It is a revelation, and an exhibition, of his Perſon and offices; of his grace and work <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 1.</note>.

               </p>
               <p>To maintain that a ſinner, before he can warrantably believe in Jeſus, muſt have ſome degree of holineſs, is contrary to the apoſtolic doctrine of juſtification before God. To this particular I have, indeed, repeatedly adverted: but it is of ſo much importance, as to deſerve a more diſtinct conſideration. The principle, then, is inconſiſtent with the apoſtolic doctrine of juſtification by <hi>mere grace;</hi> with the <hi>character</hi> of thoſe whom God juſtifies; and is adapted to encourage <hi>boaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is inconſiſtent with juſtification by</hi> MERE GRACE. Relative to this affair, the language of Inſpiration is, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 24.</note>. No words, equally few, could more ſtrongly expreſs the moſt perfectly gratuitous juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

of a ſinner, than theſe, FREELY, <hi>by his</hi> GRACE; and it is an axiom with Paul, That whatever bleſſing is <hi>of</hi> GRACE, <hi>it is not of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace:</hi> and that, whatever bleſſing is <hi>of</hi> WORKS, <hi>it is not of grace; otherwiſe work is no more work</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xi. 6.</note>.—Nor ought it here to be objected, either, That the ſentiment cenſured reſpects, not <hi>exterior</hi> conduct, but the ſtate of the <hi>heart:</hi> or, That the holineſs intended is an effect of <hi>divine grace.</hi> Not the <hi>former:</hi> for what is exterior conduct, reſpecting the affairs of religion, in which the <hi>heart</hi> is not right with God? It may ſatiſfy the perſon himſelf; it may pleaſe his neighbours; it may be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy; but it is not righteouſneſs.—Not the <hi>latter</hi>: for the Phariſee in the parable, even when pleading his own righteouſneſs for juſtification, <hi>thanked God</hi> for preſerving and aſſiſting grace <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 11.</note>.—'No words can be found out,' ſays Dr. OWEN,

                  <hi>With the</hi> CHARACTER <hi>of thoſe whom God juſtifies.</hi> Thus it is deſcribed by the Apoſtle: <hi>To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 4, 5.</note>. He that <hi>worketh not</hi>—the <hi>ungodly</hi>: ſuch is the character of him that believes in Jeſus, and whom God graciouſly juſtifies! But if the mere ſinner be not authoriſed to believe in Jeſus; if any degree of holineſs be previouſly neceſſary to faith in him; I do not perceive how it can be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a fact, that God juſtifies him who <hi>worketh not,</hi> or any that are <hi>ungodly.</hi> Let us again hear Dr. OWEN, expreſſing himſelf as follows;
<q>To ſay, he who <hi>worketh not,</hi> is juſtified through believing; is to ſay, that his works, whatever they be, have <hi>no influence</hi> into his juſtification; nor hath God, in juſtifying him, any reſpect unto them. Wherefore he <hi>alone</hi> who <hi>worketh not</hi> is the ſubject of juſtification; the perſon to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. That is, God conſidereth no man's works, no man's duties of obedience, in his juſtification; ſeeing we are juſtified <hi>freely by his grace.</hi> And when God affirmeth expreſsly, that he juſtifieth him who <hi>worketh not,</hi> and that <hi>freely by his grace;</hi> I cannot underſtand what place our works, or duties, of obedience, can have in our juſtification. For why ſhould we trouble ourſelves to invent of what conſideration they may be,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:031844_0124_0FEF1E37C065C2C8"/>
in our juſtification before God, when he himſelf affirms that they are of <hi>none at all?</hi> Neither are the words capable of any evading interpretation. <hi>He that worketh not,</hi> IS <hi>he that worketh not,</hi> let men ſay what they pleaſe, and diſtinguiſh as long as they will. And it is a boldneſs not to be juſtified, for any to riſe up in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſuch expreſs divine teſtimonies, however they may be harneſſed with philoſophical notions and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which are but as thorns and briars which the word of God will paſs through and conſume.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the Apoſtle further adds, in the deſcription of the ſubject of juſtification, that God <hi>juſtifieth the</hi> UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GODLY. This is that expreſſion which hath ſtirred up ſo much wrath among many, and on account whereof ſome ſeem to be much diſpleaſed with the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If any other perſon dare but ſay, that God <hi>juſtifieth the</hi> UNGODLY; he is preſently reflected on as one that, by his doctrine, would overthrow the neceſſity of godlineſs, holineſs, obedience, or good works. For what need can there be of any of them, if God juſtifieth the <hi>ungodly?</hi> Howbeit, this is a periphraſis of God, that he is he who <hi>juſtifieth the</hi> UNGODLY. This is his prerogative and property. <hi>As ſuch</hi> he will be believed and worſhipped; which adds weight and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis unto the expreſſion: and we muſt not forego this teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, let men be as angry as they pleaſe. But the difference is about the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:031844_0125_0FEF1E3DB1FA3468"/>
of the words. If ſo, it may be allowed without mutual offence, though we ſhould miſtake their proper ſenſe. Only it muſt be granted, that God <hi>juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi> That is, ſay ſome, thoſe who <hi>formerly were ungodly</hi>; not ſuch who <hi>continue</hi> ungodly when they are juſtified: and this is moſt true. All that are juſtified, were before ungodly: and all that are juſtified, are at the ſame inſtant made godly. But the queſtion is, Whether they are godly or ungodly, <hi>antecedently,</hi> in any moment of time, <hi>unto their juſtification?</hi> If they are conſidered as <hi>godly,</hi> and are ſo indeed, then the Apoſtle's words are not true, that God juſtifieth the <hi>ungodly:</hi> for the contradictory propoſition is true, God juſtifieth <hi>none but the godly.</hi> Wherefore, although in, and with, the juſtification of a ſinner, he is made godly; for he is endowed with that faith which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart, and is a vital principle of all obedience, and the conſcience is purged from dead works by the blood of Chriſt; yet, antecedently unto his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he <hi>is</hi> ungodly, and <hi>conſidered</hi> as ungodly; as one who <hi>worketh not;</hi> as one whoſe duties and obedience contribute nothing to his juſtification. As he <hi>worketh not,</hi> all works are excluded from being the <hi>cauſe;</hi> and as he is <hi>ungodly,</hi> from being the <hi>condition,</hi> of his juſtification—Not this, or that ſort of works; not this, or that manner of the performance of them; not this, or that kind of intereſt in our juſtification; but <hi>all</hi> works of what ſort ſoever, and however performed, are
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031844_0126_0FEF1E409DFEAE30"/>
excluded from <hi>any kind</hi> of conſideration in our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as our works or duties of obedience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It will be ſaid, <hi>That our perſonal obedience is by none aſſerted to be the righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified before God, in the ſame</hi> MANNER <hi>as it was under the Covenant of works.</hi> But the argument ſpeaks, not as unto the <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> whereby it is ſo; but to the <hi>thing itſelf.</hi> If it be ſo in <hi>any</hi> way or manner, under what qualifications ſoever, we are under that Covenant ſtill. If it be of works <hi>any way,</hi> it is not of grace <hi>at all—All is now reſolved into the merit of Chriſt, upon the account whereof alone, our own perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is accepted before God unto our juſtification.</hi> The queſtion is not, On what <hi>account,</hi> nor for what <hi>reaſon,</hi> it is ſo accepted; but whether it be, or no: ſeeing its ſo being is effectually conſtitutive of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>The ſentiment is adapted to <hi>encourage boaſting.</hi> This, however, is directly contrary to the apoſtolic doctrine. For Paul aſſures us, that, by God's method of juſtifying ſinners, all boaſting, even in <hi>comparative</hi> worthineſs, is entirely, and for ever excluded. Thus he interrogates and determines: <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus—Where is boaſting,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031844_0127_0FEF1E42277885D0"/>
then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay: but by the law of faith—By grace are ye ſaved, through faith; and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 24, 27. Eph. ii, 8, 9.</note>. According to the doctrine of Paul, a juſtified ſinner, with reference to the moment preceding his juſtification, has no more ground to think well of his perſonal qualifications, or to applaud his own exertions, relative to that affair; than his unhappy neighbour has, who is dying under a curſe, and ſinking into final ruin.—But, admitting that any degree of holineſs be neceſſary to warrant a ſinner's dependence on Chriſt, it muſt be ſo to juſtification through faith in his blood: becauſe it is in virtue of perſonal ſanctity that he is qualified for <hi>believing;</hi> and, conſequently, for the <hi>imputation</hi> of our Lord's vicarious obedience to him. His own righteouſneſs being thus eſſentially neceſſary, muſt ſhare in the honour of his juſtification. Surely, then, whoever is thus prepared for the benefit of an imputed righteouſneſs, muſt have, in compariſon with others that are not ſo qualified, <hi>cauſe of boaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as Dr. OWEN argues,
<q>If we are in <hi>any ſenſe</hi> juſtified [by our perſonal righteouſneſs] in the ſight of God, we have <hi>whereof to boaſt</hi> before him. We may not have ſo <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and with reſpect to <hi>merit;</hi> yet
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031844_0128_0FEF1E43B73996A8"/>
we have ſo comparatively, and in reſpect of <hi>others,</hi> who cannot make the ſame plea for their juſtification. But all <hi>boaſting is excluded:</hi> and it will not relieve, to ſay, <hi>That this perſonal righteouſneſs is of the free grace and gift of God unto ſome, and not unto others;</hi> for we muſt plead it as our <hi>duty,</hi> and not as God's <hi>grace—Boaſting is excluded.</hi> Apparent it is from hence, and from what [the Apoſtle] affirms concerning Abraham <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 2.</note>, that a great part, at leaſt, of the controverſy he had about juſtification, was, Whether it did admit of any <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the words uſed by the Apoſtle, are of an indifferent ſignification; and, as they are applied, may denote a <hi>virtue,</hi> as well as a <hi>vice.</hi> So they do, Heb. iii. 6 <note n="†" place="bottom">See alſo Rom. xv. 17. 1 Cor, i. 31.

                        <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification,</hi> Chap. VI.</note>.</q>
—I have enlarged the more on this particular, that the reader may perceive how nearly the principle oppoſed relates to the doctrine of juſtification; and how much this capital doctrine is corrupted by that principle.</p>
               <p>Once more: Suppoſing it neceſſary for every ſinner to poſſeſs more, or leſs, of true holineſs, before he be authoriſed to believe in Chriſt; it is hard to conceive how any one ever can believe in him. This, perhaps, may appear by the following conſiderations. Whoever believes in Jeſus, relies on him as redeeming ſinners from the curſe of the law, and the damnation of hell. No one, therefore, depends upon him, till convinced of ſin, and apprehenſive of danger. Now, as nothing but ſin expoſes men to preſent condemnation, and ſinal ruin; ſo it is that only which renders them filthy, and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031844_0130_0FEF1E4832C3B270"/>
vile, and worthleſs. The more any one, therefore, feels his want of deliverance from <hi>the wrath to come</hi>; the more keenly ſenſible he muſt be of his complicated guilt, his great baſeneſs, and his abſolute unworthineſs, in the fight of God. While, conſequently, he is perſuaded, that ſome degree of holineſs is previouſly neceſſary to warrant his reliance on Jeſus Chriſt; he muſt either labour to reform his life, to amend his heart, and to obtain ſome righteouſneſs of his own, as the pedeſtal on which to ſtand when laying hold of Chriſt, or ſink in deſpair: and, in either caſe, he is far from believing on the Son of God.—Thus, while earneſtly deſiring an intereſt in Chriſt, and conſidering himſelf as deſtitute of the requiſite holineſs, he, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>labours in the very fire,</hi> and <hi>wearies himſelf for very vanity.</hi> Having ſuch views of himſelf, and of the character under which only he is warranted to believe in Jeſus; neither the goſpel, with its cheering declarations; nor the Mediator, with his immenſe fulneſs of bleſſings and of grace, can afford him the leaſt relief; they being quite out of his reach. Becauſe, till conſcious of an holy diſpoſition, or a pious turn of heart, he neither does, nor can conſider himſelf as one toward whom the goſpel wears a ſmiling aſpect; or as authoriſed to take the leaſt encouragement from it. On the hypotheſis oppoſed, therefore, nothing but embarraſſment, and painful diſappointment, are likely to attend him.—But were he, by ſtrenuous efforts, to obtain a perſuaſion,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031844_0131_0FEF1E4C7745DB48"/>
that his inclinations have taken a virtuous turn; that his internal character is greatly improved; and, under this conſideration of himſelf, to conclude, That <hi>now</hi> he may believe in Jeſus Chriſt; what muſt be thought of his conduct? Why, that he is ignorant of the goſpel; that he is <hi>of the works of the law</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note>; and, that the pains he has taken have produced a good conceit of himſelf, rather than prepared him for faith in Jeſus Chriſt. So inimical to ſolid peace and real holineſs is the ſentiment which I oppoſe, that, according to the different ſtate of a perſon's conſcience, it has a natural tendency, either to <hi>elevate</hi> with ſelfrighteous pride, or to <hi>depreſs</hi> with deſponding fear. The <hi>former,</hi> if the great evil of ſin be not perceived, and the conſcience drowſy: the <hi>latter,</hi> if the mind be enlightened, and the conſcience tender. For, as Dr. OWEN has well obſerved,
<q>The more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual any man is, the more he ſees of his <hi>unſpiritualneſs</hi> in his ſpiritual duties <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>On the cxxx Pſalm,</hi> p. 345.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this hypotheſis there is, indeed, no ſuch thing as <hi>goſpel,</hi> or glad tidings, for any of thoſe whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures denominate, <hi>ſinners</hi>—the <hi>ungodly</hi>—the <hi>loſt</hi>—thoſe who are in the way to final ruin. Becauſe, according to the principle againſt which I plead, all the revealed relief by Jeſus Chriſt, is directed to thoſe only whoſe hearts are under an <hi>holy hias.</hi> But the ſacred Writers
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031844_0132_0FEF1E4F80D082E8"/>
are far from pronouncing perſons of that character, the <hi>ungodly,</hi> or the <hi>loſt:</hi> and they are equally far from teaching, that creatures, poſſeſſing any degree of true ſanctity, are in danger of eternal perdition. For it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that our divine Sovereign will ever ſend holineſs to hell: or that the ſubjects of truly pious diſpoſitions are in the road to ruin.</p>
               <p>Whereas, if we conſider the inſpired Writings as exhibiting a full, free, and everlaſting ſalvation, by Jeſus Chriſt, for the chief of ſinners; if we conſider the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God concerning his incarnate Son, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete warrant for the moſt guilty and ungodly to believe in him; there is a revealed foundation of hope for the vileſt of men, even when they have the ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of that being their proper character. The word of grace, reſpecting the perfect work of Chriſt, being viewed in this light, is deſervedly, and by way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular eminence, called, THE GLAD TIDINGS. For, be the wants of a ſinner ever ſo many, and his unworthineſs ever ſo great, the all ſufficient Jeſus is preſented to view, as encouraging his immediate dependence, and as rejecting none that apply to him.

               <head>CHAPTER III. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</head>
               <p>AGAINST the ſentiment for which I plead, and in oppoſition to the courſe of my reaſoning, it has been ſtrenuouſly urged;
<q>Repentance includes an holy diſpoſition, and muſt <hi>precede</hi> faith in Chriſt.</q>
—But, ſuppoſing the priority of repentance to faith were granted, it would infer no valid objection to the principle here defended: except it were proved, that repentance muſt precede, as conſtituting an eſſential part of the ſinner's <hi>warrant</hi> to believe in Jeſus. That, however, is not likely to be ſoon evinced.</p>
               <p>In what light, then, is true repentance to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? As <hi>a change of mind, or after-thought?</hi> This, indeed, ſeems to be the literal import of the original word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and that, we acknowledge, precedes faith in Jeſus Chriſt. For while a ſinner is either ſtupidly inattentive to his immortal intereſts, or expecting juſtification by his own obedience, he will not come to Chriſt.—As <hi>a conviction of ſin,</hi> attended with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of eternal ruin? This alſo, it is readily granted, precedes faith in Chriſt. For, whoever believes in Jeſus,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031844_0135_0FEF1E5B5F697930"/>
regards him as the only Saviour from divine wrath: reſpecting the danger of which, a conviction of ſin muſt precede. Nay, we are led, by the language of Scripture, to conſider believing in Chriſt, as no other than <hi>fleeing to the hope ſet before us,</hi> that we may eſcape <hi>the wrath to come</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vi. 18. Matt. iii. 7.</note>. That conviction of ſin and ſenſe of danger, ſhould not be conſidered, however, as inducing God to <hi>give,</hi> but as inclining us to <hi>receive:</hi> not as exciting the Father of mercies to forgive our offences, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Jeſus to juſtify our perſons; but as impelling us to accept the proviſion which ſovereign grace has made for the entirely deſtitute. Beſides, neither that <hi>change of mind,</hi> nor this <hi>apprehenſion of danger,</hi> can be juſtly conſidered as an holy diſpoſition: becauſe they reſpect the ſtate of the intellect, and of the conſcience; not that of the <hi>heart.</hi> Or, if the heart be affected, it is no otherwiſe than as a new turn is given to the operation of ſelf-love: which, ſimply and abſolutely conſidered, has no holineſs in it.</p>
               <p>Muſt repentance, then, be viewed under the notion of <hi>ſorrow for ſin,</hi> and <hi>averſion to it,</hi> conſidered as an oppoſition to divine authority, and as a contrariety to divine purity? This, indeed, is that repentance which is connected with pardon and ſalvation. But then it may be juſtly queried, whether it was ever found in any
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031844_0136_0FEF1E5CED0E6C80"/>
ſinner before he believed in Jeſus Chriſt: as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations, perhaps, may ſhow.</p>
               <p>Repentance, under this notion of it, is manifeſtly a fruit of ſincere eſteem for the dominion of God, and of love to his infinite excellence. Becauſe no one can be cordially grieved for oppoſing a government, which he does not eſteem; nor for his paſt averſion to excellence, which he does not admire. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will not permit our concluding, that theſe pious affections are poſſeſſed by ſinners, before they receive the truth, and believe in Chriſt. If we really love and revere God, it is <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> becauſe <hi>there is forgiveneſs with him;</hi> becauſe that love, as expreſſed in the gift of his own Son, and that forgiveneſs, through the atonement, have been more or leſs revealed to us, in the glad tidings of reconciliation.—All men, when their conſciences are alarmed, being pained with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of eternal deſtruction, will ſorrow for the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of ſin; but none beſides believers in Jeſus mourn over and abhor its <hi>intrinſic</hi> evil.</p>
               <p>Genuine ſorrow for ſin, and ſelf abaſement before God, are cloſely connected, in ancient prophecy, with faith in the bleeding Immanuel, and with reconciliation to our offended Sovereign; rather, they are conſidered as <hi>effects</hi> of that faith and reconciliation. For thus it is written; <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee; and thou
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031844_0137_0FEF1E62F08090A0"/>
ſhalt know that I am the Lord: that thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame,</hi> WHEN I AM PACIFIED TOWARD THEE <hi>for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God—I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and of ſupplications: and they ſhall</hi> LOOK UPON ME <hi>whom they have pierced, and they ſhall</hi> MOURN <hi>for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon, and ſhall be in</hi> BITTERNESS <hi>for him, as one that is in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his firſt born.</hi> To which may be added the following words: <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, thus; Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely,</hi> AFTER <hi>that I was turned, I repented; and</hi> AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER <hi>that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xvi. 62, 63. Zech. xii. 10. Jer. xxxi. 18, 19.</note>.</p>
               <p>Here we have genuine ſorrow for ſin, conſidered as rebellion againſt Jehovah's government, and as abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his purity. Here we behold a remembrance of paſt offences paining the conſcience, and ſhame ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the cheeks; confuſion producing ſilence and grief almoſt breaking the heart. Whence is it, then, that inveterate rebels are thus affected, and adamantine
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031844_0138_0FEF1E65D5B51548"/>
hearts thus melted? Not from denunciations of divine vengeance; nor from apprehenſions of endleſs perdition: but from <hi>knowing,</hi> as taught by <hi>the Spirit of grace,</hi> the import of that ſublime name, JEHOVAH <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 5, 6, 7. Iſa. xlv. 21.</note>; from <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the pierced Meſſiah; and from God being <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> to them. Yes, not only mercy revealed to the guilty, but faith in the divine teſtimony, a believing regard to the dying Jeſus, and converſion to God, are preſented to view as producing repentance.</p>
               <p>That the manifeſtation of divine benignity toward our apoſtate ſpecies, is friendly to holy ſorrow; and that the exerciſe of human compaſſion towards diſaffected neighbours, has a natural tendency to produce reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are taught by the following remarkable words. <hi>The goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance—If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink: for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 4. xii. 20.</note>. Are the exerciſe of divine kindneſs, in the courſe of common Providence, and the puny efforts of human compaſſion, for the relief of diſtreſſed fellow-creatures, adapted to produce repentance and reformation in their different objects? then, ſurely, we may conclude, that the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs benignity of God, revealed in the goſpel of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, muſt be incomparably better fitted, to excite an
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031844_0139_0FEF1E675FEDC848"/>
abhorrence of ſin, conciliate the affections to God, and produce a ſeries of holy obedience.</p>
               <p>Further: True repentance is the <hi>gift</hi> of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the aſcended Sovereign and Saviour of his church. As it is written, <hi>Him hath God exalted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts v. 31.</note>. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and pardon, being here ſo intimately connected, and both of them repreſented as the gifts of Jeſus Chriſt; we are led to conclude, that real repentance for ſin, and faith in the blood of Chriſt, coexiſt; that godly ſorrow ſuppoſes and includes faith in revealed mercy; and that both of them are the fruits of ſovereign grace.</p>
               <p>Dr. OWEN, when ſpeaking of <hi>humiliation for ſin,</hi> expreſſes himſelf as follows.
<q>There is a reſpect in it to the <hi>love of God:</hi> and this breaks the heart of the poor returning ſinner. Sorrow from the <hi>law,</hi> ſhuts itſelf up in the ſoul, and ſtrangleth it. Sorrow from the <hi>love of God</hi> opens and cauſeth it to flow forth. Thoughts of ſinning againſt the <hi>love</hi> of God, managed by the Holy Ghoſt, what ſhall I ſay? their effects in the heart are not to be expreſſed—True humility conſiſts more in <hi>believing,</hi> than in being <hi>ſenſible</hi> of ſin—Let there be no miſtake: there can be no <hi>evangelical</hi> ſenſe
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031844_0140_0FEF1E6A59CD7FD0"/>
of ſin, and humiliation for it, where there is not <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt. Zech. xii. 10—It is the ſoul's appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God for <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> and not its ſenſe of ſin, that gives unto God the glory of his grace—No repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is acceptable with God, but what is built, or leans, on the faith of forgiveneſs—God expreſsly declares in the Scripture, that <hi>the forgiveneſs that is with him,</hi> is the foundation of his preſcribing repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto man. One inſtance may ſuffice, Iſa. lv. 7 —<hi>Legal</hi> repentance, which precedes goſpel faith, and is without it, is neither a diſpoſition, preparation, nor condition of our juſtification <note n="*" place="bottom">

<q>
                     <hi>Repent ye, and believe the goſpel.</hi> This may be the meaning of the exhortation. <hi>Repent;</hi> relinquiſh all your wrong notions, relating to the way and manner of finding acceptance with the Deity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Believe the goſpel;</hi> which opens a moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected avenue, for the communication of this bleſſing. Which brings you glad tidings of a ſalvation, fully procured by the incarnate God, and freely offered to the unworthy ſinner. The word, you know, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: which, in its primary ſignification, denotes not ſo much a reformation of conduct, as a change of ſentiment.—Suppoſe it to ſignify a reformation of
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031844_0141_0FEF1E702EAD9D90"/>
conduct; the meaning then may be as follows. <hi>Repent;</hi> forſake all your vices, and all your follies; mortify every evil temper, and renounce every evil way. In order to render this practicable, <hi>believe the goſpel;</hi> wherein a Saviour is preached and diſplayed. Who makes peace for ſuch offenders; reconciles them to God; and obtains eternal redemption for them. This will ſweetly withdraw your affections from iniquity, and ſweetly attach them to the bleſſed God. Whereas, without this powerful expedient, you will never be delivered from the pleaſing witchcraft of your luſts. Sin will always have the dominion over you, ſo long as you are <hi>under the law,</hi> and not <hi>under grace.</hi> Repentance, thus underſtood, is not the <hi>condition</hi> of obtaining ſalvation, but the fruit of <hi>ſalvation itſelf—I came, not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Many perſons, I am apt to ſuſpect, miſtake the meaning of this ſweet paſſage; and turn the <hi>freely flowing</hi> benefits of the goſpel, into the <hi>rigorous</hi> requirements of the law. They reckon, our Lord's calling to repentance, is like a ſchoolmaſter calling the youths to their taſk; or like a houſeholder calling his ſervants to their work. Whereas, it is like Joſeph, the governor of Egypt, calling his brethren, each to receive a ſuit of apparel, and all to partake of his hoſpitable banquet. Chriſt, as a Saviour, is the greateſt of benefactors. When, therefore, he calls to repentance, his intention is, not to demand, but to beſtow; not to enjoin, but
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031844_0142_0FEF1E731B8B0A68"/>

<q>The ſubject of true repentance is a <hi>convinced, believing,</hi> ſoul.

Neither can an <hi>unbelieving</hi> ſinner be ſo; for without faith the heart may be rent <hi>for</hi> ſin, but not <hi>from</hi> it—Faith is the ſpring and ſource of repentance: ſo that though the graces of faith and repentance are given together and at once, in reſpect of <hi>time;</hi> yet, in the order of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> faith goes before repentance, and the acting of faith goes before the exerciſe of repentance; and he that would repent, muſt firſt believe in Chriſt, that he may repent—Then, it is not goſpel doctrine, <hi>That Chriſt will receive none but true penitents;</hi> or that none but ſuch have a warrant to embrace Chriſt, by faith— For ſenſible ſinners to think that they dare not, and ought not, to believe and embrace Chriſt, till they be more deeply humbled, and do more thoroughly repent of their ſins and, in a word, be <hi>more fit</hi> to receive him: is but a gilded deceit, and a trick of the falſe heart—The more faith, the more repentance; as, the fuller the ſpring is, the ſtreams run with the more vigorous current <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:031844_0143_0FEF1E749FC85E28"/>It is objected,
<q>Though it be not neceſſary for a ſinner to <hi>know</hi> that he is born again, before he believe in Jeſus Chriſt; yet <hi>regeneration itſelf</hi> muſt precede faith.

—In anſwer to which, the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are propoſed for conſideration.</p>
               <p>Before this objection can be juſtly conſidered as valid, it muſt be evinced, not only, that regeneration <hi>precedes</hi> faith; but alſo that it is neceſſary to <hi>authoriſe</hi> a ſinner's reliance on Jeſus Chriſt, than which, few ſentiments are more foreign from the genuine goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regeneration muſt precede faith.</hi> This, though aſſumed as a certain fact, may be juſtly doubted: for the page of Inſpiration does not warrant our ſuppoſing, that any one is born of God, <hi>before</hi> he believes in Jeſus Chriſt; or, that regeneration is effected by the Holy Spirit, <hi>without</hi> the word of grace. For we are taught, by the ſacred Writers, to conſider the word of truth, with regard to adults, as the mean of regeneration, and of many other happy effects.

But it is impoſſible for us to conceive of the mind being enlightened, of the conſcience being relieved, of the will being regulated, and of the affections being purified, by the word of truth, any further than it is believed.— I conclude, therefore, that regeneration is not, in order of time, previous to faith in Chriſt.

Nay, on ſuppoſition that the heart muſt be renewed, previous to believing the goſpel, and to any degree of dependence upon the atonement; it ſeems as if ſinners <hi>ought</hi> always to inquire into the ſtate of their own hearts, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

But the energy of the Spirit applying the word of reconciliation to their hearts, the truth is believed, and their enmity ſubdued, in the ſame inſtant. According to that ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free</hi>—free, from guilt on your conſciences, and from reigning enmity in your hearts.</p>

               <p>Thus Dr. OWEN:
<q>This [regeneration] is wrought by the <hi>word.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 23. <hi>We are born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God.</hi> Wherein, not only the <hi>thing itſelf,</hi> of our regeneration by the word, but the <hi>manner</hi> of it alſo, is declared.

               <p>The ſame excellent Author, when ſpeaking of <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> by the truth, ſays:
<q>There is a great anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and correſpondency, between the <hi>heart</hi> of a believer, and the <hi>truth</hi> that he doth believe. As the word, is in the goſpel, ſo is grace in the heart: yea, they are the <hi>ſame thing</hi> variouſly expreſſed. (Rom. vi. 17.) <hi>You have obeyed from the heart, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the form of doctrine delivered unto you.</hi> As our Tranſlation doth not, ſo I know not how, in ſo few words, to expreſs that which is <hi>emphatically</hi> here inſinuated by the Holy Ghoſt. The meaning is, that the doctrine of the goſpel begets the <hi>form, figure, image,</hi> or <hi>likeneſs</hi> of itſelf, in the hearts of them that believe. So they are caſt into the <hi>mould</hi> of it. As is the one, ſo is the other. The principle of <hi>grace</hi> in the heart, and that in the <hi>word,</hi> are as children of
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031844_0152_0FEF1E90F4BCC350"/>
the ſame parent, completely reſembling and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. Grace is a <hi>living word,</hi> and the word is <hi>figured, limned grace.</hi> As is regeneration, ſo is a regenerate heart: as is the doctrine of faith, ſo is a believer. And this gives great evidence unto, and aſſurance of the things believed—Firſt, the <hi>truth is in Jeſus:</hi> then it is expreſſed in the word. This word, learned and believed, becomes grace in the heart, every way anſwering unto the Lord Chriſt his <hi>image,</hi> from whom this <hi>tranſforming truth</hi> did thus proceed. Nay, this is carried by the Apoſtle yet higher, namely, unto God the Father himſelf, whoſe image Chriſt is, and believers his, through the word, 2 Cor. iii. 18. iv. 6 —Regeneration doth not, in order of time, precede the ſoul's intereſt in the forgiveneſs that is with God, or its being made partaker of the pardon of ſin. I ſay no more but that it doth not precede it in order of <hi>time;</hi> not determining which hath precedency in order of <hi>nature.</hi> That, I confeſs, which the method of the goſpel leads unto, is, That abſolution, acquitment, or the pardon of ſin, is <hi>the foundation</hi> of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all ſaving grace unto the ſoul; and ſo <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth</hi> all grace in the ſinner whatever—It is hence evident, that an aſſurance of being regenerate, is no way previouſly neceſſary unto the believing of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in forgiveneſs; ſo that although a man have not the former, it is, or may be, his duty to endeavour the latter. When convinced perſons cried out, <hi>What
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031844_0153_0FEF1E96D64B7178"/>
ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> the anſwer was, <hi>Believe, and and you ſhall be ſo.</hi> Believe in Chriſt, and in the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin by his blood, is the <hi>firſt</hi> thing that convinced ſinners are called unto. They are not directed firſt to ſecure their ſouls that <hi>they are born again,</hi> and then afterwards to believe. But they are firſt to believe, that the remiſſion of ſin is tendered to them in the blood of Chriſt; and that by him they may be juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law. Nor, upon this propoſition, is it the duty of men to queſtion whether they have faith, or no, but actually to believe; and faith, in its operation, will evidence itſelf. See Acts xiii. 38, 39 <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Again, he ſays:
<q>The whole matter of ſanctification and holineſs is peculiarly joined with, and limited unto, the <hi>doctrine, truth,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of the goſpel: for holineſs is nothing, but the implanting, writing, and realiſing of the goſpel in our ſouls. Hence it is termed <gap reason="foreign">

It belongs neither to nature, nor the law, ſo as to proceed from them, or to be effected by them—There neither is, nor ever was in the world, nor ever ſhall be, the leaſt dram of holineſs, but what, flowing from Jeſus Chriſt, is communicated by the Spirit, according to the <hi>truth and promiſe</hi> of the goſpel. There may be ſomething <hi>like</hi> it, as to its outward acts and effects, (at leaſt, ſome of them;) ſomething that may wear its livery in the world, that is but the fruit of men's own endeavours, in compliance with their convictions; but <hi>holineſs</hi> it is not, nor of the ſame kind or nature with it <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Reſpecting the word of truth as the inſtrument of regeneration, it has, to the following purpoſe, been objected:
<q>They who conſider divine truth as the mean of regeneration muſt grant, that it is by the Holy Spirit the word is introduced into the mind, in order to its having ſuch an effect—That ſome operation of
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031844_0155_0FEF1E9B5387A240"/>
the Spirit on the underſtanding takes place, in order ſo to <hi>change</hi> it, as to receive the word—And, that this operation <hi>precedes</hi> the entrance of light into the mind. Conſequently, that the <hi>change</hi> by which the mind is prepared to receive the light, is not effected by means of the word: and yet, in that very change men are <hi>born of the Spirit</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. S. HOPKINS's <hi>Two Diſcourſes,</hi> p. 112, 113.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>According to this view of the ſubject, the word of truth, having no influence, is of <hi>no uſe,</hi> in the work of regeneration; the ſalutary and important change being produced entirely without it. Either, therefore, by thoſe expreſſions, <hi>born again,</hi> the objector muſt intend ſomething very different from what is meant by them in Scripture; or he is not far from contradicting the expreſs determination of inſpired Writers: as appears by various paſſages already adduced—To imagine that a preparation of the <hi>mind,</hi> merely to receive the truth, is a change ſo great as to anſwer thoſe emphatical expreſſions, <hi>regeneration, born again, born of the Spirit, born of God,</hi> and <hi>a new heart;</hi> is, I think, very unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable. Becauſe, on that ſuppoſition, the change denoted by being <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> takes place merely in the <hi>intellect,</hi> or thinking faculty; not at all in the <hi>will,</hi> or the <hi>heart.</hi> But, whatever light any perſon may have in his mind, the Scriptures never teach us to conſider
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031844_0156_0FEF1E9CDB85C2D8"/>
him as <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> except his heart be renewed, ſo as to love God and approve of his ways. Nay, the Author himſelf confirms my aſſertion, by elſewhere ſaying;
<q>This regeneration of which I am ſpeaking conſiſts in a change of the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>heart</hi>—I have good grounds to aſſert, that in regeneration the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>immediate ſubject</hi> of the divine operation, and ſo of the moral change that is effected thereby <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 57, 58.</note>.</q>
                  <hi>Though I—underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge,— and have not love, I am nothing.</hi> The glorious God, however, is not loved by apoſtate creatures, unleſs as revealed in Jeſus Chriſt, and by the goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is too haſtily aſſumed, that the mind is <hi>prepared</hi> to receive the light of ſpiritual knowledge, previous to the truth having any influence upon it. For, may not the Holy Spirit, without any antecedent operation, apply divine truth, or the ſenſe and meaning of the word; ſo as to enlighten the underſtanding, impreſs the conſcience, and affect the heart? May not that omnipotent Agent, without any previous preparation, attend his own word with ſuch energy, as to irradiate the mind, ſubdue the will, and give a new turn to the whole ſoul? Nay, do not the ſcriptural paſſages already produced, naturally lead us to conclude, that this, with regard to regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a fact? If there be not an aptitude in the word of
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031844_0157_0FEF1E9E68405A10"/>
truth, as an inſtrument in the hand of God, to produce this great moral change, why is that word compared to <hi>light,</hi> called a <hi>two-edged ſword,</hi> and repreſented as giving <hi>life?</hi> When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>I had not known ſin but</hi> BY <hi>the law;</hi> and, <hi>the law worketh wrath</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 7. iv. 15.</note>; does he not intend to inform us, that the divine precepts, and their awful ſanction, are <hi>means</hi> by which the Holy Spirit convinces of ſin, and alarms the conſcience?

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm cxix. 50.

Why, then, ſhould we affix a different ſenſe to ſimilar language, reſpecting the work of regeneration, in the texts before adduced, from the writings of Paul, of James, and of Peter? Why, when the word of truth, or the goſpel of divine grace, is repreſented as that by which ſinners are <hi>born again</hi>—as the very <hi>ſeed</hi> of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration —ſhould the words receive a qualified interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;

ſo as to mean ſomething, which the Author to whom I advert does not conſider as regeneration, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> ſo called?—To be OF <hi>the truth;</hi> TO be OF <hi>faith;</hi> and to be OF <hi>God</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides, for an awakened ſinner to be perſuaded, that regeneration is prior to faith in Jeſus, and that it is effected without the inſtrumentality of divine truth; is adapted to give an injurious direction to his <hi>prayers</hi> and his <hi>expectations,</hi> reſpecting that affair. The <hi>former:</hi> becauſe if he pray agreeably to that idea, it will be for ſomething under the notion of regeneration, in which the knowledge of Chriſt, and a regard to his atonement, have no concern.

<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031844_0159_0FEF1EA5D3E47010"/>
of God concerning Jeſus, he will be ready to look for ſome ſecret, and enthuſiaſtical impulſe, to produce the important change. Two evils, theſe, of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in whomſoever they are found.</p>
               <p>Once more: This Author himſelf, I think, muſt admit, that Satan laid the foundation of his kingdom among men, by the uſe of language replete with infernal falſehood. But, if ſo, it cannot be abſurd to maintain, that the ſpiritual dominion of Chriſt, in the hearts of ſinners, commences under the ſalutary operation of divine truth. If the father of lies, by words of deceit, without any previous phyſical influence on the mental powers, polluted the imagination, obſcured the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and corrupted the heart of Eve, when in her primitive ſtate, and under a ſtrong bias to obedience; which, I preſume, this Writer will acknowledge: why ſhould he deny, that the Holy Spirit, by the word of truth, without any preparatory agency on the ſoul, enlightens the mind, impreſſes the conſcience, and gives a new turn to the heart, of one that is dead in ſin?</p>

The propenſities of their nature, therefore, in favour of communion with God, and of obedience to him, we may juſtly conclude, were not leſs powerful than thoſe in the hearts of their degenerate offspring are, to objects quite the reverſe. Conſequently, as the firſt inclination to evil, in the human heart, when perfectly pure, was produced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous phyſical influence, by the lie of Satan; we are led, by analogy, equally as by the language of Scripture, to conſider the firſt holy tendency, in a heart that is totally corrupt, as produced by the truth of God, without any preparatory agency.</p>
               <p>This argument from analogy is the more obſervable, as it ariſes from the only fact of the kind, that ever did, or ever will take place among men. It may be rendered more concluſive, however, by remarking, that though the Scriptures teach us to conſider depravity as firſt produced in the holy hearts of our paradiſiacal proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, <hi>merely</hi> by the operation of Satan's falſehood; yet the ſame infallible Writings lead us to conclude, that evangelical truth is only the <hi>mean</hi> of renewing depraved hearts, or of turning them to God.

except ſo far as the violated law has taught them; have no more knowledge of it than Adam had, immediately after his firſt offence, and before divine mercy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.

For we find that he, and his partner in diſobedience, were thoroughly diſpoſed, had it been in their power, to have exculpated themſelves, by charging the blame upon others. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree—The ſerpent beguiled me</hi>— were their pleas; without any confeſſion of guilt, or any petition for pardon.

                  <hi>Sinners muſt approve the divine character—muſt be heartily reconciled to God and his law; before they can be reconciled to the grace of God through Chriſt.</hi> But, if they be ſo reconciled, previous to believing in Jeſus, and to a view of revealed mercy, it ſhould ſeem as if they had not much occaſion for either faith, or grace, or Chriſt. Becauſe it muſt be admitted, that perſons of ſuch piety are already accepted of God, bear his image, and are in the way to heaven. A ſmall degree of aſſiſtance from Chriſt, and from grace, may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, perhaps, to <hi>expedite</hi> their progreſs in the heavenly road; on which, without regarding ſovereign mercy and atoning blood, they have ſo happily entered; and to render them a little more <hi>comfortable</hi> under the afflictions with which they meet. But, certainly, as they already approve the divine character, and have made ſuch advances in ſanctification; they cannot believe in Chriſt as juſtifying the <hi>ungodly,</hi> nor conſider themſelves as entirely unworthy. Becauſe, on a compariſon with unregenerate perſons, who have always conſtituted a vaſt majority of mankind, their moral worth is very great. For they who <hi>approve</hi> the divine character, and are <hi>heartily</hi> reconciled to God and his law, muſt be viewed by all the world, as the <hi>cordial friends,</hi> and the <hi>willing ſervants</hi> of God.—On the principles of this Author, therefore, we may ſafely aſſert, that their hearts are holy, their character honourable, and their ſtate ſecure, without any dependence on ſovereign grace,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031844_0170_0FEF1EC94FEFF0D8"/>
and without believing in the great Mediator: ſo that they are actually in the way to heaven, without regarding either grace, or Chriſt. Eternal election does not more firmly aſcertain the future holineſs of its objects, than being '<hi>heartily</hi> reconciled to God in his law,' ſecures the everlaſting felicity of all thoſe to whom that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belongs, Becauſe, being ſo reconciled, they are in poſſeſſion of that <hi>holineſs,</hi> without which, <hi>no one ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> and, conſequently, in a ſtate of preparation for the heavenly world. There is not, there cannot be any more danger of God abandoning thoſe to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition, who are become his cordial friends; than there is of his reverſing the decree of election. Are multitudes of our ſpecies under a divine curſe? it is as <hi>rebels</hi> againſt God, as habitually <hi>diſapproving</hi> of his character, and as <hi>diſaffected</hi> to his law. Are numbers conſigned over to final ruin? it is as <hi>enemies</hi> to God, as <hi>hating</hi> his character, and as <hi>averſe</hi> to his government. For, as a certain writer ſays,
<q>Nothing that loves God can periſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor, on our Author's principles, is it only in a <hi>future</hi> ſtate, that the characters under conſideration are ſure of bleſſedneſs. For, previous to any reliance, either on divine grace, or on Jeſus Chriſt; and even before they are <hi>permitted</hi> to rely on the one or the other; they muſt have a conſiderable degree of true happineſs. Becauſe it ſeems impoſſible for any reaſonable creature to be

really miſerable, wherever he exiſt, while he

He ſincerely unites with ſaints on earth, and with angels in heaven, in loving and adoring the Supreme. As a ſincere approbation of the character and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is, in every ſtage of our exiſtence, eſſential to human happineſs; and as, wherever, in the wide creation, ſuch an holy approbation is more or leſs wanting, there is a proportional degree of guilt and miſery; ſo happineſs is, by divine conſtitution, attached to that approbation, and muſt attend the perſon who 'is <hi>heartily</hi> reconciled to God and his law.'—Nor is this the language of mere theory: for every believer knows by experience, that, whatever his afflictions and trials may be, he always feels himſelf happy, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his being
<q>heartily reconciled to God and his law.</q>
While that is the caſe, he imitates our Perfect Pattern; and his language is, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> But the ſuppoſition of any one ſo approving the divine character, being ſo reconciled to the government of God, and <hi>ſanctifying the Lord God in his heart,</hi> before he believes the gracious goſpel, or depends on Jeſus Chriſt, is an opinion abſolutely unfounded.</p>

Yes, they having the <hi>virtue</hi> to eſteem Chriſt, God has the <hi>benignity</hi> to love them. But, as their virtue is not quite complete, he, to manifeſt his delight in virtue, and to ſupply its imperfections, grants them the benefit of our Lord's imputed righteouſneſs. Thus our own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence becomes a pedeſtal, on which the righteouſneſs of Chriſt may ſtand exalted; and whence, having ſuch an excellent baſis, it appears to great advantage! For, according to this dogma, it is by the co-operation of human worthineſs, and of divine grace, that ſinners obtain both pardon and juſtification.</p>

The doctrine of our Author, in this reſpect, is indeed too nearly akin to that of the Schoolmen, and of the council of Trent. For thus Dr. OWEN, relative to the Popiſh doctrine of acceptance

How contrary this to the language of Inſpiration, relative to a ſinner's acceptance with God! of which the following paſſages are a ſpecimen.
<q>The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf: God, I thank thee, that I <hi>am not as other men are</hi>—The Publican, ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to</hi> ME A SINNER. I tell you this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather than the other. For every one that exalteth himſelf,</q>
by pleading his own virtuous exerciſes,
<q>ſhall be abaſed; and he who humbleth himſelf,</q>
by ſincerely confeſſing that he is abſolutely unworthy, and by caſting himſelf at the feet of ſovereign mercy,
<q>ſhall be exalted—I am not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt;—for therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed,</q>
not from one exerciſe of virtue to another, but
<q>from faith to faith—The righteouſneſs of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031844_0177_0FEF1EDFA52D0B48"/>
God without the law,</q>
which requires the exerciſe of virtue, is manifeſted—even the righteouſneſs of God; 'which is,' not by virtue, but
<q>by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe—Being juſtified,</q>
not as exerciſing virtue, but
<q>FREELY by his GRACE— That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier,</q>
not of him that is virtuous, but 'of him that believeth in Jeſus,' all ſinful as he is.
<q>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works, or virtue? Nay, but by the law,</q>
or doctrine
<q>of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified without the deeds of the law,</q>
or the exerciſe of virtue—
<q>If Abraham was juſtified by works,</q>
or thro' the co-operation of his own virtuous exerciſes,
<q>he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. For what ſaith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs. Now to him that worketh,</q>
in the exerciſe of moral virtue,
<q>is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that <hi>worketh</hi> not,</q>
nor is diſtinguiſhed by virtuous exerciſes;
<q>but believeth on him that juſtifieth the UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GODLY,</q>
and therefore entirely deſtitute of all true virtue;
<q>his faith is counted for righteouſneſs. Even as David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs WITHOUT <hi>works,</hi>
                  </q>
or virtuous exerciſes of the heart and life:
<q>Saying, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</q>
Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin—If they which are of the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031844_0178_0FEF1EE3F15F1960"/>
'law,' or of moral virtue,
<q>be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe of none effect—Therefore it is,</q>
not of moral virtue, but
<q>of faith, that it might be by grace,</q>
independent of our own virtue; to the end the
<q>promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed—As many as are of the works of the law,</q>
or of moral virtue,
<q>are under the curſe—What things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt. Yea, doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs,</q>
or moral virtue, <q>which is of the law; but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, even the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith—The Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſs;</q>

<q>ſeems to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto reaſon, than what is here made manifeſt by the event. The Gentiles who lived in ſin and pleaſure, not once endeavouring to attain unto any righteouſneſs before God, yet attained unto it upon the preaching of the goſpel. Iſrael, on the other hand, which <hi>followed after righteouſneſs,</hi> diligently in all the works of the law and duties of obedience unto God thereby, came ſhort of it, attained not unto it.

                  <q>They, whom our Lord invites, and whom the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel encourages to believe in him, are deſcribed as <hi>labouring</hi> under a burden; as <hi>thirſty,</hi> and ſo on.</q>
True: but muſt we conſider that <hi>burden,</hi> or this <hi>thirſt,</hi> as the mark of a gracious change having taken place in their hearts; as an holy qualification for acceptance with Chriſt; or as <hi>authoriſing</hi> them to believe in him? If ſo, the goſpel, as already proved, ſhould be preached to none but thoſe who are <hi>born of God</hi>—that are, to a conſiderable degree, ſanctified—that are already in the way to heaven; and thoſe who are, in Scripture, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>ſinners,</hi> have no encouragement. Whereas, our Lord's commiſſion was; <hi>Preach the goſpel,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the glad tidings, <hi>to every creature:</hi> and his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, <hi>Come, and take</hi> FREELY—<hi>without money and without price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>burden</hi> which is here meant, by our compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Saviour, ſeems to be no other than <hi>guilt,</hi> oppreſſing the conſcience; of which the awakened ſinner <hi>labours</hi> to get rid, by means of his own deviſing: and the <hi>thirſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:031844_0183_0FEF1EF2C6846D30"/>
an earneſt deſire of happineſs, in the attainment of ſuch objects as cannot afford it. Now, a <hi>burden</hi> and a <hi>thirſt</hi> of this kind are frequently experienced by thoſe who are unregenerate, and far from having the leaſt degree of holineſs. Cain, for example, the firſtborn of woman, felt that burden, and complained of it, as too heavy for him to bear<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. iv. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>; though he was, and continued to be, an enemy to God. Judas, alſo, experienced the weight of that burden, to an intolerable degree; ſunk under its preſſure; and periſhed without remedy <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxvii. 3, 4, 5.</note>. Whence it appears, that the deepeſt ſenſe of guilt, and the moſt alarming apprehenſions of eternal ruin, are, detached from other conſiderations, no evidence of love to God; no proof of ſanctifying influence; nor any indication that the ſubjects of them are in the way to holineſs and happineſs.—Yet, as Dr. OWEN has well obſerved,
<q>Some, finding this <hi>ſenſe of ſin,</hi> with thoſe other things that attend it, wrought in them, in ſome meaſure, begin to think, that <hi>now</hi> all is well: this is all that is of them required. They will endeavour to make a <hi>life,</hi> from ſuch arguments of <hi>comfort</hi> as they can take from this <hi>trouble.</hi> They think this a <hi>ground</hi> of peace, that they have <hi>not</hi> peace. Here ſome take up before converſion, and it proves their ruin. Becauſe they are convinced of ſin, and troubled about it, and burdened with it, they think it ſhall be well with them. But, were not
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031844_0184_0FEF1EF450B9C4D0"/>
Cain, Eſau, Saul, Ahab, Judas, convinced of ſin, and burdened with it? Did this profit them? Did it intereſt them in the promiſes? Did not the wrath of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, notwithſtanding? So it is with many daily: they think their <hi>conviction</hi> is <hi>converſion;</hi> and that their ſins are <hi>pardoned,</hi> becauſe they have been <hi>troubled</hi>— For a ſoul to place the ſpring of its peace or comfort in any thing of its own, is to fall ſhort of Chriſt, and take up in <hi>ſelf.</hi> We muſt not only be <hi>juſtified,</hi> but <hi>glory</hi> in him alſo. (Iſa. xlv. 25.) Men may make uſe of the <hi>evidence</hi> of their graces; but only as a medium to a farther end: not as the <hi>reſt</hi> of the ſoul, in the leaſt. And this deprives men's very <hi>humiliations</hi> of all goſpel humility. True humility conſiſts more in <hi>believing,</hi> than in being <hi>ſenſible</hi> of ſin. <hi>That's</hi> the ſoul's great ſelfemptying and abaſing: <hi>this</hi> may conſiſt with an obſtinate reſolution to ſcramble for ſomething upon the account of ſelfendeavours <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Mr. TILLINGHAST, in anſwer to this objection, ſays:
<q>When Chriſt bids thoſe that are <hi>weary and heavy-laden</hi> come to him, doth it therefore follow, [that] he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all others? I grant, ſuch are to come: and ſuch are moſt <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>afraid</hi> to come, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called. But doth it follow, therefore, that no other muſt come; and that theſe, and only theſe, are called? If a prince ſend forth [a] proclamation to a company of traitors, to come in, and he will pardon them; and becauſe he knows that there are ſome few among them, that are ſo ſenſible of what they have done, and brought themſelves into by their rebellion, that they will never come upon this general proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but, for fear, will run away; he therefore ſends particularly to theſe, by name, <hi>You, and you, who dare not come for fear aſ being hanged; Come, I will pardon you, and you;</hi> doth it therefore follow, becauſe they have a call, as it were by name, therefore now all the reſt, who have a general call are excluded? So here.—But this fain would I know, What is the ſtate and condition that ſouls are then in, when they are thus <hi>weary and heavy-laden?</hi> Are they in the ſtate and condition of <hi>ſinners,</hi> or not? Righteous, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous? One [of theſe] they muſt be. If you ſay,

they are not <hi>ſinners,</hi> but <hi>righteous</hi> perſons; then I aſk, How came they [to be] thus? Is it by their being <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> barely? Or is it by their applying of the promiſe? If it be by their being <hi>weary and heavy-laden,</hi> then what need you preſs them to come to Chriſt for juſtification; when as they have the ſame by this their qualification? If it be by applying the <hi>promiſe,</hi> or having it applied to them; then it will follow, that, notwithſtunding this their qualification, that they are <hi>ſinners,</hi> and ſo remain until they apply the promiſe, or have it applied to them<note n="*" place="bottom">

For ſome, at leaſt, of the <hi>thirſting</hi> ones, to whom the offer is there made, are <hi>ſpending money for that which is not bread,</hi> and their <hi>labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> But it is evident, that ſinners duly ſenſible, who are thirſting after Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, are not ſpending their money and labour at that rate; but, on the contrary, for that which alone is <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfieth;</hi> namely, Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>true bread, which came down from heaven.</hi> Wherefore, the <hi>thirſt</hi> there meant, muſt needs comprehend, yea, and principally aim at, that thirſt after happineſs and ſatisfaction which,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031844_0187_0FEF1EFE64E60798"/>
being natural, is common to all mankind. Men, pained with this thirſt, do naturally run, for quenching thereof, to the empty creation, and their fulſome luſts: and ſo they <hi>ſpend money for that which is not bread,</hi> and their <hi>labour, for that which ſatisfieth not;</hi> finding nothing there that can ſatisfy that their appetite, or thirſt—As little is the ſolemn goſpel-offer (Matt. xi. 28.) reſtricted to a certain ſet of men endowed with ſome laudable <hi>qualifications,</hi> going under the name of <hi>labouring</hi> and being <hi>heavy-laden:</hi> the which do, indeed, denote the <hi>reſtleſſneſs</hi> natural to the ſinful ſoul of man, ſpending its labour <hi>for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> Our father Adam left his whole family with a conſcience full of guilt, and a heart full of unſatisfied deſires. Thus we naturally having a reſtleſs conſcience, and a reſtleſs heart, the ſoul as naturally falls a labouring for reſt to them. And it labours in the barren region of the fiery law, for a reſt to the conſcience; and in the empty creation, for a reſt to the heart. But, after all, the conſcience is ſtill heavy-laden with guilt,—and the heart is ſtill under a load of unſatisfied deſires. So neither the one, nor the other, can find reſt indeed. This is the natural caſe of all men: and to ſouls thus <hi>labouring</hi> and <hi>laden,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt calls, that they may <hi>come to him, and he will give them reſt:</hi> namely, a reſt for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, under the covert of his blood; and a reſt to their hearts, in the enjoyment of God through him<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:031844_0188_0FEF1F05B0E6AD40"/>It has, with ſome degree of confidence, been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<q>Whether, if ſinners muſt not come to Chriſt <hi>as penitent,</hi> and as poſſeſſing an <hi>holy diſpoſition;</hi> they are to believe in him, <hi>as impenitent,</hi> and as under the <hi>reigning power</hi> of their depravity?</q>
But this, like ſome other objections, is not pertinent. For the queſtion is, What is the proper <hi>warrant</hi> for a ſinner to believe in Jeſus? Not, What is <hi>the ſtate of his heart,</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he firſt believes?—Or, if the objection did apply, it might be anſwered; Neither <hi>as</hi> a penitent, nor <hi>as</hi> an impenitent ſinner: but merely under the character of one that is <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>periſhing.</hi> It was for ſuch that Jeſus died: it is to ſuch the tidings of ſalvation were addreſſed by the Apoſtles: and, therefore, ſuch are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to believe in Chriſt. The objector might, conſequently, with equal reaſon have aſked; Whether, in a public miniſtry, ſalvation by the Redeemer ſhould be exhibited to <hi>penitents,</hi> or to <hi>impenitents;</hi> to thoſe that have ſome degree of holineſs, or to thoſe who have none? and then the anſwer would have been; To nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>thoſe,</hi> nor <hi>theſe,</hi> reſpectively <hi>as</hi> ſuch: but to all of them, without exception, as deſerving condemnation and final miſery. Nor is there any reaſon to doubt, whether he to whom, by divine authority, ſalvation through Chriſt is preached, be warranted to believe in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:031844_0189_0FEF1F014E503710"/>It has been objected,
<q>To aſſert that ſinners, while deſtitute of holineſs, are warranted to believe in Chriſt; is to maintain, that they are authoriſed to expect the felicity of heaven, while their native love of ſin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in all its force, and while they are hardened rebels againſt God.</q>
But there is a great and palpable difference between perſons, while in their native ſtate, being authoriſed to <hi>believe</hi> in Jeſus; and their being warranted, while in that condition, to <hi>expect</hi> final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Yet this objection proceeds on a ſuppoſition, that whoever is encouraged by the word of grace to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Chriſt; is, at the very ſame inſtant, merely on the ſame ground, and while an unbeliever, equally au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to expect everlaſting life: which is a groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. For he that believes in Chriſt, relies on him as <hi>juſtifying the ungodly:</hi> but he who, on ſcriptural grounds, hopes for future felicity, expects it as a believer; as in a juſtified ſtate; as having a turn of heart, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſuited to the employments and enjoyments of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Becauſe, <hi>without holineſs, no one ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>— Did Paul, for inſtance, <hi>believe</hi> in Jeſus? it was under the conſideration of himſelf, as <hi>a blaſphemer, a perſecutor,</hi> and <hi>the chief of ſinners</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 13, 14, 15</note>. Did he rejoice in <hi>hope?</hi> it was, as having <hi>received the atonement</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. v. 1, 2, 11.</note>; as bearing the image of Chriſt; and as having a ſpiritual reliſh for
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031844_0190_0FEF1F08A23FC2E0"/>
heavenly things. The <hi>ſinner</hi> believes: the <hi>believer</hi> hopes.—Nor can any man believe in Chriſt, and <hi>continue</hi> a rebel againſt God: for ſovereign mercy, when it relieves the conſcience, alters the bias of the heart, and forms the character anew. God, in the exerciſe and manifeſtation of pardoning grace to rebels, makes them his friends. Thus divine <hi>goodneſs leads to repentance,</hi> to holineſs, and to hope of everlaſting happineſs. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with God, that he may be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If we maintain that the ungodly are warranted to believe in Jeſus, there will be great danger of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging a ſuperficial, Antinomian faith. Becauſe guilty creatures, under the power of their depravity, are much more likely to approve the character of Chriſt, when repreſented as willing to receive the altogether unholy; than if he were conſidered as receiving none but thoſe who are cordially diſpoſed to perform the divine precepts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the ſentiment for which I plead, may be proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to licentious purpoſes; and that, in certain inſtances, it probably has been ſo abuſed, will be admitted. But, be that as it may, Jeſus muſt either be ſo exhibited in a public miniſtry, as to ſuit the character, the ſtate, the circumſtances of apoſtate creatures, or there is no <hi>goſpel</hi> for them. Beſides, the miſapplication of any doctrine, affords no argument againſt, either its truth, or its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031844_0191_0FEF1F0B8A8C9F60"/>
becauſe the moſt excellent doctrines, and the plaineſt paſſages of Scripture, have been frequently abuſed to execrable purpoſes.</p>
               <p>This objection ſeems to imply, that a ſelfrighteous turn of heart, and phariſaical pride, make no part of human depravity. For it apparently ſuppoſes, that there is little or no danger of ſinners treating Chriſt with diſreſpect, except by conſidering him as <hi>the miniſter of ſin:</hi> or, of their oppoſing the deſigns of divine grace, in any way, beſides that of licentiouſneſs. But it appears, from Scripture, from experience, and from obſervation, that ſinners are naturally and ſtrongly inclined to ſeek juſtification <hi>by the works of the law;</hi> that a violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to cheriſh the notion of ſelf-worthineſs, is an eſſential part of their natural depravity; and that the diſreſpect with which Chriſt is generally treated by them, ariſes principally from that quarter. Yes, their low thoughts reſpecting the evil of ſin, and the high opinion they form of their own character, are the chief ſource of that neglect with which they treat the divine Jeſus, and of all their oppoſition to ſaving grace. Nay, ſo univerſal, and ſo predominant is this propenſity to ſelf-worthineſs, that, for <hi>one</hi> who abuſes the ſentiment here defended, by converting it into an occaſion of ſin; <hi>ten thouſand</hi> may be juſtly conſidered as diſhonouring Chriſt, and as rebelling againſt God, under the pernicious influence of that principle which I oppoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:031844_0192_0FEF1F0D1AF27FA0"/>It is a great miſtake to imagine, that ungodly men are ſo ready to adopt the ſentiment for which I contend. Certain it is, from the hiſtory of our Lord's miniſtry, and from the writings of Paul, that few things in the preaching, either of Chriſt, or of the Apoſtle, were ſo offenſive to perſons of reſpectability among the Jews, as the doctrine which they preached, relative to pardon and acceptance with God. The diſcourſes of Jeſus, reſpecting divine grace, were extremely offenſive to the Scribes, the Phariſees, and the reputedly devout in general. But, had the tenour of our Saviour's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of his converſe among the people, been contrary to the principle here avowed; it is not ſuppoſable that the Jews would have ſo frequently complained of him, and objected againſt his conduct, as they did. Witneſs the following ſayings: <hi>Why eateth your Maſter with publicans and ſinners?—Behold—a friend of publicans and ſinners!—Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and ſinners?—This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for ſhe is a ſinner—This man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with them—They murmured ſaying, That he was gone to be gueſt with a man that is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. ix. 11. xi. 19. Luke v. 30. vii. 39. xv. 2. xix. 7.</note>. Now, it is evident, theſe murmurers and objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were the reputedly devout; thoſe who conſidered
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:031844_0193_0FEF1F0EA9D8C4C0"/>
themſelves, and were conſidered by others, as poſſeſſing virtuous diſpoſitions and holy zeal: yet they were thoſe to whom our Lord addreſſed himſelf in the following manner; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, That the publicans and the harlots,</hi> the moſt profligate of both ſexes, <hi>go into the kingdom of heaven before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 31, 32.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such was the treatment of Jeſus, by the moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of the public; and ſuch was his language concerning thoſe who, under the fair pretext of zeal for holineſs, rejected his doctrine, and perſecuted his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! With reference to whom, when arguing on their ſelfrighteous principles in vindication of his own conduct, he ſpake three admirably gracious Parables at the ſame time, which Luke has recorded <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xv</note>.—Now, can it be ſuppoſed, with any appearance of probability, that the ſelfrighteous Jews would have caſt ſuch reflections on the character of Chriſt, as a public teacher, if he had inſiſted on any degree of perſonal holineſs, as previouſly neceſſary to faith in revealed mercy, as the only ground of acceptance with God? Had our Lord, in the courſe of his miniſtry, from time to time aſſured them, that every one muſt, prior to receiving his teſtimony of
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031844_0194_0FEF1F14594ED220"/>
pardoning mercy and believing in him, be heartily diſpoſed to keep the commands of God; they could not, with any ſhadow of reaſon, have raiſed ſuch a clamour againſt his doctrine and conduct.</p>
               <p>That the miniſtry of Paul was perfectly conſiſtent with the ſentiment here defended, appears from thoſe objections with which he meets, kand from the anſwers which he returns. Thus, for example: <hi>Some affirm that we ſay, Let us do evil, that good may come—Do we then make void the law through faith?—Shall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound?—Shall we ſin, becauſe we are not under the law, but under grace</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 7, 8, 31. vi. 1, 15.</note>?—Such were the objections: and they imply, That, in the eſtimation of thoſe who made them, the doctrine of Paul, implicitly, or by neceſſary conſequence, <hi>vacated the authority of God</hi> in his law—That believers, being delivered from the kw, as a covenant, or as preſcribing the condition on which everlaſting life is to be obtained, may ſafely <hi>continue in ſin</hi>—That ſuch continuance in the practice of ſin, would <hi>illuſtrate the riches,</hi> and <hi>manifeſt the glory,</hi> of divine grace—And that, by accumulating moral evil, <hi>the higheſt good would be promoted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſuch various and formidable objections was the doctrine of Paul conſidered, by multitudes, as juſtly
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031844_0195_0FEF1F173A8BA008"/>
expoſed! objections, however, which he repelled with abhorrence, and refuted with eaſe. But, could any perſon of common underſtanding, with the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of propriety, have made theſe objections to the goſpel which Paul preached, if he had taught, That an <hi>holy turn of heart, a diſpoſition to perform the commands of God,</hi> or <hi>the exerciſe of virtue,</hi> is previouſly neceſſary to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a ſinner's dependence on Jeſus Chriſt for pardon and peace? Common ſenſe, and a moment's reflection, forbid the thought. For, on that ſuppoſition, he muſt have laid the foundation of expecting any ſpiritual benefit from Chriſt, in the <hi>previous, perſonal holineſs</hi> of every ſinner who applies to him: which would have ſubverted the whole of his doctrine, reſpecting the juſtification of ſinners before God.—Has it been uſual—I appeal to the intelligent reader—has it been uſual, in modern times, for the doctrine of religious teachers to be charged with ſuch conſequences, or to be oppoſed by ſuch objections; when it was notorious, that they firmly inſiſted on the neceſſity of every one exerciſing virtue, or poſſeſſing ſome degree of true holineſs, in order to warrant a reliance on Jeſus Chriſt for pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance? Was any teacher of religion ever charged with <hi>making void the law;</hi> or with implicitly ſaying, <hi>Let us do evil, that good may come;</hi> by thoſe who heard his diſcourſes, or peruſed his writings, in which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that no ſinner is authoriſed to believe in Chriſt, until he is <hi>diſpoſed to obſerve the divine precepts?</hi> Surely
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031844_0196_0FEF1F1A2C9FACF0"/>
not! or, if a fact, the objector's conduct muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the effuſion of mental imbecility, as a violent paroxyſm of prejudice, or as the virulence of deliberate malice.</p>
               <p>But if, on the contrary, we underſtand Paul as maintaining, That Chriſt, with all his fulneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings, is <hi>free, perfectly</hi> free for the vileſt; if we conſider him as encouraging the <hi>chief</hi> of ſinners, merely under the character of periſhing wretches, to rely on Jeſus for their immediate acceptance with God, and as giving them aſſurance that, in ſo doing, they ſhall not be diſappointed; if we further conſider the Apoſtle as teaching, that the juſtification of ſinners is merely, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, abſolutely on the ground of our Lord's vicarious obedience imputed; <hi>then</hi> we perceive the true ſource of theſe objections. For that doctrine, in the eyes of all whoſe hearts are leavened with legal pride, will ever be treated as an inſult on moral virtue; as inimical to the divine law; and as having the moſt licentious tendency. The ſame doctrine, it is apparent, is oppoſed by ſimilar objections in our own times: but, <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principle for which I plead will be further confirmed, if we take into conſideration thoſe <hi>replies</hi> which the Apoſtle made in defence of his doctrine. How, then, does he anſwer the unfounded and calum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niating
<pb facs="unknown:031844_0197_0FEF1F616CE89500"/>
objections? Not by ſaying,
<q>No: I never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, I never meant, that ſinners may believe in Chriſt, for pardon and peace, before they are diſpoſed to obſerve the divine precepts. I always taught, that they muſt love God, or be virtuouſly inclined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his will, before they can acceptably believe in Chriſt.</q>
—But, inſtead of replying in that manner, his anſwers are? It is a <hi>ſlanderous report;</hi> and the <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe who raiſed it <hi>is juſt—God forbid! yea, we eſtabliſh the law—God forbid! how ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein? God forbid! know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs? But God be thanked, that</hi> though, before ye believed in Jeſus, <hi>ye were the ſervants,</hi> or ſlaves, <hi>of ſin;</hi> yet <hi>ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 8, 31. vi. 2, 15, 16, 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee, that Paul repels and refutes the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by ſtrong negations; by ſhowing the abſurdity of thoſe grounds on which ſome of them proceed; and by denouncing the judgment of God againſt all thoſe who dared, out of hatred to evangelical truth, maliciouſly to ſlander the apoſtolic miniſtry. It ſhould be obſerved, however, that the Apoſtle does not give the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his doctrine having been miſunderſtood, relative
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031844_0198_0FEF1F231E5077B0"/>
to the <hi>moral ſtate</hi> of thoſe whom he encouraged to believe in Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins, and acceptance with God.—To prove that none can juſtly conſider themſelves as having <hi>already</hi> believed in Chriſt, except they be cordially diſpoſed to holy obedience, his replies are pertinent and ſtrong: but they do not in the leaſt imply, that ſinners muſt have ſome degree of holineſs, or that they muſt exerciſe virtue, before they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to believe in him. The want of obſerving this obvious diſtinction, ſeems to be the principal reaſon of that confuſion which often attends the ideas of ſerious perſons on this important ſubject; and of thoſe miſtakes into which they fall, relative to the true ground of a ſinner's application to Chriſt, by which their conſciences are frequently ſo much embarraſſed.</p>
               <p>Once more: It may, perhaps, be objected;
<q>The principle defended infers the doctrine of <hi>general redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </q>
To this I anſwer, in the words of Dr. OWEN.
<q>Many diſputes there are, <hi>whether Chriſt died for all individuals of mankind, or no.</hi> If we ſay <hi>No,</hi> but only for the elect, who are <hi>ſome of all ſorts:</hi> ſome then tell us, we cannot invite all men promiſcuouſly to believe. But why ſo? We invite not men, as <hi>all</hi> men; no man, as <hi>one</hi> of all men; but all men as <hi>ſinners:</hi> and we know that Chriſt <hi>died for ſinners.</hi> But, is this the <hi>firſt</hi> thing, that we are, in the diſpenſation of the goſpel, to propoſe to the ſoul of a ſinner, under the law, <hi>That
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:031844_0199_0FEF1F24A5276DC8"/>
Chriſt died for</hi> HIM <hi>in particular?</hi> Is that the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of our meſſage unto him? Were not this a ready way to induce him to conclude, Let me then continue in ſin, that grace may abound? No: but this is, in order of nature, our firſt work; even <hi>that</hi> we have had in hand. This is the beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. This is <hi>the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi> There is a way of reconciliation provided. God is in Chriſt <hi>reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> There is a way of acceptance: <hi>there is forgiveneſs with him</hi> to be obtained. At this <hi>threſhold</hi> of the Lord's houſe, doth the greateſt part of men to whom the goſpel is preached fall and periſh; never looking in to ſee the treaſures that are in the houſe itſelf; never coming into any ſuch ſtate and condition, wherein they have any ground or bottom to enquire, Whether Chriſt died for them, in particular, or no? They believe not this report, nor take any ſerious notice of it. This was the miniſtry of the Baptiſt; and they who received it not, <hi>rejected the counſel of God</hi> concerning their ſalvation; and ſo periſhed in their ſins. This is the ſum of the bleſſed <hi>invitation</hi> given by Wiſdom: and here men ſtumble, fall, and periſh. Luke vii. 10. Prov. ix. 1—5. i. 29, 30<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <hi>THE truth, as it is in Jeſus,</hi> being the doctrine <hi>according to godlineſs</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 21. 1 Tim. vi. 3.

Of this nature is the ſentiment for which I plead; as, perhaps, may appear by the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It has a natural tendency to humble ſelf-righteous pride, by annihilating all diſtinctions among men, reſpecting the ground of their acceptance with God.</hi> Now this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeable to the genius of evangelical truth, and to the nature of Meſſiah's kingdom; as appears by the following prophetic Oracle, relative to the miniſtry of John the Baptiſt, and the commencement of goſpel times. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtraight in the deſert a highway for our God. Every valley ſhall be exalted, and every mountaim and hill ſhall be made low: and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough places plain: and the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Job xi. 12.</note>; ſo proud man would be righteous, though guilty before God, and obnoxious to ruin. If, however, the divine law be equitable, ſinners are juſtly accurſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note>; and, if their condemnation be righteous, they cannot have the leaſt hope, except through ſovereign mercy.— A ſmall degree of difference from others, with regard to exterior character, is commonly conſidered, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as recommending to the favour of God, and as furniſhing a ground of hope, through Jeſus Chriſt. Now, in whomſoever this perſuaſion prevails, the goſpel is underſtood as directing all the relief it reveals, to the qualified, the virtuous, the worthy: not the guilty, the vile, and the wretched. It is conſidered, therefore, not as adapted to humble the proud heart, and to relieve the pained conſcience; but as maintaining a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between different characters, and as paying a juſt regard to human worth. While, conſequently, to multitudes, who think themſelves comparatively righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it miniſters food for ſelf importance; it leaves others, who conſider themſelves as the chief of ſinners, without the leaſt foundation of hope.—The principle,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031844_0202_0FEF1F2EF4CD2A88"/>
however, for which I contend, has a directly contrary tendency: for, in prophetic language, it <hi>levels</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and <hi>elevates</hi> valleys. Or, in the words of our Lord, it <hi>abaſes</hi> thoſe that are exalted, and <hi>exalts</hi> thoſe that are abaſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 12. Luke xiv. 11. xviii. 14.</note>. Becauſe it maintains, that there is the very <hi>ſame</hi> ground of encouragement, and to an <hi>equal</hi> degree, for men to belive in Jeſus, whether they be eſteemed moral, or profligate; pious, or profane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is moſt happily ſuited to relieve thoſe who are held in the ſnare of deſpondency, by forbidding deſpair in the vileſt wretch that lives.</hi> Many there are, we have reaſon to think, who, having, for a long courſe of time, violated the dictates of conſcience, by indulging their worſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities; having, in multiplied inſtances, acted contrary to friendly advice, to their own reſolutions, promiſes, vows; and having, perhaps, been the manifeſt occaſion of ruin to various others; implicitly ſay, with thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>There is no hope: no; for we have loved ſtrangers, and after them will we go</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. ii. 25.</note>. Thus, in a kind of ſullen deſpair, they harden their conſciences; in order to enjoy, for a while, the pleaſures of ſin, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, and without remorſe. Perceiving no reaſon for hope, they endeavour to diſcard fear. Having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that <hi>there is forgiveneſs with God,</hi> for perſons in
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031844_0203_0FEF1F31DFA94150"/>
their ſituation; or that ſuch enormous offenders may find acceptance through Jeſus Chriſt; they ruſh on to final ruin. For, where there is no hope of eſcaping evil, there are no efforts to guard againſt it.</p>
               <p>The doctrine for which I plead, is, however, adapted to break the deſtructive ſnare, by exhibiting a ground of hope. Yes, the gracious goſpel, conſidered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete warrant for the ungodly to believe in Jeſus, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the moſt profligate, and the moſt criminal, to regard the atonement of Chriſt as allſufficient.
<q>There is not,</q>
as one obſerves,
<q>a more effectual remedy [againſt deſpondency,] than the conſideration of the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of the grace of God in Chriſt and the promiſes: which are not made to ſuch as <hi>deſerve</hi> mercy, but to ſuch as <hi>want</hi> it; not to righteous perſons, but to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; not to the whole, but to the ſick—Of all the ways and experiments to bear up a ſinking ſpirit, there is no conſideration like this, That from the beginning to the end of our ſalvation, nothing is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily active but <hi>free grace.</hi> This is a firm bottom of comfort againſt the guilt of the moſt bloody and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſins: becauſe free grace is not tied to any rules: it may do what it pleaſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. SPURSTOWE'S <hi>Wells of Salvation opened,</hi> p. 50, 51.</note>.</q>
It belongs, indeed, to the very nature of <hi>grace,</hi> properly ſo called, to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free and ſovereign, in all its beſtowments: for

where there is deſert, whether intrinſic or pactional, the operation of grace neceſſarily ceaſes, and, if recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude prevail, that of equity takes place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is admirably fitted to excite hope and produce comfort in thoſe who, though not ſunk in deſpondency, are deeply diſtreſſed by a ſenſe of guilt, of depravity, and of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</hi> Are the conſciences of men alarmed, by a conviction of ſin, and an apprehenſion of deſerved wrath for paſt offences? Are ſinners, being acquainted with their own hearts, conſcious of ſtrong propenſities to evil, and of numerous criminal imperfections attending their beſt performances? they conſider themſelves as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vile. Diſcerning nothing in their hearts, nor any thing in their lives, which deſerves the name of <hi>holineſs;</hi> but, on the contrary, much that ſeems to mark them out for deſtruction; they have nothing to remove their painful fears, or to relieve their burdened conſciences, except what the goſpel ſays concerning divine mercy, as manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt. He being revealed, however, as perfectly ſuitable to their wants, and as completely free for their acceptance; they are preſented, by ſovereign grace, with an allſufficient Saviour for their immediate dependence. Conſiding in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God as true, and receiving the proviſion of his grace as a free gift; they find relief, and enjoy peace Nor does the comfort obtained ariſe from reflecting on the <hi>manner</hi> in which they believe, but from that <hi>grace</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:031844_0205_0FEF1F37D99C1F30"/>
which the goſpel reveals, and from the <hi>allſufficiency</hi> of Jeſus in whom they truſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is of great importance to the real Chriſtian, in times of ſpiritual darkneſs and of diſcouragement.</hi> Has he, by the power of indwelling ſin, or through the force of Satan's temptations, loſt that peace which ariſes from a view of intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt? Is he incapable of approaching God with a filial confidence, crying, <hi>Abba Father?</hi> he recurs to this truth, as the firſt ſpring of his encouragement, and, under the character of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> applies to Chriſt afreſh. It being fixed in his mind, as a leading principle of revealed truth, that the moſt ungodly are authoriſed to believe in Jeſus; and that no degree of previous holineſs is neceſſary for that purpoſe; he cannot, even in his worſt condition, but conſider himſelf as within the verge of that encouragement. As, therefore, it is by faith in Chriſt that he derives hope; and as, under the influence of hope, ſpiritual endeavours are excited; ſo, in this procedure, not only peace of conſcience, but prayer and watchfulneſs, brotherly love and ſelf-denial, communion with God and heavenly mindedneſs, are promoted.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 14.</note>; and though, by the word of truth, that divine Agent produce, excite, and maintain devout affections in the ſoul; yet we ought never to conſider ſubſtantial evidence of true godlineſs, as ariſing from ſecret impulſes, however ſtrong; nor from tranſient flaſhes of religious affection, be they ever ſo high: but from the <hi>general frame</hi> of the heart, reſpecting the glorious God, as revealing himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is of great moment in the Chriſtian's daily walk with God.</hi> The reaſon is, it has a powerful tendency to promote an habitual regard to the word of grace and the atonement of Chriſt, as the only ſource of ſpiritual peace. The Chriſtian, being conſcious of daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting freſh guilt, conſidering his tranſgreſſions, and his numerous imperfections in religious duty, as attended with peculiar aggravations, ariſing from his knowledge of the divine will, the bleſſings he enjoys, the profeſſion he makes, and the character he bears; it is only by an

               <p>Dr. OWEN, when directing ſinners to regard that forgiveneſs which is with God, as the firſt ſource of their encouragement, ſays;
<q>This is the <hi>only</hi> way and means to enable you to obedience, and to render what you do therein acceptable unto God. It may be, that ſome of you are under the power of convictions, and have
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031844_0210_0FEF1F46872CCAC0"/>
made engagements unto God to live unto him, to keep yourſelves from ſin, and to follow after holineſs. It may be, you have done ſo in afflictions, dangers, ſickneſſes, or upon the receipt of mercies: but yet you find that you cannot come unto any ſtability, or conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, in your courſe. You break with God and your own ſouls, which fills you with new diſquietments; or elſe hardens you, and makes you ſecure and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: ſo that you return unto your purpoſes no oftener, than your convictions, or afflictions, befal you anew. This condition is ruinous and pernicious, which nothing can deliver you from, but this cloſing with forgiveneſs. For, all that you do without this, however it may pleaſe your minds, or eaſe your conſciences, is not at all accepted with God. Unleſs this foundation be laid, all that you do is loſt. All your prayers, all your duties, all your amendments, are an abomination to the Lord. Until peace is made with him, they are but the acts of enemies, which he deſpiſeth and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. You run, it may be, earneſtly; but you run out of the way: you ſtrive, but not lawfully, and ſhall never receive the crown. True goſpel obedience is the fruit of the faith of forgiveneſs. Whatever you do without it, is but a building without a foundation; a caſtle in the air. You may ſee the order of goſpel obedience, Eph. ii. 7—10. The foundation muſt be laid in <hi>grace; riches of grace,</hi> by Chriſt, in the free pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin. From hence muſt the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031844_0211_0FEF1F4AF3438CE8"/>
works of obedience proceed, if you would have them to be of God's appointment, or find acceptance with him. Without this, God will ſay of all your ſervices, worſhip, obedience, as he did to the Iſraelites of old, (Amos v. 21—25.) <hi>I deſpiſe all; reject it all:</hi> it is not to him, nor to his glory, Now, if you are under convictions of any ſort, there is nothing you more value, nothing you more place your confidence in, than your duties: your repentance, your amendment: what you do, and what in good time you will be. Is it nothing unto you, to loſe all your hopes and all your expectations, which you have from hence? To have no other reception with God, than if all this time you had been wallowing in your ſins and luſts? Yet thus it is with you, if you have not begun with God on his own terms; if you have not <hi>received the atonement,</hi> in the blood of his Son; if you are not made partakers of forgiveneſs; if your perſons are not pardoned, all your duties are accurſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This alone will give you ſuch motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements unto obedience, as will give you life, alacrity, and delight in it. You perform duties, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſins; but with heavineſs, fear, and in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Could you do as well without them, as with them; would conſcience be quiet, and hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hold out; you would omit them forever. This makes all your obedience burdenſome; and you cry

out in your thoughts, with him in the Prophet; <hi>Behold, what a wearineſs it is!</hi> The ſervice of God is the only drudgery of your lives; which you dare not omit, and delight not to perform. From this wretched and curſed frame, there is nothing that can deliver you but this cloſing with forgiveneſs. This will give you ſuch motives, ſuch encouragements, as will greatly influence your hearts and ſouls. It will give you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, liberty, delight and cheerfulneſs, in all duties of goſpel obedience. You will find a conſtraining power in the love of Chriſt therein: a freedom from bondage, when the Son truly hath made you free. Faith and love will work genuinely and naturally in your ſpirits; and that which was your greateſt burden, will become your chiefeſt joy. (2 Cor. vii. 1.) Thoughts of the love of God, of the blood of Chriſt, or the Covenant of Grace, and ſenſe of pardon in them, will enlarge your hearts, and ſweeten all your duties. You will find a new life, a new pleaſure, a new ſatisfaction, in all that you do <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Relative to theſe particulars, to ſome articles of Chriſtian experience, and to the ſtate of unconverted ſinners; I ſhall conclude the whole with various extracts from Dr. OWEN. Thus, then, that judicious Author:
<q>Our <hi>foundation</hi> in dealing with God, is Chriſt alone; <hi>mere</hi> grace, and pardon in him. Our <hi>building</hi> is in and by holineſs and obedience; as the fruits of that faith by which we have received the atonement. And great miſtakes there are in this matter, which bring great intanglements on the ſouls of men. Some are all their days laying the foundation, and are never able to build upon it, unto any comfort to themſelves, or uſefulneſs to others: and the reaſon is, becauſe they will be mixing with the foundation ſtones, that are ſit only for the following building. They will be bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their obedience, duties, mortification of ſin, and the like, unto the foundation. Theſe are precious ſtones to <hi>build</hi> with, but unmeet to be firſt laid to bear upon them the <hi>whole weight</hi> of the building. The foundation is to be laid, as was ſaid, in <hi>mere grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="unknown:031844_0215_0FEF1F58B7A4F6F0"/>
mercy, pardon in the blood of Chriſt. This the ſoul is to accept of, and to reſt in, <hi>merely as it is</hi> GRACE; without the conſideration of any thing in itſelf, but that it is ſinful and obnoxious unto ruin. This it finds a difficulty in, and would gladly have ſomething of its own to mix with it. It cannot tell how to fix theſe foundation ſtones, without ſome cement of its own endeavours and duty: and becauſe theſe things will not mix, they ſpend a fruitleſs labour about it all their days. But, if the foundation be <hi>of grace,</hi> it is not at all <hi>of works:</hi> for, otherwiſe, <hi>grace is no more grace.</hi> If any thing of our own be mixed with grace in this matter, it utterly deſtroys the nature of <hi>grace;</hi> which, if it be not <hi>alone,</hi> it is <hi>not at all.</hi> But doth not this tend to licentiouſneſs? Doth not this render obedience, holineſs, duties, mortification of ſin, and good works, needleſs? God forbid! yea, this is the only way to order them aright unto the glory of God. Have we nothing to do, but <hi>to lay the foundation?</hi> yes, all our days we are to <hi>build</hi> upon it, when it is ſurely and firmly laid. And theſe are the means and ways of our edification. This, then, is the ſoul to do, who would come to peace and ſettlement. Let it let go all former endeavours, if it have been engaged unto any of that kind: and let it alone receive, admit of, and adhere to <hi>mere grace, mercy, and pardon;</hi> with a full ſenſe that, in its ſelf, it hath nothing for which it ſhould have an intereſt in them, but that all is of mere

                  <q>You know how fatal and ruinous it is, for ſouls to abuſe the grace of God, and the apprehenſion of the pardon of ſins, in the courſe of their obedience to countenance themſelves in ſin, or the negligence of any duty. This is to turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, as we have elſewhere at large declared. And it is no leſs pernicious, to bring the duties of our obedience; any reſerves for them; any hopes about them, into the matter of pardon and forgiveneſs, as we are to receive them from God. But theſe things, as they are diſtinct in themſelves, ſo they muſt be diſtinctly

managed in the ſoul: and the confounding of them, is that which diſturbs the peace, and weakens the obedience of many. In a confuſed manner, they labour to keep up a life of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>duty;</hi> which will be, in their places, conjoined, but not mixed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Firſt, to take up mercy, pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, <hi>abſolutely on the account of Chriſt;</hi> and then to yield all obedience in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Chriſt, and for the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt, is the life of a believer<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>They that believe <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> in a due manner, believe it for the ends and purpoſes for which it is revealed of God—If God reveals any thing for <hi>one</hi> end and purpoſe, and men uſe it quite unto <hi>another;</hi> they do not receive the word of God, nor believe the thing revealed, but ſteal the word, and delude their own ſouls. Let us then weigh, to what end and purpoſes this forgiveneſs was firſt revealed by God; for which alſo its manifeſtation is ſtill continued in the goſpel. We have ſhewed before, who it was to whom this revelation was made, and what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was in, when firſt it was made unto him. A loſt, wretched creature, without hope or help, he was: how he ſhould come to obtain acceptance with God, he knew not. God reveals forgiveneſs unto him, by Chriſt, to be <hi>his all.</hi> The intention of God in it was,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:031844_0218_0FEF1F202C785E70"/>
that a ſinner's ALL <hi>ſhould be of grace.</hi> (Rom. xi. 6.) If any thing be added unto it, for the ſame end and purpoſe, then <hi>grace is no more grace.</hi> Again, God intended it as a <hi>new foundation</hi> of obedience, of love, and thankfulneſs. That men ſhould <hi>love,</hi> becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; and be <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe pardoned, as I have ſhewed before; that it might be the righteouſneſs of a ſinner, and a ſpring of new obedience in him, all to the praiſe of grace, were God's ends in its revelation <note n="*" place="bottom">

Some men have no peace, becauſe they have <hi>that,</hi> without which it is impoſſible they ſhould have peace. Becauſe they cannot but condemn themſelves, they cannot entertain a ſenſe that God doth acquit them. But this is the myſtery of the goſpel, which unbelief is a ſtranger unto. Nothing but <hi>faith</hi> can give a real ſubſiſtence unto theſe things, in the ſame ſoul, and the ſame time. It is eaſy to learn the <hi>notion</hi> of it, but it is not eaſy to experience the <hi>power</hi> of it. For a man to have a ſight of that <hi>within</hi> him, which would condemn him, for which he is troubled; and, at the ſame time, to have a diſcovery of that <hi>without</hi> him, which will juſtify him, and to rejoice therein; is that which he is not led unto, but by faith in the myſtery of the goſpel.
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:031844_0219_0FEF1F6479839A30"/>
We are now under <hi>a law for juſtification,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all boaſting, Rom. iii. 27. So that though we have joy enough in another, yet we <hi>may</hi> have, we always <hi>have,</hi> ſufficient cauſe of humiliation in ourſelves. The goſpel will teach a man to <hi>feel</hi> ſin, and <hi>believe</hi> righteouſneſs, at the ſame time. Faith will carry heaven in one hand, and hell in the other; ſhewing the one deſerved, the other purchaſed. A man may ſee enough of his own ſin and folly, to bring <hi>Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi rend="sup">è</hi> Coelo,</hi> a hell of wrath out of heaven; and yet ſee Chriſt bring <hi>Coelum ex Inferno,</hi> a heaven of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of an hell of puniſhment. And theſe muſt needs produce very diverſe, yea contrary effects and operations in the ſoul: and he who knows not how to aſſign them their proper duties, and ſeaſons, muſt needs be perplexed. The work of ſelf-condemnation, then, which men in theſe [painful exerciſes] cannot but abound with, is, in the diſpoſition of the Covenant of Grace, no way inconſiſtent with, nor unſuited unto, juſtification, and the enjoyment of peace, in the ſenſe of it. There may be a deep ſenſe of ſin, on other conſiderations beſides <hi>hell.</hi> David was never more humbled for ſin, than when Nathan told him it was forgiven: and there may be a view of hell, as <hi>deſerved;</hi> which yet the ſoul may know itſelf freed from, as to the <hi>iſſue</hi>—A deep ſenſe of the evil of ſin, of the guilt of [a] man's <hi>own</hi> ſin, is no way inconſiſtent with goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel aſſurance of acceptance with God through Chriſt,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031844_0220_0FEF1F676F5BC398"/>
and of forgiveneſs in him. By a ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, I underſtand two things; a clear conviction of ſin, by the Holy Ghoſt ſaying unto the ſoul, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> and a ſenſe <hi>
                        <hi rend="sup">c</hi>
                     </hi> the diſpleaſure of God, or the wrath due to ſin, according to the ſentence of the law —Deep ſorrow for ſin is conſiſtent with aſſurance of forgiveneſs: yea, it is a great means of preſervation of it. Godly ſorrow, mourning, humiliation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triteneſs of ſpirit, are no leſs goſpel graces, and fruits of the Holy Ghoſt, than faith itſelf; and ſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the higheſt flouriſhings of faith whatever. It is the work of <hi>heaven itſelf,</hi> and not of the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it, to wipe all tears from our eyes—Sorrow, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excluſive of the faith of forgiveneſs, is <hi>legal,</hi> and tendeth to death. Aſſurance, abſolutely excluſive of godly ſorrow, is <hi>preſumption,</hi> and not a <hi>perſuaſion from him that calleth us.</hi> But, goſpel-ſorrow, and goſpel-aſſurance, may well dwell in the ſame breaſt, at the ſame time. Indeed, as in all worldly joys there is a ſecret wound; ſo, in all godly ſorrow and mourning, conſidered in itſelf, there is a ſecret joy and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence it doth not wither and dry up, but rather enlarge, open, and ſweeten the heart. I am perſuaded, that, generally, they <hi>mourn moſt</hi> who have <hi>moſt aſſurance.</hi> All true, goſpel mourners, will be found to have the root of aſſurance ſo grafted in them, that, in its proper ſeaſon (a time of trouble) it will undoubtedly flouriſh.</q>

                     <hi>Known</hi> holineſs, is apt to degenerate into ſelfrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.

What is it that is troubled and grieved in thee? What is it, that ſeems to be almoſt killed and deſtroyed; that cries out, complains, longs for deliverance? Is it not the new creature? Is it not the principle of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, whereof thou art partaker? I ſpeak not of trouble and diſquietments for ſin committed; nor of fears and perturbations of mind, leſt ſin ſhould break forth to loſs, ſhame, ruin, diſhonour; nor of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of a convinced conſcience, leſt damnation ſhould enſue; but of the ſpirit againſt ſin, out of a <hi>hatred</hi> and a <hi>lothing</hi> of it, upon all the mixed conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of love, grace, mercy, fear, the beauty of holineſs, excellency of communion with God, that are propoſed in the goſpel. If thou ſeemeſt to thyſelf to be only <hi>paſſive</hi> in theſe things; to <hi>do</hi> nothing, but to <hi>endure</hi> the aſſaults of ſin; yet if thou art ſenſible, and ſtandeſt under the ſtroke of it, as under the ſtroke of

an enemy, there is the root of the matter. And as it is thus, as to the ſubſtance and <hi>being</hi> of holineſs, ſo it is alſo as to the <hi>degrees</hi> of it. Degrees of holineſs, are to be meaſured more by oppoſition, than ſelf opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He may have more grace than another, who brings not forth ſo much fruit as the other; becauſe he hath more oppoſition, more temptation: and ſenſe of the want of ALL, is a great ſign of <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in the ſoul— It is certain, whilſt we are in the fleſh, our duties will taſte of the veſſel whence they proceed. Weakneſs, defilements, treachery, hypocriſy, will attend them. To this purpoſe, whatever ſome pretend to the contrary, is the complaint of the church, Iſa. lxiv. 6. The chaff, oftentimes, is ſo mixed with the wheat, that corn can ſcarce be diſcerned. And this know, <hi>That the more ſpiritual any man is, the more he ſees of his unſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs in his ſpiritual duties.</hi> An outſide performance will ſatisfy an outſide Chriſtianity.

Are your complaints of want of an intereſt in forgiveneſs, a ſanctified means to obtain it? not at all. You will not deal ſo with yourſelves in things natural or civil. In ſuch things you will take an induſtrious courſe for a remedy, or for relief. In things of the ſmalleſt importance in this world, and unto this life, you will not content yourſelves with <hi>wiſhing</hi> and <hi>complaining.</hi> As though induſtry, in the uſe of natural means, for the attaining of natural ends, were the ordinance of God; and diligence in the uſe of ſpiritual means, for the obtaining of ſpiritual ends, were not!—Do you uſe diligence, ſtudy, endeavours, <hi>all diligence;</hi> diligence at all times, in all ways by God appointed; <hi>all manner</hi> of diligence, within and without, in private and public, to this end and purpoſe? Do you ſtudy, meditate, pray, watch, faſt, neglect no opportunity, keep your hearts, ſearch, try, examine yourſelves, fly tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and occaſions of cooling, deadening, and ſtifling grace? Do theſe things abound in you? <hi>Alas, you cannot do thus; you are ſo weak, ſo indiſpoſed.</hi> But,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:031844_0227_0FEF1F7DA8809F30"/>
alas, you will not; you will not part with your eaſe; you will not crucify your luſts; you will not uſe <hi>all diligence:</hi> but muſt come to it, or be contented to ſpend all your days in darkneſs, and to lie down in ſorrow.</q>

God forbid it ſhould be otherwiſe with you! or that we ſhould endeavour to ſpeak peace unto you, in any ſuch a frame! To hear of a perſon, that he walks ſlothfully, careleſsly, or indulgeth his corruptions; and to find him camplaining, that he is at a loſs, whether he have any intereſt in pardon, or no; to give, or tender, comfort to ſuch mourners, without a due admonition of their duty to <hi>uſe diligence,</hi> in the uſe of means, for to help on their deliverance out of the condition wherein they are, is to tender poiſon unto them—Spiritual

                  <q>Men living under the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of religion, and not experiencing the <hi>power,</hi> virtue, and efficacy of it in their hearts; are, whatever they profeſs, very near to Atheiſm; or, at leaſt, expoſed to great temptations thereunto. If they profeſs they know God, but in works deny him, they <hi>are abominable, and diſobedient, and, unto every good work, reprobate.</hi> Let ſuch men lay aſide tradition and cuſtom; let them give up themſelves to a free and rational conſideration of things; and they will quickly find that all their profeſſion is but a miſerable ſelfdeceiving; and that, indeed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not one word of the religion which they profeſs. For, of what their religion affirms to be <hi>in themſelves,</hi> they find not any thing true, or real—He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the goſpel, avows that the death of Chriſt doth <hi>crucify ſin;</hi> that faith <hi>purifieth the heart;</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt quickens, and enables the ſoul, unto duty; that God is good and gracious unto all that come unto him; that there is precious communion to be obtained with him, by Chriſt; that there is great joy in believing. Theſe things are plainly, openly, frequently inſiſted on in the goſpel. Hence the Apoſtle preſſeth men unto obedience, on the account of them; and, as it were,

leaves them at liberty from it, if they were not ſo. Philip, ii. 1, 2. Now, if men live long in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of theſe things, ſaying that <hi>they are ſo,</hi> but indeed find nothing of truth, reality, or power in them; have no experience of the effects of them, in their own hearts or ſouls; what ſtable ground have they of believing any thing elſe in the goſpel, whereof they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have an <hi>experience?</hi> A man profeſſeth that the death of Chriſt will <hi>mortify ſin,</hi> and ſubdue corruption. Why doth he believe it? becauſe it is ſo affirmed in the goſpel. How, then, doth he find it to be ſo? Hath it this effect upon his ſoul, in his own heart? Not at all: he finds no ſuch thing in him. How, then, can this man believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, becauſe it is affirmed in the goſpel; ſeeing that he finds no real truth of that which it affirms to be in himſelf? So our Saviour argues, John iii. 12 —Of all dangers, therefore, in profeſſion, let pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors take heed of this; namely, Of a <hi>cuſtomary, traditional,</hi> or <hi>doctrinal</hi> owning ſuch truths, as ought to have <hi>their effects and accompliſhment in themſelves,</hi> whilſt they have no experience of the reality and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of them.

what end ſhould they continue longer in the avowing of that which is not?

Faith worketh <hi>by works,</hi> and makes itſelf perfect by them: and the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning forgiveneſs, hath a ſpecial influence into all holineſs <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xv. 19. 1 Pet. i. 22. James ii. 22. Titus ii. 11, 12.</note>—No man can, then, believe forgiveneſs of ſin, without a deteſtation and relinquiſhment of it— All that own the goſpel muſt acknowledge this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>The real belief of the pardon of ſin, is prevalent with men not to live longer in ſin.</hi> But now, what are the greateſt number of thoſe who pretend to receive this truth? Are their hearts purified by it? Are their conſciences purged? are their lives changed? Do they deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts? Doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs teach them ſo to do? Have they found it effectual to theſe purpoſes? Whence is it, then, that there is ſuch a bleating, and bellowing <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. xv. 14.</note>, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

amongſt them? Some of you are drunkards, ſome of you ſwearers, ſome of you unclean perſons, ſome of you liars, ſome of you worldly, ſome of you haters of all the ways of Chriſt, and all his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the earth: proud, covetous, boaſters, ſelf-ſeekers, envious, wrathful, backbiters, malicious praters, ſlanderers, and the like. And ſhall we think, that ſuch as theſe <hi>believe</hi> the forgiveneſs of ſin? God forbid! Again; Some of you are dark, ignorant, blind, utterly unacquainted with the myſtery of the goſpel; nor do at all make it your buſineſs to enquire into it. Either you hear it not at all; or, negligently, ſlothfully, cuſtomarily, to no purpoſe. Let not ſuch perſons deceive their own ſouls. To <hi>live</hi> in ſin, and yet to <hi>believe</hi> the forgiveneſs of ſin, is utterly impoſſible. Chriſt will not be a miniſter of ſin, nor give his goſpel to be a doctrine of licentiouſneſs, for your ſakes. Nor ſhall you be forgiven, that you may be delivered to do more abominations <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. vii. 10.</note>. God forbid!</q>
               </p>
               <p>'If any ſhall ſay,
<q>That they thank God, they are no ſuch <hi>publicans</hi> as thoſe mentioned: they are no drunkards, no ſwearers, no unclean perſons, nor the like; ſo that they are not concerned in this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: their lives and their duties give another account of them:</q>
then, yet conſider further, That the

Are they influenced from this <hi>faith of forgiveneſs,</hi> you boaſt of, or no? May it not be feared, that it is utterly otherwiſe? You do not perform them becauſe you <hi>love the goſpel,</hi> but becauſe you <hi>fear the law.</hi> If the truth were known, I doubt it would appear, that you get nothing by your <hi>believing of pardon,</hi> but an encouragement unto ſin. Your <hi>goodneſs,</hi> ſuch as it is, ſprings from another root. It may be, alſo, that you ward yourſelves by it againſt the ſtrokes of conſcience, or the guilt of particular ſins. This is as bad as the other. It is as good be encouraged unto ſin, to <hi>commit</hi> it; as be encouraged under ſin, ſo as to be kept from <hi>humiliation</hi> for it. None under heaven are more remote from the belief of grace and pardon, than ſuch perſons are<note n="*" place="bottom">

from all expectation of mercy, and have cauſed all your hopes to periſh: or, he might have left you alive and yet have refuſed to deal with you any more. He could have cauſed your ſun to go down at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and have given you darkneſs inſtead of viſion. He could reſpite your lives for a ſeaſon, and yet <hi>ſwear in his wrath,</hi> that you ſhould never <hi>enter into his reſt.</hi> It is now otherwiſe: how long it may be ſo, nor you, nor I, know any thing at all. God only knows what will be your time, what your continuance. We are to ſpeak <hi>whilſt it is called to-day:</hi> and this is that, for the preſent, which I have to offer unto you; God declares that <hi>there is forgiveneſs with him;</hi> that your condition is not deſperate, nor helpleſs—Some of you, it may be, are old in ſins, and unacquainted with God: ſome of you, it may be, have been great ſinners, ſcandalous ſinners: and ſome of you, it may be, have reaſon to apprehend yourſelves near the grave, and ſo alſo to hell. Some of you, it may be, have your conſciences diſquieted and galled: and it may be, ſome of you are under ſome outward troubles and perplexities, that cauſe you a little to look about you: and ſome of you, it may be, are in the madneſs of your natural ſtrength and luſts; <hi>your breaſts are full of milk, and your bones of marrow,</hi> and your hearts of ſin, pride, and contempt of the ways of God. All is one: this word is <hi>unto you all;</hi> and I ſhall only mind you, That <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031844_0234_0FEF1F9400C7F768"/>
the living God.</hi> You hear the voice, or read the words of a poor worm; but the meſſage is the <hi>meſſage,</hi> and the word is the <hi>word,</hi> of Him who ſhaketh heaven and earth. Conſider, then, well what you have to do; and what anſwer you will return unto Him who will not be mocked <note n="*" place="bottom">
