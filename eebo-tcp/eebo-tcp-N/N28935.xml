            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>II SAMUEL, i. 27.</bibl>
               <q>HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN, AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED!</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>FROM a very ancient date in the hiſtory of human affairs, mankind have been in the practice of celebrating by words or more ſubſtantial monuments, the virtues and heroic exploits of the dead. In republican governments eſpecially, the funeral oration has been rarely omitted, in the caſe of the more conſpicuous, deſerving citizen. The Grecian ſtates, early commenced the uſage: Rome followed their example, not only through the period of her greater glory, but down nearly to that of her loweſt decline;—the more recent revival of letters and ſocial improvement, having by no means diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the whole of the kind. Doing juſtice to the memory of departed worth, has much to be ſaid in its favour. A rich ſource of pleaſing emotion to the feeling grateful heart it cannot fail to operate powerfully upon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers, to ſtudy the careful imitation of what they ſo much delight to extol.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038576_0005_101296273515D030"/>
BUT with the public celebration of deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merit, thus ſtrongly recommended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent grounds; it admits and no doubt often experiences groſs abuſe. The high wrought encomium of our text and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate connection, is perhaps not ſo perfectly deſerved as could be wiſhed. Saul and his ſon Jonathan were its ſubjects, ſcarcely any thing being to be ſaid to the advantage of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but that he was "the Lord's anointed" and the latter a mere youth, of whom, the moſt that we know is, that he was perſonally brave and the poſſeſſor of an unuſually friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart. Over theſe two perſons it was, that David gave utterance to his grief, in that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful lamentation, of which the Text is a part. It is a lamentation, which does honor, both to the talents and feelings of its author. It has deſervedly immortalized <hi>him,</hi> as a man who knew how to forgive injuries, and whoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his friend, was without duplicity and perſevering.</p>
            <p>"And David lamented with this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over Saul, and over Jonathan his ſon. The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: left the daughters of the Philiſtines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, left the daughters of the uncircumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the ſhield of the mighty is vilely caſt away, the ſhield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than turned not back, and the ſword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan, were lovely and pleaſant in their lives, and in their death they they were not divided; they were ſwifter than eagles, they were ſtronger than lions. Ye daughters of Iſrael, weep over Saul, who clothed you in ſcarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midſt of the battle! O Jonathan, thou waſt ſlain in thine high places. I am diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant haſt thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, paſſing the love of women—<hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITHOUT farther diſcuſſing the queſtion, whether this <hi>high eulogy</hi> was a matter of ſtrict deſert, in view of thoſe who were originally its ſubjects; of this I am confident, that it has been deſerved in the caſe of others. It ſhall accordingly be the twofold object of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the preſent diſcourſe; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate

               </gap>erences.</p>
            <p>IN delineating the character worthy of high commendation, and of courſe to be univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deeply lamented, at his death:—I ſhall begin with mentioning the one, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well, in <hi>military</hi> office. It being the diſaſtrous fate of the warrior, which dictated the paſſage we are now reviewing, naturally gives the lead to the preſent remark. In thus holding to view military ſkill and exertion as ranking among the virtues of life, far be it from me to ſtand forth an approver, of a very large proportion of thoſe, who have ſhone and and acquired eminence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. <hi>Ambitious murderers—expert aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſins—unfeeling incendiaries</hi>—are rather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious names, which by no means do juſtice to their real guilt and infamy. A ſcourge to the world, humanity execrates and divine juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will aſſuredly puniſh them. It is not to me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liorate the circumſtances of life, but to puniſh and reclaim from ſin, that God permits them upon earth.</p>
            <p>BUT with the warrior thus an object o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deſerved execration;—he may be and fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nkind. Hence the addreſs of God, to Cyrus, a man deſervedly celebrated, both in ſacred and profane hiſtory. "Thus ſaith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whoſe right hand I have holden, to ſubdue nations before him; and I will looſe the loins of kings to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates ſhall not be ſhut. I will go before thee, and make the crooked places ſtraight; I will brake in pieces the gates of braſs, and cut in ſunder the bars of iron. For Jacob my ſervants ſake and Iſrael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have ſirnamed thee, though thou haſt not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſide me; I girded thee, though thou haſt not known me: That they may know from the riſing of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, and from the weſt, that there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me, I am the Lord, and there is none elſe"—So long as that ſpirit of national injuſtice and aggreſſion continues in the world, of which no paſt period has been wholly free, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war will be neceſſary and altogether juſtifiable;—of courſe thoſe ſkilful to wield the ſword, are deſervedly to be held in high eſteem, by their brethren. Without them the inherent rights of human nature are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly proſtrate, property devaſtated or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

taken away, the family ſanctuary made a place of lawleſs intruſion, and even the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary of the great Jehovah, with all its religious inſtitutions and ſolemnities, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot; thus verifying, what David long ſince complained of;—and indeed, which various parts of our own country, not many years paſt, exemplified. "They have caſt fire into thy ſanctuary, they have defiled by caſting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. They ſaid in their hearts, let us deſtroy them together. We ſee not our ſigns, there is no more any prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. O God, how long ſhall the adverſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? ſhall the enemy blaſpheme thy name for ever?" As muſt be a matter univerſally conced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the man of war, who under God, is made the inſtrument of alleviating and ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing ſuch a truly unwelcome ſtate of things, deſerves at his death undiſſembled and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal lamentation.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, we are abundantly authorized to lament the man, who has ſhone as a diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted ſtateſman.—To be great in war and to be great in peace, require very different attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of character, ſeldom united. Of the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is much leſs difficult to defend a country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hoſtile attacks from abroad, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate

its internal civil concerns with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, amid the jarring feelings and oppoſite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereſts of millions. Of all departments of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that of the republican chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is far the moſt critical and arduous. To be the ſucceſsful and approved helmſman of a nation, requires a vaſt combination of foreſight, energy, and perſeverance, rarely the lot of mortals. The fatigue and anxiety of ſuch an office, muſt be incalculable.—To keep in order the complicated wheels of national government, is a laborious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; though a far greater one, to put them firſt in motion. It is beyond the reach of wealth, to compenſate adequately ſuch a taſk;—how truly noble then to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſmalleſt pecuniary reward, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, of pure love of country. Certainly the able ſtateſman, uncompenſated unleſs by a conſciouſneſs of doing good, fully merits the rich tribute, of being held in the grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, of his ſurviving cotemporaries and poſterity.</p>
            <p>How worthy alſo, to be lamented is the man who has unvaryingly diſplayed, unſhaken at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the conſtitution and laws of his country.—Convinced of the true conſtruction to be put, upon the great <hi>palladium</hi> of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exiſtence and liberty, in this or the other of its articles; nothing is able to make him depart from it, in the ſmalleſt degree.

the riſk of popularity, the colliſion of parties, the ſolicitations of the crafty, and the invectives of diſapointed ambition; he remains immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—tenaciouſly fixed on what he conceives to be right. Truly difficult as it many times is, for the ſupreme head of a nation, to avoid the imputation of obſtinacy, while purſuing the-line of rational manly firmneſs; ſtill it is a line, for which he will never fail, moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to aim. Feeling the juſtice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired remark "that in a multitude of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, there is ſafety" he liſtens to the whole which can be ſaid; tho not without afterwads, both thinking and acting for himſelf. Far greater confidence may be ſafely repoſed in ſuch a man, than in one, who while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pleaſe all, is very certain of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his adminiſtration but too exactly anſwer to an apoſtles pointed deſcription "for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea, driven of the wind and toſſed—for let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord."</p>
            <p>FURTHER, how deſerving of lamentation at his death is the one, who while engaged in public life, ſhewed himſelf ſuperior to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of adulation, and the ſeducements of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.—The conqueſt of ſelf in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, is far the greateſt conqueſt, which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is able to achieve.

the humble man amid the unqualified applauſes of millions, and that not barely for a day but for years, ſhews ſelf-command—diſplays greatneſs of ſoul, next to divine. Thus made conſcious of acting a noble part and deſerving well; the pleaſure thence reſulting, does not ſtand confined to the narrow limits of a ſelfiſh heart, but diffuſes itſelf abroad—ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lts in the idea of national peace and improvement, aggrandizement and felicity.—The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe feelings and views are of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed benevolent caſt, with entire cheerfulneſs, quits the pinnacle of high elevation, the firſt moment circumſtances will allow. It was not to be made great, but to do great good, that he conſented to riſe; of courſe it being the firſt object of his wiſhes, again to enjoy a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dignified retirement. How truly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate would it be for the world, did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture with extenſive authority, in all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do ſo little to deprave the heart—that in the place of retaining power, for the purpoſe of enſlaving and making miſerable; it was relinquiſhed with equal or greater ſatisfaction, than what it was originally received.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, worthy indeed to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the man, whoſe private life has been a continued ſeries of beneficence, unſtained by vice, and who witneſſed a ſacred regard to the truth and power of religion. How compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038576_0013_1012963C39B168C0"/>
contemptible are the moſt brilliant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal qualities, with all the adventitious celebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which an elevated department for action, can give to them, unaccompanied by a moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and the true fear of God. With vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principles and practices, the eſſence of real dignity in the obſcure citizen; they are inconceivably more commanding and uſeful, when the attribute of high life. The great man, who manifeſts reverence for religion and its inſtitutions, demonſtrates his full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their reality and importance. He ſhews himſelf ſuperior to the ſplendid tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſeducing world, and proclaims aloud to his fellow worms "that there is one thing needful; a good part which ſhall not be taken away."</p>
            <p>I have now detailed, with deſigned brevity, a few leading features of character which more than authorize—which peremptorily enjoin, the moſt feeling lamentation. They are features of character, which authorize and enjoin lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation when found ſingly; how much more when combined, and forming one vaſt maſs, of human excellence and worth.</p>
            <p>As I am ſure is needleſs to inform you, my Brethren, the paſt remarks are by no means thoſe, of the mere <hi>ſpeculatiſt.</hi>—They are not the produce of imagination, but have been penned from <hi>actual life.</hi>

O WASHINGTON! thou great and good—thou friend of God and man, I can ſuppreſs thy beloved name, no longer. <hi>Rich</hi> in years—<hi>rich</hi> in deſert—<hi>rich</hi> in every virtue—<hi>rich</hi> in the eſteem of thy country and the world, thou art now ſhrouded in the tomb;—<hi>and thy place ſhall know thee no more."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"How are the mighty fallen, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of war periſhed."</p>
            <p>A few inferences, may now cloſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attempt.</p>
            <p>IN view of what has been offered, how clearly are we taught—how forceably have we urged upon us, the idea of a future immortal exiſtence. It cannot be, that ſo much innate worth—ſuch complicated deſert of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—and unfeigned fear of the great Jehovah, as marked the man we this day lament, ſhould periſh in the grave. No, my Brethren, the moſt glorious triumph of our departed Hero and Father, is yet to arrive. "So when this corruption ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory."</p>
            <p>OUR ſubject alſo, impreſſively urges upon us, to cultivate a ſpirit of humble ſubmiſſion

to God's holy unerring providence. The cup of national judgement put into our hands to drink, is indeed very bitter; tho' let it not be forgotten, that it poſſeſſes an intermixture of ſweetneſs. Our tears ought to a degree, to be thoſe of gratitude—gratitude that kind heaven ſaw fit to raiſe up ſo great a Worthy, that he has been ſo eminently guided by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine counſel, and allowed to live and be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to a good old age.</p>
            <p>THE reflections we have been indulging, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſtrongly recommend attachment to the conſtitution and varied intereſts of our country. A deep bluſh ought to cover the face of thoſe, who pretend to mourn for our departed Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and yet make it their daily effort to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mine that noble edifice of liberty and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which has been the idol of his wiſhes, the work of his life, and no doubt the ſubject of his frequent and moſt ſervent prayers. The <hi>urn</hi> of ſo great and good a patriot, is too ſacred to be wet with the tears, <hi>of foul hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</hi> It is impoſſible that real gratitude to the father of his country and the feelings of the parricide, ſhould ever unite in the ſame heart.</p>
            <p>THE addreſs of the paſt diſcourſe is alſo, moſt pointed and forcible, in favor of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exemplary life.—If it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or wiſhed, that we ſhould all be heroes
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038576_0016_10129643C1BCCF18"/>
or ſtateſmen; we ought univerſally to be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in heart and virtuous in converſation. The one talent claims the ſame improvement and enſures a proportionate reward, as the ten. The more humble virtues <hi>"of the greateſt man who ever lived"</hi> formed out, by no means the leaſt eſtimable part of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let the ſolemn providence which has been the burden of our remarks at this time, deeply impreſs every mind, in view of the inconceivably intereſting article of death. Would the armed deſtroyer of our race, not paſs by <hi>"heavens favorite ſon,"</hi> he certainly will not paſs by us. Are there none ſohigh, neither are there any ſo low, as to be remotely author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized in the calculation, that they ſhall never die." The ſmall and great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter, "the object which ought to be that of chief ſolicitude with us all, being ſo to live the life of the righteous, "that our laſt end be like his."</p>
