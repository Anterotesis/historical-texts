            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the occaſion of our aſſembling this day is uncommon, it is not the leſs important.</p>
            <p>As families and villages publicly mourn the loſs of individual members; ſo the nation mourns the fall of her Friend, her Hero, her Founder. He being the Benefactor and Father of all, which town or hamlet, from Maine to Georgia, would be willingly excluded from this general Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
            <p>Though the annals of OUR country afford no example of the kind; though we are in danger of adopting tokens of extreme ſorrow; yet this is not the firſt inſtance of national mourning. For forty days, Jacob, the Hebrew patriarch was mourned in the nation where he died.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038184_0003_1011168898CB5DC8"/>Pelopidas,<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note> the Theban, ſlain in a foreign war, when borne to his native State, was met on the way, as he paſt through the cities, by magiſtrates, by young men, by children, by <hi>the miniſters of religion</hi> with all the pomp, which could give <hi>him</hi> honor, or expreſs <hi>their</hi> grief. The Theſſalians, in whoſe cauſe he had fallen, importuned the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of directing his funeral ſolemnities.</p>
            <p>But the firſt ORATION, pronounced in honor of the dead, mentioned in hiſtory, was delivered by Poplicola at the death of Brutus; that Brutus, ſo renowned for his diſintereſted zeal in giving ſentence of death againſt his own ſons guilty of treaſon. For him the Roman women mourned a whole year; two months longer than for their neareſt relations.</p>
            <p>The Commonwealth interred Poplicola at the public expence, and to expreſs their affectionate veneration for the man, the women by common conſent lamented his death a year, "as if he had been a ſon, a brother, or father."</p>
            <p>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Bingham's Antiquities of the Chriſtian Church.</note> The firſt Chriſtians adopted the cuſtom of funeral eulogies; they were pronounced at the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038184_0004_1011168A1BCC9B90"/>
grave of the ſaint; to render the ſcene more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn, the emblems of their crucified Savior were adminiſtered. But neither Chriſtians for the loſs of a brother, nor Greeks, nor Romans, for the fall of their Conſuls and Generals, had ſuch cauſe for mourning as the States of America, at the preſent time.</p>
            <p>Probably NO MAN ever united ſo many great talents, and reigned ſo entirely in the hearts of <hi>millions,</hi> as he whoſe departure the nation mourns. The Poets and Orators of the world will blazon his virtues, and the laſt age of time admire the wonderous man.</p>
            <p>Were the Speaker to take a part in the eulogies of the day his words might be loſt as a drop of dew on the boſom of ocean: ſtill it may be DUTY to remark, that we are unſpeakably indebted to God for raiſing up ſuch a character, at ſuch a time; a character whoſe moderation, whoſe gentleneſs, whoſe purity was ſo adapted to the moral habits, and religious opinions of his country. While clad in panoply dreadful; terrible to his enemies, as the fiery bolt of heaven; he was gentle as the Shepherd of a flock, compaſſionate as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a family. Mercy ſoftened his juſtice; humanity tempered his vengeance, and the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſword, was the blood of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038184_0005_1011168DD2C874D8"/>The idea of conqueſt and triumph, of invaſion and ſlaughter, never darted its contagion amid the reflections of his mind. Had this humane ſpirit been wanting; had he been merely the rough ſoldier, or daring Commander, Americans would have been diſguſted; their confidence loſt; the proſpects of the revolution wrapt in darkneſs. He never wounded the breaſt of ſenſibility, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extorted a tear from morality, nor a ſigh from religion: He never gave his country "pain, but when he died."</p>
            <p>His INVENTIVE genius was <hi>neceſſary.</hi> What in other circumſtances might have been <hi>convenient</hi> was <hi>here eſſential.</hi> A vaſt extent of defenceleſs territory, towns and cities, raiſed the ſupplicating eye, and implored protection from him. A race of harmleſs farmers, from their birth living in habits of equality, independent lords of the ſoil, revolting at the thought of military ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were the unpromiſing materials to form a defence againſt the diſciplined valor of European Veterans. Much of his artillery ſlumbered in the hills of ore; much of his ammunition ſlept in the duſt, or bade him defiance in the magazines of his foe.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>ſtratagems</hi> of <hi>creative</hi> genius encouraged his friends, awed the enemy, and ſaved the cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038184_0006_101116951CF77378"/>
Under his eye the huſbandman ſoon became the Champion of Freedom, the field of harveſts the citadel of war, on the hill of flocks was the blaze of battle, and the flag of INDEPENDENCE waved over the deep. The metamorphoſes of poetic fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed viſible in <hi>real life.</hi> His meaſures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſappointed the calculations of prudence, overleaped the rules of ſyſtem, while the cloud of adverſity guided his banner to the hill of victory. When he ſeemed to reſt quietly in his camp, like the ſlumbering volcano, he has unexpectedly burſt on his foe in a deluge of fire.</p>
            <p>His FORTITUDE in ſeaſons, which tried the moſt intrepid minds, was a golden pillar in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his merit. When his wants were multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when revolt raiſed her ſtandard; when neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beſieged his camp; when reſources failed; when the ſeas ſaid, "They are not in us," and the fields, "They are not in us," like the rock of the billows, or the hill of ſtorms, he bore all with invincible <hi>fortitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undiſmayed he left the iſles of Newyork; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmayed he abandoned the fortreſſes of the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, while the crimſon of their ſteps betrayed the courſe of his deſponding troops. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can conteſt, the Liberties of mankind, appeared to tremble in the ſcale of events; the voice of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038184_0007_10111698633B2658"/>
popular zeal had ſunk almoſt to the whiſper of ſubmiſſion. The Commander in Chief remains unmoved. Though he knew when to retire; yet like the blaſt of the tempeſt, it was to return with increaſing fury.</p>
            <p>The aſtoniſhed Delaware bore him back to vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; the triumph at Trenton rouſed the country to a ſenſe of their own force; gave the mortal ſtab to oppreſſion, broke the ſceptre of deſpotiſm. Like the ſun obſcured by clouds, but not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, he continued the ſame in every exigence.</p>
            <p>His unaffected MODESTY after all the ſervices he had done, all the diſtreſſes he had borne, all the honor he had won, was a diadem of glory, was a <hi>prodigy</hi> of human virtue. Aſcribing to the aid of other Agents, or immediately referring to the PROVIDENCE OF GOD the great events in which he was the principal Actor, <hi>What did he ever arrogate to himſelf?</hi> His replies accepting the great appointments of his country; his addreſſes reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe appointments, are the uniform language of his life; they ſhow the great man riſing above himſelf.</p>
            <p>Travellers <note n="*" place="bottom">Briſſot's travels in the United States.</note> have been ſurpriſed at the modeſt manner in which he deſcribed thoſe events of
<pb facs="unknown:038184_0008_1011169C008F43C8"/>
the revolution, which covered him with glory, and made a bloody page in the hiſtory of war. The manner was the ſame, as if he had not been preſent, or only an obſerving ſpectator.</p>
            <p>But the unrivalled ſplendor of his character beamed from his DISINTERESTED ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Without that ambition for fame or wealth, which frequently fires the heart, and directs the actions of men, he was reclining under the groves of Vernon, or ploughing his own field, when the voice of millions called him to lead their armies. His favorite indulgences allured him to refuſe; his benevolence required him to comply; he did not heſitate; he became our Captain.</p>
            <p>How conſtantly was the ſame ſelf denial neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary during the uncertain, the diſmal conteſt. A narration of theſe trials would be the hiſtory of the revolution.</p>
            <p>When he had given ſovereign INDEPENDENCE to his country; when he had raiſed her to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and glory; when he had repelled the foe, and huſhed the thunders of invaſion; when he had fixed the confidence of his country, and the admiration of the world, he then <hi>reſigned his ſword;</hi> that ſword, which courted his hand; with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038184_0009_1011169D901D7530"/>
tears he bade adieu to that army, who would have given him their <hi>blood;</hi> who would have made him perpetual Dictator: He became a private cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen with that people, who <hi>could not</hi> have refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a THRONE.</p>
            <p>Here gaze, ye Caeſars, ye Cromwells, ye Buon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apartes, of the world, and ſhrink into your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited non-exiſtence! But here was no ſtruggle of paſſions, no <hi>trial</hi> for the <hi>pure</hi> benevolence of WASHINGTON. The bleſſings of his country at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, as he retires to the banks of Potow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac; their prayers aſcend for his peace and final happineſs.</p>
            <p>But a more painful queſtion demands his deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Can he, will he again ſacrifice his wiſhes? Look, ye children of men, look ye angels of light, ſee a ſpirit of benevolence like thine own. He feared not the loſs of thoſe honors, which he nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſought; he grudged not any ſervice for that people, who were dearer to him than the blood which rolled through his heart; but fatigued with the toils of the crimſon field; tired of public life, he ſighed for repoſe. Yet he conſents to preſide over the nation, which his ſword had eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Here the frozen calculations of worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the mechanical balancing of arguments yield
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038184_0010_101116A28681E4C0"/>
to the fervent impulſe of diſintereſted zeal for the public good. Juſtly to eſtimate his virtues, or to recommend them to others, requires a ſpirit pure and benevolent like his own. The beams of morn extinguiſh the ſtars; the meridian blaze dazzles the eye; we need not, therefore, <hi>mention</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the <hi>firſt</hi> office of his country, or his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſubordinate ſtation. So great were his other ſacrifices that we forget to tell, that the bread which he eat, and the happineſs of doing good, were all his reward for years and years of toil in the beſt part of his life.</p>
            <p>But to omit his VALOR would be to <hi>rob</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. How many hills and plains have ſhuddered to ſee his cool, undaunted valor! His courage was not the rage of Brutus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note> hurrying to death in ſingle combat; it was not the fury of Mahomet,<note n="†" place="bottom">Echard.</note> riding into the ſea to ſupport his diſtant fleet; it was not the madneſs of Pelopidas, ruſhing from life before his army; but that diſpaſſionate preſence of mind, which enſures victory, or prevents the common diſaſters of defeat. He never wantonly expoſed a hair of his head; he never turned his boſom from the hotteſt battle when duty called.</p>
            <p>His ardor in the field was not a thirſt for <hi>fame;</hi> but the indignant ſpirit of <hi>ſelf defence;</hi> it was not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038184_0011_101116ABAC36AA20"/>
a frenzy of <hi>raving paſſion;</hi> but the calm dictates of <hi>conſcience:</hi> it was not <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>ſlaughter;</hi> but the <hi>zeal</hi> of ſaving his country.</p>
            <p>His enemies will relate the deeds of his bravery to other times. The batteries of York-Town, the plains of Monmouth, numerous hills of blood, eulogize the ſword of his battles. In ſtrains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting the Monongahela ſtrikes the ſong, the Hudſon, the Delaware, the Schuylkill, and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dywine, ſwell the chorus of his valor.</p>
            <p>His SUCCESS completes the glory of his name. Here he roſe on the breath of heaven above the ſphere of his own great actions. No virtue is ſo ſpotleſs, no courage ſo undaunted, no diſcretion ſo watchful, as to <hi>enſure</hi> ſuch a ſeries of ſucceſs, ſuch a tide of glory. The uniform confidence of his country was a phenomenon great, like the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his mind, the remarkable deeds of his life, the almoſt miraculous interpoſitions of Providence in his behalf. Republics are not in the habit of ſuch uniformity or gratitude. It will probably ſtand as a political wonder in the hiſtory of man, during the preſent ſtate of ſociety, that he ſo long enjoyed the unwavering confidence of theſe States. That they ſhould have ſagacity to diſcover him among millions, and wiſdom to give him their conſtant ſupport merits them vaſt applauſe. He

was as evidently a favorite of Providence, as of his country: He as conſpicuouſly enjoyed the protection of his God, as the cordial veneration of his fellowcitizens. The time of his birth, the peculiar ſtate of his country, many things in which He had no influence, as well as the energetic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the unſullied virtues of his own mind, all conſpired to render him what he was, the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Republic, the pride of his country, the admiration of mankind.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to be forgotten that he enjoyed powerful aid. The ſwords of Green and Putnam<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>General PUTNAM commanded in the celebrated action of Bunker or Breed's hill. It is a ſingular circumſtance that this ſhould not be more generally known.—Putnam was the commanding officer of the party, who went upon the hill the evening before the action: he commanded in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he harangued his men as the Britiſh firſt advanced, charged them to reſerve their fire, till they were near, <hi>'till they could ſee the white of their eyes,'</hi> were his words.— At the ſecond aſſault he commended their former calmneſs, aſſured them "they would now do much better," and directed them "to aim at the officers." They obeyed. The fire was tremendous. <hi>'My God,'</hi> ſaid Putnam, in telling the ſtory, <hi>'I never ſaw ſuch a carnage of the human race.'</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things he related to the Reverend Mr. Whitney, his Miniſter, by whoſe permiſſion they are now publiſhed.—In a note of his ſermon occaſioned by the death of the General, he ſays, "The detachment at firſt was put under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of General Putnam, with it he took poſſeſſion of the hill, and ordered the battle from beginning to the end. General Warren arrived alone on the hill and as a <hi>Volunteer</hi> joined the Americans juſt as the action commenced.—Theſe <hi>facts</hi> General Putnam himſelf gave me ſoon after the battle and <hi>repeated</hi> them after his life was printed. The General, who encouraged and animated his ſoldiers, by his words and example, to prodigies of bravery, is highly to be hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored, and the praiſe not given to <hi>another,</hi> however meritorious in other reſpects. Other evidence, to confirm what I have here ſaid, I am able to produce, if any ſhould call for it."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Whitney has a letter written him by an officer, who was in the action, aſſerting that Putnam was Commander. While writing this note an officer of rank, who was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the battle, who ſaw Warren fall, tells me I may "be aſſured, General Putnam was the officer who led the party to the hill, who marked the ground to be fortified, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the action."</p>

But we forbear— The mighty man is fallen; his ſword ſleeps in his hall.

            <p>Man is evidently formed for endleſs improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in knowledge, uſefulneſs, and enjoyment. In this life they are progreſſive and ſometimes great.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will paſs on and riſe, as far above the preſent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>archangel,</hi> as that ſurpaſſes a ſpark of love in the humble ſoul. Then his light is only dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an ETERNITY to aſcend in bliſs and glory is ſtill before him. But for this he muſt drop his clay: To riſe, to reign, to live, he muſt ſleep in the narrow houſe, return to the duſt of the ground. It is the ſtormy hour in the voyage of our exiſtence: It is the moment of agonizing conteſt, as the victory is won, as the crown is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But what coward would fly when the triumph is certain; when a kingdom is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when the livery of death is exchanged for robes of immortality? We die, we ſoar, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers expand, the worm of duſt unites with elder ſons of light; their work, their joys the ſame. "Were death denied even fools would wiſh to die." Is it not kind in God to remove his moſt uſeful agents from the evils of time to more exalted ſcenes in glory?</p>
            <p>When God determines to PUNISH, he may wiſely remove uſeful perſons, who were barriers againſt his judgments. Lot muſt be haſtened from the devoted city; omnipotent anger "can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing," cannot kindle a <hi>ſpark</hi> till he is gone. The <hi>Judgments</hi> of God flow from the common courſe of events; no violence deranges
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038184_0017_101116BDF2964D58"/>
the natural order of things; effects ſpontaneouſly flow from their cauſes: Therefore when the hour of divine Judgments arrives, thoſe perſons muſt be removed whoſe influence would prevent the evils deſigned. Being the confidence of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Champion of Gath muſt bow to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of death, the ſword of the Shepherd muſt drink his blood, that terrors might ſeize the camp, the falling troops burden the fields as they fled.</p>
            <p>As a haughty ſpirit precedes a fall; as pride ſwells the heart deſtined to ruin; as the <hi>means</hi> of ſafety are removed before deſtruction comes; ſo thoſe perſons whoſe proweſs, whoſe wiſdom, or piety, defend their connexions, will be removed before the divine judgments arreſt their victims. The Righteous are taken not only <hi>from</hi> the evil; but that it <hi>may</hi> come; that it may flow uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled. This is natural; it is agreeable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe; therefore the Hero of Troy crimſons the duſt <hi>before</hi> the city falls. When puniſhment haſtens, uſeful perſons are removed from their ſtations.</p>
            <p>To ſhow he <hi>needs</hi> not the <hi>nobleſt</hi> inſtruments; to ſhow his INDEPENDENCE, GOD removes them from the world. Nothing can impoveriſh him, who creates: A Tyrant he raiſes up in the land of Ham to ſhow his mighty power: That

Tyrant he deſtroys to ſhow he was not neceſſary. Kings and Conquerors are as eaſily formed, as drops of dew, or floating atoms. While the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evils may ruin the great men of this world, the greateſt, <hi>actually promote</hi> the deſigns of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. On mount Gilboa the royal Warriors fall, "who were the beauty of Iſrael, who were ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than eagles, who were ſtronger than lions; on whoſe face was ſeen the rage of battles, the ſtep of death was behind their ſwords, the blood of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on their ſpears."</p>
            <p>Cities have aſcended in burning vapor, as leaves of the foreſt; a world has been drowned, as a ſhip in the ſtorm. The majeſty of his kingdom, the riches of his empire, the awful magnificence of his government, confounds our calculations, when dreadful ſcenes ſtrike the view, when God hides in darkneſs the firſt Agents of the world. This INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE of means commands our admiration.</p>
            <p>God, alſo calls away the principal Actors from the world to make room for the <hi>forming</hi> of OTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS. Such is the preſent ſtate of things, that but few can be eminently great at the ſame time. If all were Generals, who would compoſe the phal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anx? If all were rulers, who would be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? Had Nimrod and the officers of his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment continued till this time, how may great

men muſt have remained in their original ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
            <p>Seldom does the <hi>exigence</hi> of the time fail of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the characters required. The moment he was needed, the Hero of Columbia roſe. Had he been immortal, no other like him would have appeared, no other would have been neceſſary. By the removal of ſuch there may be a ſucceſſion of great men, as long continued as the duration of the world, more numerous than the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time: Therefore there may be a period when every <hi>hill</hi> ſhall have been a VERNON, and every <hi>family</hi> have furniſhed a WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>Though the beloved man is fallen, there is no ſhadow of doubt, but the hour which demands, will alſo exhibit <hi>another</hi> formed for the occaſion. It is the folly of error for us to tremble, or for our enemies to exult, as if he, who raiſed up one, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend a hoſt of Waſhingtons. An ADAMS <hi>lives,</hi> and when God deſigns to bleſs a people, there will always be found the neceſſary Agents; a Moſes where the chains of a Deſpot are to be broken; a Cyrus where a captive nation find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; a Waſhington where the banner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence is unfurled, or a new Empire eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. As the mortality of great men multiplies great men, it renders the world a nurſery of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038184_0020_101116CD4AA2AFD0"/>
a ſchool of virtue and glory. Eaſy it is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to juſtify Providence in calling uſeful Agents from earthly ſcenes.</p>
            <p>We may here remark that the Almighty Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor removes men from life, when the WORK is ACCOMPLISHED for which they were DESIGNED. The God of knowledge perfectly knows what is the work of every perſon, as he enters on the ſtage of life. When his work is done, the agent lives to no purpoſe, therefore reaſon approves, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs demands his removal. Every actor good and bad retires when his part in the drama is fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. God perfectly knew the work of Egypt's king; therefore when he diſplayed his laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when his work was <hi>done,</hi> he was whelmed in the deep, he left the world.</p>
            <p>Redemption was the work of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore when that work was 'finiſhed,' he was the priſoner of Death: Why ſhould not the agent be removed when his taſk is <hi>accompliſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To teach men their DEPENDENCE upon God for great characters, He often removes them in the midſt of their uſefulneſs. The view of a long, a conſtant ſeries of events, without derangement or change, is apt to efface our convictions of the divine agency, which gives exiſtence and energy
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038184_0021_101116D04BCA0548"/>
to all. Men long accuſtomed to enjoy law and protection from the wiſe and valiant, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forget the hand, who raiſed them up; they regard the ſervants of God, as the <hi>authors</hi> of the bleſſings, while they are only the <hi>means</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them. That God may not be robbed of his glory, he removes thoſe uſeful perſons, who prevented us from ſeeing his goodneſs. Was not the Prophet's ſchool deeply awed with a preſent God, and a ſenſe of their own <hi>dependence</hi> when they ſaw the man of God aſcending in a chariot of fire?</p>
            <p>Finally, God removes great agents to teach great men, THEY MUST DIE. All men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe <hi>proſperous,</hi> are too little ſolicitous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their diſſolution, and the unknown e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents beyond the grave. The cares of buſineſs, the pride of wealth, the flatteries of greatneſs, the enchantments of pleaſure, ſeize their hearts, and direct their actions.</p>
            <p>Were none to die, but thoſe worn out with years, none but thoſe no longer uſeful; were none but the dregs of mankind ſwept into the grave, Who, among the active and great, would think of death, or prepare for heaven? But when the mighty man falls, his companions in honor ſee, that while they are reſpected as <hi>Gods,</hi> they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038184_0022_101116D1DB013158"/>
muſt die like <hi>men.</hi> They ſee that no degree of importance repels the ſhaft of death; the tyrant delights to ſpread his terrors, to make the great tremble, the world mourn.</p>
            <p>In a critical day, when the Hebrew camp ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to need his wiſdom, with Canaan's hills in view, their Leader, their Legiſlator, their Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington expires; he paſſes from the top of Nebo to his ſeat in glory. While the wonders of his benevolence were enlightening the world; while the ſpirits of the good were raviſhed by his divine eloquence, the <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was nailed to the tree. While a great part of mankind are in arms, and his country trembles, as a barque in the ſtorm, the Defender of America deſcends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his tomb. From his importance to ſociety, Who can preſume on life?</p>
            <p>Thus reaſons viſible plead for the afflictive won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of divine ſovereignty, which ſummon from earth the great and good. Moſt important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations demand ſuch diſpenſations. Pleaſant is the office to ſpeak for God, to juſtify his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards the great, the good, the wiſe men of the earth: Yet what is more dreadful in the divine government, than the mortality of ſuch perſons? Therefore though we "know not now," we may 'hereafter' know why other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038184_0023_101116D9F6CAA068"/>
circumſtances exiſt; why wickedneſs, famine, and peſtilence, depopulate the world; why moral darkneſs reigns; why the beams of rational religion illume ſo ſmall a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; why we inherit danger and diſtreſs; why infants expire, and guilt wakens a fire that <hi>never</hi> dies.</p>
            <p>As God has reaſons wiſe for the terrible acts of his authority, SUBMISSION becomes the heart of man. Still the event we contemplate is ſerious; a great man, whom God delighted to honor, is fallen. He loved our nation, his name was a formidable hoſt. The ſtar is ſet, which guided us through a dark night of imminent dangers; gone is the cloud, which gave terror to our foes, light and ſafety to his country. He was happy, not in his own ſplendor, but in our proſperity; he lived not for himſelf, but for us. How many years of diſtreſſing days, and diſmal nights in the blaze of ſummer, and the froſt of winter, did he hazard his life in the bloody field! He made ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſacrifice, welcomed every burden, dared every danger, which the public good required. When did he refuſe to die for his country? From what ſcene of carnage did he ever fly? What was his REWARD for all his ſervices? Like the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the new world, he roſe with unrivalled ſublimity.</p>
