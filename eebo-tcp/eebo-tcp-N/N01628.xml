            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>WHat I briefly offer in the following Pages, I was moved to by the Reverend Mr. <hi>George Corwin,</hi> late Miniſter of <hi>Salem.</hi> He liv'd greatly and juſtly beloved and deſired, and I think died as much lamented. He was an Able, Faithful, Laborious Miniſter of the Goſpel; and a lover of Souls, and I believe is now gone to his Everlaſting Rest. When he was last in Town a few Months ago; he deſired me to write ſome ſhort thing, to ſhow that <hi>Perſons ſhould ſeek Baptiſm for themſelves &amp; Children; &amp; that Baptiz'd Perſons when grown up, ſhould renew their Covenant with God.</hi> He deſir'd (if I Remember right) that what ſhould be written might be <hi>adapted to the Capacity of the meaneſt;</hi> and might be <hi>Short</hi> alſo, that ſo it might be the more <hi>eaſily bought, and charitably diſtributed,</hi> where it might probably do good. If he had not died ſo ſoon, I believe I ſhould ſcarce have begun to write ſo ſoon as I have. But quickly after I heard of his Death, this motion reviv'd in my mind, and put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fulfilling (in ſome poor meaſure) the will of the dead. I have here made a brief Eſſay
<pb facs="unknown:001934_0004_0FBA1E7104D69238"/>without looking into any Author, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Bible. Indeed long before his motion, I had written a <hi>Dialogue</hi> about the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> (tho' 'tis not publiſh'd) and another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> tho' 'tis not yet finiſhed, each of them much larger than this. Let what is here offer'd, he compar'd with the Scripture, try'd by that; if in any thing it diſagrees thereto let it ſo far be rejected: But if it agrees with Scripture, and is yet diſregarded by any, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch their neglect, they must anſwer to God the Judge of all. So far as this brief Eſſay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the deſire of the worthy Mr. <hi>Corwin;</hi> I ſay, ſo far, <hi>tho' he be dead, he yet ſpeaks</hi> in it. Let thoſe who were once under his Faithful Miniſtry, <hi>Remember how they have heard;</hi> and live agreeably to the truths of God which he Inculcated on them. Indeed all under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould believe it and obey it; if what is here offered ſhall be Instrumental of quickning any thereto, let God have all the Glory; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Author be remembred in their Prayers.</p>

               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Since the Fall and Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of the Firſt Man Adam, all Mankind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are Sinners, the Children of the Devil, and liable to eternal Wrath and Miſery. Sin is</hi> a breach or <hi>Tranſgreſſion of God's Law.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. Through the deceitful Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Devil, our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> Sinned,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001934_0006_0FBA1E74D4F8D9C8"/>(and ſo deſerved Death) in eating the forbidden Fruit. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4, 6, 13. Hence the <hi>Devil</hi> is called a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning.</hi> Joh. 8.44. The <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> was conſidered as a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a common Covenant—head to all his Poſterity; and therefore all his Poſterity were Involved in his Sin and Guilt. <hi>By one Man</hi> (that is the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>Sin enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned—by one Man's diſobedience many were made Sinners,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 19. <hi>In A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam all die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. Thus all Men Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam;</hi> as coming from him, they are Sinful and Guilty. And ſo conſidered meerly as Sinful, they are the <hi>Children of the Devil. Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do.</hi> Joh. 8. 44. <hi>In this the Children of God</hi> (by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoption) <hi>are manifest, and the Children of the Devil; whoſoever doth not Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſneſs, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c. Natural unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Men, they do not work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they cannot do the things that pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. Therefore they are the <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> they Imitate him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, follow him. <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. And Men conſidered <hi>as Sinners,</hi> are <hi>Children of Wrath by Nature.</hi> Eph. 2.3. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Gal. 3.10. Sin
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001934_0007_0FBA1E7C76AB02A8"/>deſerves, <hi>Everlaſting Fire—Everlaſting Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</hi> Mat 25.41, 46. What has been thus briefly deſcribed, is the State and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Men naturally ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>God has ſent his only begotten Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, into the World to deſtroy the works of the Devil; to Save men from Sin and Miſery, to make them holy and happy.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. <hi>For this cauſe the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> Mat. 1.21.—<hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their Sins.</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and purafie us to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10.— <hi>Jeſus which delivered us from wrath to come.</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law,—being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in hint, before the foundation of the World that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in Love.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that the gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heveth in him, ſhould not periſh but ſhould have everlaſting Life.</hi> Chriſt came into the World, led an Holy Life. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.) Died an accurſed Death (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.) that he might <hi>Save Sinners</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18) might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Therefore the Scope of the Goſpel is, <hi>to open Men's Eyes, turn them from Darkneſs to light,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001934_0008_0FBA1E804201AFE8"/>from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgivnes of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are Sanctified by Faith that is in Chriſt.</hi> Act. 26.18. Chriſt came into the World, to purchaſe Salvation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulmen, to turn rebel men from Sin and Satan unto God, that they might be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to God, love him, live to him, and be eternally happy in his Favour.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the only Saviour of Sinners.</hi> As he come to Save Sinners. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) So, <hi>neither is there Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any other, for there is none other Name giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en under Heaven among Men, whereby we must be Saved.</hi> Acts 4.12. There's <hi>no remiſſon</hi> of Sin) <hi>without Shedding of Blood</hi> (Heb. 9.22.) <hi>not the Blood of Bulls and Goats</hi> (Heb. 10.4.) but the <hi>Blood of Jeſus</hi> (1 Joh. 1.7.1 Pet. 1.19.) Who is that <hi>Lamb of God which takes away the Sin of the World.</hi> Joh. 1.29. Chriſt then is the only Saviour of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and he is an <hi>Allſufficient</hi> one too. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.—<hi>He is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have everlaſting Life.</hi> Joh. 3.16.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>No Men can be Saved, without true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Sin and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I mean this, of thoſe grown to years of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and not of ſuch as die in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Many Children of profeſſing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children of the Covenant die in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. As ſuch Infants are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſharers in the Sin and Guilt of the firſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001934_0009_0FBA1E818DC037C8"/>Adam, and ſo becoming liable to Death; ſo they are as capable of having righteouſneſs and grace from Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and of being Saved by him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. — 19.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.45. — 49. But as for thoſe under the Goſpel, grown to years of Underſtanding; they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Sin, if they would be Saved by Chriſt. They muſt be convinc'd of <hi>Sin.</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8.) <hi>Guilt.</hi> (Rom. 3.19.) <hi>Wrath.</hi> (Mat. 3.7.) They muſt have their hearts <hi>rent and broken</hi> for Sin. (<hi>Joel.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.) muſt <hi>mourn</hi> for it. (<hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.) be <hi>ſorry</hi> for it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.18.) <hi>Be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded for their own Sinful wayes,</hi> and <hi>loath</hi> themſelves for them. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31, 32.) and with ſuch a Soul abhorrence of Sin, they muſt <hi>turn from all their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that ſo Iniquity may not be their Ruin.</hi> Ezek. 18.30.

               <p>It is Chriſt's Command, that thoſe who are his Diſciples, Subjects, Servants ſhould be Baptized, He ſaid to his Apoſtles, Mat. 28 19, 20. <hi>Teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you; and to, I am with you alwayes to the End of the World.

If thou wilt not have him to <hi>Reign over thee,</hi> he'll <hi>ſlay thee,</hi> Luke 19.27.
