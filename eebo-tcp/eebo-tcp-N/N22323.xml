            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>The Sons of Toil, with many a weary stroke,</l>
            <l>Scoop the hard bosom of the solid rock;</l>
            <l>Resistless through the stiff, opposing clay,</l>
            <l>With steady patience, work their gradual way;</l>

            <l>Through the brown horrors of the aged wood;</l>
            <l>Cross the lone waste the silver urn they pour,</l>
            <l>And cheer the barren heath, or sullen moor.</l>
            <l>The traveller, with pleasing wonder, sees</l>
            <l>The white sail gleaming through the dusky trees;</l>
            <l>And views the alter'd landscape with surprize,</l>
            <l>And doubts the magic scenes which round him rise,</l>
            <l>Now, like a flock of swans, above his head,</l>

            <l>Now, meeting streams, in artful mazes, glide,</l>
            <l>While each, unmingled, pours a separate tide;</l>
            <l>Now, through the hidden veins of earth they flow,</l>
            <l>And visit sulphurous mines and caves below,</l>
            <l>The ductile streams obey the guiding hand,</l>
            <l>And <hi>social Plenty</hi> crowns the HAPPY LAND!"</l>

What Nature has denied to the inhabitants of one climate, is supplied by what she has liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on another; and the super-abundance of each becomes <hi>common stock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What COMMERCE, considered in this view, is to mankind in general, by means of <hi>foreign trade</hi> and <hi>external navigation;</hi> she is, in a smaller degree, to particular states and societies, by means of <hi>inland navigation</hi> and good <hi>roads;</hi> whereby the produce of one part of the country, as the case may require, is easily exchanged for that of another, and the superfluities of the whole readily carried to the principal marts or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for exportation.</p>
            <p>Without improvements of this kind, together with a good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws for the encouragement of <hi>industry</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the inhabitants of countries rich by nature, capable of being bound together in one flourishing and civilized <hi>whole,</hi> sensible of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest, and rejoicing in the common prosperity, may continue long in a state of almost savage wretchedness and poverty, insensible to the benefits of social and civil life, contributing <hi>scantily</hi> to the relief of their own wants, and <hi>nothing</hi> to relieve the wants of others, or to increase the common stock of felicity in their own country, and of the world in general.</p>
            <p>When a country is well improved by means of <hi>good roads</hi> and <hi>canals,</hi> joining its principal rivers, and thus establishing a general <hi>inland communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> each district with its superfluity may, as already mentioned, purchase what it wants of another, and each be reciprocally furnished with all necessaries and commodities; and, therefore, improvements of this kind are among the strongest marks of the good policy of a nation.</p>

               <hi>Canals</hi> and <hi>water-carriage,</hi> in particular (as is well observed by the writers on this subject) "render land-carriages and beasts of burthen less necessary; and they may be more profitably employed in tillage and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture. By <hi>canals,</hi> dry and barren grounds are fertilized, and marshy and watery grounds are drained. By means of them, manufactures require fewer hands and less expense; and traffic is extended and animates all parts of a country, procuring plenty and happiness to the individuals, and enlarging the power and strength of a state or sovereignty in general."</p>
            <p>"In fine, by <hi>canals,</hi> a people may be supplied," in their cities, towns, and elsewhere, "with grain, forage, fuel, materials for building, and also all other heavy and raw materials for manufactures, which otherwise would remain of little value at a distance from the place where they are wanted, because of the great expense commonly attending their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation by carriages, &amp;c. for, a <hi>barge</hi> of a reasonable size, worked by two men and drawn by two horses, can transport seventy or eighty tons; which weight, by any other carriage, would have required forty men and about one hundred and sixty horses." This calculation is made for the canals in England, where, by means of turnpikes, a level country and improved roads, land-carriage has a great advantage over any land-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that can, for many years, be compleated throughout the greatest part of the United States; and the calculations are also verified by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the difference between land and water-carriage in the immense commerce carried on by <hi>canals</hi> in Holland, France and Italy. To esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the difference of expense between <hi>land</hi> and <hi>water-carriage</hi> in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylvania,</hi> while our rivers continue in an unimproved state, is difficult. An estimate, however, was attempted for this purpose, founded on the most authentic documents, and laid before the Legislature in February, 1791, <note n="*" place="bottom">The plan of a more accurate <hi>estimate</hi> will be added to the report of the engineer, for the year 1794, in the subsequent papers.</note> as may be seen from page 11th. to page 17th. of the following papers, and was greatly in favor of water-carriage. But when the canals, now in operation, shall be compleated, even to the connection of the city of Philadelphia with Presqu' Isle on lake Erie (two short port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages only excepted) the difference in favor of water-carriage, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, will be far greater than is estimated in England, Holland, France and Italy, or indeed any other European country.</p>

It is no wonder then, that from the earliest stages of <hi>commerce</hi> in the Old World, and even for the conveniency of military expeditions, and maneuvres both of attack and defence, <hi>canals</hi> for water-carriage should have been among the first improvements made on the face of nature, by the most powerful states, both ancient and modern.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>canals</hi> executed by the ANCIENTS, the first mentioned by historians is that which connected the <hi>Red Sea</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> by which, it is said, <hi>king Solomon</hi> passed with his fleet to join that of <hi>Hyram,</hi> king of Tyre, to proceed together to <hi>Ophir</hi> in search of gold, as in Kings, I. chap. 9th. <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> among the ancients; <hi>Delisle,</hi> Father <hi>Secard</hi> and <hi>Rollin</hi> among the moderns, have all borne testimony to the existence of this canal; and its ruins have been traced by sundry travellers—<hi>Rollin,</hi> in particular, gives the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account of it—</p>
            <p>"The <hi>canal</hi> which joined the <hi>Red Sea</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> is not one of the least advantages which the <hi>Nile</hi> afforded <hi>Egypt.</hi> This <hi>canal</hi> had its beginning near the town of <hi>Bubastus;</hi> it was one hundred cubits, that is, fifty yards broad, so that two boats could pass with ease, deep enough for the largest vessels, and above one hundred <hi>Stadia,</hi> that is, fifty leagues long." But this canal, useful and extensive as it is said to have been, can hardly be compared, in point of utility or extent, to what may be anticipated in the future prospects of <hi>commerce</hi> in the UNITED STATES, by means of <hi>canals</hi> and <hi>rivers</hi> joining the tide-waters of Delaware, Susquehanna, Potomack, Hudson's river, &amp;c. with the Ohio, Mississippi, the great western lakes, and perhaps the South Sea itself.</p>
            <p>It would be foreign to the main subject of the following papers, to speak of the military <hi>canals</hi> of the <hi>Romans;</hi> such as the <hi>Fossa Mariana</hi> to draw subsistence by sea up the <hi>Rhone;</hi> the canal from the <hi>Isser</hi> (which empties into the <hi>Zuyder-zee</hi>) to the <hi>Rhone</hi> and <hi>Rhine;</hi> the canal joining the river <hi>Nyne</hi> in England, near <hi>Peterborough,</hi> with the <hi>Witham</hi> below <hi>Lincoln.</hi> But it may be proper to observe, that even in a <hi>military</hi> as well as <hi>commercial</hi> view, it may be worthy of the <hi>United States</hi> of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, to improve the natural advantages of their situation along our <hi>sea coasts,</hi> as well as in the <hi>internal</hi> parts of our country. For example, if it should ever be the misfortune of these states to be engaged in a foreign
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029474_0006_0FE17C499BE766F0"/>
war, especially with maritime powers, how easy and safe might a water communication be made from Rhode Island and the eastern states to New York; and from New York to Philadelphia, by joining the <hi>Millstone</hi> or other branches of the <hi>Rariton</hi> with the river Delaware and the city of Philadelphia; and then from Philadelphia down the Delaware, and (by a short cut of about four miles and a half below Newcastle) from the Delaware to Chesapeak bay, <hi>Baltimore, Annapolis</hi> and the city of <hi>Washington</hi> on Potomack; thence still by bays, canals and cuts, through Virginia, North and South Carolina to Savannah in Georgia. In time of <hi>war,</hi> this might not only give a safe communication from one extremity of the United States to another, similar to the communication from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to province and from town to town in Holland, free from the interruption of the privateers of a foreign enemy; but even in time of <hi>peace</hi> such a communication, at certain seasons, by vessels not fit for a <hi>coasting</hi> trade, and the danger of doubling capes and going out to <hi>sea,</hi> might answer many commercial purposes, and make shorter and fafer voyages—But this hint is only thrown out hastily, and by the bye. We return to the subject of <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> canals for <hi>internal</hi> navigation.</p>
            <p>Next to the <hi>canals</hi> of the ancients, already mentioned, and indeed superior in name to any of them, is the CANAL OF CHINA, begun about the end of the third century; which is said to be the source of immense riches, being constantly covered with a multitude of vessels and boats; by which one may travel, within land, from <hi>Pekin</hi> to the extremity of the empire—a space of six hundred leagues. "The principal canal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges itself on both sides, into a great number of others, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the most part of the towns and villages, and answer the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of travellers and traffick. The small <hi>canals</hi> are again subdivided into a number of smaller to fertilize the neighboring plains. Travellers speak with extacy of this <hi>canal,</hi> and of the magnificence and beauty of the <hi>stone bridges</hi> over the same, the piers being so slender, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the materials, that the arches, which are very high, appear at a distance, as if suspended in the air; and, when many can be seen at once, they form a prospect the most agreeable in the world: yet these ingenious people have not the use of locks and sluices, but by the help of ropes and pullies, draw their boats up dams of masonry, where there is a fall, which is sometimes attended with great danger."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:029474_0007_0FE17C4B2FDA5208"/>
Of MODERN CANALS, those of <hi>France</hi> deserve particular notice. "As early as the reign of their Henry IV. the French became sensible of the great advantages the Dutch and Flemings enjoyed by joining rivers and seas by <hi>canals;</hi> and therefore conceived many projects of this kind. The most important of those executed are the following—</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>canal</hi> for joining the <hi>Seine</hi> and <hi>Loire,</hi> which was the first made in that country, with locks and sluices to ascend and descend boats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the labor and danger of ropes and pullies, as in the ancient method.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>canal</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to aid the former, as of great importance to the city of Paris; and which meets the Loire a little above Orleans and was finished in 1724, making the navigation of the <hi>Seine,</hi> from near <hi>Orleans,</hi> as good as can be desired.</p>
            <p>III. But of all the great works executed in France, the CANAL of LANGUEDOC, called also the <hi>canal</hi> of the two seas, is the greatest, and reflects more honor on <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. than all the victories and spendid acts of his reign. By means of this grand <hi>canal,</hi> a ready communication is made between the two fertile provinces of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and in consequence between the <hi>Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> "It is sixty-four leagues long, and has one hundred and four locks, extending in some places for a mile together by a passage dug through rocks under ground. The expense was thirteen millions of livres, of which the king contributed seven millions, and the province of Languedoc the rest <hi>[See Savare Dict. Comm.]</hi> "And if the king, on the representation of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> had not shared the expense, and magnificently given the perpetual revenues of it to the celebrated engineer, Mr. <hi>Riquet</hi> and his heirs, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject only to the sole charge of keeping it in repair, this great work had, perhaps, remained unfinished to this day. The states of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> with equal magnanimity, contributed their part, by a tax on that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, without any view to a share of the profits; excepting so far that they rightly considered, the tax as continuing only for a time, but that the expenditures of the profits, would be amongst themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a permanent source of riches, increasing more and more, by the advantages they would reap from trade, added to that of obtaining with ease, those things which they stood in most need of—and the event con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their expectations."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:029474_0008_0FE17C4CB62E9718"/>
"The <hi>opposition</hi> which Mr. <hi>Riquet</hi> met with from the OWNERS OF THE GROUND, through which the <hi>canal</hi> was to pass, being made known to <hi>Colebert,</hi> he thought the only way to avoid these difficulties, was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the king to <hi>indemnify all those who might think themselves aggrieved;</hi> who, accordingly, took the canal into his own protection, bought the ground through which it was to pass, erected it into a fief, and gave the property to Mr. Riquet, as aforesaid."</p>
            <p>A similar opposition has been made by some of the owners of lands on the route of the Pennsylvania canals; but this, it is hoped, may be overcome gradually by the good sense of the people: if not, the remedy is in the power of the Legislature by an amendment of the incorporating acts, providing more effectually for a valuation by <hi>good and lawful men indifferent to the parties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to some further account of the <hi>Languedoc canal,</hi> which, traversing an immense tract of country, and joining two oceans by an entire inland navigation, bears the greatest similitude (although upon a shorter scale) to the <hi>canals</hi> proposed for joining the <hi>Atlantic ocean</hi> by means of the tide waters of <hi>Hudson's</hi> river, the <hi>Delaware, Susquehanna</hi> and <hi>Potomack</hi> on the east, with <hi>Ohio</hi> or <hi>Mississippi,</hi> and the great lakes, which are in the nature of <hi>oceans,</hi> on the <hi>west.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Languedoc canal</hi> (according to the account of VALLENCEY, an able engineer, whose authority is made use of in many parts of this introduction) is "divided into two principal parts, running from its <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>point</hi> of <hi>partage,</hi> is that point on the summit of some mountain, or highest middle ground where the waters, head springs, or sources of different great rivers rise; and, dividing themselves, run different ways. Thus, in the navigation from Philadelphia, by means of the <hi>Schuylkill, Susquehanna</hi> and <hi>Juniata</hi> rivers on the <hi>east</hi> side, and the <hi>Conemaugh, Kiskeminetas, Allegheny</hi> and its branch called <hi>French creek,</hi> on the <hi>west</hi> side, [See the map] by which the tide waters of <hi>Delaware</hi> may be connected with <hi>Lake Erie</hi> (and the other great lakes) at <hi>Presqu' Isle;</hi> and with the <hi>Mississippi</hi> waters, at the heads of Conemaugh; the point of partage is on a fine level on the Allegheny mountain, where large springs running <hi>eastward</hi> into the <hi>Juniata branch</hi> of <hi>Susquehanna,</hi> and <hi>westward</hi> into the <hi>Conemaugh</hi> branch of <hi>Allegheny</hi> river, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the <hi>Ohio</hi> and <hi>Mississippi,</hi> are but a few rods apart; and the present carrying place from the mouth of Poplar run on Juniata to the forks of Little Conemaugh, less than sixteen miles.</note> 
               <hi>point of partage,</hi> which is the most elevated spot in the neighborhood of <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naudari.</hi> The <hi>first,</hi> which extends ninety-six thousand three hundred
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:029474_0009_0FE17C4E414028F0"/>
and fifteen French fathoms towards the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> descends from the point of partage to the lake of <hi>Thau</hi> near <hi>Agde,</hi> and passes from thence to the port of <hi>Cette</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> The <hi>second,</hi> which extends twenty-nine thousand three hundred and sixty-six fathoms, descends from the <hi>point of partage</hi> to the ocean at its mouth in the <hi>Garonne,</hi> below <hi>Toulouse;</hi> so that between the two mouths of this grand canal, the whole extent is one hundred and twenty-five thousand six hundred and eighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one fathoms, or fifty French leagues and an half. An exact level of the ground being taken, it was found that the point of partage was six hundred French feet higher than the lake of <hi>Thau,</hi> which is on a level with the Mediterranean, and one hundred and eighty-six French feet above the mean height of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> taken immediately below Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse."</p>
            <p>"To pass the boats from the port of <hi>Cette</hi> up to the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>partage,</hi> there are seventy-four locks, <note n="†" place="bottom">To pass from the <hi>summit level</hi> of the <hi>Schuylkill</hi> and <hi>Susquehanna canal</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Tulpehocken</hi> on Schuylkill eastward, in the distance of near thirty-five miles, the fall is three hundred and ten feet, proposed to be divided into forty-five locks—The descent from the <hi>west</hi> end of the summit level to the <hi>Susquehanna,</hi> at the mouth of its <hi>Swatara</hi> branch, has not yet been finally ascertained, nor, consequently, the number of locks, should it be eventually necessary to make a <hi>canal</hi> and locks the whole way, and every where to quit the bed of the river.</note> of about eight feet fall each; and twenty-six locks from the same point to the <hi>Garonne,</hi> which is navigable from Toulouse to the ocean; so that this CANAL contains one hundred <hi>great locks.</hi> The only difficulty in the accomplishment of this work (for the ground is level and of a good kind) was the expense, which was supplied as above stated.</p>
            <p>"Of these one hundred locks, the most beautiful are the <hi>eight locks</hi> together, near <hi>Beziers,</hi> which form one continued cascade of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty fathoms long and sixty-six French feet fall; that is eight feet three inches fall to each lock."—Similar to this, and equally beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, are the <hi>five locks</hi> together, at the east end of the summit level of the <hi>Schuylkill</hi> and <hi>Susquehanna canal,</hi> between <hi>Myers-town,</hi> near the head of the Tulpehocken branch of <hi>Schuylkill;</hi> and <hi>Lebanon,</hi> at the head of the <hi>Quittapabilla</hi> and <hi>Swatara</hi> branch of <hi>Susquehanna.</hi> Here there is thirty feet fall, that is six feet fall to each lock, comprized in the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:029474_0010_0FE17C57A1162B48"/>
distance of three hundred and seventy feet; by which junction there is a saving of about a fifth of the expense which would have been requisite in the construction of so many locks separately.</p>
            <p>"In the <hi>route</hi> of the <hi>Languedoc canal,</hi> there are several hills and mountains in the aforesaid space of fifty leagues, which the <hi>canal</hi> was to cross; all of which are cut through, except that of <hi>Malpas;</hi> which, being very high and rocky, is hollowed, or tunnelled, in the form of a vault, with a foot bank four feet broad, to draw the boats along. This work passes for as extraordinary and noble a thing as any of the ancient Romans."</p>
            <p>"This <hi>canal</hi> (of <hi>Languedoc</hi>) is sixty feet broad at top, thirty feet at bottom, and six feet deep. At the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>partage,</hi> there is the great <hi>bason</hi> called <hi>Narouse</hi> of an octangular form, being four hundred yards long, three hundred broad and seven feet deep, its sides lined with masonry—The greatest difficulty in joining the two seas by means of this canal, was thought to be that of finding a sufficient quantity of water at the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>partage,</hi> to supply a continual navigation of fifty leagues, because of the inevitable loss by the gates, the oozing and evaporation. It was here that <hi>Riquest</hi> gave proof of his superior abilities, for providing for so essential an article, by the <note n="*" place="bottom">This reservoir is said to contain a body of water, whose superficies is two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions three hundred and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The waters of this reservoir, run out through large brass cocks, which communicate with vaulted galleries, made at the bottom of the dam, one hundred feet below the surface."</p>
            <p>"In constructing this grand canal, they inevitably crossed many rivers and rivulets; and then thought of no other expedient than to bring them
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:029474_0011_0FE17C5B272A4690"/>
into it, and let them overflow again at particular places, that they might always keep a sufficient depth of water for the navigation; and so far from thinking these foreign waters an inconvenience, they were considered as proper to supply what was lost by evaporation. At the end of some years they found their error; for the mud, which these foreign waters brought into the canal, increased so fast, that the canal would not have remained long navigable, had not the celebrated engineer <hi>Vauban,</hi> found means to separate these foreign waters from the <hi>canal,</hi> and to let in as much of them as they pleased, and when they thought proper. This he compleated by <hi>back drains,</hi> or side ditches, and aqueducts of his own invention—There are forty-five of these on this canal, which are of two kinds; the first, called aqueduct bridges, raised on arches, to support the canal, under which passes these foreign rivers and waters.

Of the latter, namely—the duke of Bridgewater's, the re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of a short extract from memoirs of the life of Mr. <hi>James Brindley,</hi> may be proper to show that neither mountains nor valleys, rivers nor marshes, can be any long impediment to skill and perseverance, supplied and supported by adequate finances.</p>
            <p>The duke of Bridgewater hath at Worsley, about seven miles from Manchester, a large estate, rich with mines of coal, which had hitherto lain useless in the bowels of the earth, because the expense of carriage was too great to find a market for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
            <p>The duke, wishing to work these mines, perceived the necessity of a canal from Worsley to Manchester: upon which occasion, Mr. Brindley, who was now become famous in the country, was consulted. Having surveyed the ground, be declared the scheme to be practicable. In consequence of this, an act was obtained in the years 1758 and 1759, for enabling the duke to cut a canal from Wordey to Salford, near Manchester, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> carry the same to or near Hollin Ferry, in the county of Lancaster. It being, however, afterwards discovered, that the navigation would be more beneficial, both to the duke of Bridgewater and the public, if carried over the river Irwell, near Barton bridge, to Manchester—he applied again to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and procured an act, which enabled him to vary the course of the canal agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to this new plan, and likewise to extend a side branch to Longford bridge in Stretford. Mr. Brindley in the mean time had begun these great undertakings, being the first of the kind ever attempted in England, with navigable subterraneous tunnels and elevated aqueducts. The principle laid down at the commencement of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness reflects much honor on the noble undertaker, as well as upon his engineer. It was resolved that the canal should be perfect in its kind, and that, in order to preserve the level of the water, it should be free from the usual obstructions of locks. But, in accomplishing this end, many difficulties occurred, which were deemed unsurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It was necessary that the canal should be carried over rivers, and many large and deep vallies, where it was evident that such stupendous mounds of earth must be raised as could scarcely, it was thought, be compleated by the labor of ages; and above all, it was not known from what source so large a supply of water could be drawn, as, even upon this improved plan, would be requisite for the navigation. But Mr. Brindley, with a strength of mind peculiar to himself, and being possessed of the confidence of his great patron, conquered all the embarrassments thrown in his way, not only from the nature of the undertaking itself, but by the passions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of interested individuals, and the admirable machines he contrived, and the methods he took, to facilitate the progress of the work, brought on such a rapid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it, that the world began to wonder how it could have been esteemed so difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:029474_0014_0FE17C66514A5C70"/>
When the canal was compleated as far as Barton, where the Irwell is navigable for large vessels, Mr. Brindley proposed to carry it over that river, by an aqueduct of thirty-nine feet above the surface of the water. This, however, being generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a wild and extravagant project, he desired, in order to justify his conduct towards his noble employer, that the opinion of another engineer might be taken: believing that he could easily convince an intelligent person of the practicability of his design. A gentleman of eminence was accordingly called in; who, being conducted to the place where it was intended that the aqueduct should be made, ridiculed the attempt; and when the height and dimensions were communicated to him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, I have often heard of castles in the air, but never before was shown where any of them were to be erected.</p>
            <p>This unfavorable verdict did not deter the duke of Bridgewater from following the opinion of his own engineer. The aqueduct was immediately begun; and it was carried on with such rapidity and success, as astonished all those who had but a little before condemned it as a chimerical scheme.</p>
            <p>"This work commenced in September, 1760; and the first boat sailed over on the 17th. July, 1761. From that time, it was not uncommon to see a boat loaded with forty tons drawn over the aqueduct, with great ease, by one or two mules; while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, against the stream of the Irwell, persons had the pain of beholding ten or twelve men tugging at an equal draught; a striking instance of the superiority of a canal navigation over that of a river not in the tide way. The works were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Manchester, at which place the curious machines for landing coals upon the top of the hill, gives a pleasing idea of Mr. Brindley's address in diminishing labour by mechanical contrivances.</p>
            <p>"The duke of Bridgewater perceiving, more and more, the importance of these inland navigations, not only to himself in particular, but to the community in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, extended his ideas to Liverpool; and though he had everydifficulty to encounter, that could arise from the novelty of his undertakings, his grace happily overcame all opposition, and obtained, in 1762, an act of parliament for branching his canal to the tide way of the Mersy.—This part of the canal is carried over the Mersy and Bollen, and over many wide and deep vallies. Over the vallies it is conducted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of a single lock: the level of the water being preserved by raising a mound of earth, and forming therein a channel for the water across the valley at Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, through which the Mersy runs: this kind of work extends nearly a mile.</p>
            <p>"A person might naturally have been led to conclude, that the conveyance of such a mass of earth must have employed all the horses and carriages in the country, and that the completion of it would be the business of an age. But our excellent mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic made his canal subservient to this part of his design, and brought the soil in boats of a peculiar construction, which was conducted into caissoons or cisterns. On open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bottom of the boats, the earth was deposited where it was wanted; and thus, in the easiest and simplest manner, the valley was elevated to a proper level for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the canal. The ground across the Bollen was raised by temporary locks, which were formed of the timber used in the caissoons, just mentioned. In the execution of
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:029474_0015_0FE17C6963773558"/>
every part of the navigation, Mr. Brindley produced many valuable machines, which ought never to be forgot in this kingdom; nor ought the oeconomy, and forecast, which are apparent through the whole work, to be omitted, in the stops, or flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, fixed in the canal where it is above the level of the land. The stops are so constructed, that, should any of the banks give way, and thereby occasion a current, the adjoining gates will rise by that motion only, and prevent any other part of the water from escaping, except that which is near the breach between the two gates—The success with which the duke of Bridgewater's undertakings were crowned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a number of gentlemen, and manufacturers, in Staffordshire, to revive the idea of a canal navigation through that country, for the conveying to market at a cheaper rate, the products and manufactures of the interior parts of the kingdom. This plan was patronized by lord Gower and Mr. Anson; and met with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of many persons of rank, fortune, and influence in the neighbouring counties. Mr. Brindley was, therefore, engaged to make a survey from the Trent to the Mersy; and upon his reporting that is was practicable to construct a canal, from one of those rivers to the other, and thereby to unite the ports of Liverpool and Hull, a subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for carrying it into execution was set on foot in 1765, and an act of parliament <note n="*" place="bottom">He was the greatest enthusiast in favor of artificial navigations that ever existed. Having spoken upon various circumstances of rivers before a committee of the House of Commons, in which he seemed to treat all sorts of rivers with great contempt, a member asked him, for what purpose he apprehended rivers were created Brindley, considering with himself a little before he gave an answer replied at last, "to feed navigable canals."</note> was obtained in the same year.</p>
            <p>"In 1766, this canal, called by the proprietors, "the canal from the Trent to the Mersy," but more emphatically by the engineer, "the grand trunk navigation," on account of the numerous branches which he justly supposed would be extended every way from it, was begun; and under his direction conducted with great spirit and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, as long as he lived. Mr. Brindley's life not being continued to the completion of this important and arduous undertaking, he left it to be finished by his brother-in-law, Mr. Henshall, who put the last hand to it in May, 1777, being somewhat less that eleven years after its commencement. We need not say, that the final execution of the grand trunk navigation gave the highest satisfaction to the proprietors, and excited a general joy in a populous country, the inhabitants of which already receive every advantage they could with from so truly noble an enterprise.</p>
            <p>"This canal is 93 miles in length, and, besides a large number of bridges over it, has 76 locks and 5 tunnels. The most remarkable of the tunnels is a subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous passage of Harecastle, being 2880 yards in length, and more than 70 yards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the surface of the earth. The scheme of this inland navigation had employed the thoughts of the ingenious part of the kingdom for upwards of twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and some surveys had been made; but Harecastle hill, through which the tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is conducted, could neither be avoided nor overcome by any expedient the ablest engineers could devise. It was Mr. Brindley alone who surmounted such difficulties, arising from the variety of measures, strata and quicksands, as no one but himself would have attempted to conquer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:029474_0016_0FE17C6B359F37F8"/>
"Soon after the navigation from the Trent to the Mersy was undertaken, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to parliament, by the gentlemen of Staffordshire and Worcestershire, for leave to construct a canal from the grand trunk, near Haywood, in Staffordshire, to the river Severn, near Bewly. The act being obtained, the design was executed by our great engineer; and hereby the port of Bristol was added to the two before united ports of Liverpool and Hull. This canal, which is about 46 miles in length, was compleated in 1772. Mr. Brindley's next undertaking was the survey and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a canal from Birmingham, to unite with Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal, near Wolverhampton. This navigation, which was finished in about three years, is 26 miles in length. As by means of it vast quantities of coal are conveyed to the river Severn, as well as to Birmingham, where there must be a peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for them, extraordinary advantages have accrued to manufactures and commerce.</p>
            <p>"Our engineer advised the proprietors of the last mentioned navigation, in order to avoid the inconvenience of locks, and to supply the canal more effectually with water, to have a tunnel at Smethwick. This would have rendered it a compleat work. But his advice was rejected; and to supply the deficiency, the managers have lately erected two of Messrs. Watts and Boulton's steam engines. The canal from Droitwich to the river Severn, for the conveyance of salt and coal, was likewise executed by Mr. Brindley. By him also the Coventry navigation was planned, and it was a short time under his direction.</p>
            <p>"The Canal from Chesterfield to the river Trent, at Stockwith, was the last pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic undertaking in which Mr. Brindley engaged.</p>
            <p>"And notwithstanding <hi>some of the canals passed through the fine villas and extensive lawns of many gentlemen's retreats,</hi> yet <hi>their</hi> MAGNANIMITY induced them to sacrifice their private convenience for public utility. <note n="*" place="margin">Persons were offered to be appointed to value the ground, and assess damages, which they refused.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"He surveyed and planned the whole, and executed some miles of the navigation, which was successfully finished by Mr. Henshall in 1777.</p>
            <p>"The last of our great mechanic's ingenuity and uncommon contrivances that we shall mention, is his improvement of the machine for drawing water out of mines, by a loosing and gaining bucket. This he afterwards employed to advantage in raising up coal from the mines."</p>
            <p>P. S. Upon an extensive view of the natural advantages, which Pennsylvania en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, for improvements of this kind, a few of her citizens, in the year 1789. united by the name of "The SOCIETY for promoting the improvement of ROADS and INLAND NAVIGATION;" and the number of members soon increased to more than <hi>one hundred,</hi> residing in various parts of the state; whose meetings were to be on every Monday evening, during the session of the Legislature, in order to suggest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, schemes and proposals, for promoting internal trade, manufactures and population, by facilitating every possible communication between the different parts of the state.</p>

            <head>The memorial of "The Society for promoting the improvement of roads and inland navigation,"
<hi>Respectfully sheweth,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT your memorialists, residing in various parts of this state, with a view to contribute their best endeavors to promote the internal trade, manufactures and population of their country, by facilitating every possible communication between the different parts of the state, have lately formed themselves into a society, by the name above mentioned. And knowing that the Legislature, with the laudable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of advancing the best interests of this commonwealth, and availing themselves of the extensive information, which they have obtained of the geography and situation of the country, have now under their consideration the important subject of roads and inland navigation; we, therefore, beg leave, with all possible deference, to suggest some important considerations which have occurred to us in our enquiries into this subject.</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania, from her situation, and extent of territory, is a respectable common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the Union. Her soil is fertile, her products various, and her rivers, by the bountiful Author of Nature, have been made to flow in every direction, as if on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to bear from all parts the wealth and produce of the land, in an easy, cheap and expeditious manner, to her principal mart and port in the city of Philadelphia. To combine the interests of all the parts of the state, and to cement them in a perpetual commercial and political union, by the improvement of those natural advantages, is one of the greatest works which can be submitted to <hi>legislative</hi> wisdom; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent moment is particularly auspicious for the undertaking, and if neglected, the loss will be hard to retrieve.</p>
            <p>When once our trade hath forced its way, even through a less advantageous channel, it is difficult to alter its course; and a little expense, judiciously and seasonably applied, may retain a stream in its channel, which with immense sums cannot be restored, if once diverted from it. Large emigrations from Europe are now directing their course to this country, and will be encouraged by every improvement we make, by means of roads and water communications with the distant parts of the state. The constant influx of settlers from the eastern states is also a considerable object. Being stopped, for the present, by the Indian disturbances from swarming into the western territory, many of them may be encouraged to make a halt or settlement in this state, if they find good roads and communications in the different parts thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:029474_0018_0FE17C743A6BC3C8"/>
It may be proper, therefore, before we proceed farther, to subjoin a general state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the various communications and improvements of which Pennsylvania is capable in this way; so far as relates to navigation.</p>

               <p>But as the Tioga waters, and the communications from thence to lake Ontario, lie within the state of New York, it is probable that they will not be improved by that state, unless it can be done with a view to draw the trade of that country by the Oneida lake, Wood creek, &amp;c. into Hudson's river, and even when that shall happen, by a happy rivalship between the cities of Philadelphia and New York, to draw the trade of those vast countries to their respective ports, a great part of it will come with more ease to the former than to the latter; and while the waters are left in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unimproved state, every advantage is on the side of Pennsylvania, by means of the navigation down the <hi>Tioga,</hi> and then either down Susquehanna to the mouth of Swatara, and thence to Philadelphia by the waters of Swatara, Quitipahilla, Tulpehocken and Schuylkill; or from the mouth of Tioga up Susquehanna to the great bend, and thence by the portage to Stockport, and by Delaware to Philadelphia.

to the city of New York will be four hundred and thirty-five miles (See No. VII.) whereof seventeen miles are land carriage; and the distance to Philadelphia, by Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware (See No. II.) will be three hundred and thirty-one miles; or by Swatara and Schuylkill (See No. IX.) will be four hundred and one miles. Or if the middle of the Genessee settlement, on the Genessee river, be taken as the place of beginning, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to New York will be four hundred and eighty-seven miles, whereof <note n="*" place="bottom">In this route to New York there are the same portages, <abbr>

               <p>Connected with the Delaware navigation, we beg leave further to add, that above Stockport, the Mohock and Popaughton branches, are each navigable for boats of fifteen tons for more than fifty miles above their junction, and considerably higher still for rafts. The Lehigh and Lechawacksen, likewise, offer themselves as very important branches of this navigation, lying in the interior parts of the state; but nothing need be added to the report of the Commissioners on this head. We proceed, therefore, to the second great and most important head, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Susquehanna navigation,</hi> as it may be connected with the Schuylkill waters, on the one hand, and the Ohio waters and great lakes on the other. Here is a navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which we may properly call our own, passing through the most inhabited and central parts of the state; in which we can have no rivals, if duly improved, and opening such numerous sources and channels of inland trade, all leading to the port of Philadelphia, as perhaps no other nation or sea port on the whole globe can boast of.</p>
               <p>For, in the first place, if we turn our view to the immense territories connected with the Ohio and Mississippi waters, and bordering on the great lakes, it will appear from the tables of distances, that our communication with those vast countries (considering Fort Pitt as the port of entrance upon them) is as easy and may be rendered as cheap, as to any other port on the Atlantic tide waters. The distance from Philadelphia to the Allegheny, at the mouth of Kiskeminetas, is nearly the same as from the mouth of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nongahela to George Town on Potomack; and supposing the computed distances from Pittsburgh to the Dunkard Bottom to be just, and the navigation of Cheat river, on the one hand, and the Potomack, at the mouth of Savage river, on the other, to be, at all seasons of the year, equal to the navigation of the Kiskeminetas, Conemaugh and Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata; yet as the portage from Dunkard Bottom to the Potomack, at the mouth of Savage river, is thirty-seven miles and a quarter, and the portage from Conemaugh to Juniata only eighteen miles (which may be considerably shortened by locks) there can be no doubt but that the transportation of all kinds of goods and merchandize from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to Pittsburgh may be at a much cheaper rate than from any other sea port on the Atlantic waters.</p>
               <p>This is not mentioned with a view to disparage the internal navigation of our sister states, more especially <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia.</hi> We admire their noble exertions to improve the natural advantages of their country, and desire to imitate and to emulate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029474_0024_0FE17C851D7C81F8"/>
them. Every improvement, and every new communication with the western territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, promoted by any of the United States, by which the trade of the lakes, the Ohio and the Mississippi waters can be drawn to our sea ports, is a benefit to the whole Union. By no other methods than by opening easy communications, both by good roads and safe water carriage, can the settlers, in those vast western countries, be made useful to the Atlantic states, and comfortable in their own situation. Nor can we expect by any other means than by inviting their trade, and making it their interest to be connected with us, that we can long secure such connection. But, although a considerable part of the settlers on the Ohio waters may be accommodated by the Potomack navigation, and the state of Pennsylvania may only have a share in the trade of those waters; yet there remains to us the immense trade of the lakes, taking Presqu' Isle, which is within our own state, as the great mart or place of embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Here there can be no competition, in respect to the distances or the ease of water carriage, between the port of Philadelphia and any other port on the Atlantic tide waters; whichsoever of the three communications, between Philadelphia and Presqu' Isle, we may choose to pursue.</p>
               <p>Of those three communications, it is of importance to choose the best in the first instance, and not to neglect the improvement of it; nor to entertain doubts and delays, till the opportunity of receiving benefit from it be entirely lost, and the trade of those vast countries drawn into other channels.</p>
               <p>We shall speak first of the communication with Presqu' Isle, by the Chadaghque lake, the Conewango river, part of Allegheny, the Sinnemahoning, Susquehanna, Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara and Schuylkill (No. III.) which appears to be the shortest, being about five hundred and twenty-four miles and an half. The navigation of the Conewango and north branch of Sinnemahoning, according to the report of the Commissioners, may be made very good, and is, on that account, as well as the shortness of the distance, preferable to that by the way of Toby's creek and the west branch of Sinnemahoning. But a considerable part of this communication lies through the state of New York, in a yet unsettled country; and although it leads, in the most direct way to Presqu' Isle and the great lakes, it cannot be of any great use in the main communication with the Ohio and Mississippi by the way of Pittsburgh, which is the great object of present consideration.</p>
               <p>The second route from Philadelphia to Presqu' Isle, by the west branch of Susque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna, as connected with Swatara and Schuylkill, and by the Sinnemahoning and Toby's creek, being five hundred and sixty miles and a quarter (See No. IV.) passes indeed wholly through our own state; but besides what has been already mentioned concerning the waters of Toby's creek, compared with the Conewango and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daghque lake, this navigation could be of no farther use than the former, in respect to the main communication with Pittsburgh, as the mouth of Toby's creek lies fifty miles higher on the Allegheny than the mouth of Kiskeminetas; and even with respect to Presqu' Isle, the navigation from Philadelphia, by the way of the Juniata and Kiske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minetas, is as short as by the way of Toby's creek, the latter being five hundred and sixty miles and three quarters, as mentioned above, and the former five hundred and sixty-one miles and an half.</p>

                  <hi>Third,</hi> This third communication, then, is that which embraces all present interests. It connects Philadelphia with Pittsburgh and all the Ohio waters, by the Schuylkill, the Swatara and Juniata branches of Susquehanna, and the Kiskeminetas branch of Allegheny, with the distance of five hundred and sixty-one miles and an half (No. II.) and also Philadelphia and Presqu' Isle, using the same waters, as above, to the mouth of Kiskeminetas, and then by the easy waters of Allegheny and French creek. In this whole communication to Pittsburgh, there are only eighteen miles portage between the Juniata and Conemaugh (which may be considerably reduced as is said before) and only the addition of fifteen miles and an half more at the portage from Le Boeuf to Presqu' Isle, which portage is, likewise, included in both the other communications. In this statement of portages, it is supposed that the canal or lock navigation between the heads of Tulpehocken and Quitipahilla, is to be compleated; but it that work should be thought too great to begin with, it will be only the addition of four miles portage, by an excellent and level road.</p>
               <p>The navigation; by this route, we beg leave to recommend to the Legislature, as one of the first and greatest works which they can undertake for the honor and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their country. It is a work within their reach—a work in which not only the citizens of this state, but of the United States in general, are deeply interested. The expense, even including the canal, has been estimated, and doth not exceed the sum which would be requisite to compleat a good road of fifty or sixty miles in some of the interior parts of the state, and which, after all, would only be of <hi>partial</hi> benefit, contributing but little to unite the remote parts of the same, in one easy central chain of communication, with the capital.</p>
               <p>The improvement of roads is, however, one great part of the design of our <hi>asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> and we mean to make it our endeavor to bring forward and to encourage useful plans for this purpose. Some roads, as connected with the plan of inland navigation, require the immediate attention of the Legislature. Among these are the different portages mentioned in the respective water communications stated above; and, particularly, that between Stockport on Delaware, and Harmony, at the great bend of Susquehanna, and between the mouth of the Poplar run on Juniata, and the Canoe Place on Conemaugh. Another most important road, as connected with the navigation scheme, will be from the highest boatable waters of Yohiogeny, near the Turkey Foot, to the junction of the Rays-town branch of Juniata and Dunning's creek near Bedford; or even to the mouth of Poplar run on the Frank's-town branch. By this road, all the inhabitants of the upper parts of Washington and Fayette coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and part of Bedford county, would have access to the great water communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Juniata, or to the great <hi>state road</hi> from Bedford to Philadelphia; avoiding the mountainous and circuitous course they are now obliged to pursue; and a great part of their trade, which would otherwise go to Potomack, would be thereby secured to Pennsylvania.</p>
               <p>In this view, also, the state road, through Lancaster, Carlisle and Bedford to Pittsburgh, is an object of primary consideration, and may be undertaken without delay or injury to the plan of western navigation. This commonwealth, we are happy

to believe, is now, in its resources, equal to the accomplishment of all necessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, both of roads and navigation.</p>
               <p>We would beg leave, before we conclude, to point out some other roads as worthy of attention, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>I. The road through Reading and Sunbury, and thence to be continued by the best and most practicable route to Presqu' Isle, or the lands on French creek.</p>
               <p>II. The road through Bethlehem to the northern boundary of the state, at some point between Delaware and the great bend of Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>III. A road leading from Hudson's river, in the state of New York, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from Stockport on Delaware, across towards the west branch of Susquehanna, between Munsey and the great Island, and to join the road, mentioned above, as leading to French creek and Presqu' Isle.</p>
               <p>But, in every view, we humbly conceive, that the laying out and improving those roads ought not to interfere with, or delay the improvement of our inland navigation. The ease and cheapness of water carriage, compared with every other, furnish suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient arguments, on this subject, if there were none else.</p>
               <p>The annexed comparative view, of the expenses of both, is submitted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Legislature, as a conclusion to this memorial.</p>

            <head>Remarks and Calculations respecting the Communications between Schuylkill and Susquehanna.</head>
            <p>IN the present year 1790, by the best estimates that can be obtained, the quantity of one hundred and fifty thousand bushels of grain has been brought down the Susquehanna, and passed through Middle Town, on its way to Philadelphia market. Juniata has afforded a very considerable part of this quantity; and here it must be observed, that the lands on this river are but in an infant state of cultivation, and suppose them to be ever so well improved, the proportion they bear to the lands on the other branches of the Susquehanna is not more than one-fifth part.</p>
            <p>In the year 1788, large quantities of wheat and flour were carried up the river for the use of the settlers in Northumberland county: since last March, about thirty thousand bushels of wheat returned down the stream to market from said county. It may also be reasonably expected, that should an easy inland communication be effected between the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill, the whole produce of Cumberland, and part of York county, would cross the Susquehanna to the Philadelphia market. From these principles it is evident, that there will be an annual increase of the country produce that will descend the Susquehanna, although, from so short an experience, certainty in our estimates cannot be expected: but, in order to reduce the subject more to view, let the annual increase be put at one-eighth, which I expect will be allowed, on all hands, to be guarded by moderation and justified by strong probability.</p>
            <p>I said one hundred and fifty thousand bushels of grain are allowed to have passed to Middle Town in the present year, which, augmented by an annual increase of one-eighth, will, in 1793, amount to two hundred and six thousand two hundred and fifty bushels, which, at two shillings and six pence per bushel, (the carriage, on the present principles, to the Philadelphia market) amounts to twenty-five thousand seven hundred and eighty-one pounds, five shillings; then, by adding one-eighth, the annual increase, it will stand thus:—

The abovementioned quantity of grain is equal to five thousand five hundred and twenty-four tons and an half; and suppose one-third of the weight is carried back, in salt, liquors and other merchandize, at five shillings per hundred or five pounds per ton, there will be one thousand eight hundred and forty-two tons, with an annual increase of one hundred and sixty-seven tons.—It will then stand thus:—

A number of observations naturally present themselves as consequences of this water communication: First, The difference between the carriage by land and that by water, during the aforesaid period, is one hundred and forty-eight thousand three hundred and seventy-four pounds, which will be a clear gain to the country, and the stock now vested in horses, waggons, &amp;c. could be employed to other useful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; the so general use of horses might be abated and oxen used in their stead by the farmers, whose principal reason for giving so decided a preference to horses is their being supposed better for draught on the roads: a more general use of oxen would not only be attended with immediate profit to the husbandman, but would tend to increase the article of beef as an export. The lands in the old counties, below the mountains, are known to have abated in that virgin fertility which attends all new cultivation;—they must now be manured. Added to this, the population is increasing very rapidly; the operation of these causes, in a few years more, will make the consumption equal to the produce in the old counties. If the staple of the port of Philadelphia is to be supported, it can be best done by conducting the streams of commerce, in the article of grain, from the Susquehanna to this city.</p>
            <p>The late information obtained from the commissioners who have viewed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications with the Allegheny and lake Erie, make it highly probable, that an immense trade will one day be carried on from Philadelphia with the great lakes and furr countries, and with the settlements on the Ohio, &amp;c. The proposed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between Schuylkill and Susquehanna will serve as a basis to this traffick, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the route be by the Juniata or the other branches of the Susquehanna.</p>
            <div type="statement_of_expense">
               <head>The expense attending the transportation of two hundred and six thousand two hundred and fifty bushels of grain to market.</head>
               <p>THE above quantity of grain is equal to five thousand five hundred and twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four tons and an half, and, a boat to carry six tons, will be equal to nine hundred and twenty-one boat loads, and each boat to pass and repass eight times, annually, it will take one hundred and fifteen boats to transport the quantity above mentioned in a season;—the expense of hands and provisions attending each load will be fifteen pounds—consequently, nine hundred and twenty-one loads will cost thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifteen pounds, and the annual increase of expenses for an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional number of boats, hands, &amp;c. to transport the increase of produce, will be one thousand five hundred and twenty pounds a year, and then it will stand thus:—

            <head>A proposal and plan for carrying into immediate execution the improvement of roads and inland navigation.</head>
            <head>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met.</head>
            <p>THE Society for promoting the improvement of roads and inland navigation, beg leave to present the result of their enquiries, concerning the best method, and most effectual plan, for the carrying that important work into immediate execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And, in the first place, with respect to the improvement of roads, on turning our attention to the history of this work, as it hath been conducted in other countries, and especially in the island of Great Britain, we find that but little attention was paid to the improvement of roads, till in the year 1285, the first statute was passed for widening the roads between market towns in "England," but this was done purely to prevent robberies, and not the least hint of its being yet necessary for the use of carriages or to promote commerce. But, in the year 1555, a statute was passed "taking notice that the high ways were become very noisome and tedious to travel, and dangerous to all passengers and carriages;" wherefore, it was enacted, "That every parish should annually choose two Surveyors of the high ways, to see that the parishioners, according to their lands, abilities and farms, shall send their carts, horses, men, tools, &amp;c. four days in every year, for mending the roads, &amp;c." and, from this time, to the reign of Charles II. there were no less than twenty six statutes, on similar principles, passed for keeping the highways in repair; from which the road laws of Pennsylvania have been in great measure copied, only substituting townships for parishes. But soon after the restoration of Charles II. we find it set forth, "That the vast increase of the capital city of London, and of the nation's commerce and manufactures, with the concomitant increase of wealth and luxury, had introduced such numbers of heavy wheel carriages on the roads, as rendered it impracticable, in most cases, for parishes to keep their own part of the roads in repair; more especially in the counties lying nearer London, and in the manufacturing counties; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a more <hi>equitable</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> method was introduced of tolls and toll-gates called turnpikes; by which means the burden of putting and keeping the roads in repair (as it is strongly expressed) was put upon the <hi>identical wearers-out of the roads,</hi> according to the use they made of them—and, accordingly, upon this <hi>new</hi> and more <hi>equitable</hi> and <hi>effectual plan,</hi> many <hi>local,</hi> as well as <hi>general,</hi> statutes have been enacted for limiting the weight of waggon loads, the breadth of wheel rims, called fellies; the number of horses, &amp;c. And what has been said of roads may be applied to the deepening of rivers, and the improvement of inland navigation, by locks, tolls, and canals," which was begun about the same time, and is now extended over the whole kingdom by subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts of parliament <hi>special</hi> and <hi>local</hi> as well as more general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:029474_0034_0FE17CA9B6B376B8"/>
The present circumstances of Pennsylvania, in respect to the increase of commerce, wheel carriages, &amp;c. and the unimproved state of our roads and inland navigable waters, being so similar to those of England in the time of Charles II. the foregoing reasoning will justify the conclusion which we mean to draw from it, namely—That the putting or keeping the great roads in repair, either in the counties near the capital city of Philadelphia, or, indeed, in distant counties but thinly inhabited, would be a burthen not only intolerable to the inhabitants of the particular townships, through which the roads pass, but, likewise, <hi>unequal</hi> in itself, and ought neither to be borne by the state at large, nor yet by the particular townships and counties; but, for the greater part, "by the <hi>identical wearers-out</hi> of the roads," according to the use they make of them.—And the like reasoning applies to the improvement of rivers and opening of canals for water carriage.</p>
            <p>From these preliminary observations, the Society beg leave to lay down the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles, as the ground work of the <hi>plan</hi> herewith submitted to the consideration of the Legislature of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The method of turnpike roads and toll navigation must be adopted.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The work, both of roads and navigation, must be undertaken and carried into execution, by separate companies and associations of men; upon some uniform and consistent plan, aided and directed by the Legislature; as neither the state alone, nor any number of companies without public regulations and assistance, can be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the great work in all its parts; and, therefore, the assistance of the state should be apportioned to different parts of the work, with a <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>equal hand,</hi> in respect both to <hi>roads</hi> and <hi>navigation,</hi> as it may be most necessary, and where the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the tolls, the distance from the <hi>market</hi> and other circumstances may yield the least probability of an adequate encouragement or speedy reimbursement to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers.</p>
            <p>Upon those principles, the Society beg leave to offer the following</p>
            <div type="plan">
               <head>Heads of a Plan:—</head>

In order that there may be sufficient wisdom, consistency, experience, imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and public spirit attached to the execution of the work, and interested in its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; the Legislature to appoint, by law, a "Board of Commissioners for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of roads and inland navigation, within the state of Pennsylvania."</p>

To employ, at the public expense, a proper person or persons, to examine, survey, mark out, and report, in writing, such roads as may be deemed the most proper to be established as turnpikes, assigning their reasons that induced them to be of opinion, in any instance, that it will be of public utility to depart from the present or old line of any established road.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To determine finally (after considering such reports and obtaining all necessary information) upon the line of road, which shall be established as turnpike.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To determine on such roads as, not being suitable for turnpike, ought to be made or repaired at public cost, and to employ proper persons to perform the same.</p>

               <p n="5">5. To fix in each contract, the particular road, and the extent or length thereof which the parties are to improve, and the rates or tolls which they shall be entitled to receive for horses, cattle, carriages, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Every share to entitle the holder to a vote in establishing <hi>general rules</hi> and <hi>regulations,</hi> and in the choice of the Treasurer and Managers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Managers to have power—</p>
               <p n="1">1st. To call upon the contractors, or subscribers, for such proportions, from time to time, of their respective subscriptions, as may be necessary to carry on the work until finished, placing the sums collected in the hands of the Treasurer.</p>

               <p n="4">4th. To superintend the collection of the tolls, either by proper agents to be employed for the purpose, or by <hi>farming</hi> the same to individuals.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. To settle the accounts of the tolls, and make dividends half yearly, which shall be announced in the news-papers.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. To call the corporation together whenever they shall find necessary, and to lay their proceedings and accounts before it; at least once a year, and oftner if thereunto required by a quorum thereof.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The said Board of Commissioners to have the care and superintendency of <hi>inland navigations,</hi> respecting which they should be empowered,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To determine which of those that are proposed by the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Assembly, shall be undertaken solely at the public expense, and which of them can be best performed by contractors entitled to tolls, &amp;c. The latter to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029474_0037_0FE17CAE4CE11E80"/>
be preferred whenever the situation, and nature of the improvements will admit of it. With respect to the former, the Board should be authorized to carry on the work at the public expense, under the direction of such agent or agents as they may appoint for that purpose. In regard to the latter, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> such improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may be entitled to tolls, the Board should be empowered,</p>

               <p n="10">10. By an article in each contract, the government shall be restrained from laying out or establishing turnpikes, or toll navigations, in a second instance, that during <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> years, would destroy or diminish the income or revenue of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes or toll navigations which they had established in the first instance.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Board of Commissioners to be empowered to lend public money, if necessary, to any contractors or subscribers, to turnpike roads, or toll navigations, for the purpose of compleating what they have undertaken, if after going certain lengths, it should appear that they would be unable to compleat the same without such aid, sufficient security being given, that the sums so lent shall be faithfully applied to the uses intended, and re-paid at the end of the term stipulated. Or, the said Board may subscribe, on behalf of the commonwealth, such number of shares under any contract for turnpike roads or toll navigation, as may be found necessary, and be entitled to all the rights and privileges conferred on the share holders.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Board of Commissioners shall make application to the Governor, for his warrant upon the Treasurer, for the sums of money which they may, from time to time, require for carrying their duty into effect; their requisitions to be made in writing, and to be founded upon estimates of expenditures necessary or actually made, or upon engagements, subscriptions, or contracts made for the purposes of their appointment, and the Governor to grant his warrants upon such requisition (to be paid out of the fund appropriated to this use) unless he shall see sufficient cause to refuse; in which case he shall assign his reasons in writing.</p>
               <p>The Society have directed an accurate geographical and hydrographical <hi>map</hi> to be compiled from actual surveys; exhibiting a general and compleat view of the <hi>roads</hi> and <hi>water</hi> communications, which are proposed to be improved, connecting them with the roads and water communications of the neighbouring states; and they have promoted a liberal subscription for the immediate publication of the same; considering that such a map will not only be highly useful to all persons who wish to gain a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029474_0038_0FE17CB55BF4EBE0"/>
of the situation of the country, and the various improvements of which the state of Pennsylvania is susceptible, but it will likewise be useful to the public, by directing their attention to the different parts of the state which are the objects of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bringing forward individuals, as well as companies, to promote and undertake the execution of the same. But as the subscriptions of the members of the Society alone may not be sufficient encouragement for the publication of a map of such an expensive nature, the Society beg leave to recommend the further encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same to the Legislature, and herewith have presented the original draft of the same to their inspection. All which is humbly submitted.</p>

                  <hi>THE foregoing</hi> memorial, <hi>with the</hi> estimates <hi>and proposed</hi> plan <hi>of execution, having been referred by the Legislature to committees of their respective</hi> Houses, <hi>to</hi> confer <hi>with the</hi> committee <hi>of the</hi> Society of roads and navigation, <hi>and to</hi> report thereon; <hi>the result of the whole, after mature deliberation, was the adoption of the following</hi> general principles—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Legislature, although animated with the warmest zeal for the improvement of their country, by means of</hi> roads <hi>and inland navigation, yet could not subject the finances of the state (even if adequate) to the burden of the whole; yet they would make liberal appropriations of public money for the improvement of such</hi> roads <hi>and</hi> navigable waters, <hi>as lying too remote from the more populous parts of the country, and the inhabitants but thinly settled, rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable for them either to improve their own roads and waters by subscriptions or the usual county taxes; and the profits of the</hi> tolls <hi>would yet be too small, to induce companies to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the work at their own expense; but that in the more settled parts of the country, especially near the metropolis, they would be ready to incorporate companies, for the gradual and progressive improvement of roads and waters, where the tolls would be sufficient to recompence the subscribers or stockholders, and the charge would fall according to justice upon those who were to be benefited, in proportion to the use they might make of such roads and waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Legislature, therefore, in discharge of their part, and to set a laudable example of public spirit, made large appropriations by law, for the improvement of sundry</hi> roads <hi>and</hi> waters; [see the appendix.] <hi>They also passed the following acts of incorporation,</hi> 
                  <abbr>

            <head>An act to enable the Governor of this commonwealth to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate a company, for opening a canal and lock-navigation between the rivers Schuylkill and Susquehanna, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Tulpehoccon, Quittapahilla and Swatara, in the counties of Berks and Dauphin.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the opening a communication by water, for the transportation of the produce of the country, and of goods, wares and merchandizes, between the city of Philadelphia and the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and north western counties of the state of Pennsylvania, will greatly tend to strengthen the bands of union between citizens inhabiting distant parts of a country governed by the same free and happy constitution and laws, to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures, and the promotion of commerce: And whereas, from reports made by certain Commissioners appointed by the late Supreme Executive Council, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of an act of the General Assembly of this commonwealth in such case provided, it appears, that the waters of Tulpehoccon, Quittapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilla and Swatara, in the counties of Berks and Dauphin, united, by means of a canal and locks, will be sufficient for an inland navigation for the purposes aforesaid; and it is reasonable that the expense of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing so great a convenience should be defrayed by the persons who will derive an immediate benefit by the use of it:</p>

            <head>Schuylkill and Susquehanna Canal Navigation.</head>
            <head>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the commonwealth of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylvania, in General Assembly met:—</head>
            <p>THE President, Managers and Company of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, with every sentiment of respect and grateful acknowledgment of that protection, encouragement and support, which they have received from the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the carrying on the great work committed to their trust and direction; beg leave to submit, to the consideration of the General Assembly, an account of the work already executed, the monies expended, the plan and probable expense of the work remaining to be accomplished, and the prospect of an effectual completion of the whole undertaking, within the time limited by law.</p>
            <p>The magnitude and immense importance of the system of <hi>roads and inland naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> projected, and now in rapid progress, through the various parts of the state, as tending to the increase of our <hi>commercial</hi> and <hi>agricultural</hi> interest, to the general pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our citizens of every class and degree, and strengthening the bands of their union to the most distant parts of the state, need not be mentioned to an enlightened Legislature; which hath nursed this <hi>great work,</hi> by the aid of public money from the beginning, and hath incorporated and encouraged companies with liberal franchises, for carrying on and compleating the same.</p>
            <p>Within the whole habitable globe, there is not a country, of equal dimensions, which offers to its industrious inhabitants more resources of wealth, independence and happiness, than Pennsylvania; considering the salubrity of climate, the fertility of soil, the variety of produce and manufacturing materials, and the means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by <hi>improved roads</hi> and the <hi>inland navigation</hi> of our great rivers and their numerous branches, embracing and interlocking with each other, and spreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (up to their sources) through all the parts of the state; and forming <hi>water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> by sundry routs, from the <hi>tide waters</hi> of <hi>Delaware</hi> and the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> to the great lakes and extreme bounds of the United States.</p>
            <p>The CANAL which is to connect the <hi>Schuylkill</hi> and <hi>Susquehanna</hi> navigation is the <hi>chief link</hi> of this vast chain—a link on which the success and utility of the whole <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> necessarily depend.</p>
            <p>The summit level of this <hi>canal,</hi> between Lebanon and Myers-town, for upwards of three miles is compleated, in respect to the heavy digging, and the purchase of all the ground for the scite of the canal, the locks and towing paths; as well as the grounds containing the sources and springs of the waters, and through which they are to be conducted into the <hi>reservoir</hi> at the summit level. The exhorbitant prices allowed by <hi>juries</hi> for some of the lands and waters necessary to the work, has considerably enhanced the expense of this part; but a sufficiency of water to fill the <hi>canal</hi> and <hi>locks</hi> at the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029474_0065_0FE17D138188D668"/>
ground, was of such essential consequence to the success of the undertaking, that the whole system of our inland navigation must have been deranged, and have become abortive, if the Managers had been deterred, or slackened their exertions, on account of the expense; which, after all, does not greatly or disproportionably exceed the original estimates for the middle ground; and the final amount of expenditures on this part will not be above <hi>forty thousand pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two remaining parts of this grand communication under our direction, are—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Tulpehocken canal navigation,</hi> from the east end of the middle ground, down to Schuylkill at the mouth of Tulpehocken; being, by the courses of the creek and along its margin, thirty-five miles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Quitipahilla</hi> and <hi>Swatara</hi> navigation, from Lebanon to Susquehanna, being thirty-two miles.</p>
            <p>The report of our engineer, his plan and estimates, together with his able and judicious arguments and reasons for preferring, <hi>generally,</hi> a CANAL NAVIGATION along the margin, to the natural bed of the waters, (as being a more compleat navigation, with less injury to the meadows or mills of the land holders, and on the whole, at an expense not so much greater as to be placed in competition with the permanent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be derived from it) are herewith submitted to the Legislature.</p>
            <p>But the original calculations, on framing the act by which we were incorporated, were grounded upon the presumption that the natural beds of those rivers, by means of <hi>dams</hi> and <hi>locks,</hi> might answer the purpose of a temporary navigation, with little more than eight or ten miles digging on the whole; whereas, on the present improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plan, (which will remain of permanent emolument to the state, so long as those rivers continue to run) the expense will be about thrice the sum first contemplated, as will appear by the annexed estimate—It is an expense however, (considering the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the undertaking) which can by no means be viewed as beyond the powers of this state, and is a prize worthy of their public spirit, and utmost exertions to see accomplished.—Your memorialists therefore, cannot but entertain the most sanguine expectations of the aid and encouragement of the Legislature in prosecuting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the work.</p>
            <p>By the estimates hereto annexed, it will appear, that in order to compleat the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation upon a permanent foundation, through the distance of about seventy miles (from the mouth of Tulpehocken on Schuylkill, to the mouth of Swatara, on Susque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna) there will be a deficiency of £. 308,000—but the trade which may reasonably be expected through this immense communication with the Western World, will amply compensate the <hi>public,</hi> as well as the individual stockholders, for the <hi>capital stock</hi> to be employed in the work.</p>
            <p>There are but two ways to raise this CAPITAL—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either by enlarging the present <hi>capital</hi> by the increase of shares and new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, on the terms of the act of incorporation; or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the company's negociating and obtaining an <hi>effectual loan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PURSUANT to an order of the Board, made in April last, I have now the honor to lay before you, a plan and estimate of that part of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna canal, which extends from the east end of the summit level, to the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tulpehocken with the river Schuylkill near Reading. Independent of other circumstances, I purposely delayed the survey of the intended line until autumn, as by that means I had an opportunity of viewing the creek in its lowest state. My instructions directed me to explore the Tulpehocken, the adjacent ground, and any other practicable course by which a navigable canal might be made to the Schuylkill. I had conceived very sanguine hopes in favor of the practicability of the latter mode; as I had been informed by persons well acquainted with the face of the country, that there was a probability of finding a more direct route to the Schuylkill, than by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the circuitous windings of the Tulpehocken. But on a very attentive view I do not hesitate to declare that it is impracticable to deviate from the course of the creek; which from its <hi>source</hi> to its <hi>mouth</hi> is environed with hills, so as to render it impossible to leave its banks at any considerable distance, as will be seen by an inspection of the plan. <hi>One</hi> of the two remaining modes must therefore be adopted, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> a canal navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation totally unconnected with the river: or by using the bed of the present creeks and making such improvements as they are capable of. I have well considered every argument that has been advanced in favor of, and every objection that has been made against, the latter mode. After stating with as much perspicuity as I am able, the reasons that have influenced my determination, I shall leave it to the Board to adopt that plan, which to them appears the most eligible. The contest between river navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and canals is an old one. Many very plausible arguments have been adduced in favor of the former, and until <hi>time</hi> had proved their fallacy they had much weight, as may be conceived from the many fruitless attempts that have been made in England to render navigable the river Avon, from Stratford to Tewksbury, the Stour to the Severn, the Severn from Shrewsbury to Worcester; the Irwel, the Kennet, the Mersey and the Thames from Crechlade to the tide water; the last of which rivers has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the abilities of the first engineers for more than a century to no purpose; for after immense sums have been expended upon it, it is now so imperfect as to be unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable six months in the year. A collateral canal has been recommended as much cheaper, but the prejudices of corporations, millers and land-owners has hitherto prevented the adoption of this plan. The unerring test of experience has at length convinced the warmest advocates for river navigations how inefficacious they are. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have mentioned the above instances, as practical examples are more conclusive than theoretical arguments. It should also be remembered that the danger to be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029474_0068_0FE17D1FAB71FA90"/>
in this country is much greater than in England, as the floods are more violent and accompanied by ice in greater quantities. The usual method of making rivers navigable is to throw dams across the stream in the most convenient situations, and to build a lock in a collateral channel to enable the boats to pass from one <hi>pond</hi> to the other. To obtain the necessary depth of water, the bed of the river at the tail of each lock must be deepened; or the water raised so much by the next dam as to effect the same purpose. In the instance before us the former mode may be deemed impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the bed of the creek being chiefly solid work—The latter is liable to the following objections. To obtain the requisite depth, the water will be raised higher than the adjacent meadows; to prevent their being overflowed an embankment must be made which obstructs the natural drainage from the meadows. This may be remedied by cutting a back drain to the tail of the next lock, but, in many instances, it will be impracticable. These banks are liable to be destroyed every winter by the floods if raised only to the height necessary to <hi>pen</hi> up the water, as they will not be sufficient to confine the river in its bed at that time: and if it overflows it will inevitably destroy them. To prevent this it follows, that the banks should be raised sufficiently high, and of a proper strength, to resist every effort of this powerful element. I am not so well acquainted with the state of the Tulpehocken in the winter season as to assign the just dimensions of these embankments, which will vary with the increase of its stream by every new accession of water. But from the best information which I have been able to collect, I have reason to believe they will destroy as much land and be nearly as expensive as cutting a canal. And when every precaution has been taken that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ingenuity can suggest they are in continual danger of being destroyed—and that these instances are far from being rare, the works on the rivers I have beforementioned will evince, having been frequently swept away. The <hi>lifts</hi> of the locks on the canal will be on an average seven feet; but on the river it would not be prudent to make them more than four or five feet; this circumstance by increasing the number of locks will add considerably to the expense of execution, as the difference between a four feet and seven feet lock is not so much as may be imagined. For the ease and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of hauling, and also for its stability, a towing path should be as little elevated above the surface of the water as possible; but as in the most favorable seasons the water will be continually fluctuating, it would be necessary to raise it at least three times its usual height; and then it will be considerably damaged every flood—If the Tulpehocken was in a permanent state it would be much less difficult to render it navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; but its variations both from natural and artificial causes being so great, it will be almost impossible to assign a just proportion of <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>lockage,</hi> to acquire the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site advantages requisite in a summer and winter season. The above are the most material objections that occur to me at present. The only argument advanced in favor of river navigations is that they are less expensive in the execution. What the <hi>saving</hi> may amount to in the case before us is difficult to ascertain; but it will not be of any consequence when put in competition with the manifest advantages of a canal navigation—And the necessary annual repairs will, I am persuaded, amount to as much as the interest of the principal sum, saved in the execution. As far as my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will influence the Board, it is necessary to declare, that taking every object into consideration, I recommend, as most subservient to their immediate interest, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029474_0069_0FE17D2131CB8B18"/>
beneficial to the public at large, the adoption of a canal navigation, independent of the Tulpehocken, except in such instances as nature, or art, render it expedient to deviate therefrom. These particular cases will be pointed out in the course of the annexed description of the proposed line. Having done my duty, by declaring my opinion, it only remains for me to assure the Board; that whatever their decision may be, I shall execute their orders with as much alacrity as if my recommendation had been adopted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>plan</hi> herewith exhibited will give the Board a better information respecting the appearance of the country; the direction of the canal and the course of the Tulpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hocken, than could be conveyed by words. The track of the canal is shewn by a <hi>red</hi> line, and though I may hereafter find it expedient to vary therefrom, in some few instances, these variations will be so trifling as not to cause any sensible alteration in the plan.</p>
            <p>The water courses intended to convey the several springs into the summit level of the canal, are distinguished by different colours, which the <hi>table of reference</hi> on the plan will explain. In placing the locks, particular regard has been paid to their <hi>situation</hi> and <hi>lift,</hi> so as to combine the double advantage of suiting the ground, and affording the easiest communication with the divided lands by bridges over the tails, which saves <hi>two hundred</hi> pounds in every instance. In a first survey it cannot be expected that every local circumstance can be comprehended—I may hereafter see sufficient reasons to induce me to make some alteration in their situation and lift; whenever that is done, it will be from economical motives. The ground in Loy's plantation would have admitted the lifts of the locks to have been <hi>ten</hi> feet, but as it would have caused a considerable additional expenditure of water, I have deemed it most eligible to fix them at <hi>six feet;</hi> and this has been continued until additional supplies of water have justified increasing the falls of the subsequent locks.</p>
            <p>The regular and uniform descent of the ground in the vicinity of the Tulpehocken prevents us having locks of more than eight feet fall; as the extra digging at the tail of each lock would be more expensive than the saving of an increased lift. On account of the proximity of the hills on each side of the Tulpehocken, the canal is obliged to keep very near the channel, and consequently in the meadows; this circumstance makes it very unpopular with the farmers; but it cannot be avoided, as any other course would enhance the expense of execution infinitely more, than any consideration which will be made for the land. In the following estimate I have been as particular and accurate as the uncertainty of works of this kind will admit. I trust it will be found that sufficient allowance has been made for the execution. In some instances I may have overrated, and in others undervalued the contingent expense; but I believe the average will be found very near what I have allowed it. Not to depend altogether upon appearances to form a judgment of the quality of the ground through which the canal passes, I caused it to be bored in every field—I found the strata generally the same, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> black earth, clay of different kinds, gravel and rock, on which the borings mostly terminated, but at irregular depths from the surface, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> from one to six feet. The rock in general lies sufficiently deep from the surface to permit the canal to be cut without interfering with it. When it lies near the surface, I shall cause it to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029474_0070_0FE17D2B9B2A6438"/>
be accurately examined before the canal is set out, and shall regulate the locks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.—It has been a common complaint, (and experience in general has evinced the justice of it) that the estimates of most public works have fallen considerably short of the sums afterwards actually expended in their execution. Whatever may have been the motives for these deceptions, they have not influenced me. The following estimate, (though not greater than the majority of the English canals of the same length have cost) would not have been so high but for the unusual quantity of lockage, and the peculiar disadvantages it labors under in being far removed from most of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary materials, particularly stone and sand. However the execution will be as eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical as possible, as I shall let all the work by contract that can be done with propriety.</p>
            <p>The important article of lockage, I am well persuaded, will be found accurate.—Bridges, the next object, I am not so confident of, with respect to number. I have allowed them in all places where I suppose them necessary, but perhaps a jury may think otherwise. It would be adviseable, in many cases, for the company to purchase the land cut off by the canal, as it is very rarely worth the expense of erecting a bridge, and very frequently not a fourth part. These parcels of land if purchased and re-sold to the owners of the adjacent plantations would save some thousand pounds. In the estimate, I have not included the value of the land necessarily destroyed by the canal; this rests entirely with the juries who have hitherto differed so much in their valuations that no certain idea can be formed of it—In the article of fencing there would be a considerable saving by introducing the modern mode of towing path gates, at the division of every inclosure.</p>
            <p>The following description of the nature of the ground through which the canal passes, aided by a reference to the plan, will convey as just an idea of it as can be obtained by any other mode than ocular observation—Beginning at the line of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Loy the summit level is continued twenty-two perches to the head of the first lock, between which, and Michael Loy's road, there will be six other locks, of six feet fall each; at the tail of the seventh lock we shall acquire a considerable acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of water by taking in two copious streams which rise in the spring houses of Loy, and Spangler; from this place, therefore, the canal may be considered as abundantly supplied with water at all seasons. Leaving Leonard Immels and Michael Ramlers on the south, the canal passes through the meadows to the west end of Bassler's mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, across which an embankment must be made for a towing path three hundred and twenty yards in length, with a waste wear under it to discharge the superfluous water into the mill-pond.</p>
            <p>The tenth lock is intended to be placed at the road from Myers-town to Lebanon, with a bridge over the tail. Leaving Myers-town about a quarter of a mile to the northward, the canal passes through the lands of Simon Bassler, and John Myers, to Valentine Millers, in very favorable ground; from thence to the line of John Kuster is one continued rock in length forty perches: this part will be very expensive; I have considered it in the estimate as cut through the solid rock, but if on trial it should prove difficult to quarry, I shall bank over it as the cheapest mode. Through the plantations of Kuster, Haag, Kreitzer and Wolborn the ground in general is good.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029474_0071_0FE17D2D804E9D00"/>
Through Sharf's plantation it will be rocky, but, by adapting the fall of the proced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lock to suit the level of the ground, it may in a great measure be avoided. Near the great spring the Tulpehocken makes a considerable elbow, as will be seen by the plan; the canal is laid down as crossing the isthmus. Of the propriety of this route I am not fully satisfied; the distance does not exceed twenty-two perches, but it is composed wholly of rocks in distinct but large masses. To cut the canal through these, and also a new channel for the Tulpehocken, will certainly be very expensive. The next mode of execution is to carry the canal over the Tulpehocken by means of two small aqueducts, and to bank across the isthmus; another mode is to make use of the bed of the river, which may be rendered navigable by erecting a dam at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond intersection, sufficient to raise the water to the requisite height. The first plan is the most perfect, and the last most economical. I am not now prepared to speak decisively on this point; but before it is set out, I shall carefully examine the ground, and adopt that mode which shall appear most eligible. From the great spring, no material obstacle occurs till we arrive at Lower's mill-dam. Here there are two routs, the first through the hill to the northward of the mill, the other by an embankment through the dam; this last is the most preferable, as being much the cheapest. In the estimate I have divided the canal into five districts, the first of which terminates at this place. The length is six miles, four furlongs, and six chains, and the fall one hundred and nine feet seven inches. From Lower's to Lechner's mill, the ground is various in quality, but in general it is not unfavorable. In many places it will be necessary to cut a new channel for the river, as it frequently runs so near the hills as not to leave a sufficient width for a canal and towing path; it will be unnecessary to specify these instances particularly, as they will be shewn more plainly on the plan, where they are denoted by a blue line. At Lechner's, the canal will pass through the hill between the mill and a small out building; at this place I propose to contract the width of the canal to eleven feet, admitting the passage of one boat only at a time; the length of this hill is twenty perches. From Lechner's the canal passes through the plantations of Lantz, Read, Kortz, Brown, Sheafer and Meyer, in favorable ground. The course of the canal through Debe's meadow might have been more direct; but as the circuitous tract, laid down on the plan, saves a bridge, it will be the cheapest. At Edge's it will be advisable to make use of the present dams indeed there is no alternative, as the hill on the west side, approaching nearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the water edge, precludes every idea of making a canal in this place. All that is necessary here will be to make a towing path elevated about three feet above the surface of the water, that being the height to which the floods generally rise in the winter season. This is the end of the second district, which is five miles, seven furlongs and two chains in length; and the fall is fifty-four feet, eleven inches, divided into eight locks. Leaving the mill-dam by the new race cut to the slitting mill, the canal passes through the plantations of George Ege, Deppe, Lutz and Clinger to Forrar's mill. From this place to the North hill creek, the ground is very irregular in quality. In the wood belonging to Jasper Stump, the canal crosses the North hill; at the time I viewed it, the stream was very trifling, but from the appearance of its banks and the width of the channel, it must be very considerable in the winter season. Until I am better acquainted with it I cannot determine upon the most eligible mode
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029474_0072_0FE17D2F1F9FD728"/>
of crossing it, whether by an aqueduct or a tumbling dam. The latter will be the cheapest, but the most inconvenient for the boats. The third district terminates here; the length is six miles and seven furlongs; and the fall forty-eight feet, eight inches, which I have divided into six locks. From hence the canal passes through the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Shomo, Stouch, Geis, and Dunder, to Stouch's mill. From this place to Hiester's mill the ground is various in quality and irregular in surface; a considerable portion is rock, the particulars of which will be specified in the estimate. From Hiester's mill to Raebar's, the canal proceeds in very favorable ground: at this place the river must be turned from its natural course, which will be occupied by the canal. From Raeber's the line of the canal runs through the plantations of Bon, Ruhl, John Raeber, to Read's mill, near which the fortieth lock is placed. From Read's mill to the Schuylkill, the ground on each side of the Tulpehocken, with very few exceptions, is so extremely irregular and rocky, that on account of the enormous expense that would be incident to a canal navigation, it will be the most eligible mode to make the Tulpehocken navigable by means of dams and side locks—The ground on each side of the creek is well adapted to this purpose; in most places it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no banking, nature having already performed that office; and in those places where the water will be raised above the surface of the adjacent land, it is of so little value as to render the purchase of it an object of little importance—The length of this district, extending from Hiester's mill to the Schuylkill, is eight miles, seven fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs and four chains, and the fall sixty seven feet, eleven inches.—The total length of the canal, from the east end of the summit level to the Schuylkill, is thirty-four miles, one furlong and six chains; the fall three hundred and ten feet, divided into forty-five locks.</p>

            <p>One hundred and sixteen thousand pounds, a part of the sum deficient, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the work from Lebanon to Schuylkill; when that part is finished the company will draw a considerable annual toll. The citizens of the state will be convinced that although this great work will be attended with considerable difficulty, it can be surmounted so as to perfect a navigation from the eastern to the western waters. For finishing the work from Lebanon to Susquehanna a further sum of £. 192,000 is to be provided, making agreeably to the above estimate, £. 308,000</p>
            <p>But as the work from Lebanon to Susquehanna has not yet been laid out by the engineer, £. 192,000 is mentioned as the greatest sum, supposing no part of the bed of the Quittapahilla and Swatara to be made use of. But if, instead of a canal navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation along the whole margin of the rivers, the beds of the said rivers, wherever they can be made safe and permanent, should be adopted, the expense may possibly be found less. This point will be ascertained during the ensuing Summer.</p>

            <head>Report of WILLIAM WESTON, <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> for the Year 1794. To the PRESIDENT and MANAGERS of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Companies.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING received from the Secretary of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna, canal, the request of the Managers for my immediate attendance on the committee, who are appointed to state the present situation of their works, and a general state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their affairs;—I have endeavored to supply them with every information which the shortness of the notice would allow. It was my original intention to have postponed my report until the close of the present year; but the commands of the Board not permitting me to carry it to that time, I have endeavored to anticipate, as accurately as possible, the probable state of the works at that period. It must be understood, that the annexed details and statements relate only to that part of the canal eastward of the summit level, the operations of which commenced early in June; the previous expense of day-wage, and some subsequent pieces of contract work on the summit, will be included in Mr. Roberdeau's accounts herewith exhibited.</p>
            <p>I flatter myself the progress made in the works, in the short space of seven months, will prove satisfactory to the Board. On a careful comparison of the actual state of the various works, and an ample allowance for the completion of such parts as remain unfinished, with the previous estimate laid before the Board in my last report, it appears, that from the east end of the summit level to Michael Kreitzer's plantation, a distance of more than four miles and a quarter, the actual expenditure will fall short of the estimated one at least <hi>three thousand pounds.</hi> Though I would not wish to appear too sanguine, yet I may be allowed to draw favorable inferences of the remainder of the line; which, if realized, cannot be more gratifying to the Board than pleasing to myself.—Independant of this, I have well-founded reasons for assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the works will rather proportionably diminish than increase in expense, as the important object of land-carriage will, after the ensuing year, in a great measure be done away, by the canal being made subservient to that purpose. The sand for the locks, bridges, &amp;c. will be (from the approaching proximity of the canal) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the respective works for little more than half the present cost; the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark will hold good respecting the lime. Though the average value of the bricks (reduced to statute size) will not exceed twenty-four shillings per thousand, yet I must own I have been disappointed in the <hi>quantity</hi> made the last season; the unfavora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of the weather, during the greatest part of the summer, has prevented the produce coming up to my calculations; at the same time that the number has been diminished, the cost of those actually made has of consequence been increased. From the difficulty of procuring waggons to haul bricks, lime, sand, &amp;c. I was under the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029474_0075_0FE17D3B8D33FD58"/>
necessity of not employing half the number of bricklayers I had at first contemplated; though, at the same time, more work has been done in <hi>four months</hi> than is generally executed on most canals in one <hi>season. Five</hi> locks of six feet fall, and two road bridges, are compleated, and such progress made in the sixth lock, and two more bridges, that a fortnight's work, in the ensuing spring, will suffice to finish them. The whole of the works on the canal (excepting such parts as it would have been imprudent to set) have been executed by contract, and on such terms as I doubt not will be satisfactory to the Board. As the subsequent statements contain the whole of the expenses incurred on the respective articles to the present period, it is proper to observe that a considerable portion thereof belongs to the next year's account;—upwards of a <hi>million and a half of bricks; hollow quoins</hi> for <hi>ten locks; coping</hi> for <hi>nine</hi> bridges; and a considerable quantity of lime, sand, &amp;c are now on hand, ready for immediate use. The different works are classed separately; the amount of these will not contain the whole expenses of the present year; there being many accounts which could not with propriety be fixed to any article, others that belong not solely to the present year, and others which I have had no opportunity of seeing; but the accounts of Mr. Roberdeau and Mr. Beatty will give the Board every information they may desire on this head.</p>

            <p>Exclusive of the above annual income, the stockholders will derive great emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the seats for water works, of which there will be many from the surplus water at the different locks within the grounds purchased for the canal, and without damage to the mills erected on the lands of the adjoining owners. It will also be a peculiar advantage, that from the situation of these water works, all produce and manufactures, or raw materials, may be loaded or unloaded directly, without the intervention of land carriage, to and from the boats. The waters of the Tulpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hocken and Quittapahilla are abundantly copious to supply every demand for any purpose of this kind whatever. The above calculation, at a dividend of 12 per cent. per annum, is equal to a capital of £. 523,850; but, calculating the most moderate increase of population, the toll will increase, even on this capital, one per cent. per annum; until it amounts to the limitation, in the act of incorporation, and then the toll will be subject to a reduction according to law.</p>

            <head>Delaware and Schuylkill Canal.</head>
            <p>This Canal is intended to answer the double purpose of forming a capital link in the great chain of western navigation, from the Ohio and lake Erie to Philadelphia, as well as for an abundant supply of wholesome water to all parts of the city. The canal will connect the navigation of the Schuylkill with the Delaware, and is carried on a level of 49 feet above the high water mark of the Delaware, for about 16 miles to Broad-street; and from thence is conducted into the Delaware above Callow Hill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street, through six locks, the distance being about one mile. The report of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty engineer states, that <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>By a rough calculation, which is by no means exaggerated, I find we have blasted with powder and quarried, five millions four hundred and forty five thousand cubic feet of rock, and have mounded up, between the towing path of the canal and the river, a bank with the stone and rubbish, from 20 to 25 feet high from its base in the river. We have made at our brickyard, last summer, about three hundred thousand bricks.</p>
                  <p>At the lower end of the canal, in the vicinity of the city, through the distance of two miles and three quarters, there have been two hundred and fifty thousand cubic yards of earth and gravel and partly rocks, removed out of the bed of the canal, and ten culverts built and compleated.</p>
               </note> one third of the work is finished, and that contracts are formed and forming for a vigorous prosecution during the present year; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee with confidence can assert, that a proper attention of the stockholders to the punctual payment of the monies when called for by the President and Managers, will enable the Board to draw a toll for part of the distance in the year 1796, and to compleat the whole in three or four years.</p>

The stock of the company, as already subscribed, amounts to £. 150000, which, from the costs of that part of the canal already cut, will be sufficient for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work necessary for the transportation of produce; the toll of which will amount, agreably to the foregoing estimate, to £. 62000 per annum, making a dividend of upwards of forty-one per cent. but, agreeably to the charter granted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the toll is to be so reduced every ten years, as not to afford more than a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend of 25 per cent. per annum.</p>
            <p>In addition to the £. 150000 subscribed, a further sum of about £. 50000 will be wanting to complete the watering of the city, on which the stockholders, by law, are allowed a further dividend of 10 per cent. per annum. This great object is of such immense consequence to the health of the city, and to the extinguishing of fires, that the citizens of Philadelphia will cheerfully pay, for the use of the water, a sum more than adequate to the payment of the 10 per cent. allowed by law.</p>
            <p>In addition to the advantages already stated, great revenues may be drawn from the application of the surplus water passing through the canal, which, from Broad-street to the Delaware, affords a fall of near 50 feet. Dry docks are, also, contemplated by the law, and will, when the resources of the company become ample, be carried into effect.</p>
            <p>Respecting the dimensions of this canal, it has been <hi>determined:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st. That the width of the bottom be twenty feet.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. That the depth of water be three feet and an half.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. That the width of the canal be thirty feet and an half.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. That the width of the towing path be ten feet.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. That the towing path be not less than one foot above the surface of the water in any place.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. That the locks be constructed to admit boats of sixty feet in length and nine feet in width.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. That the descent of the canal be at the rate of two inches per mile.</p>
            <p>(N. B. The new river canal, for conducting water to the city of London, has three inches descent per mile, but this has been sound more than necessary, and increases the expense of maintaining the bank.)</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>IN a <hi>historical</hi> view, according to the order of <hi>time,</hi> the following papers should have been inserted immediately after page 47 of the preceding sheets. As soon as the <hi>subscriptions</hi> were compleated, and the several canal companies organized by an election of a President, Managers and other officers; committees were appointed to lay off and level the proposed tracts of the <hi>canals,</hi> and to report to the Boards of Managers.</p>
            <p>The summit level, or middle ground, between the head waters of Quittapahilla near Lebanon, and those of Tulpehockon near Myer's town, (a distance of about four miles and a half) had been examined and levelled, about twenty-five years ago, by a committee appointed by the <hi>American Philosophical Society, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> William Smith,</hi> D. D. then Provost of the college of Philadelphia, <hi>John Lukens,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> Surveyor General of the province (now state) of Pennsylvania, and <hi>John Sellers,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire.</abbr> The same ground was afterwards examined and levelled, under legislative sanction, by sundry skilful persons, and among others by the celebrated philosopher and mechanic <hi>David Rittenhouse,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> L. L. D. his brother <hi>Benjamin Rittenhouse, Timothy Matlack, John Adlum,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquires,</abbr> and others, all agreeing in the results of their work, respecting the proper tract of the canal, for a junction of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna;—extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their prospects still further to the great plan now in operation, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the junction of the tide-waters of Delaware with the Ohio and western lakes. But the dark and distressing period of the revolution necessarily suspended all improvements of this nature, in every part of America, until the glorious aera of the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>independence</hi> of the United States, when they were first resumed in the states of Virginia and Maryland, upon the Potomack, under the auspices of the illustrious WASHINGTON, during his short recess from his public labors; next in the state of PENNSYLVANIA, as set forth in the last page of the <hi>Introduction</hi> to these papers; and speedily afterwards, with a noble emulation of public spirit, in most of the other states, according to their natural advantages, as <hi>New York, Connecticut, Massachuset.</hi> the <hi>Carolinas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The company of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna navigation being (as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) the first organized in Pennsylvania, a committee, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Timothy Matlack,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> were appointed to repair to the summit ground near Lebanon, and finally to re-examine the levels, to ascertain the exact route of the canal, the sources and quantity of the waters which could be brought to supply the reservoir on the summit, and the locks at each end; with an account of the lands and waters necessary to be purchased as the great basis of the work. The same committee were also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to level and lay out the <hi>Conewago canal,</hi> and finished their work in July, 1792. A committee was also appointed to lay out and level the <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Schuylkill</hi> canal, from Norris town to Philadelphia, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Dr. <hi>Rittenhouse,</hi> Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Samuel Powel,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire.</abbr> There is a responsibility attached to the companies and their Managers, as well concerning their own diligence as that of their committees, which is the only apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029474_0084_0FE17D556D98E5B8"/>
for the mention of these appointments. But the President and Managers did not think it proper to depend wholly on their own judgment, or the judgment of their committees, in works of such magnitude and immense public consequence. They, therefore, determined to engage one of the ablest engineers that could be procured from England, to superintend and direct their works; and in the mean <hi>while,</hi> that there might be no unnecessary delay, they commenced their undertakings at such places, on the three <hi>canals,</hi> as appeared to them to leave no room for the choice of better ground, or for any error which could materially affect the work;—the <hi>Schuylkill</hi> and <hi>Susquehanna</hi> canal under the superintendance of <hi>John Bull,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> the <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Schuylkill</hi> canal under Mr. <hi>Jonathan Robeson,</hi> and the <hi>Conewago</hi> canal under Mr. <hi>James Brindley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Early in the month of January, 1793, arrived from <hi>London</hi> WILLIAM WESTON, <abbr>Esquire,</abbr> the <hi>engineer</hi> engaged by the companies; a gentleman who had directed the execution of some of the principal canals in England, whose great abilities, activity and experience in all the branches of his department, have merited and obtained the perfect confidence and esteem of the Managers; and whose advice and assistance, which have been solicited and given as occasion might permit, will be of the utmost importance towards the facilitating improvements of a similar nature in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing states.</p>
            <p>After some necessary arrangements with the President and Managers of the several <hi>canals,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> accompanied by one of the committee who had assisted in laying them out, left Philadelphia February first, and proceeded to that part of the canal begun at Norris town, arriving at Lebanon February fourth. He found more than six hundred men at work, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> upwards of two hundred at Norris town, and about four hundred at the summit or middle ground, between Lebanon and Myers town. The following <hi>abstract</hi> of his <hi>report</hi> made to the companies on his return, gave them great satisfaction, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>"From such a view as the time and the season of the year would permit me to take of the canal through the middle ground near Lebanon, I have little doubt but the most favorable line has been adopted.</p>
            <p>"The first and most important object is a due and adequate supply of water. I judged it expedient to examine the various springs which are to supply the summit of the canal, but not with intention to ascertain the quantity they afford (this being an improper season for that purpose) but to view their situation with respect to the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit level. It is very apparent they may be conducted into the canal with great ease. The springs were lower than when gauged last summer. It will be needless to say any thing further on this subject, as Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> will deliver to the committee a calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the number of lock-fulls of water they yield in twenty-four hours; which seems to have been made with great care and attention. This I apprehend will be adequate to the trade that may reasonably be supposed to pass over the summit, making proper allowance for exhalation and leekage. Suppose the crown level 3 1/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; miles in length, the extra depth 4 feet, the mean width 32 feet, it will contain 2,365,440 cubic feet of water, which, at 3420 cubic feet to a lock, will give 691 locks full.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:029474_0085_0FE17D56F2F188D0"/>
"The Delaware and Schuylkill canal appears to be judiciously laid out, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as near the banks of the river as the nature of the ground would admit.</p>
            <p>"The fault of this canal, supposing the dimensions perfectly right, as formed by persons intimately acquainted with the state of the waters and the boats navigable on them, I observe to be this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that the proposed depth of water being 3½ feet, and the width at bottom 20 feet, the surface with the proper slope should have been 30½ feet, whereas I found it but 27, the angle of the slope being 45 degrees; whereas the present practice is an angle of 33½ degrees, and the bottom and top as 2 to 3.</p>
            <p>"The result of a conference with Dr. <hi>Rittenhouse,</hi> respecting the fall it may be necessary to give the canal, in order to supply the city with water, will be explained to the Board by Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> together with other matters necessary to be known, but which do not come immediately in my department.</p>

At the season of the year in which these springs and waters were <hi>gauged,</hi> the weather was extremely warm, the evaporation great, and many of them <hi>gauged</hi> after having passed over large meadows. I have therefore no hesitation in declaring, that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity given may be safely taken as rather under than above the <hi>mean</hi> quantity, at the driest and warmest times of the year; and I trust this will be verified by Mr. <hi>Weston'</hi>s future examinations; and if any deficiency should, upon an increased state of the trade, be found in the quantity of those waters, it may be supplied, as I hinted in a former report, by the introduction of Furnace creek, and even the Swatara and some of its branches; and the increased trade will enable the company to make use of all these auxiliary supplies when necessary. But, without these, Mr. <hi>Weston'</hi>s abilities, even with the present waters, will introduce constructions in the locks, at a small expense, whereby one <hi>third</hi> of the quantity of water in each lock may be saved, exclusive of the <hi>Reservoir</hi> on the summit level, which may be constructed, according to his report, to contain 691 locks full of water, to be accumulated by occasional rains at all seasons of the year, and by the natural supply of the springs on such days as the number of boats, passing the locks, may be short of the number calculated upon, which will probably be the case for a long time to come.</p>

            <p>MORE than two years have elapsed since the <hi>engineer</hi> delivered his first report, approving the general plan of the works, as projected by the companies, and in considerable progress before his arrival. His experience and labors during that period, have fully justified the accuracy of the calculations, and the easy practicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all the projections. Upwards of fifteen miles, including the work on both canals, commenced before his arrival, are in general nearly compleated or finished, with the necessary locks, and through the most difficult grounds; a distance of more than four miles and a quarter of which, were finished in about seven months of the last summer and autumn; the actual expenditure on which fell short of the estimated one at least <hi>three</hi> thousand pounds,—yielding a favorable presumption, that, in the progress of the works, the expense will rather be proportionably diminished than increased. [See his reports for 1793 and 1794, particularly the latter, page 58 of the preceding papers.]</p>

            <p>There are but two ways of supplying this deficiency, as was stated in a memorial to the Legislature, (see page 49) <abbr>

               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st. Either by enlarging the present capital by the increase of shares and new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, on the terms of the act of incorporation; or,</p>
            <p n="2">2d. By the company's negociating and obtaining an <hi>effectual loan;</hi> or, perhaps, partly in both these methods.</p>
            <p>But by reason of the large sums of money already invested in the various stocks of this state and of the United States, such as banks, insurance companies, <hi>roads,</hi> canal and other companies, and the growing demands of capital for our increased domestic and foreign trade among our monied citizens; there appears but little prospect either of obtaining a <hi>loan</hi> or an increase of shares to any considerable amount among indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual capitalists in this country, nor a prompt payment of a considerable number of the shares already subscribed according to law.</p>
            <p>And although it might be possible, and perhaps probable, in the present fluctuating state of property among <hi>capitalists</hi> in Europe, to obtain a <hi>foreign loan,</hi> upon the ample prospects, which the magnitude of this undertaking holds forth, of a speedy and secure return, either of the capital, or liberal profits on the footing of stockholders; yet the length of time, and expense attending the <hi>negociation,</hi> would give a damp to the work, and occasion such a stop or suspension of it, as would be dishonorable to the state and fatal in the issue; considered not only as a check to our western popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a grievous prolongation of the time in which the present stockholders might expect some returns for their money advanced, not to mention the bad policy of vesting such a large proportion as two thirds of the stock and profits of so great an undertaking, in the hands of foreigners; although one <hi>third</hi> might be prudently vested in this way, while the state might hold the other third.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:029474_0089_0FE17D63AA488238"/>
This distribution of the capital into three parts, the <hi>commonwealth</hi> and original stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders being invested with <hi>two,</hi> would undoubtedly secure the raising of the other third part, upon an advantageous loan, or new subscriptions for shares, either at <hi>home</hi> or <hi>abroad,</hi> and thereby likewise ensure the speedy and compleat success of the work.</p>
            <p>The finances of the state are in a flourishing condition; and it is submitted to the wisdom and feelings of an enlightened Legislature, to what nobler purposes they can be applied (in part at least) than to the improvement of our country, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of arts and manufactures, even if no monied return were to be expected, on the capital to be expended; for, can an interest of 8 or 10 per cent. on the monied capital of a great commonwealth be considered as an equivalent for suffering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of a happy and fertile country to languish and decay?

            <p>WHEREAS the companies incorporated for opening a canal and lock navigation, between the rivers Schuylkill and Susquehanna, and between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, have, from the novelty of such extensive and arduous undertakings, in a young country, experienced numerous difficulties beyond what were ever contemplated by the Legislature, at the time of passing the acts of incorporation, or by the subscribers to the said works, at the time of subscribing thereto: <hi>And whereas</hi> large sums of money have already been expended on the said works, and there is every reasonable expectation that a canal naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, connecting the eastern and western waters of Pennsylvania, may be effectually compleated if efficient funds can be provided for the same, to the great advantage and increase of the agriculture, trade and manufactures of the state at large:</p>
            <p>Section I. <hi>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same,</hi> That it shall and may be lawful to and for the Presidents and Managers, for the time being, of the said companies to raise, by way of lottery, a sum not exceeding two hundred and sixty-six thousand, six hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty seven cents, to be applied to carrying on the works of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna navigation, and one hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents, to be applied to carrying on the works of the Delaware and Schuylkill canal navigation. <hi>Provided always nevertheless.</hi> That nothing herein contained shall be construed or held to authorize the said Presidents, Managers and Companies, or either of them, to form the said sum or sums into capital stock, or to consider them, or either of them, as any part of their capital stocks upon which a dividend of profits can be made.</p>
            <p>Section II. <hi>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,</hi> That the Presidents and Managers, previous to selling any tickets in the said lottery, shall lay the scheme thereof before the Governor of this commonwealth, to be approved of by him, and shall also enter into bonds to the Governor, for the due and faithful payment of all prizes that may be drawn in the said lottery, when the same shall be demanded, after the drawing of the said lottery shall be compleated.</p>

Section III. <hi>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,</hi> That as soon as the said tickets shall be sold, the said Presidents and Managers shall certify the same to the Governor of the commonwealth, and, upon such certificate being presented, it shall and may be lawful for the Governor to appoint five Commissioners to superintend the drawing of the said lottery, which said Commissioners shall take an oath or affirmation, diligently and faithfully to perform the duties entrusted to them.</p>
            <p>Section IV. <hi>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,</hi> That the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, or any three of them, shall attend at the drawing of each day, and, when the whole is compleated, shall cause an accurate list of the fortunate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to be published, in at least three news-papers in the city of Philadelphia, and the said Commissioners shall receive, of the Presidents and Managers of the said Companies, two dollars each for each day's attendance on the duties enjoined on them.</p>
            <p>Section V. <hi>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,</hi> That all prizes not demanded within twelve months after publication as aforesaid, shall be applied as aforesaid to carrying on and compleating the works of the said companies.</p>
