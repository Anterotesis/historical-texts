            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BEING kindly invited by a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after Dinner I went to <hi>Rye,</hi> about eleven Miles from <hi>Stanford.</hi> I read Prayers and preached to a ſmall Congregation.

Hither ſeveral of <hi>New-York</hi> Friends came to meet me. I talk'd with them on the Way of the Things of God, and found an inexpreſſible Satisfaction in my Soul when I arrived at the Houſe of my very dear Friend Mr. <hi>Noble.</hi> After Supper, the Lord filled my Heart, and gave me to wreſtle with him for <hi>New-York</hi> Inhabitants, and my own dear Friends. To add to my Comfort, the Lord bro't my Dear Brother <hi>Davenport</hi> from <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> by whoſe Hands the bleſſed Jeſus has of late done <hi>great</hi> Things. In a Letter to his Mother he writes thus: <q>The Lord has, in infinite Mercy, given me, in my Pariſh, near twenty, in a little more than two Months Time.

I long ſince expected cloſe Oppoſition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increaſing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> where I would, many ſeem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to ſpeak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Yeſterday, I found my Heart ſomewhat dejected, and told Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> I expected but little Movings in <hi>New-York;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> bid me "expect great Things from God," and likewiſe told me of ſeveral who were, as he hoped, ſavingly wrought upon by my Miniſtry, when there laſt. <hi>O Lord, let theſe Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 1. Finiſhed my Anſwer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekneſs. <hi>O Lord, give it thy Bleſſing!</hi> Preached twice as Yeſterday to very crowded Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exerciſe, ſome fainted, and the Lord ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew us more and more, that a Time for favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>New-York</hi> was near at Hand. <hi>O wherefore did I doubt! Lord increaſe my Faith.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 2. Preached this Morning with Freedom and ſome Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <hi>Noble</hi>'s Houſe, I could only lie before the Lord and ſay, <q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Chriſt would be gracious to ſuch a Wretch</q> As I went to Meeting, I grew weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004851_0005_100E020115D07130"/>could have choſe to be ſilent rather than ſpeak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty Ruſhing Wind, and carried all before it. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was carried out till I could ſcarce ſpeak any more. A Senſe of God's Goodneſs overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman ſaid, <q>Come and s;ee what God has done for me To-night.</q> I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, "Oh my Jeſus, my Jeſus!" Another, a little Boy, was ſo concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could ſcarce ſtand. One of my Friends aſked him why he cried, <q>Who can help it? ſaid he. Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Words cut me to the Heart.</q> After I came home, I threw myſelf upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freeneſs, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Condeſcenſion of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <hi>B—r,</hi> whom I met at <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> who being eſpouſed to the young Woman, was ſo ſtruck at the ſame Place, by my Advice, who married her this Night, and both are going as my Aſſiſtants to <hi>Georgia.</hi> Never did I ſee a more ſolemn Wedding. Jeſus Chriſt was called, and he was preſent in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> had married them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wreſtle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Ghoſt was remarkably preſent, that moſt, I believe, could ſay, <hi>Surely God is in this Place!</hi> After this, Divine
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004851_0006_100E020387EB9A68"/>Manifeſtations flowed in ſo faſt, that my frail Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was ſcarce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> on the Bed-ſides. I prayed for each of them alternately with ſtrong Cries, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, aſtonished at my own Vileneſs, and the Excellency of Chriſt, then roſe full of Peace, &amp; Love &amp; Joy. O how am I obliged to my Enemies? God has remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably revealed himſelf to my Soul, ever ſince I have ſeen the Pamphlet published by the Presbyterians againſt me. O how faithful is he that hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Heel, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Head; Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my ſojourning here on Earth.</hi>

                  <hi>Monday, Nov.</hi> 3. Preached both Morning and Afternoon, and perceived the Congregations ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. There was a great and gracious Melting amongſt the People both Times, but no crying out. Near 110 <hi>l.</hi> Currency were collected for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans; and in the Evening many came and took an affectionate Leave. About ſeven we took Boat; reached <hi>Staten Iſland</hi> about ten, greatly refreſhed in my inner Man. A dear Chriſtian Friend received us gladly. We ſolaced ourſelves by ſinging and praying. And about Midnight retired to ſleep, ſtill longing for that Time when I ſhould ſleep no more. <hi>Lord keep me from a ſinful and 100 cager Deſire after Death. I deſire not to be impatient. I deſire quietly to wait till my bleſs;ed Change come. Amen and Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Tuesday, November</hi> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <hi>Staten Iſland,</hi> to about 3 or 400 People. The
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004851_0007_100E0205943DEE38"/>Lord came amongſt them. One dear young Man, in particular, as tho' his very Heart-ſtrings would break, came to me after Sermon, with ſtrong Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Tears, beſeeching me, <q>to pray that he might be converted</q>. Many others wept alſo, and ſeveral of God's Children felt the Preſence of the dear Lord Jeſus in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to ſee me again. One gray-headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkneſs to Light, when I was here laſt. My Soul was alſo much refreſhed with the Sight of dear Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi> and Mr. <hi>Croſs.</hi> The former has lately loſt his Wife, and though dear unto him, yet he was enabled with great Calmneſs to preach her funeral Sermon, whilſt the Corps were lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This put me in Mind of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> who, at the News of his Wife's Death, ſaid. "By <hi>Kate,</hi> I'll come after thee ere it be long." Since his Wife's Deceaſe, Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> has ben in the <hi>Weſt Jerſeys</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> and told me how God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably work'd by his Miniſtry in many Places. — Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> alſo has ſeen great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Things in his Congregations, ſo great that when I came to deſire a particular Account, he ſaid, <q>It directly anſwered the Account given by Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> of the Work of God in <hi>Northampton.</hi>

After ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I gave a Word of Exhortation. With what Power none can fully expreſs but thoſe that ſaw it. O how did the Word fall like a Hammer and like a Fire!

I then began to pray, and felt the Spirit of God working in me mightily. A great Commotion was ſoon observed among the Hearers. I then gave a Word of Exhortation. The Lord's Preſence attended it in a ſurprizing Manner. One in about ſix Minutes cried out. <hi>"He is come, he is come,"</hi> and could ſcarce ſuſtain the Diſcovery that Jeſus Chriſt made of himſelf to his Soul. Others were ſo earneſt for a Diſcovery of the Lord to their Souls, that their eager Crying obliged me to ſtop, and I prayed over them as I ſaw their Agonies and Diſtreſs increaſe. At length we ſung a Hymn, and then retired to the Houſe where the Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt continued till near Midnight, talking of and praiſing, <q>

And at length, my own Soul was ſo full that I retired, and was in a ſtrong Agony for ſome Time, and wept before the Lord, under a deep Senſe of my own Vileneſs, and the Sovereignty and Greatneſs of God's everlasting Love. Moſt of the People ſpent the Remainder of the Night in Prayer and Praiſes. Two or three young Miniſters ſpake alternately, and others prayed as the Lord gave them Utterance. Oh!

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004851_0015_100E0216CEE2E5D8"/>me Freedom, and many Friends being in the Room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted them all. But, Oh how did they melt under both; My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were ſome who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been moſt marvellous Offenders againſt the great God. I ſhall mention two only. The firſt is one Mr. <hi>Brockden,</hi> Recorder of Deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>a Man eminent in his Profeſſion, but for many Years a notorious Deiſt. In his younger Days, he told me, he had ſome religious Impreſſions, but coming into Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, the Cares of the World ſo choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in ſome Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to diſpute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to propagate his Deiſtical, I could almoſt ſay Atheiſtical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Proſelytes of vicious, debauched People. When I came to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this Time Twelve-month, he told me, he had not ſo much as a Curioſity to hear me. But a Brother Deiſt, his choiceſt Friend, preſſing him to come and hear me, to ſatisfy his Curioſity, he at length complyed with his Requeſt, It was Night. I preach'd at the Court Houſe Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>—I had not ſpoke much before God ſtruck his Heart. For, ſaid he, I ſaw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home, his Wife, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a Sermon, came in alſo, and wiſhed heartily that he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004851_0016_100E021A2401AE90"/>had heard me. He ſaid nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the ſame Wiſh; and, if I miſtake not, after that another, till at laſt being; unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes. Why, ſays he, I have been hearing him; and then expreſſed his Approbation. Ever ſince he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily believe Jeſus Chriſt has made himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to his Soul. Though upwards of three ſcore Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives ſuch Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</q> 
                  <q>The next is one CAPTAIN H—L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almoſt a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He uſed to Swear to eaſe his Stomach, and was ſo fond of new Oaths that he uſed to go on Board the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Honour of coining it. It would be endleſs to give Inſtances of his vile Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be ſaid, he is now, I believe, a Chriſtian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The effectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached laſt Spring at <hi>Pennypack,</hi> though under good Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before. Ever ſince he has been zealous for the Truth, ſtood like a Lamb when was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered ſome time ago, by many of my Oppoſers, and, in ſhort, ſhews forth his Faith by his Works.</q> I might ſpeak alſo of ſome Quakers, who are fairly brought into an experimental Acquaintance with Chriſt, who are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004851_0017_100E021C4D495248"/>choſen with my ſelf, the aforeſaid <hi>B—n</hi> and <hi>H—l,</hi> and ſome others joint Truſtees for the Houſe lately erected.—But I mention theſe in particular, becauſe I think they are remarkable Proofs of that too much exploded Doctrine, I mean, <hi>God's Eternal Election and everlaſting Love.</hi> 
                  <q>Whatever Men's carnal Reaſoning may ſuggeſt, yet if the Children of God fairly examine their own Experiences, if they do God Juſtice, they muſt acknowledge that they did not chooſe God, but God choſe them. And if he choſe them at all, it muſt be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing foreſeen in them. Unleſs they acknowledge this, Man's Salvation muſt be in Part owing to the Free-Will of Man, and if ſo, unleſs Men deſcend from other Parents than I did, Chriſt Jeſus might have died, and never have ſeen the Travel of his Soul in the Salvation of one of his Creatures. But I would be tender in this Point and leave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be taught it of <hi>God.</hi> I am of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Bradford's</hi> Mind.</q> 
                  <hi>Let a Man go to the Grammar School of Faith and Repentance, before he goes to the Univerſity of Election and Predeſtination.</hi> A bare Head-Knowledge of the Form of ſound Words availeth nothing. I am quite ſick of Chriſtleſs Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. <hi>From ſuch may I ever turn away!</hi> Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <hi>Monday, November</hi> 10. Preached Morning and Afternoon to very large Congregations, and obſerved a wonderful ſweet Power attend both, but eſpecially the Evening-Sermon. Many afterwards came and told me what God did for their Souls thereby.

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 15. Preached twice every Day this Week in the new Houſe, one Morning excepted, when I preached in Mr. C—'s Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe on Account of the Snow. A moſt ſweet and wonderful Power went at that Time through the Congregation. The Lord gave me the Text I preached on juſt before Meeting; directed me to a Method as I was going up the Pulpit-Stairs; and enabled me to diſcourſe with an uncommon Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Freedom, and Power. The Effects plainly ſhewed that it was of God. — The Word ſeemed to ſmite them like ſo many pointed Arrows. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afterwards told me what they felt, and in the Evening I was ſent for to a young Woman, who was carried Home from Meeting, and had continued almoſt ſpeechleſs. When I came, ſhe look'd like a Perſon dead and laid out. I prayed with her, and heard afterwards that ſhe came out into a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable State.— <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Indeed I cannot ſay we had one dry Meeting. The leaſt Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountable carried out to talk againſt Reaſoning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was ſo ill that ſome of my Friends adviſed me to go Home. I thought it beſt to truſt to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart, ſomewhat refreſhed, but all on a ſudden, my Soul was ſo carried out to talk againſt depending on our natural Reaſon, that my Friends were aſtoniſhed, and ſo was I too: For I felt the Holy Ghoſt come
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004851_0019_100E02200319DE78"/>upon me at that Time, and never ſpake on that wiſe before. <q>As I was going Home, I ſaid to a Friend, Surely ſome Reaſoners were in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> Upon Enquiry, I found a Cluſter of them were preſent, and then I knew wherefore I was ſo aſſiſted. <hi>Oh who would but truſt in God!</hi> One of theſe Reaſoners a little after, meeting Mr. <hi>B—n,</hi> ſaid, <q>What!

               </p>
               <p>Another Afternoon, there was ſuch an univerſal Commotion in the Congregation, as I never ſaw in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> before. One or two cried out in a moſt piteous Manner, and Numbers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I preached on thoſe Words, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <hi>P—r,</hi> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> to know, "Why I ſhould not preach in the Church?" He, after ſeveral Invectives caſt out againſt me, ſaid,<hi>He could not anſwer his Oath to the Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>if he did give me Leave,</hi> and cautioned her againſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear me; adding, <hi>That if ſhe followed or adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what I ſaid, ſhe was in a woful Condition."</hi> Nay, ſaid he, <hi>You are damned if you do.</hi> With all, he told her, <hi>He was diſtreſſed in his Soul for her, becauſe ſhe

Then, Sir, replied ſhe, <q>I muſt believe in Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Doctrine.</q>

Many that before were only convicted, now plainly proved, that they were converted and had a clear Evidence of it within themſelves. My chief Buſineſs was now to build up and to exhort them to continue in the Grace of God. Notwithſtanding many were convicted almoſt every Day, and came unto me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt Diſtreſs and Anguiſh of Soul. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Societies are now in the Town, not only of Men and Women, but of little Boys and little Girls. Being ſo engaged, I could not viſit them as I would, but I hope the Lord will raiſe me up ſome Fellow-Labourers, and that Elders will be ordained in every Place then we ſhall ſee a glorious Church, ſettled and eſtabliſhed in <hi>Philadelphia. Haſten that Time, O Lord, my Strength &amp; my Redeemer.</hi> I cannot leave off giving an Account of this Week's Work, without menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning another Inſtance or two of God's Grace. One Woman came to me, I think fairly converted to our dear Lord Jeſus. She told me, when I was at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> laſt, <q>She came deſiring that I would baptize her Child. I being otherwiſe enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, refuſed. Upon this the Devil aſſaulted her, being under ſtrong Convictions, in a moſt violent Manner, and endeavoured to perſuade her, that all I had told her were Lies. She was caſt into Darkneſs, but reaſoned thus, It is impoſſible that it ſhould be Lies, or that I ſhould be a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſince the Word came with ſuch Light, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and unſpeakable Power upon her Soul, when ſhe heard me. She went home, retired to Bed, and there the Devil would fain have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004851_0022_100E0225F5AEA918"/>her to cut her Child's Throat with a Pair of of Sciſſars. She being bro't into the utmoſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, cried and looked up to Chriſt. He delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her out of her Diſtreſs. Satan immediately left her, and God flowed in upon her Soul. She now knows that her Redeemer liveth. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul!</hi> Another young Woman, who I believe was made a wiſe Virgin laſt Spring, and received Jeſus Chriſt in her Heart, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, "That ſhe continued in great Joy for near three Days, and went as far as <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> to hear me, when I took my Leave laſt. As ſhe was returning, ſome Body told her, <hi>I believed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi> Alas! Then, ſaid ſhe, (though ſhe was converted) what will become of me?

                  <hi>Oh that all who are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt that Doctrine were thus taught of God!</hi> They would not ignorantly call the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection the Doctrine of Devils, or cry out vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the HORRIBLE DECREE. But, as an excellent Chriſtian obſerves, <hi>The Doctrine of Election is ſuch a glorious Myſtery, that it dazzles the weak Eyes even of ſome of God's dear Children.</hi> But I have reſerved the moſt ſweet Proof of God's Grace and Power to the laſt. About the Middle of the Week I was called to viſit one Mrs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then lying on a ſick Bed, but after prodigious Agonies, brought home to God when I was at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> laſt Spring. <q>Her Huſband was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004851_0023_100E022822EF8310"/>her ſpiritual Friends leave to come unto her. God now inclined his Heart to let me come and pray with her, according to her Deſire. When I went the firſt Time, he was not in the Room, but was offended that he was not called up to join with us. The next Day he himſelf met me in the Street, and gave me an Invitation. I compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and viſited his Wife ſeveral Times. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before did I ſee a Soul ſo exult in God, and talk ſo ſeelingly of the Love of Jeſus, though ſometimes in Extremity of Pain. Sometimes ſhe was ſo full of God that ſhe could not ſpeak, and at other Times, when ſhe could not ſpeak, and <hi>I bid her lift up her Hands if all was well,</hi> ſhe ſtretched them with great Earneſtneſs. As ſoon as ever ſhe could recover Breath, ſhe would talk of Jeſus, ſaying that his Love was above her Pain, that ſhe longed to be diſſolved, but was willing to tarry the Lord's Leiſure. When I told her, <hi>that I wanted to be gone too.</hi> No, ſays ſhe, do you ſtay longer, and bring home ſome more Souls to Chriſt; with many other gracious Words, which dropped from her Mouth. My Soul was much enlarged to hear a Creature talk with ſuch Aſſurance juſt upon the Brink of Eternity. Her Huſband and other Friends ſtood weeping by. God gave me great Aſſiſtance in Prayer. His Preſence filled the Room, and ſome I thought would have cried out.</q> 
                  <hi>Oh that this Sickneſs may be a Means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God of ſaving her Relations precious and immortal Souls!</hi> After my Departure, ſhe bid one of my Friends tell me, "That ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 16. Preached both Morning and Evening, and collected both Times about 105 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> for the Orphans. In the Morning my Soul was peculiarly enlarged, tho' I was ſomewhat dejected before I left my Lodgings. In the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I publickly baptized five adult Women, who had undergone a ſtrict Examination. Before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon I gave them an earneſt Exhortation.

There was Abundance of Weeping when I came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Diſcourſe. Great Numbers flock'd to my Lodgings, ſome under Diſtreſs, ſome to give Thanks for what God had done for their Souls, and others to preſent me with ſomething for the poor Orphans. One that was baptized brought three Children, I baptized them, prayed, and gave a Word of Exhortation with a melting Heart to many dear Souls. In the Evening I went with my dear Friend Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> to take a final Leave of Mrs. <hi>D</hi>—yet rejoicing in God. Viſited a poor diſtracted Woman, and afterwards went to the Boys Society, where I met with a tender hearted Lad or two; then I returned home, and at laſt went to Bed, quite

However there was an affecting Melting, and ſeveral (as I heard afterwards) who had been in Bondage before, at that Time received Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. With Abundance of Tears, after Dinner moſt of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> Friends that came over the Water took their laſt Farewell.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004851_0026_100E022E0144CC70"/>on a few Miles, but my Body was more and more out of Order, and I thought God was preparing me for future Bleſſings. <hi>It is good to be humbled.

Two or three more of his Aſſociates were at <hi>Whiteclay Creek:</hi> And God was pleaſed to appear for me in an extraordinary Manner. There were many Thouſands waiting to hear the Word.

But on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, God's Preſence ſo filled my Soul that I could ſcarce ſtand under it.

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004851_0044_100E0255CF22E890"/>Promiſe: <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Books of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Exodus,</hi> which I expounded in Courſe, Morning and Evening, were much bleſſed to my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comfort. And the Lord has been pleaſed to give me Freedom to write down ſome of my extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Diſcourſes, which I hope he will bleſs for his own Name's Sake. In ſhort, this Voyage has been a profitable Voyage to my Soul, becauſe of my having had many ſweet Opportunities for Reading, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayer. I cannot but adore the Providence of God in favouring me with ſuch bleſſed Retirements as I have frequently enjoyed on the great Waters. I dared not expect to meet with ſuch Succeſs as he has been pleaſed to give me abroad: And I doubt not but I ſhall yet ſee greater Things there as well as at home. I never had ſuch a Variety of Trials and Changes of Life lying before me as at this Time. But I throw myſelf into the Hands of the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſhall conclude this further Account of God's Dealing with me, with a Hymn compoſed by my dear and honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Weſley.</hi>
