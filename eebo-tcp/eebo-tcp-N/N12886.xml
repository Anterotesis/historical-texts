            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>'TIS</hi> the duty of every one to do what he can, in a rational friendly manner, to promote the public good and prevent public calamity. For a man to withhold what he thinks would be of public utility, is either not to be friendly or not to be faithful. Where there are vices or prejudices and prepoſſeſſion, 'tis not likely that every truth can be properly exhibited, and urged, without offending ſome.</p>
            <p>My aim in the following diſcourſe has been to ſpeak plainly, without fear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, without ill-will to any; with hearty benevolence to the public, not as pleaſing man, but God who tries the heart. If ſome things in the ſermon ſhould offend a number, I ſhall not be diſappointed, and if the publication ſhall be uſeful to any, may God have the glory.</p>

            <head>A SERMON, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE are called upon by our civil rulers to ſet apart this day for faſting and prayer. We are called upon by thoſe who have the management or lead in our public affairs—who beſt know, and have the moſt comprehenſive view of, things in theſe United States. We have reaſon to bleſs God that thoſe who go foremoſt in affairs of ſtate will call upon us to apply to God, yea will lead us to the throne of grace for divine aid. The proclamation points out various particulars that we ought to bear in mind this day. I might take the ſeveral things in the proclamation as ſubjects of diſcourſe; and I ſhall pay a due regard to what is there ſaid: but I ſhall mention ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, which I think we may properly have in view this day, and which if you pleaſe you may conſider as my text.</p>
            <p>Jer. xxx. 11. <hi>Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iſai. lviii. 6. <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. ii. 1, 3. <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another thou condemneſt thyſelf; for thou that judgeſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016296_0004_0F9C1E71DC79A470"/>
doſt the ſame thing.—And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them that do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deut. xxx. 9 <hi>The Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers, if thou ſhalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and ſtatutes, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great and glorious God, who made and governs the world, has an intuitive view of all things in Heaven, earth and hell. He has ſeen from the firſt how our American troubles came on, and how they have proceeded. He permits the Britiſh court to oppreſs us, and has excited our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; excites us to ſtand for our liberties civil and religious. We have a great and wiſe, an holy and juſt, yet merciful God to apply to. When we conſider our ſinfulneſs we ſee our need of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, and implore it. When we view our conteſt with Britain we appeal to the juſtice of God with courage and confidence. By Britain we are abuſed, oppreſſed, moſt cruelly treated: We have been forced into this war. Liberty and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rights of mankind we deſired. Theſe were denied. The moſt abject ſubmiſſion to unreaſonable terms has been urged upon us. We cannot ſo meanly, ſo baſely ſubmit. We are contending for liberty. Our cauſe is juſt—is glorious; more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than to contend for a kingdom. A cauſe on which we may hope for a divine bleſſing. Though our contention with Great-Britain is ſo glorious, yet have we reaſon to be humbled and abaſed before
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016296_0005_0F9C1E72A231F7A0"/>
God. We have reaſon to be humble and mourn for the many ſins, the many vices that prevail among us. God has a controverſy with us: How very different from that of Great-Britain! God moſt righteouſly contends and corrects us for our ſins: in this caſe we have reaſon to ſubmit, repent, and reform. Britain contends and threatens ruin; in this caſe we juſtly vindicate ourſelves, and ought moſt vigorouſly to exert ourſelves in a proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. I have always had the firmeſt belief that we ſhould prevail in our conteſt with Britain. But I have always thought, and often told you, that God would ſcourge us for our ſins. <hi>What ſon is there whom the father chaſtens not?</hi> 'Tis common for God to correct his people when working deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for them. Thus he often treated Iſrael in the days of the judges. God often makes uſe of the worſt of inſtruments to correct his own people, while he calls upon them to repent and reform. God corrects us by Britain, and loudly calls upon us to repent; while the cruelty of our enemies, and the juſtice of our cauſe, is not forgot before him. While I am obliged to point out many crying ſins among us, I cannot help animating you from the conſideration that we are engaged in a glorious cauſe: We are nobly contending for the good of millions yet unborn. In this cauſe I would have you encouraged and emboldened, though I muſt lead your thoughts to ſome diſagreeable ſubjects. There are ſins, great and aggravated ſins among us. God is angry and contending with us. We are this day called upon by our rulers to faſt and pray—to confeſs and forſake our ſins. 'Tis my
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016296_0006_0F9C1E735B691ED0"/>
duty to point out the ſins that abound, that are moſt provoking to God, for which he maintains a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with us, and which we ſhould ſincerely bewail and ſpeedily forſake. I ſhould be unworthy to occupy the place of a goſpel miniſter, if through fear, ſloth, or any thing elſe I ſhould neglect to do this. And if while thus endeavouring to keep a good conſcience, I ſhould be obliged to point out ſome deficiency in our rulers themſelves, I ſhould act in character as a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and a friend to my country. The ſins or vices which in my view are moſt prevalent among us, and which 'tis proper I ſhould this day point out, and which call for reformation, are ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p>Infidelity, profane curſing and ſwearing, neglect and contempt of religion; ſelfiſhneſs, avarice, and extortion; ſupporting and encouraging ſlavery; criminal languor and negligence in defence of our civil and ſacred rights.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Infidelity, profane curſing and ſwearing, neglect and contempt of religion.</hi>—I put all theſe together becauſe they are breaches of the firſt table of the law. They are more immediately againſt God himſelf. Sins againſt God are in their own nature the greateſt ſins. The greateſt command, as our ſaviour ſhews us, is to love or ſhow a proper regard to God. The breach of the greateſt command muſt be the greateſt ſin, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law. In the Jewiſh ſtate ſins againſt God immedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ately were ordered to be puniſhed with death; and moſt reaſonably, becauſe that ſtate was a theocracy; God was their king: And ſin againſt him was high
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016296_0007_0F9C1E74599E45F8"/>
treaſon, was deſpiſing and oppoſing the chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. And though God does not now require us to puniſh thoſe ſins in the ſame manner; yet he, the moral governor of the world, is highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and will ſooner or later enter into judgment for ſuch iniquity, and will puniſh thoſe ſtates where ſuch ſins abound. <hi>The ſin of infidelity,</hi> is great and moſt ungrateful. To deny and reject the holy ſcriptures, which is the voice of God ſpeaking from heaven to us; to treat it as a forgery and impoſture; to renounce and blaſpheme the Saviour who has died for our good, muſt be very wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, when 'tis conſidered with what clear light and evidence the ſcripture is conveyed to us; by its own internal excellency, moſt agreeable to the divine perfections; by the wonderful and exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of ancient and undeniable prophecy and predictions; and by a multitude of the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and inconteſtable miracles. The ſin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity muſt appear dreadful when we conſider the worth of immortal ſouls; an eternity of happineſs or miſery before us; when we conſider how much Jeſus Chriſt has done and ſuffered for us; when we conſider how God has diſtinguiſhed us from the heathen, and given us a happy opportunity to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our eternal felicity. This dreadful ſin does awfully abound in our land; but, bleſſed be God, I truſt I may ſay not among our rulers: Therefore it does not ſo much expoſe us to national or public judgments as if the leaders of the people counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Profane curſing and ſwearing.</hi>—What ſhall I ſay? I need not inform any that it exceedingly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016296_0008_0F9C1E79D7A803D8"/>
abounds. Shall I ſay this is leſs criminal than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity? probably in ſome inadvertent inſtances it may be. Infidelity is the more deliberate ſin: But to affront God to his face by profaning his ſacred name is ſhocking. To defy, and at the ſame time imprecate the vengeance of the omnipotent, is moſt wicked and abſurd. To dare the power and juſtice of God, and call for damnation on themſelves and others, is folly and wickedneſs beyond what I am able to expreſs. God himſelf has declared that <hi>he will not hold them guiltleſs who take his name in vain.</hi> No ſin has leſs temptation; no ſin is leſs excuſable; ſcarce any ſin ſhews a more hardened and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart. What an amazing increaſe of this ſin in our land in a few years! What an increaſe of it in our army ſince it was firſt conſtituted! Then profane curſing and ſwearing was forbid under proper penalties: See the rules and articles of the Congreſs for regulating the army. Not only was that vice forbid, but for a time ſome conſiderable regard was ſhown to thoſe articles. But, alas! how little thought of and regarded now, not only by the common ſoldiers, but by ſome, may I not ſay many, of the officers themſelves. Not only in our army, but through our land, God is daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and provoked by many thouſands who in that impious manner ſet their mouths againſt the Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neglect and contempt of religion, or things ſacred.</hi> —The day that God requires us to ſet apart to himſelf is diſregarded and profaned. He that has a right to diſpoſe of all our time, allows us ſix days in ſeven for our own employments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016296_0009_0F9C1E7B2AD70A80"/>
and requires us to devote one to himſelf. How ungrateful and wicked to rob him of this! and yet how common. Not only the ſabbath, but religious people and religious exerciſes are treated with contempt. The houſe of God, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God are deſpiſed. The man that conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſcruples to comply with faſhionable vices is ſhunned, is treated with a ſneer if not hooted at. Oh! how valuable, rather invaluable are the means of grace. If we have immortal ſouls, if God has opened a way for our ſalvation by Chriſt, what an unſpeakable privilege is it to have a day and ſeaſon of grace; and what a provocation to have all that God has done for us neglected and deſpiſed. By the work of redemption God deſigned chiefly to diſplay and illuſtrate his perfections in our world; and by our compliance with the methods of his grace, and a cordial obedience to his law, we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him. How provoking then to diſregard all that God has done for us, and treat religion with contempt. God has diſtinguiſhed us from the heathen, and may we not fear that by deſpiſing our privilege God may ſay of us as of Iſrael of old. Amos iii. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the family of the earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Selfiſhneſs, avarice, and extortion abound, and cry to Heaven againſt us.</hi>—The ſelfiſhneſs I mean is that which is oppoſite to public ſpiritedneſs and general benevolence. This is really the root of all the vices in the world; more immediately of thoſe which hurt our fellow creatures. A ſelfiſh perſon will promote his own private intereſt at the expence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016296_0010_0F9C1E7D1267CAC0"/>
of the public. He will injure and oppreſs others to advance himſelf, if he thinks he can do it with impunity. This narrow ſordid diſpoſition has abundantly appeared of late, at a time when we have all had the loudeſt calls to deny ſelf, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert ourſelves for the common good. But inſtead of a public ſpirit which ſhould have been the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle in us all, there has in many appeared the moſt inſatiable avarice, and a greedy graſping at every thing within their reach; endeavouring, at the expence of the public, to draw every thing poſſible into the narrow circle of ſelf. Hence the moſt ſhameleſs barefaced extortion; taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of others neceſſity; demanding a moſt exorbitant price for the commodities of life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the moſt ſcarce and neceſſary articles. If we do not endeavour in ſome good meaſure to do as we would be done by, and conſider our neighbours with whom we deal, as being a part of the ſame body with ourſelves, and to be advantaged as well as ourſelves, we are not fit to be members of civil ſociety. God with indignation beholds our ſelfiſh, avaricious, oppreſſive practice: And we may well ſuppoſe that for this, among other evils, he corrects us by continuing the war upon us. What ſays the ſcripture, 1 Theſ. iv. 6. <hi>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, becauſe that the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Our continuing in this ſelfiſh, unfriendly, cruel practice, under the rod of God, while his judgments are abroad in the land, is an aggravation of our ſin; and ſhews a perverſe, incorrigible diſpoſition, and is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit juſtification of ourſelves in our evil ways.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016296_0011_0F9C1E7DCFF5C120"/>
'Tis an aggravation of the ſin of oppreſſion, and extortion at this time, that 'tis practiſing the ſame thing that we ſo loudly complain of in the conduct of Great-Britain toward us. Britain would have been at peace with us could they have extorted from us every thing which they thought proper. And thoſe among us who act upon the principle of getting what they can from others by taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their wants and weakneſs, are practiſing the ſame thing which we are now oppoſing in Great-Britain, and which is the ground of that cruel war which this country is now, and has ſo long a time been bleeding under. Theſe extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and oppreſſors among ourſelves, would, if cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concurred and favoured, act as cruelly as the Britiſh miniſtry has done. God ſees and weighs the conduct of our Britiſh oppreſſors, and the conduct of extortioners among ourſelves. His judgments will ſooner or later, in this world or the next, moſt dreadfully overtake the guilty. Let us, let the inhabitants of the land fear and take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; repent and reform that we may not continue under the divine diſpleaſure, and fall under ſtill heavier judgments. The ſelfiſh ſordid diſpoſition that I have mentioned has no doubt produced that criminal languor and negligence in the defence of our civil and ſacred rights which the <hi>proclamation</hi> mentions. Are we not too remiſs in carrying on the war? Does it not proceed from a ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted principle? Are we not too fearful of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending our property in the public cauſe? Is there not a too general diſpoſition to ſhrink away from the employment or expence of the war, hoping it
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016296_0012_0F9C1E7E8F736DD8"/>
will ſucceed well, and end well, without our moſt vigorous exertion? But ſurely we are every way called upon to exert ourſelves in the preſent conteſt. The importance of the cauſe calls upon us; the danger ariſing from remiſſneſs calls upon us; our fellow creatures ſuffering in priſons and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements calls upon us; our religion and civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty are at ſtake; yea, our all is at ſtake: If we do not ſucceed we are undone. And ſhall we at ſuch a time as this, by a mean felfiſhneſs, avarice, and extortion, not only ſhrink back from ſo good and great a cauſe, but even ſuck the blood, and tear out the bowels of our country. Our extortion really tends to this.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Supporting and encouraging ſlavery, is one of the great and crying evils among us.</hi>—Can it be believed that a people contending for liberty ſhould, at the ſame time, be promoting and ſupporting ſlavery? What foreign nation can believe that we who ſo loudly complain of Britain's attempts to oppreſs and enſlave us, are, at the ſame time, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject ſlavery; and that while we are abundantly declaring that we eſteem liberty the greateſt of all earthly bleſſings? I cannot but think, and muſt declare my ſentiments, that the encouraging and ſupporting negro ſlavery is a crying ſin in our land. In our conteſt with Britain how much has been ſaid and publiſhed in favour of liberty? In what horrid colours has oppreſſion and ſlavery been painted by us? And is it not as great a ſin for us to practiſe it as for Britain? <hi>Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal?</hi> Is not the hard yoke of ſlavery
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016296_0013_0F9C1E7F61454DB0"/>
felt by negroes as well as by white people? Are they not fond of liberty as well as others of the human race? Is not freedom the natural unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right of all? What ſay the Congreſs in their declaration of independency? "We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs: that to ſecure theſe rights governments are inſtituted."— Thus the Congreſs. If liberty is one of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unalienable rights of all men, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is; if 'tis ſelf-evident, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo clear that it needs not proof, how unjuſt, how inhuman, for Britons, or Americans, not only to attempt, but actually to violate this right? Britain is attempting to violate it; we in America have a long time been in the actual violation of it. I have obſerved that ſins againſt God directly, are, in their own nature, the greateſt ſins; yet there may be ſome particular ſins againſt fellow creatures (which are alſo ſins againſt God) eſpecially cruelty, ſo circumſtanced, and ſo aggravated, as to be the moſt crying ſins of a particular people. Thus the tranſgreſſions of Damaſcus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Moab, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for which God entered into judgment, and would not turn away their puniſhment, were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to fellow creatures; becauſe they <hi>threſhed Gilead with inſtruments of iron, carried away the whole captivity to deliver them to their enemies, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with the ſword, caſt off pity, ript up the women with child, and burnt the bones of kings into lime.</hi> Amos firſt and ſecond chapters. And I cannot but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016296_0014_0F9C1E801145A568"/>
think our practiſing and patronizing negro ſlavery, is the moſt crying ſin in our land. And that on this account, more than any one particular thing, God maintains his controverſy with us. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I think ſo are two: Firſt, becauſe 'tis a moſt cruel, inhuman, unnatural ſin, moſt directly contrary to the whole law of God comprehended in love, to love our neighbour as ourſelf, and do as we would be done by. The ſlaves have never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their right to freedom; 'tis as the Congreſs ſay, a natural right, and an unalienable one. And if 'tis taken away, 'tis violently taken. The Apoſtle Paul ranks <hi>men ſtealers</hi> (which is the ſin we are guilty of by the negro ſlavery) <hi>with murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, whore-mongers, defilers of themſelves with mankind, liars, perjured perſons, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. i. 9. Secondly, becauſe 'tis openly and avowedly doing that which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt with our Britiſh enemies, and look upon ſo unjuſt and cruel in them. The whole of the preſent war, and all our ſtruggles under it, and our ſufferings and hardſhips by it, are to oppoſe and ſhun that from others, which we are tolerating and practiſing ourſelves, and that in a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than our enemies are attempting. If we were not blinded by ſinful ſelf-intereſt, and criminal partiality, we could not but ſee and feel the force of the Apoſtles reaſoning in Rom. 2. <hi>Thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, O man; for wherein thou judgeſt another thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame thing. And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them which do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God. Thou
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016296_0015_0F9C1E83B73A4E40"/>
that preacheſt a man, ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſayeſt a man, ſhould not commit adultery, doſt thou commit adultery? Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt idols, doſt thou commit ſacrilege? Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the law, through breaking the law diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi> Theſe words ſhew that we cannot expect to eſcape the judgments of heaven unleſs we reform and are more conſiſtent. We are condemned out of our own mouth, and by our own practice. How often has it been ſaid in our day that liberty is the greateſt human bleſſing; and that 'tis oppreſſive and cruel to deprive us of it? How oft has it been ſaid that ſlavery is more to be dreaded than death? On how many liberty poles; on how many garments and ornaments worn pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, have been inſcribed theſe emphatical words, <hi>Liberty or Death!</hi> How muſt theſe words ſound in the ears of thoſe that are held in ſlavery by us? How muſt they ſound in the ears of all impartial perſons? Eſpecially how muſt they appear to the great governor of the world, who is no reſpecter of perſons, but will judge all perſons by the law of liberty and equity? I am perſuaded theſe united American States muſt, and will groan under the afflicting hand of God, till we reform in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And our caſe looks the darker in this reſpect, that 'tis an evil which the legiſlature might remove. Sins and vices, that creep in among people, while laws and magiſtrates are generally againſt them, are not ſo threatning to a ſtate; but if the political head is ſick, and the heart faint, the danger is greater. How juſtly might God ſay to us this day, as to Iſrael of old, <hi>Is this the feaſt that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen?
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016296_0016_0F9C1E85296C6A78"/>
To what purpoſe is the multitudes of your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications? When you ſpread forth your hands I will hide my eyes from you; your hands are full of</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſlavery. <hi>Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed ſlave. Is not this the feaſt that I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppreſſed go free</hi>: The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſlaves: <hi>And that ye break every yoke.</hi> I doubt not but we may ſucceed againſt our Britiſh oppreſſors even if we ſhould not free ourſelves from the guilt of enſlaving others. The cauſe of Britain is moſt unjuſt, and our conteſt with them is moſt righteous. But however we may be free from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh oppreſſion, I venture to ſay, we ſhall have inward convulſions, contentions, oppreſſions, and various calamities, ſo that our liberty will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, till we waſh our hands from the guilt of negro ſlavery. And our neglecting to reform in this matter may protract the war to a diſtreſſing length, though we ſhall ſucceed in the end. And now how righteous is it in God to permit oppreſſion and extortion to prevail. Is it not a puniſhment for our much worſe oppreſſion of the ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Though the emancipation of the ſlaves ought to be managed by the legiſlatures, yet the maſters of ſlaves need not wait for that. If thoſe maſters had a true ſpirit of freedom; if they abhored the very nature of ſlavery, they would ſoon free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſuch a blot in the character of freemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know there are many in our land, who are ſenſible of this evil, and wiſh it remedied; but they are generally perſons not ſo immediately guilty, not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016296_0017_0F9C1E869099F060"/>
being poſſeſſed of ſlaves, and they are ready to ſay, what can we do? Let me obſerve, that there ought to be petitions from the friends of liberty in every county to the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſting them to take this matter under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. If the legiſlatures would come into proper meaſures to free the ſlaves in ſome ſuitable time, it would free our country from a load of guilt: I ſay in ſome ſuitable time, for I ſuppoſe it ſhould not be done at once, but gradually.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis objected, that this is not a proper time, that this cannot be entered upon in this ſtate of war and confuſion. But let me obſerve, that if this is one cauſe of God's controverſy with us, and of his continuing to frown upon us, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is the moſt proper time to conſider and rectify this matter, that it may be a means of freeing us from our calamities. We might as well ſay that we cannot, in this difficult time, raiſe men for our army, becauſe we are ſo ſtraightened for help, and need our men at home; whereas this is the time in which it muſt be done. To ſay this is not the proper time for our legiſlature to conſider the eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of our ſlaves, is, in my view, as abſurd as for a ſick man to ſay his ſtomach is ſo out of order that he cannot now take a diſagreeable medicine, but will wait till he is better, and can take it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch difficulty. I know there are many imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary difficulties, and many objections raiſed, but 'tis eaſy to get over them all except ſuch as ariſe from ſelf-intereſt, and thoſe will not eaſily be got over<note n="*" place="bottom">Many plans might be offered for emancipating the ſlaves: If it would be of any importance I would offer one in a poſtſcript. It may be no one plan would ſuit every ſtate; ſome might chooſe one, and others another.</note>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016296_0018_0F9C1E86D6FE46B8"/>
If we had a clear, rational view, of the worth, nature, and importance of freedom; if we had a proper view of the criminal nature of enſlaving others; if we had a proper view of that tribunal, where judgment will paſs without any reſpect to perſons, by the law of loving others as our ſelves, we ſhould eaſily get over all the difficulties that are in the caſe.</p>
            <p>I would think as favourably as I can, concerning the guilty ſtate of my country, which I moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh to proſper and enjoy the divine ſmiles. I would excuſe and extenuate, as far as poſſible, the unnatural ſin of holding fellow creatures in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual bondage. I ſuppoſe the ſin is leſs aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, becauſe 'tis by many not thought to be a ſin, and becauſe 'tis ſo common. 'Tis like the polygamy of the ancient patriarchs. That was a common evil, and not duly conſidered. To marry ſeveral wives, and have a concubine or miſtreſs beſide, was an unnatural evil, as God has created an equal number of each ſex. And for a perſon of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious character to live in that practice now, would be ſcandalous, and thought to be impious; and very juſtly. Yet this ſin in itſelf is by no means ſo great, ſo unnatural, ſo cruel, and ſo provoking to God, as it is to keep in perpetual bondage thoſe who have a natural right to freedom, and have not forfeited it. Polygamy of old was a common ſin and not duly conſidered: And ſlavery being ſo common now, and not duly weighed, may exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but will not free from guilt. I have reaſon to hope this matter will be conſidered and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and that God will turn to us in mercy and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016296_0019_0F9C1E88722B9CD8"/>
proſper us. We ſhould not be diſcouraged, but repent and exert ourſelves in the cauſe of liberty, both againſt Britain and among ourſelves. I know ſome ſerious people, hearty friends to our country, are diſpoſed to ſink into diſcouragements when they view the many vices among us, the frowns of God upon us, and how few there are that pay any regard to the tokens of his diſpleaſure. The abounding of vice, and inſenſibility under the rod of God, is certainly the darkeſt aſpect in our public affairs. But ſtill we may encourage ourſelves in the goodneſs of God, and every one, as far as his influence extends, attempt a reformation, beginning with ſelf. God is yet waiting to be gracious; he deals with us as with a people whom he deſigns to ſave and not deſtroy. Though he corrects, yet he ſhews us many favours. He remarkably appears for us, and prevents our ruin; yea, gives us advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt our enemies. We ſhould conſider that correction is no ſign of rejection. Things are yet in our favour. Though the war is protracted, and we are ſo long held under the rod, yet all things ſhall be for the beſt in the end. Nothing leſs than what we have ſuffered would have done for us. Nothing leſs would have made ſufficiently deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on us and on poſterity. Nothing leſs would have given us and poſterity a view of the worth of the privileges we contend for. How often is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Engliſhmen that their anceſtors have waded through rivers of blood to enjoy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of freemen. Our preſent difficulties will be recollected with advantage to the end of time. If God is contending with us, yet he deals with us as
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016296_0020_0F9C1E890E4AB8D0"/>
children for whom he deſigns mercy: We have many tokens for good. 'Tis encouraging that our rulers regard religion, acknowlege the providence of God, and call upon us to ſeek him, to repent and reform. And if they are deficient in ſome things, yet they uprightly mean to diſcourage evil, and promote virtue; and whereunto they have not attained, deſire that even this may be ſhewn unto them. I cannot but hope this day may be in ſome meaſure ſuch a faſt as God has choſen.</p>
            <p>Some people are apt to think we have no reaſon to expect, and can ſcarce pray for an outward bleſſing, while ſo many vices abound among us. Indeed we have reaſon to be humbled and mourn, reaſon to repent and reform; but that we may not ſink into diſcouragements conſider, that God who is infinite in goodneſs, waits long to be gracious, and may yet try us with mercy as a means to lead us to repentance. We may well pray for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful interpoſition, <hi>that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we may ſerve him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs all the days of our life.</hi> Will ſome aſk, what if we ſhould not return to God by repentance and reformation, but that we ſhould continue in ſin, and vice continue to abound, as it has done two or three years paſt? I anſwer, that would be truly lamentable, and a very dark ſign, that would much damp our hopes. God forbid it ſhould be ſo. But in that caſe, I ſhould expect that God would yet try us with a mixture of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and corrections. That we ſhould be delivered from Britiſh tyranny, and have plenty in our land, with internal commotions, diviſions, convulſions,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016296_0021_0F9C1E89CD5B24C8"/>
oppreſſions, and other difficulties, while God gave us a ſpace to repent and reform, which, if after all we ſhould refuſe to do, we ſhould be ripening for heavy judgments in ſome future time. And how long an infinitely merciful and long ſuffering God may deter thoſe judgments, we know not. I cannot but hope, yea believe, that after the war is over we ſhall ſet ourſelves to reform many things that are amiſs among us, ſlavery not excepted. I muſt believe this great event, this important ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for liberty, will, in the end, be a means of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to negro ſlavery in this land, and to many other oppreſſions and impoſitions, which a ſtate of liberty is adapted to throw off and reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Our ſtruggle for liberty is attended to through the world. All eyes are upon us; and all that are not ſelf-intereſted, or grievouſly impoſed on by miſrepreſentations, think our cauſe is juſt, and wiſh us ſucceſs. Should we obtain our end, this land of liberty could not be ſo inconſiſtent, could not with any face continue and ſupport ſlavery, and other oppreſſions contrary to a ſtate of freedom. On the whole, my friends, we have the greateſt reaſon to reform our lives, truſt in God, and exert ourſelves in our country's cauſe with full confidence of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>My dear friends, I cannot leave you without a repeated earneſt exhortation to repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Infidelity, profaneneſs, contempt of divine things, avarice, oppreſſion and extortion, are provoking to God. And if God be againſt us, who can eventually be for us? All our exertions will be to no purpoſe if God does not favour us.

How eaſily can he diſappoint all our ſchemes and attempts? How eaſily can he ſend a ſickneſs that will ſweep away our army? How eaſily can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the fruits of the earth, and cauſe a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? How eaſily can he give ſome unexpected ſucceſs to our enimies? How righteouſly might he leave us to ſuch contentions and animoſities among ourſelves as would divide and deſtroy us? In all theſe ways, and many others, he has in times paſt diſappointed the hopes of thoſe he has chaſtiſed or deſtroyed. Let us then be deeply ſenſible how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'tis that God be for us. That we be ſuch a people as he will delight in and bleſs: That we be reformed, humble, and benevolent. If God be for us, we need not fear any that are, or can be againſt us. What a happy land will this be, if 'tis a land of true religion! It will then be a land of liberty, of peace, and plenty. We ſhall then live in love and peace among ourſelves: And many from other nations will flock to us as the moſt happy people on the face of the earth.

            <p>MANY plans or ſchemes might be mentioned, but the following is propoſed as moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the owners of ſlaves, and as freeing them gradually, year after year, which in many reſpects might be beſt for them, and for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, viz. All that ſhall hereafter be born, and all that are now under five years old, ſhould be free, the males at twenty-one years old, and the females at eighteen. All above five years, and under ten years of age, to be free, the males at twenty-three years, and the females at twenty years of age. All above ten, and under 15 years old, male and female, to be free at twenty-five years old. All between fifteen and twenty years old, to be free in eight years from this time. All between twenty and twenty-five, to be free in ſeven years from this time. All between twenty-five and thirty, to be free in ſix years. All between thirty and thirty-five, to be free in five years. All between thirty-five and forty, to be free in four years. All between forty and forty five, to be free in three years. All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween forty-five and fifty, to be free in two years. All between fifty and ſixty, to be free in one year. And all above ſixty to ſerve during life, in order to be taken care of and provided for by their owners.</p>
            <p>In ths plan ſome would become free in one year, others in two, others in three, and ſo on.</p>
            <p>The owners might from principles of equity and benevolence, free many of them in a much ſhorter tme than is here mentioned, and no doubt many would.</p>
