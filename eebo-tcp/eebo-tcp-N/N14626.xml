            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following letter was written in the year 1776, at the requeſt of an American gentleman, who deſired to know my ſentiments upon the ſlavery of the Negroes, and profeſſed an intention of reſtoring all his own to liberty, could he be convinced that duty required the ſacrifice. I therefore ſent him the following eſſay, the imperfections of which may perhaps be ſomething extenuated by the precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with which it was written. It has lain by me many years in obſcurity; nor did I chooſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it during the progreſs of the American conteſt. Since the happy termination of that diſaſtrous war, I have ſhewn it to ſome of my particular friends, who have honoured me ſo far as to deſire copies, and to ſuggeſt that its publication might not be unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with utility. After reflecting upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I have choſen to comply with their wiſhes, and preſent this fragment to the public; becauſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſcredit it brings upon my head, it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to eſtabliſh the ſincerity of my heart: And if a ſingle human being ſhould by my means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to happineſs, it is an ample recompence for all the dangers I may incur as an author. Should this eſſay ever reach America, it may perhaps diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe thoſe who have not learned to diſcern friends from flatterers, and to diſtinguiſh between the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of truth and calumny. Thoſe, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who are enlightened by a more extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018557_0003_0FA7B1B77A4E29A8"/>
of human nature, may perhaps reſpect an Engliſhman, who, after daring to aſſert their cauſe, through all the varied events of the late revolution, dares now with equal intrepidity aſſert the cauſe of truth and juſtice, and of that part of the human ſpecies whoſe wrongs are yet unredreſſed, and almoſt unpitied. Should it be aſked why I rather publiſh a fragment than a complete eſſay, I can only anſwer, that I reſpect truth ſo much, that I am not inclined to violate it even as an author; and that this letter having been really written in the year 1776, and being ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the gentleman to whom it was ſent, I do not chooſe to piece it with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the year 1784.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I WAS extremely ſurpriſed at receiving a letter, in an unknown hand, which deſired me to give my ſentiments relative to the ſlavery of the Negroes; till reading to the end, I recollected the name of a gentleman, whom I had the pleaſure of ſeeing with Mr. Laurens. Much as I am flattered by finding my opinion of any conſequence with a gentleman of whom I have heard ſo advantageous a character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſtill more ſurpriſed, that he can aſk it on ſuch a queſtion; a queſtion which I am ſure his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and good ſenſe will be ſufficient to decide, if he attends, for a moment, to their dictates. I reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you, ſir, too much to doubt the ſincerity of the declaration you make, when you profeſs to be guided by reaſon and morality upon this queſtion; for this is the only arbitration which any man can have to conſult upon a ſubject like this: Where they are ſilent, the voice of the whole world ought
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018557_0004_0FA7B1B877507A08"/>
to be diſregarded, and where they approve, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all mankind can have no influence upon a mind like yours.—But as you expreſsly deſire to know my ſentiments, I muſt wave both preface and ceremony, and addreſs you with the modeſt freedom that becomes one man when he is ſpeaking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother upon the moſt important queſtion in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. As a member of that ſociety which has now made a ſolemn appeal to Heaven, and taken up arms againſt the nation to which it owes its eſtabliſhment, you muſt admit that there are ſuch things as right and juſtice, to which the whole human ſpecies have an indefeaſible claim. Indeed, unleſs there be ſuch a thing as juſtice, it is in vain we enquire about its precepts, or refer to its arbitration. He that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no right but force, no juſtice but ſuperior vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, arms every man againſt himſelf, and juſtifies all exceſſes. If it be lawful to injure becauſe we can; if we may ſeize the property of another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult his perſon, or force him to labour for our luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or caprice, merely becauſe he is weaker; this principle will be equally fatal to ourſelves, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhall ſtrip us of that power which is our only prerogative, and ſhift the plea of ſuperiority. You are to remember that, upon this ſuppoſition, your ſlaves, the inſtant they ſhall become the ſtrongeſt, will have a right to the ſervices of yourſelf and every other gentleman of the ſouthern colonies; will have a right to force you to labour naked in the sun to the muſic of whips and chains; to rob you of every thing which is now dear to your indolence, or neceſſary to your pleaſures; to goad you to every ſpecies of ſervile drudgery, and puniſh you for their amuſement and caprice; will have a right to exhauſt your youth in ſervitude, and to abandon your age to wretchedneſs and discases: In one word, fir, they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018557_0005_0FA7B1895C6E3E0"/>
will have a right to uſe YOU, as you do THEM. Let us, therefore, leave principles which can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by no one but a profeſſed enemy to mankind; who would at one ſtroke extirpate every thing which alleviates the evils of life, and arm every man in an eternal war againſt his fellow creatures, to enquire what are the real dictates of that juſtice, whoſe exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I am perſuaded, we both allow. You, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, admit there are certain claims, which, for want of a better name, we call rights, to which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies has an indiſputable title. To expreſs myſelf in other words, "There is a method of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing our own happineſs in ſuch a manner, that we may promote the general good at the ſame time; or, at leaſt not interfere with it." This, our reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, is the privilege of every created being; and while he confines himſelf within theſe bounds, we feel the moſt cordial approbation of his conduct. We love, and eſteem, and ſympathize with him, from the very conſtitution of our nature. On the contrary, whenever any one diſturbs or injures a being acting in this manner, or prevents him from attaining the good to which he is impelled, we feel our hatred and indignation moſt forcibly excited againſt the aggreſſor. We conſider ſuch a character as armed againſt the welfare of the world, and as one who is endeavouring to make the common good ſubſervient to his own ſelfiſhneſs. I appeal to the generoſity of your own nature, for the exiſtence of theſe principles. Have they not, a thouſand times, animated you to acts of virtue and humanity, as well as inſpired you with an involuntary reverence for all who acted from their impulſe? Have they not often pleaded the cauſe of the wretch that lay trembling and defenceleſs at your feet, and, in ſpite of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of your country and education, whiſpered to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018557_0006_0FA7B1B93B40E260"/>
your mind that one human being ought not to hold his exiſtence by the tenure of another's will?</p>
               <p>Do not theſe principles now inſpire you, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently impel you beyond the bounds of prudence and ſafety, while what you call your country's cauſe animates you to exertion? But this cauſe is only the united cauſe and intereſt of every particular man; thoſe rights which the Great Creator taught him to diſcover when he gave him reaſon, which he urges him to defend by paſſion, and which a mind like yours prizes beyond the gratifications of ſenſe, and dares to graſp at even while it is periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This appears to me to be a plain and conciſe deduction of morality, which means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than that method or rule of conduct by which the whole human ſpecies may attain the greateſt poſſible degree of happineſs. And I rather chooſe to expreſs myſelf ſo, becauſe I thus compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all ſects and opinions. The religious man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the happineſs of the ſpecies is the great end of the Deity, which he promotes by the rewards and puniſhments of a future ſtate: The diſciple of Shaftſbury underſtands this, when he talks of the beauty of virtue and the love of order; and even the gloomy pupil of Hobbes, who reſolves every thing into ſelf intereſt, muſt allow the exiſtence of moral diſtinctions, ſo far as they influence the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſpecies. This univerſal morality appears to me to be the only rational and legal foundation of all human government; which ought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the application of this general rule to particular ſocieties, and the enforcing it by civil eſtabliſhments. If, therefore, it be granted, that the rights of a nation are nothing more than the rights of every man in it, and that all juſt and legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſuppoſes a delegated power entruſted ſolely for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018557_0007_0FA7B1BA063A44D0"/>
the purpoſe of promoting the general good; it will appear evident that every individual in the univerſe poſſeſſes certain rights, which no man can diveſt him of without injuſtice, unleſs he be guilty of ſome crime againſt ſociety which expoſes him to its ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Hence it follows, that whenever any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attacks the rights and happineſs of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it deſerves to find its own deſtruction in the attempt; and whenever any individual preſumes to exerciſe this ſpecies of authority over his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he muſt be a tyrant and an oppreſſor, whom it is permitted to deſtroy by every poſſible method. Whoever would deny this, muſt either deny the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of right and juſtice entirely, and then it is in vain to argue; or muſt ſhew ſome natural diſtinction by which one part of the ſpecies is entitled to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges from which the other is excluded. The firſt ſuppoſition I have already conſidered, and the ſecond is altogether abſurd; for all alterations and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among mankind ſolely ariſe from civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has no other juſt foundation than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right; and natural right, for that reaſon, muſt be a principle of higher authority than civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whenever, therefore, civil government tends to deſtroy and confound the rights of nature, it ceaſes to have any claim to our obedience; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tyranny, corruption, deſpotiſm, a peſt inſtead of a bleſſing, and ſubverſive of every purpoſe for which it was inſtituted, or ought to be continued.</p>
               <p>I am extremely fearful of expreſſing myſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely upon ſo abſtract a ſubject, and muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though with the hazard of prolixity, attempt to place it in a different light.—If you imagine any number of the human ſpecies aſſembled in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of the globe, without any form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed among them; it is evident,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018557_0008_0FA7B1BD799B3140"/>
that theſe individuals may either live together in ſuch a manner as to produce mutual comfort and aſſiſtance, or may be the cauſe of continual miſery to each other. No propoſition in the mathematics can be inveſtigated with more preciſion than the methods of conduct which have theſe contrary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies. Every diſpoſition which inclines one man to aſſiſt another, or to avoid giving him offence and doing him injury, muſt neceſſarily contribute to the common welfare; which would be perfect, were theſe diſpoſitions cultivated in the greateſt poſſible degree. On the contrary, every diſpoſition, which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the perſonal ſecurity of individuals, or to deprive them of thoſe things which they have acquired by their induſtry, is detrimental to the ſum of happineſs, and would, if carried to the greateſt poſſible degree, entirely deſtroy that part of the ſpecies.—In this view of things, morality ariſes from neceſſity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly obſerved, produce happineſs to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; but when violated or neglected, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily occaſion miſery, as fire or pointed ſubſtances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</p>
               <p>I hardly think that the greateſt ſceptic will deny theſe diſtinctions founded upon facts as certain as the impreſſion of any material ſubſtance upon our ſenſes. If we, now, proceed a little farther, we ſhall find that the diſpoſitions which produce theſe different kinds of conduct are by the moraliſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by different names, and enforced by different motives, according to their ſeveral ſyſtems; while natural religion adds its ſanctions, and inclines us
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018557_0009_0FA7B1BDB3D66A90"/>
to believe that the Deity himſelf, who has diſplayed ſo great an attention to the happineſs and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his creatures here, may extend his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to another ſtage of exiſtence, and compenſate the evils ſometimes unmeritedly ſuffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the ſcheme of human things is perfect as it is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; the clouds which overſhadowed our horizon are diſſipated, and the gradual progreſs of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happineſs, is diſplayed and aſcertained.</p>
               <p>Having laid down theſe principles, it is eaſy to apply them to the particular caſe in queſtion. Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is the abſolute dependance of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as inconſiſtent with all ideas of juſtice, as deſpotiſm is with the rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is a crime ſo monſtrous againſt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, that all thoſe who practiſe it deſerve to be extirpated from the earth. It is no little indirect attack upon the ſafety and happineſs of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly ſtrikes at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all humanity and juſtice. Robbers invade the property, and murderers the life of human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but he that holds another man in bondage, ſubjects the whole ſum of his exiſtence to oppreſſion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more deteſtable than robber and aſſaſſin combined. But if no one who has common feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common ſenſe will attempt to juſtify it by argument; ſince it would involve him in the groſſeſt and moſt inextricable contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He muſt allow that every man has, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a right to life, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to ſubſiſtence, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018557_0010_0FA7B1BEAF77B7D8"/>
is juſtified by nature and the Deity in purſuing his own happineſs by all innocent methods, every other individual is equally juſtified in making him miſerable. In ſhort, it is reducing every thing to the ſtate before deſcribed, a ſtate of conteſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from which right and juſtice are equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>Of you, ſir, who ſay you have ſeveral ſlaves, I beg leave to aſk what are the rights you claim over them? Have you a right to torture them when they are guilty of no faults? Have you a right to kill them for your diverſion? Is your power circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by no bounds, and are there particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings who bring into the world all the rights which you yourſelf can pretend to, but have ſo entirely loſt them by being tranſported into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and of nature's God?</p>
               <p>Surely, ſir, unleſs I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honour and humanity. You ſtart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked barbarity. You would not murther a ſlave to ſhew your dexterity, nor maim him to prove your ſtrength; you would not daſh an infant upon the ground to feed your dogs, even tho' he was black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while ſhe was ſuckling him, to improve your ſkill in anatomy. You nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would, nor dare you commit actions like theſe; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and ſuperiour right to deſtroy you like a beaſt of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: You will feed and cloath your negroes, you will treat them with humanity and tenderneſs, and then you have a right to moderate advantage from their labors. All this, ſir, is well; and could I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

that you ever had acted in another manner, I ſhould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your negroes chooſe to ſtay with you upon theſe terms, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a fair and equitable compact. But what if they ſhould chooſe to leave you, will you let them go? If you do, you are a man of honor, ſenſe, and humanity; but I fear no Weſt Indian.</p>
               <p>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puniſhments more dreadful than death itſelf for contumacious ſlaves? And what is this but claiming the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings miſerable, for your intereſt or amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Who, ſir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loathſome drudgery? And if you have no right to this, what are the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments you pretend to inflict but ſo many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becauſe you withhold your property; or a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher a right to a woman's blood becauſe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her chaſtity? Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the puniſhments inflicted upon fugitive ſlaves are a flagitious inſult upon juſtice, humanity and common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able property in the labours of your fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—A wretch, devoid of compaſſion and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who calls himſelf a king of ſome part of Africa, which ſuffers the calamity of being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the Europeans, ſeizes his innocent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or engages in an unneceſſary war to furniſh himſelf with priſoners; theſe are loaded with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like beaſts to the ſlaughter houſe) down to the ſea ſhore, where the mild ſubjects of a Chriſtian

government and a religious king are waiting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for the purchaſe, and to tranſport them to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. They are then thruſt by hundreds into the infectious hold of a ſhip, in which the greateſt part frequently periſhes by diſeaſe, while the reſt are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to experience the candor and humanity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican patriots—If you have never yet conſidered it, pauſe here for a moment, and endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon your mind the feelings of a being full as ſenſible, and perhaps more innocent than you or I, which is thus torn in an inſtant from every thing that makes life agreeable; from country, friends and parents; from the intercourſe of mutual affection with conſort, lover, or child; which, poſſeſt of feelings more exquiſite than European hearts can conceive, is ſeparated for ever from all it loves; that, reduced to a depth of miſery, which, even in the midſt of freedom and affluence, would be ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the moſt hardened diſpoſition, inſtead of friends and comforters, and obſequious attendants, ſees itſelf ſurrounded with unrelenting perſecutors and unpitying enemies; wretches, who by long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with miſery, are grown callous to its ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; who anſwer tears with taunts, and complaints with torture! I ſhudder at the horrors which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and bluſh to be a human creature! Yet theſe are not the colours of deſcription, but a recital of facts leſs ſtrong than the reality. Can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon theſe things, without unutterable remorſe, Can he know that, perhaps, while he is wallowing in luxury and ſenſuality, there are beings whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence he has embittered, mothers ſhrieking for their children, and children periſhing for want of their mothers care; wretches who are frantic with rage, ſhame and deſperation, or pining in all the agonies of ſlow and painful death, who might have
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018557_0013_0FA7B1C822E578C0"/>
been at peace if he had never exiſted? Can any man know this and hope for mercy, either from his fellow creatures or his God?—</p>
               <p>After the arrival of the ſurviving wretches in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, you well know in what manner they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their conſcientious maſters—how they are brought to the market, naked, weeping, and in chains—how one man dares to examine his fellow creatures as he would do beaſts, and bargain for their perſons—how all the moſt ſacred duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and inſulted; and thus you dare to call yourſelves the maſters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence!—While I am tracing this practiſe, which you and every man who has been in the iſlands or the ſouthern colonies of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, knows to be true, my aſtoniſhment exceeds even my horror, to find it poſſible that any one ſhould ſeriouſly doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</p>
               <p>With what face, ſir, can he who has never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſouthern colonies ſpeak of privileges and juſtice? Is money of ſo much more importance than life? Or have the Americans ſhared the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power of St. Peter's ſucceſſors, to excuſe their own obſervance of thoſe rules which they impoſe on others? If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, ſigning reſolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandiſhing a whip over his affrighted ſlaves.</p>
               <p>If men would be conſiſtent, they muſt admit all the conſequences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the dilemma of either acknowledging the rights of your negroes,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018557_0014_0FA7B1C8355E7DA8"/>
or of ſurrendering your own.—If there be certain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and univerſal rights, as the declarations of your Congreſs ſo repeatedly affirm, I wonder how the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Africans have incurred their forfeiture.—Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Engliſh Americans, which conſtitutes the difference, and entitles them to rights from which they totally exclude more than a fourth part of the ſpecies?—Or do you chooſe to make uſe of that argument, which the great Monteſquieu has thrown out as the ſevereſt ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is ſhort and woolly?</p>
               <p>The more attentively you conſider this ſubject, the more clearly you will perceive, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and tyranny, combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from yourſelf, that every title you can alledge, muſt be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and ſupported by open and avowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. Can any thing be clearer, than that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by ſuffering oppreſſion; and that it is a contradiction to urge a purchaſe of what no one has a right to ſell? Nor does it make any difference, whether the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate victim paſs from one to another, or from one to a thouſand maſters, any more than whether a nation be enſlaved by a firſt or by an hundredth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. There can be no preſcription pleaded againſt truth and juſtice; and the continuance of the evil is ſo far from juſtifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you ſay to a man in private life, who ſhould pretend to be no thief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he only bought ſtolen goods; or that he was no villain, becauſe he did not forge a deed himſelf, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018557_0015_0FA7B1C8F6F64830"/>
by that honorable ſecurity? Yet this is literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the title which the Americans plead to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or ſteal your negroes; perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are too lazy and luxurious: but you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage an infamous, pitileſs race of men to do it for you, and conſcientiouſly receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to ſervitude! No, men of your independent ſpirits, that have taken up arms againſt the government that had protected and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed them, rather than pay a tax of three pence; that have laid the axe to the root of all human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and inſtead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abuſes and preſcriptive obedience, have aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the living fountains of truth, juſtice and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happineſs of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all mankind to be their equals. Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unknown to nature and to degrade one part of the ſpecies to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!—You know that this is the greateſt of all corruptions, and as ſuch you deteſt it.—What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil diſtinctions, when legitimate the permiſſion of the people, and conſequently ſubordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated deſart and the howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Not of Frenchmen, nor of Germans, nor of Engliſhmen, but of men;—men, the firſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme diſtinction, who, created for freedom and happineſs, tranſport to every ſoil the inherent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of their nature.</p>

Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I hope you will pleaſe to be men; and, as ſuch, admit the whole human ſpecies to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cottage and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loathſome exiſtence in miſery and chains; you will not make depredations upon your unoffending neighbours, and, after having ſpread deſolation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to ſervitude.

But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe ſome of you at leaſt are Chriſtians. Your worſt actions, therefore, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt crimes which even your enemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary cauſes of all theſe miſchiefs?—You, you encourage the Engliſh pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to violate the laws of faith and hoſpitality, and ſtimulate him to new exceſſes by purchaſing the fruits of his rapine.

I was not a little pleaſed with this my firſt reception; it convinced me, that there ought to be a conſiderable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard every where of the ſavage character of the Africans. I obſerved, both in negroes and Moors, great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and ſociableneſs, which gave me ſtrong hopes, that I ſhould be very ſafe amongſt them, and meet with the ſucceſs I deſired, in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after the curioſities of the country.</q>

               <p>Andrew Brue, a principal man in the French Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in the account he gives of the great river Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal, which runs many hundred miles up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, tells his readers, <q>The farther you go from the ſea, the country on the river ſeems more fruitful and well improved. It abounds in Guinea and Indian corn, rice, pulſe, tobacco, and indigo. Here are vaſt meadows, which feed large herds of great and ſmall cattle; poultry are numerous, as well as wild fowl.</q> The ſame author, in his travels to the ſouth of the river Gambia, expreſſes his ſurprize, <q>To ſee the land ſo well cultivated; ſcarce a ſpot lay unimproved; the low grounds divided by ſmall canals, were all ſowed with rice; the higher ground planted with Indian corn, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and peaſe of different ſorts, beef and mutton very cheap, as well as all other neceſſaries of life.</q> The account that this author gives of the diſpoſition of the natives, is, <q>That they are generally good-natured and civil, and may be brought to any thing by fair and ſoft means.

               </p>
               <p>N. Brue, in his account of the trade, &amp;c. writes, <q>That having received a quantity of goods, he wrote to the king of the country, that if he had a ſufficient number of ſlaves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince, (ſays that author) as well as other negro monarchs, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſure way of ſupplying his deficiencies by ſelling his own ſubjects.—The king had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this method, by ſeizing three hundred of his own people, and ſent word to Brue, that he had the ſlaves ready to deliver for the goods.</q>

               <p>The miſery and bloodſhed, conſequent of the ſlave trade, is amply ſet forth by the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, of two voyages to the coaſt of Guinea for ſlaves.

               <q>
                  <p>Seſtro, December the 29th, 1724. No trade to-day, though many traders come on board, they inform us, that the people are gone to war within land, and will bring priſoners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we ſtay.</p>
                  <p>The 30th. No trade yet, but our traders came on board to-day, and informed us, the people had burnt four towns of their enemies, ſo that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow we expect ſlaves off. Another large ſhip is come in: yeſterday came in a large Londoner.</p>
                  <p>The 31ſt. Fair weather, but no trade yet; we ſee each night towns burning; but we hear the Seſtro men are many of them killed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land negroes, ſo that we fear this war will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful.</p>

The 2d January. Laſt night we ſaw a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fire break out about eleven o'clock, and this morning we ſee the town of Seſtro burnt down to the ground, (it contained ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of houſes) ſo that we find their enemies are too hard for them at preſent, and conſequently our trade ſpoiled here; ſo that about ſeven o'clock we weighed anchor, as did likewiſe the three other veſſels to proceed lower down.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The ſecond relation, alſo taken from the original manuſcript journal of a perſon of credit, who went ſurgeon on the ſame account, in a veſſel from New-York to the coaſt of Guinea, about eighteen years paſt, is as follows, viz. <q>Being on the coaſt at a place called Baſalia, the commander of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, according to cuſtom, ſent a perſon on ſhore with a preſent to the king, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting him know, they wanted a cargo of ſlaves. The king promiſed to furniſh them with ſlaves, and in order to do it, ſet out to go to war againſt his enemies, deſigning alſo to ſurprize ſome town, and take all the people pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. Sometime after, the king ſent them word, he had not yet met with the deſired ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, having been twice repulſed, in attempting to break up two towns; but that he ſtill hoped to procure a number of ſlaves for them; and in this deſign he perſiſted till he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which laſted three days, during which time the engagement was ſo bloody, that four thouſand five hundred men were ſlain on the ſpot.</q> The perſon, that wrote the account, beheld the bodies as they lay on the field of battle. <q>Think (ſays he in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) what a pitiable ſight it was, to ſee the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows weeping over their loſt huſbands, orphans deploring the loſs of their fathers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>

               <p>"And firſt, to the captains employed in this trade. Moſt of you know the country of Guinea, perhaps now by your means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilderneſs; the inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murdered or carried away, ſo that there are few left to till the ground; but you know, or have heard, how populous, how fruitful, how pleaſant it was a few years ago. You know the people were not ſtupid; not wanting in ſenſe, conſidering the few means of improvement they enjoyed. Neither did you find them ſavage, treacherous, or unkind to ſtrangers. On the contrary, they were in moſt parts a ſenſible and ingenious people; kind and friendly, and generally juſt in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by ſtealth, part by force, part made captives in thoſe wars which you raiſe or foment on purpoſe. You have ſeen them torn away, children from their parents, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from their children: Huſbands from their wives, wives from their beloved huſbands; brethren and ſiſters from each other. You have dragged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native ſhore. You have forced them into your ſhips, like an herd of ſwine,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <hi>About the year</hi> 1749, <hi>I ſailed from Liverpool to the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea; ſome time after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a conſiderable diſtance, upon having notice from one of the negro kings, that he had a parcel of ſlaves to diſpoſe of, I received my inſtructions and went, carrying with me an account of ſuch goods we had on board, to exchange for the ſlaves we intended to purchaſe; upon being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I preſented him with a ſmall caſe of ſpirits, a gun and ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, which having accepted, and underſtood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the ſlaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here, how ſhall I relate the affecting ſight I there beheld, the ſilent ſorrow which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the countenance of the afflicted father, and the painful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the tender mother, expecting to be forever ſeparated from their tender offspring; the diſtreſſed maid wringing her hands in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of her future wretchedneſs, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fearful apprehenſion of the perpetual ſlavery to which they were doomed. I purchaſed eleven, who I conducted, tied two and two; to our ſhip. Being but a ſmall veſſel (ninety ton) we ſoon purchaſed our cargo, conſiſting of one hundred and ſeventy ſlaves, whom thou may'ſt reader range in thy view, as they were ſhackled two and two together, pent up within the narrow confines of the main deck, with the complicated diſtreſs of ſickneſs, chains and contempt; deprived of every fond and ſocial tie, and in a great meaſure reduced to a ſtate of deſperation. We had not been a fortnight at ſea, before the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this deſpair appeared; they formed a deſign of recovering their natural right, liberty, by raiſing and murdering every man on board; but the goodneſs of the Almighty rendered their ſcheme abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his mercy ſpared us to have time to repent: The plot was diſcovered; the ring-leader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at ſun riſe received a number of laſhes; in this ſituation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till ſun ſet, expoſed to the inſults and barbarity of the brutal crew of ſailors, with full leave to exerciſe their cruelty at pleaſure: The conſequence was, the next morning the miſerable ſufferer was found dead, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

who had ſouls immortal as your own. You have ſtowed them together as cloſe as ever they could lie, without any regard to decency or conveniency—And when many of them had been poiſoned by ſoul air, or had ſunk under various hardſhips, "you have ſeen their remains delivered to the deep, till the ſea ſhould give up his dead." You have carried the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivors into the vileſt ſlavery, never to end but with life: Such ſlavery as is not found among the Turks at Algiers, no, nor among the heathens in America.</p>
               <p>May I ſpeak plainly to you? I muſt. Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me: Love to you, as well as thoſe you are concerned with. Is there a God? You know there is. Is he a juſt God? Then there muſt be a ſtate of retribution: A ſtate wherein the juſt God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his work. Then what reward will he render to you. O think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times! before you drop into eternity: Think how, <q>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that ſhewed no mercy.</q> Are you a man? Then you
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018557_0024_0FA7B1D4F088F510"/>
ſhould have a human heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made of? Is there no ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as compaſſion there? Do you never feel ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pain? Have you no ſympathy? No ſenſe of human woe? No pity for the miſerable? When you ſaw the flowing eyes, the heaving breaſt, or the bleeding ſides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures. Was you a ſtone or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tyger? When you ſqueezed the agonizing creatures down in the ſhip, or when you threw their poor mangled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains into the ſea, had you no relentings? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one ſigh eſcape from your breaſt? Do you feel no relenting now? If you do not, you muſt go on till the meaſure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you, as you have dealt with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah

than for you: But if your heart does relent; though in a ſmall degree, know it is a call from the God of love. And to day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart—To-day reſolve, God being your helper to eſcape for your life—Regard not money: All that a man hath will he give for his life. Whatever you loſe, loſe not your ſoul; nothing can countervail that loſs. Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events be an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>This equally concerns every merchant who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſlave-trade. It is you that induce the African villain to ſell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to ſteal, rob, murder men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren without number: by enabling the Engliſh vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to pay him for ſo doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is your money, that is the ſpring of all, that impowers him to go on; ſo that whatever he or the African does in this matter, is all your act and deed. And is your conſcience quite reconciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your heart? Can you ſee, can you feel no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the caſe your own. <q>Maſter (ſaid a ſlave at Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool to the merchant that owned him) what if ſome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my miſtreſs, and maſter Tommy and maſter Billy, and carry them into our country and make them ſlaves, how would you like it?</q> His anſwer was worthy of a man: <q>I will never buy a ſlave more while I live.</q> O let his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution be yours! Have no more any part in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable buſineſs. Inſtantly leave it to thoſe unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretches, <q>who laugh at humanity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</q>

And this equally concerns every perſon who has an eſtate in our American plantations: Yea, all ſlave-holders of whatever rank and degree; ſeeing men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-ſtealers. Indeed, you ſay, <q>I pay honeſtly for my goods; and I am not concerned to know how they are come by.</q> Nay but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know that they are not ſtolen: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot honeſter than him. But you know they are not honeſtly come by: You know they are procured by means nothing near ſo innocent as picking of pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, houſe-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are procured by a deliberate ſeries of more complicated villainy (of fraud, robbery and murder) than was ever practiſed either by Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans or Pagans; in particular by murders of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is your money that pays the merchant, and through him the captain and African butchers. You therefore are guilty: Yea principally guilty, of all theſe frauds, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and murders. You are the ſpring that puts all the reſt in motion; they would not ſtir a ſtep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you—Therefore the blood of all theſe wretches, who die before their time, whether in their country or elſewhere, lies upon your head. The blood of thy brother (for whether thou wilt believe it or no, ſuch he is in the ſight of him that made him) crieth againſt thee from the earth, from the ſhip and from the waters. O! whatever it coſt, put a ſtop to its cry, before it be too late. Inſtantly, at any price, were it the half of thy goods, deliver thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from blood guiltineſs! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy houſe, thy land, are at preſent ſtained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018557_0027_0FA7B1E03A585B08"/>
no more guilt: Spill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to ſhed blood! Do not pay him for doing it! Whether thou art a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian or no, ſhew thyſelf a man; be not more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage than a lion or a bear.</p>
               <p>Perhaps thou wilt ſay, <q>I do not buy any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes: I only uſe thoſe left me by my father.</q> But is it enough to ſatisfy your own conſcience! Had your father, have you, has any living, a right to uſe another as a ſlave! It cannot be, even ſetting REVELATION aſide. It cannot be, that either war or contract, can give any man ſuch a property in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as he has in his ſheep and oxen: Much leſs is it poſſible, that any child of man, ſhould ever be born a ſlave. Liberty is the right of every human creature, as ſoon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he derives from the law of nature. If therefore you have any regard to juſtice, (to ſay nothing of mercy, nor of the revealed law of God) render unto all their due. Give liberty to whom liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none ſerve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice; away with whips, chains, and all compulſion. Be gentle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men. And ſee that you invariably do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one, as you would he ſhould do unto you.</p>
