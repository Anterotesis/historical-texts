            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE very flattering Reception my <hi>Hiſtory of the Roman Commonwealth</hi> has received, has encouraged me to attempt, on the ſame plan, and with the ſame views, A Hiſtory of the Grecian States: thoſe States which, though inconſiderable in their extent, gave law to the ſurrounding nations, and brought ſavage man, who till then wandered in the wilds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and barbarity, into the pale of civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forced the rude cuſtoms of ſavages to yield to the refinements of the polite arts and ſciences. Though her loſty domes are now no longer viſible, though her ſtately and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent cities have been long ſince levelled with the earth, and the martial ſpirit has ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt on Grecian ſoil; yet the deeds of her Heroes, Legiſlators, and Philoſophers, will die only with Time itſelf.</p>
            <p>After what has been advanced in the Preface to my Roman Hiſtory, little need further be ſaid in apology for this publication. I ſhall, therefore, only juſt mention the three heroes of my Frontiſpiece.</p>
            <p>HOMER was the moſt celebrated and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the Poets of antiquity; and yet we are not certain of what part of Greece he was a native; nor do we know exactly the time of his birth, though he is generally ſuppoſed to have lived about eight hundred and forty years before Chriſt. No nation in the world has produced poems comparable to his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:026819_0004_1013717E78D06F00"/>
XENOPHON was ſo celebrated a Greek Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that they called him the <hi>Attic Bee.</hi> He was a ſcholar of Socrates, and no leſs the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior than the ſcholar. He wrote ſeveral books, of which ſome are ſtill in being, and their ſtile is conſidered as a maſter piece. His Cyropae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, which he dedicated to Cyrus, has not its equal.</p>
            <p>The character of DEMOSTHENES, the moſt celebrated Athenian Orator, will be found in different parts of this work. We have here only to add, that, when Antipater ſucceeded Alexander, he fled to ſave his life; and, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to avoid falling into his enemy's hands, he ſwallowed poiſon, which he had prepared and kept for that purpoſe in his pen, and ſo ended his days.</p>

               <p>GREECE, in its earlieſt infancy, was a combination of little ſtates, each governed by its reſpective ſovereign, yet all uniting for their mutual ſafety and general advantage. Their inteſtine contentions, however, were carried on with great animoſity; and, as it happens in all petty ſtates under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a ſingle commander, the jealouſies of the princes were a continual cauſe of diſcord. From this diſtreſsful ſituation, thoſe ſtates, by degrees, began to emerge; a different ſpirit began to ſeize the people, and, ſick of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of their princes, they deſired to be free. A ſpirit of liberty prevailed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> over Greece, and a general change of government was effected in every part of the country, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Macedonia. Thus monarchy gave way to a republican government, which, however, was diverſified into as many various forms as there were different cities, according to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar character of each people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026819_0010_1013719D992D9A38"/>
Though theſe cities ſeemed to differ from each other in their laws and intereſts, yet they were united by one common language, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a national pride, that taught them even to conſider all other nations as barbarous and feeble. Even Egypt itſelf, from whence they had derived many of their arts and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, was conſidered in a very ſubordinate light. To make this union among the ſtates of Greece ſtill ſtronger, there were games in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in different parts of the country, with rewards for excellence in every purſuit. Theſe ſports were inſtituted for very ſerious and uſeful purpoſes: they afforded an opportunity for the ſeveral ſtates meeting together; they gave them a greater real for their common religion; they exerciſed the youths for the purpoſes of war, and encreaſed that vigour and activity, which were then of the utmoſt importance in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fate of a battle.</p>
               <p>Their chief bond of union, however, aroſe from the council of the Amphictyons, which was inſtituted by Amphictyon, king of Athens, about the year 2500, and was appointed to be heid twice a year at Thermopylae, to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for the general good of thoſe ſtates, of whoſe deputies it was compoſed. The ſtates, who ſent deputies to this council, were twelve, namely, the Theſſalians, the Thebans, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Ionians, the Perhaabeans, the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, the Locrians, the Oetans, the Pthiotes, the Maleans, the Phocians, and the Delopians. Each of theſe cities, which had a right to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the Amphictyonic council, was obliged
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026819_0011_1013719F65B8D858"/>to ſend two deputies to every meeting. The one was entitled the Hieroumuemon, who took care of the intereſts of religion; the other was called the Pylagoras, and had in charge the civil intereſts of his community.</p>
               <p>This confederacy united the Greeks for a time into a body of great power, and greater emulation. By this aſſociation, a country, not half ſo large as England, was able to diſpute the empire of the earth with the moſt powerful monarchs of the world; by this aſſociation, they not only made head againſt the numerous armies of Perſia, but diſperſed, routed, and deſtroyed them, reducing their pride ſo low, as to make them ſubmit to conditions of peace, as ſhameful to the conquered as glorious to the conquerors. But, among all the cities of Greece there were two, which by their merit, their valour, and their wiſdom, particularly diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the reſt: the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Though the kingdom of Lacedaemon was not ſo conſiderable as that of Athens, yet, as it was of much earlier inſtitution, it deſerves our firſt attention.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026819_0012_101371A48961EE88"/>diſcipline were at laſt impoſed upon it by Licurgus, one of the firſt and moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary legiſlators that ever appeared among mankind. There is perhaps nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in profane hiſtory, yet nothing ſo well atteſted, as what relates to the laws and government of Lycurgus. What indeed can be more amazing, than to behold a mutinous and ſavage race of mankind yielding ſubmiſſion to laws, that controuled every ſenſual pleaſure, and every private affection! To behold them give up for the good of the ſtate, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and conveniences of private life, and making a ſtate of domeſtic privacy more ſevere and terrible, than the moſt painful campaigns and the moſt warlike duties! Yet all this was effected by the perſeverance and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a ſingle legiſlator, who gave the firſt leſſons of hard reſignation in his own generous examples.</p>
               <p>Lycurgus was the ſon of Eunomus, one of the two kings who reign e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> together in Sparta: During the minority of Charilaus, Licurgus act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as regent: but reſolving to make himſelf acquainted with all the improvements of other nations, he travelled into Crete, paſſed over into Aſia, and from thence went into Egypt. But while he was thus employed abroad, his preſence was greatly wanted at home, where every thing was haſtening to anarchy and ruin. On his return, he found the people wearied out with their own importunities, and ready to receive any new impreſlious he might attempt. He firſt communicated his deſign of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026819_0013_101371A867E5A368"/>altering the whole code of laws to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friends, and then by degrees gained over the leading men to his party, until things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ripe for a change, he ordered thirty of the principal men to appear armed in the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. Charilus, who was at this time king, at firſt oppoſed the revolution, but was ſoon perſuaded to join in the meaſure.</p>
               <p>To continue the kings ſtill with a ſhadow of power, he confirmed them in their rights of ſucceſſion as before; but diminiſhed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by inſtituting a ſenate, which was to ſerve as a counterpoiſe between the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and the people. The kings however, had ſtill all their former marks of outward dignity and reſpect. The government hitherto had been unſteady, tending at one time towards deſpotiſm, at another to democracy; but the ſenate inſtituted by Lycurgus ſerved as a check upon both, and kept the ſtate balanced in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</p>
               <p>To keep the people in plenty and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſeems to have been one of the moſt re fined ſtrokes in this philoſopher's legiſlation. The generality of people were at that time ſo poor, that they were deſtitute of every kind of poſſeſſion, while a ſmall member of individuals were poſſeſſed of all the lands and the wealth of the country. In order, therefore, to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the inſolence, the fraud. and the luxury of the one, as well as the miſery, the repining, and the factious deſpair of the other, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them majority, and forced the reſt, to give up all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and to the commonwealth, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026819_0014_101371AA5C2ED418"/>to make a new diviſion of them, that they might all live together in perfect equality. Thus all the ſenſual goods of life were diſtributed among the governors and the governed, and ſuperior merit alone conferred ſuperior diſtinction.</p>
               <p>It would, however, have anſwered no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent purpoſe to divide the lands, if the money had been ſtill ſuffered to accumulate. To prevent, therefore, all other diſtinctions but that of merit, he reſolved to level down all fortune to one ſtandard. He did not, indeed, ſtrip thoſe poſſeſſed of gold or ſilver of their property; but, what was equivalent, he cried down its value, and ſuffered nothing but iron money to paſs in exchange for every commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. This coin alſo he made ſo heavy, and fixed at ſo low a rate, that a cart and two even were required to carry home a ſum equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to twenty pounds Engliſh, and a whole houſe was neceſſary to keep it in. By theſe means, money was ſoon brought into diſuſe, and few troubled themſelves with more than was ſufficient to ſupply their neceſſaries. Thus not only riches, but their attendant train of avarice, fraud, rapine, and luxury, were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from this ſimple fiare.</p>
               <p>Even theſe inſtitutions were not thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent that tendency, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have to private exceſs. A third regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was therefore made, commanding that all meals ſhould be in public. He ordained, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026819_0015_101371AE228E7368"/>a law was expreſsly made againſt their entrance into the city. By theſe means, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality was not only made neceſſary, but the uſe of riches was at once aboliſhed.

               <p>So rigorous an injunction, which thus out off all the delicaries and refinements of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, was by no means pleaſing to the rich, who took every occaſion to inſult the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver on his new regulations.

               <p>Thus undaunted by oppoſition, and ſteady in his deſigns, he went on to make reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the manners of his country <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As the education of youth was one of the moſt important objects of a legiſlator's care, he firſt inſtituted, that ſuch children as, upon a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view were deemed deformed or weekly, and unfitted for a future liſt of vigout and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026819_0016_101371B5559596C8"/>ſhould be expoſed to periſh in a cavern near mount Taygetus. Thoſe infants that were born without any capital defects, were adopted as children of the ſtate, and delivered to their parents to be nurſed with ſeverity and hardſhip. From their tendereſt age, they were accuſtomed to make no choice in their eating, nor to be afraid in the dark, or when left alone; not to be peeviſh or fretful, to walk barefoot, to lie hard at nights, to wear the ſame cloathes winter and ſummer, and to fear nothing from their equals. At the age of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they were taken from their parents, and delivered over to the claſſes for their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their diſcipline there was little elſe than an apprenticeſhip to hardſhip, ſelf-denial, and obedience.</p>
               <p>All oſtentatious learning was baniſhed from this ſimple common wealth: their only ſtudy was to obey, their only pride was to ſuffer hardſhips. There was yearly a cuſtom of whipping them at the altar of Diana, and the boy that bore this puniſhment with the greateſt fortitude came off victorious. Every inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed calculated to harden the body, and ſharpen the mind for war. In order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for ſtratagems and ſudden incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the boys were permitted to ſteal from each other; but, if they were caught in the fact, they were puniſhed for their want of dexterity.</p>
               <p>At twelve years old, the boys were removed into another claſs of a more advanced kind. There, in order to cruſh the ſeeds of vice
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026819_0017_101371B730088240"/>which at that time began to appear, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and diſcipline were encreaſed with their age. They had now their ſkirmiſhes between parties, and their mock fights between larger bodies. In theſe they often fought with hands, feet, teeth, and nails with ſuch obſtinacy, that it was common to ſee them loſe their eyes, and often their lives, before the fray was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Such was the conſtant diſcipline of their minority, which laſted till the age of thirty, before which they were not permitted to marry, to go into the troops, or to bear any office in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>With regard to the virgins, their diſcipline was equally ſtrict with the former. They were inured to a conſtant courſe of labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, until they were twenty years old, before which time they were not allowed to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable.</p>
               <p>Valour and generoſity ſeemed the ruling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this new inſtitution; arms were their only exerciſe and employment, and their life was much leſs auſtere in the camp than in the city. The Spartans were the only people in the world, to whom the time of war was a time of eaſe and refreſhment; becauſe then the ſeverity of their manners was relaxed, and the men were indulged in greater liberties. With them the firſt principles of war was never to turn their backs on their enemies, however diſproportioned in forces, not to deliver up their arms until they reſigned them with life.</p>
               <p>Such was the general purport of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rgus, which from their tendency
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026819_0018_101371BB63DB2B30"/>gained the eſteem and admiration of all the ſurrounding nations. The Greeks were ever apt to be dazzled rather with ſplendid than uſeful virtues, and praiſed the laws of Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, which at beſt were calculated rather to make men warlike than happy, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute inſenſibility inſtead of enjoyment.</p>
               <p>When Lycurgus had thus compleated his military inſtitution, and when the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he had eſtabliſhed ſeemed ſtrong and vigorous enough to ſupport itſelf, his next care was to give it all the permanence in his power. He therefore ſignified to the people, that ſomething ſtill remained for the completion of his plan, and that he was under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of going to conſult the oracle of Delphos for its advice. In the mean time, he perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to take an oath, for the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of all his laws until his return, and then departed with a full reſolution of never ſeeing Sparta more. When he was arrived at Delphos, he conſulted the oracle, to know whether the laws he had made were ſufficient to render the Lacedaemonians happy; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwered, that nothing was wanting to their perfection, he ſent this anſwer to Sparta, and then voluntarily ſtarved himſelf to death-Others ſay he died in Crete, ordering his body to be burnt, and his aſhes to be thrown into the ſea. The death of this great lawgiver gave a ſanction and authority to his laws, which his life was m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026819_0019_101371BCF3A96720"/>his former ſervices. They built a temple, and paid divine honours to him after his death; they conſidered themſelves as bound by every tie of gratitude and religion to a ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of all his inſtitutions; and the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Spartan government is a proof of their perſevering reſolution.</p>

               <p>THE Athenians having, for more than a century, ſeen the good effects of laws in the regulation of the Spartan commonwealth, about the year 3380, became deſirous of being governed by written laws. They pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Draco, a man of acknowledged wiſdom and unſhaken integrity, but rigid even beyond human ſufferance. Draco not ſucceeding in this buſineſs, Solon was applied to for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſſiſtance, as he was the wiſeſt and juſteſt man in all Athens. His great learning had acquired him the reputation of being the firſt of the ſeven wiſe men of Greece, and his known humanity procured him the love and veneration of every rank among his fellow ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Solon was a native of Salamis, an iſland dependent on Athens, but which had revolted to put itſelf under the power of the Megareans. In attempting to recover this iſland, the Athenians had ſpent much blood and treaſure, until at laſt v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>, a law was made, rendering it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026819_0020_101371BEA56D4898"/>capital ever to adviſe the recovery of their loſt poſſeſſion. Solon, however, undertook to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to another trial; and, feigning himſelf mad, he ran about the ſtreets, uſing the moſt violent geſtures and language; but the purport of all was, to upbraid the Athenians for their remiſſneſs and effeminacy, in giving up their conqueſts in deſpair. In ſhort, he acted his part ſo well, by the oddity of his manners, and the ſtrength of his reaſoning, that the people roſolved on another expedition againſt Salamais; and, by a ſtratagem of his contrivance, in which he introduced ſeveral young men upon the iſland in women's cloaths, the place was ſurpriſed, and added to the dominion of Athens.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only occaſion, on which he exhibited ſuperior addreſs and wiſdom. At a time when Greece had carried the arts of eloquence, poetry, and government, higher than they had yet been ſeen among mankind, Solon was conſidered as one of the foremoſt in each perfection. The ſages of Greece, whoſe ſame is ſtill undiminiſhed, acknowledged his merit, and adopted him as their aſſociate. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between theſe wiſe men was at once inſtructive, friendly, and ſincere. They were ſeven in number, namely, Thales the Mileſian, Solon of Athens, Chilo of Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Pittacus of Mitylene, Periander of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Bias and Cleobulus, whoſe birth-places are not aſcertained.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſages often viſited each other, and their converſations generally turned upon the
<pb facs="unknown:026819_0021_101371C1A87CFD80"/>methods of inſtituting the beſt form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the arts of private happineſs. One day, when Solon went to Miletus to ſee Thales, the firſt thing he ſaid, was to expreſs his ſurpriſe that Thales had never deſired to marry, or have children. Thales made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then, but a few days after contrived that a ſtranger, ſuppoſed to arrive from Athens, ſhould join their company. Solon, hearing from whence the ſtranger came, was inquiſitive after the news of his own city, but was only informed, that a young man died there, for whom the whole place was in the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as he was reputed the moſt promiſing y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

"I heard the name, (replied the ſtranger, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for the occaſion) but I have forgotten it: I only remember, that all people talked much of his wiſdom and juſtice." Every an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer afforded new matter of trouble and terror to the inquiſitive father, and he had juſt ſtrength enough to aſk, if the youth was the ſon of Solon. "The very ſame," replied the ſtranger; at which words Solon ſhe wed all the marks of the moſt inconſolable diſtreſs. This was the opportunity which Thales wanted, who took him by the hand, and ſaid to him with a ſmile, "Comfort yourſelf, my friend, all that has been told you is a mere fiction, but may ſerve as a very proper anſwer to your queſtion, why I never thought proper to marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One day, at the court of Periander of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026819_0022_101371C8692A8B30"/>a queſtion was propoſed, "Which was the moſt perfect popular government?" "That (ſaid Bias) where the laws have no ſuperior."

"That (ſaid Chilo) where the laws are more regarded than the orators." But Solon's opinion ſeems to have the greateſt weight, who ſaid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon a certain occaſion, when Solon was converſing with Anacharſia, the Scythian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolopher, about his intended reformation in the ſtate, "Alas (cried the Scythian) all your laws will be found to reſemble ſpiders webs: the weak and ſmall flies will be caught and entangled, but the great and powerful will always have ſtrength enough to break through."</p>
               <p>A matter ſtill more celebrated is Solon's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Croeſus, king of Lydia. This monarch, who was reputed the richeſt of all Aſia Minor, was willing to make an oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſplay of his wealth before the Greek philoſopher, and after ſhewing him immenſe heaps of treaſures, and the greateſt variety of other ornaments, he demanded, whether he did not think the poſſeſſor of them the moſt happy
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026819_0023_101371CA00D48258"/>of all mankind. "No, (replied Solon) I know one more happy, a poor peaſant of Greece, who, neither in affluence nor in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, has but few wants, and has learned to ſupply them by his labour." This anſwer was by no means agreeable to the vain monarch, who by this queſtion hoped only for a reply that would tend to flatter his pride. Willing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to extort one ſtill more favourable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e aſked, whether, at leaſt, he did not think him happy. "Alas! (cried Solon) what man can be pronounced happy before he dies!" The integrity and the wiſdom of Solon's replies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>invaded by Cyrus, the empire deſtroyed, and Croeſus himſelf was taken priſoner. When he was led out to execution, according to the barbarous manner of the times, he then too late recollected the maxims of Solon, and could not help crying out when on the ſcaffold upon Solon's name. Cyrus, hearing him repeat the name with great earneſtneſs, was deſirous of knowing the reaſon: and being informed by Croeſus of that philoſopher's remarkable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, he began to fear for himſelf, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Croeſus, and took him for the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confidence and friendſhip. Thus Solon had the merit of ſaving one king's life, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming another.</p>
               <p>Such was the man, to whom Athens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for aſſiſtance in reforming the ſeverity of their government, and inſtituting a juſt body of law. His firſt attempt was, therefore, in ſavour of the poor, whoſe deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026819_0024_101371CDF704AFB0"/>at once, by an expreſs law of inſolvency. His next ſtep was to repeal all the laws enacted by Draco, except thoſe againſt murder. He then proceeded to the regulation of offices, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and magiſtrates, all which he left in the hands of the rich; and he diſtributed the rich into three claſſes, ranging them according to their incomes. The Areopagus, ſo called from the place where the court was held, had been eſtabliſhed ſome centuries before, but So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon reſtored and augmented its authority. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo auguſt as this court, and its repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for judgment and integrity became ſo very great, that the Romans ſometimes referr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cauſes, which were too intricate for their own deciſion, to the determination of this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. Nothing was regarded here but truth: that no external objects might pervert juſtice, the tribunal was held in darkneſs, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates were denied all attempts to work upon the paſſions of the judges. Superior to this, Solon inſtituted the great council of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who were to judge upon appeals from the Areopagus, and maturely to examine every queſtion before it came to be debated in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly of the people.</p>
               <p>He aboliſhed the cuſtom of giving portions in marriage with young women, unleſs they were only daughters. The bride was to carry no other fortune to her huſband than three ſuits of clothes, and ſome houſehold goods of little value. It was his aim to prevent making matrimony a traffic: he conſidered it as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable connection, calculated for the mutual
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026819_0025_101371CF8A78A230"/>hapineſs of both parties, and the general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the principal inſtitutions of this celebrated lawgiver, and though neither ſo ſtriking, nor yet ſo well authoriſed as thoſe of Lycurgus, they did not fail to operate for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſucceeding ages, and ſeemed to gather ſtrength by obſervance. In order to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his ſtatutes, he engaged the people by a public oath to obſerve them religiouſly, at leaſt for the term of an hundred years: and thus, having completed the taſk aſſigned him, he withdrew from the city, to avoid the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſome, and the captious petulence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for, as he well knew, it was hard, if not impoſſible, to pleaſe every individual. Solon being now employed on his travels in viſiting Egypt. Lydia, and ſeveral other countries, left Athens to become habituated to his new inſtitutions, and to try by experience the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their formation.</p>
               <p>While Solon was thus on his travels, civil contenſions diſturbed Athens, and the ſpirit of party was haſtening every thing to ruin. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten years abſence, Solon returned to Athens, and found the city involved in ſlavery. Piſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratus had procured himſelf a guard formed of his own creatures, who at length ſeized on the citidel, while none were left, who had ſufficient courage or conduct to oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>In this general conſternation, which was the reſult of folly on the one hand, and treachery on the other, the whole city was one ſcene of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026819_0026_101371D42EE470B8"/>complaining, others preparing for ſlavery with patient ſubmiſſion. Solon was the only man, who, without fear or ſhrinking, deplored the folly of the times, and reproached the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians with their cowardice and treachery. "You might with eaſe (ſaid he) have cruſhed the tyrant in his bud; but nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but to pluck him up by the roots. As for myſelf, I have at leaſt the ſatisfaction of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged my duty to my country and the laws: as for the reſt, I have nothing to fear; and now, upon the deſtruction of my country, my only confidence is in my great age, which gives me the hopes of not being a long ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor." In fact, he did not ſurvive the liberty of his country above two years; he died at Cyprus, in the eightieth year of his age, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and admired by every ſtate of Greece. Beſides his ſkill in legiſlation, Solon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marakble for ſeveral other ſhining qualities: he was maſter of eloquence in ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that from him Cicero dates the origin of oratory in Athens. He was alſo ſucceſsful in poetry; and Plato aſſerts, that it was only for want of due application, that he did not come to diſpute the prize with Homer himſelf.</p>

               <p>FROM the death of Solon, to about the year of the world 3500, Athens continued to be the ſcene of party cabals, and uſurped
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026819_0027_101371D5DBF7A718"/>tyranny; but, about this period, two young citizens began to diſtinguiſh themſelves at Athens, namely Ariſtides and Themiſtocles. Theſe youths were of very different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but from this difference reſulted the greateſt advantages to their country. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles was naturally inclined to a popular government, and omitted nothing that could render him agreeable to the public, or gain him friends. His complaiſance was boundleſs, and his deſire to oblige ſometimes outſtepped the bounds of duty. His partiality was often conſpicuous. Ariſtides was remarkable for his juſtice and integrity. Being a favourer of ariſtocracy, in imitation of Lycurgus, he was friendly, but never at the expence of juſtice-In ſeeking honours, he ever declined the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his friends, leſt they ſhould, in turn, demand his intereſt when his duty was to be impartial. The love of the public good was the great ſpring of all his actions, and with that in view no difficulties could daunt, no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or elevation exalt him. On all occaſions he preſerved his uſual calmneſs of temper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded, that he was entirely his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's, and very little his own.</p>
               <p>At this time, Darius, king of Perſia, was turning his arms againſt Greece, while theſe illuſtrious Athenians were inſpiring their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens with a noble confidence in their bravery, and made every preparation for the expected invaſion, which prudence and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate valour could ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:026819_0028_101371D8A37D4808"/>
In the mean time, Darius' generals made themſelves maſters of the iſlands in the Aegean ſea, and laid ſiege to Eretria, which they at laſt took by ſtorm, owing to the treachery of ſome of the principal inhabitants. The town was plundered and burnt, and the inhabitants put in chains, and ſent as the firſt fruits of war to the Perſian monarch; but he, contrary to their expectations, treated them with great jenity, and gave them a village in the country of Ciſſa to live in.</p>
               <p>This was ſoon followed by the battle of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon, the firſt great battle the Greeks had ever engaged in. It was not like any of their former conteſts ariſing from jealouſy, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in an eaſy accommodation: it was a battle that was to be decided with the greateſt monarch of the earth. This was an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was to decide the liberty of Greece, and, what was of infinitely greater moment, the future progreſs of refinement among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Upon the event of this battle depended the complexion, which the manners of the Weſt were hereafter to aſſume, whether they were to adopt Aſiatic cuſtoms with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, or to go on in modelling themſelves upon Grecian refinements. This therefore may be conſidered as one of the moſt important bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that ever was fought, and the event was as little to be expected as the ſucceſs was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Miltiodes, who was now inveſted with the ſupreme command of the Greek army, like au experienced general, endeavoured, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026819_0029_101371DE14750B98"/>of his ground, to make up for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in ſtrength and number, his whole army conſiſting but of ten thouſand. He was ſenſible, that by extending his front to oppoſe the enemy, he muſt weaken it too much, and give their denſe body the advantage. He therefore drew up his army at the foot of a mountain, ſo that the enemy ſhould not ſurround him, or charge him in the rear. On the flanks, on either ſide, becauſed large trees to be thrown, which were cut down for that purpoſe, and theſe ſerved to guard him from the Perſian ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, that generally wheeled on the flank in the heat of an engagement. Datis, the Perſian general, was ſenſible of this advantageous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but relying on his ſuperiority of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and unwilling to wait till Miltiades ſhould receive reinforcements, he determined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
               <p>The ſignal was no ſooner given than the Athenians, without waiting the Perſian onſet, ruſhed in upon their ranks with deſperate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, as if wholly regardleſs of ſafety. The Perſians conſidered this firſt ſtep of the Athen: ans as the reſult of madneſs, and were more inclined to deſpiſe them as maniacs. than op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as ſoldiers. However, they were quickly undeceived. It had never been the cuſtom of the Grecks to run on with this head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long valour; but comparing the number of their own forces with that of the enemy and expecting ſafety only from raſhneſs, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to break through the enemy's ranks, or fall in the attempt. The greatneſs of their
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026819_0030_10137220CF70BE58"/>danger added to their courage, and deſpair did the reſt. The Perſians, however, ſtood their ground with great intrepidity, and the battle was long, fierce, and obſtinate. Miltiades had made the wings of his army exceedingly ſtrong, but had left the main body weaker, and not ſo deep; for having but ten thouſand men to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a numerous army, be ſuppoſed the victory could be obtained by no other means than by ſtrengthening his flanks. He doubted not but that, when his wings were once victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, they would be able to wheel upon the enemy's main body on either ſide, and then eaſily rout them. The Perſians, therefore, finding the main body weakeſt, attacked it with their utmoſt vigour. It was in vain that Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides and Themiſtocles, who were ſtationed in this poſt of danger, endeavoured to keep their troops to the charge: courage and intrepidity were unable to reſiſt the torrent of encreaſing numbers, ſo that they were at laſt obliged to give ground. In the mean time the wings were victorious; and now, juſt as the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was fainting under the unequal encounter, theſe ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder was now univerſal, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians followed them to the beach, and ſet many of their ſhips on fire.</p>

On this occaſion it was that Cyndoeyrus, the brother of the poet Aeſchylus, ſeized with his hand one of the ſhips that the enemy was puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from the ſhore. The Perſians within, ſeeing themſelves thus ſtopped, cut off his right hand that held the prow; he then laid hold of it with his left, which they alſo cut off; at laſt, he ſeized it with his teeth, and in that manner expired.</p>
               <p>Seven of the enemy's ſhips were taken, above ſix thouſand Perſians were ſlain, without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who were drowned in the ſea as they endeavored to eſcape, or thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed when the ſhips were ſet on fire. Of the Greeks, not above two hundred men were killed, among whom was Callimachus, who gave his vote for bringing on the engagement. The Perſian forces, before the battle, couſiſted of ſix hundred ſhips, and an army of an hundred and twenty thouſand men. Their inſtructions were, to give up Athens to be plundered, to burn all the houſes and temples and to lead away all the inhabitants into ſlavery. The country was to be laid deſolate, and the army was provided with chains and fetters for bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conquered nations.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the famous battle of Marathon, which the Perſians were ſo ſure of gaining, that they had brought marble into the field, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to erect a trophy there. This battle was fought in the year of the world 3514.</p>
               <p>A part of the army, immediately after the battle, marched forward to Athens, to protect it from any attemps the enemy might make,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026819_0033_101371EA908BEE70"/>which proved a very prudent meaſure; for the Perſian fleet, inſtead of ſailing directly back to Aſia, made an attempt to ſurpriſe Athens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſuppoſed the Greek troops could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from Marathon. The Athenian troops, however, took the precaution to move directly thither, and performed their march with ſo much expedition, that, though it was forty miles from Marathon, they arrived there in one day. In this manner the Greeks not only expelled their enemies, but confirmed their ſecurity. By this victory, the Grecians were taught to know their own ſtrength, and not to tremble before an enemy only terrible in name.</p>
               <p>The gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades ſpoke a nobleneſs of mind, that far ſurpaſſed expenſive triumphs, or baſe adulation. Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his merits were too great for money to repay, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>uſed a picture to be painted by Polygnotus, one of their moſt celebrated artiſts, in which Miltiades was repreſented, at the head of the ten commanders, exhorting the ſoldiers, and ſetting them an example of their duty. This picture was preſerved for many ages, with other paintings of the beſt maſters, in the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico where Zeno afterwards inſtituted his ſchool of philoſophy. Every officer, as well as private ſoldier, who fell in this battle, had a monument erected to his memory on the plains of Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</p>
               <p>Though the gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades was very ſincere, yet it was of no long continuance. This fickle and jealous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, naturally capricious and now more than
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026819_0034_101371EE94BB6F20"/>ever careful of preſerving their freedom, were willing to take every opportunity of mortifying a general, from whoſe merit they had much to fear. Being appointed, with ſeventy ſhips, to puniſh thoſe iſlands that had favoured the Perſian invaſion, he ſailed to Paros, and inveſted that place. Here, having broken his thigh by an accident, he was obliged to raiſe the ſiege, and return home. On his arrival at Athens, the whole city began to murmur, and he was accuſed of having taken a bribe from Perſia. As he was not in a condition to anſwer this charge, being confined to his bed by the wound he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at Paros, the accuſation took place againſt him, and he was condemned to loſe his life. However, in conſideration of his former ſervices, his ſentence was commuted into a penalty of fifty talents, the ſum which it had coſt the ſtate in fitting out the late unſucceſsful expedition. Not being rich enough to pay this ſum, he was thrown into priſon, where his wound growing worſe, from bad air and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, it turned at laſt to a gangrene, and put an end to his life and misfortunes. Thus periſhed a man, who has been very juſtly praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his condeſcenſion, moderation, and juſtice. To him Athens was indebted for all its glory, he being the man who firſt taught her to deſpiſe the empty menaces of the boaſtful Perſians. Cimon, his ſon, who was at this time very young, ſignalized his piety on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As this ungrateful city would not permit the body of Milt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DARIUS, king of perſia, died amidſt the preparations he was making for a ſecond expedition into Greece; but he was ſucceeded by a ſon, who inherited all his ambition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhare of his abilities. He was a young man, ſurrounded by flatterers, and naturally vain and ſuperficial. Having drained all the Eaſt to compoſe his own army, and the Weſt to ſupply thoſe of the Carthagenians, who were come to his aid, he ſet out from Suca, in order to enter on this war, ten years after the battle of Marathon, and in the year of the world 3523.</p>
               <p>Sardis was the place, where the various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were compelled to his banner were to aſſemble. His fleet was to advance along the coaſt of Aſia Minor towards the Helleſpont; but as, in doubling the cape of Mount Athos, many ſhips were detained, he was reſolved to cut a paſſage through that neck of land, which joined the mount to the continent, and thus gave his ſhipping a ſhorter and ſafer paſſage. This canal was a mile and a half long, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out from a high mountain. It required immenſe labour to perform ſo great a work: but his numbers and his ambition were ſufficient to ſurmount all difficulties. To urge on
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026819_0036_101371F392F23C28"/>the undertaking the faſter, he treated his labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the greateſt ſeverity; while, with all the oſtentation of an eaſtern prince, he gave his commands to the mountains to ſink before him: "Athos, (ſaid he) thou proud aſpiring moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that lifteſt up thy head unto the heavens, be not ſo audacious as to put obſtacles in my way. If thou giveſt them that oppoſition, I will cut thee level to the plain, and throw thee headlong into the ſea!"</p>
               <p>Early in the ſpring, he directed his march down towards the Helleſpont, where his fleet lay in all their pomp, expecting his arrival. Here he was deſirous of taking a ſurvey of all his forces, which compoſed an army that was never equalled either before or ſince. It was compoſed of the moſt powerful nations of the Eaſt, and of people ſcarce known to poſterity, except by name. The remoteſt India contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted its ſupplies, while the coldeſt tracts of Scythia ſent their aſſiſtance. Medes, Perſians, Bactirans, Lydians, Aſſyrians, Hyrcanians, and an hundred other countries of various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, languages, dreſſes, and arms. The land army, which he brought out of Aſia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſeventeen hundred thouſand foot, and fourſcore thouſand horſe. Three hundred thouſand more that were added upon croſſing the Helleſpont, made all his land forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amount to above two millions of men. His fleet, when it ſet out from Aſia, conſiſted of twelve hundred and ſeven veſſels, each car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying two hundred men. The Europeans augmented his fleet with an hundred and twenty
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026819_0037_101371F69C50BFB0"/>veſſels, each of which carried two hundred men. Beſides theſe, there were a thouſand ſmaller veſſels, fitted for carrying proviſions and ſtores. The men contained in theſe, with the former, amounded to ſix hundred thouſand: ſo that the whole army might be ſaid to amount to two millions and a half, which, with the women, ſlaves, and ſettlers, always accompanying a Perſian army, might make the whole above five millions of ſouls. Such was the ſtate of this proud monarch's forces.</p>
               <p>Lord of ſo many and ſuch various ſubjects, Xerxes found apleaſure in reviewing his forces: beholding all the earth covered with his troops, and all the ſea crouded with his veſſels, he felt a ſecret joy diffuſe itſelf through his frame, from the conſciouſneſs of his own ſuperior power. But all the workings of this monarch's mind were in extreme: a ſudden ſadneſs ſoon took place of his pleaſure, and diſſolving into a ſnower of tears, he give himſelf up to the reflection, that not one of ſo many thouſands would be alive an hundred years after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Xerxes had given orders for building a bridge of boats acroſs the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont, for the tranſporting of his army into Europe. This narrow ſtrait, which now goes by the name of the Dardanelles, is near an Engliſh mile over. However, ſoon after the completion of this work, a violent ſtorm ariſing, the whole was broken and deſtroyed, and the labour was to be undertaken anew. The fury of Xerxes, upon this diſappointment, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with equal extravagance and cruelty.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026819_0038_101371F85410E6E0"/>His vengeance knew no bounds, the workmen who had undertaken the taſk, had their heads ſtruck off by his order; and that the ſea alſo might know its duty, he ordered it to be laſhed as a delinquent, and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it, to curb its future irregularities. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus given vent to his abſurd reſentment, two bridges were ordered to be built in the place of the former, one for the army to paſs over, and the other for the baggage and beaſts of burden. The workment, now warned by the fate of their predeceſſors, undertook to give their labours greater ſtability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t they placed three hundred and ſixty veſſels acroſs the ſtrait, ſome of them having three banks of oars, and others fifty oars a-piece. They then caſt large anchors on both ſides into the water, in order to fix thoſe veſſels againſt the violence of the winds and current. They then drove large piles into the earth, with huge rings faſtened to them, to which were tied ſix vaſt cables, which went over each of the two bridges.— Over all theſe they laid trunks of trees, cut purpoſely for that uſe, and flat boats over them, faſtened and joined together, ſo as to ſerve for a floor, or ſolid bottom. When the whole work was thus completed, a day was appointed for their paſſing over; and as ſoon as the firſt rays of the ſun began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſweet odours of all kinds were abundantly ſcattered over the new work, and the way was ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed with myrtle. At the ſame time, Xerxes, turning bis face tow-res the eaſt, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the ſun, which is the god of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026819_0039_101371FCD2BCFF40"/>Then, throwing his libations into the ſea, together with a golden cup and Perſian ſcyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tar, he went forwards, and gave orders for the army to follow. This immenſe train were no leſs than ſeven days and ſeven nights paſſing over, while thoſe who were appointed to conduct the march, quickened the troops by laſhing them along; for the ſoldiers of the Eaſt, at that time, and to this day, are treated like ſlaves. Thus this immenſe army having landed in Europe, and being joined by the ſeveral Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations that acknowledged the Perſian power, Xerxes prepared for marching directly forward into Greece.</p>
               <p>He continued his march through Thrace, Macedonia, and Theſſaly, every knee bending before him till he came to the ſtraits of Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylae, where he firſt found an enemy prepared to diſpute his paſſage. This army was a body of Spartans, led on by Leonidas their king, who had been ſent thither to oppoſe him. None of the Grecian ſtates were found bold enough to face this formidable army but Athens and Lacodaemon. One cannot, without aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, reflect on the intrepidity of theſe two ſtates, who determined to face the innumerable army of Xerxes with ſuch diſproportioned forces. Their whole army amounted to only eleven thouſand two hundred men. Ariſtides was called from baniſhment, and placed at the head of their forces.</p>
               <p>It was ſoon reſolved to ſend a body of men to guard the paſs at Thirmopylae, where a few would be capable of acting againſt numbers. Thirmopylae was a narrow paſs of twenty five
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026819_0040_1013720207F500A8"/>feet broad, between Theſſaly and Phocis, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the remains of a wall, with gates to it. This place was pitched upon, as well for the narrowneſs of the way, as for its vicinity to the ſea, from whence the land forces could oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally receive aſſiſtance from the fleet. The command of this important paſs was given to Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta, who led thither a body of ſix thouſand men. They were all along taught to look upon themſelves as a forlorn hope, only placed there to check the progreſs of the enemy, and give them a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the deſperate valour of Greece. Even oracles were not wanting to check their ardour; for it had been declated, that to precure the ſafety of Greece it was neceſſary that a king, one of the deſcendants of Hercules, ſhould die. This taſk was cheerfully under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ken by Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das; and as he marched but from Lacedoemon, he conſidered himſelf as a willing victim offered up for the good of his country. However, he joyfully put himſelf at the head of his little hand, took poſſeſſion of his poſt, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate deſperation wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time, Xerxes approached with his numerous army, fluſhed with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceeſt, and confident of victory. His camp exhibited all the marks of Eaſtern magniſicence and Aſiatic lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury. As he expected to meet no obſtructions on his way to Greece, he was ſurpriſed to find, that a handful of men would dare to diſpute his paſſage. He waited four days to give the Greeks time to retire; but they continued their
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026819_0041_10137203AC4A8428"/>poſt a muſing themſelves in their uſual way.—He ſent to them to deliver up their arms; but Leonidas, with a truly Spartan ſpirit, deſired him <hi>to come and take them.</hi> Xerxes offered, if they would lay down their arms, to recieve them as friends, and to give them a country much lager and better than what they fought for. "No country (they replied) was worth acceptance, unleſs won by virtue; and as for their arms, they ſhould want them, whether as his friends or enemies."</p>
               <p>Xerxes, thus treated with contempt, at length ordered a body of Medes to advance, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the onſet, but were repulſed with great loſs. The number of the aſſailants only ſerved to increaſe their confuſion; and it now began to appear, that Xerxes had many followers, but few ſoldiers. Theſe forces being routed by the Grecian troops, the Perſian immortal band was brought up; but theſe were as unſucceſsful as the former. Thus did the Greeks keep their ground for two days, and no power on earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eemed capable of removing them from their advantageous ſituation. The Perſians, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by the treachery of a Grecian deſerter, got poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt, which commanded the rear of the Spartans.</p>
               <p>Leonidas, apprized of this misfortune, and ſeeing that his poſt was no longer tenable, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the troops of his allies to retire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves for better times and the future ſafety of Greece. As for himſelf, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Spartans, they were obliged by their laws not to fly; that he owed a life to his country,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026819_0042_1013720580D5E1E8"/>and that it was now his duty to fall in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Having thus diſmiſſed all but his three hundred Spartans, with ſome Theſbians and Thebans, in all not a thouſand men, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his followers, in the moſt cheerful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to prepare for death. "Come, my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldiers, ſaid he, let us dine cheerfully here, for to-night we ſhall ſup with Pluto." His men, upon hearing his determined purpoſe, ſet up a loud ſhout, as if they had been invited to a banquet, and reſolved every man to ſell his life as dearly as he could. The night now began to advance, and this was thought the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious opportunity of meeting death in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's camp. Thus reſolved, they made directly to the Perſian tents, and, in the darkneſs of the night, had almoſt reached the royal pavilion, with hopes of ſurpriſing the king. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity added much to the horror of the ſcene; and the Perſians, falling upon each other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, rather aſſiſted the Grecians t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus ſucceſs ſeemed to crown the raſhneſs of their enterprize, until the morning beginning to dawn, the light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſmallneſs of their numbers.

               <p>The loſs of Xerxes in this battle was ſaid to amount to twenty thouſand men, among whom were two of his brothers. Xerxes, therefore, diſmayed at an obſtinacy that coſt him ſo dear, was for ſome time more inclined to try his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the very day of the battle of Thirmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylae, there was an engagement at ſea between the two fleets. The Grecian flee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conſiſted of two hundred and ſeventy-one veſſels: that of the enemy had lately loſt four hundred veſſels in a ſhipwreck, but were ſtill greatly ſuperior to the Grecian fleet.</p>
               <p>Xerxes, to repair his loſs by a victory, ordered two hundred Perſian veſſels to take a compaſs, and ſurpriſe the Grecians lying in the ſtraits of Eubaea; but the Grecians, being appriſed of their deſigns, ſet ſail by night, and ſo, by a counter ſurpriſe, fell in with them while they were thus ſeparated from the main body, took and ſunk thirty, forced the reſt to ſea, and there, by ſtreſs of weather, they were all ſoon after ſunk or ſtranded. Enraged at theſe diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, the Perſians bore down the next day with the whole fleet, and drawing up in form of an half-moon, made an offer of battle, which the Greeks as readily accepted. The Athenians having been reinforced with three and fiſty ſail, the battle was very obſtinate and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026819_0044_1013720C4C8C1110"/>bloody, and the ſucceſs pretty nearly equal on both ſides, ſo that both parties ſeemed content to retire in good order.</p>
               <p>After this, Xerxes, having entered the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Phocis with his numerous army, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and burned every town throught which he paſſed. Having ſent off a conſiderable detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to plunder the temple at Delpho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, with the reſt he marched down into Attica, where he found Athens deſerted by all but a few in the citadel. Theſe men deſpairing of ſuccour, and unwilling to ſurvive the loſs of their country, would liſten to no terms of accommodation: they boldly withſtood the firſt aſſault, and, warmed by the enthuſiaſm of religion, began to hope for ſucceſs. However, a ſecond aſſault carried their feeble outworks, they were all put to the ſword, and the citadel reduced to aſhes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the confederate Greeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in council, that they ſhould prepare to receive the Perſians on the iſthmus by land, and in the ſtraits of Salamis by ſea. Xerxes, after having demoliſhed and burned Athens, marched down towards the ſea, to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his fleet, which he had determined ſhould once more come to an engagement with the enemy. The Grecian ſleet conſiſted of three hundred and eighty ſhips, the Perſian ſleet was much more numerous; but whatever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they had in numbers, and the ſize of their ſhips, they fell infinitely ſhort of the Greeks in their naval ſkill, and their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the ſeas where they fought.</p>

Themiſtocles, watching a favorable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, gave the ſignal for battle, when the Grecian fleet ſailed forward, in exact order. Xerxes, imputing his former ill ſucceſs at ſea to his own abſence, was reſolved to be a witneſs of the preſent engagement from the top of a promo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>uo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as ſtruck the enemy with terror; but their ardor abated when the engagement became cloſer. The numerous diſadvantages of their circumſtances then began to appear: the wind blew directly in their faces; the height and heavineſs of their veſſels made them unwieldy and uſeleſs; even the number of their ſhips, in the narrow ſeas where they fought, only ſerved to embarraſs and encreaſe their confuſion. The lonians firſt gave way, then the Phoenicians, and Cyprians, when the reſt retired in great diſorder, and fell foul of each other in their retreat. The Greeks purſued the Perſian fleet on every ſide; ſome were intercepted at the ſtraits of Attica, many were ſunk, and more taken. Above two hundred were burnt, all the reſt were diſperſed; and the allies, dreading the refentment of the Greeks, as well as of the Perſian king, made the beſt of their way to their own country. Such was the ſucceſs of the battle of Salamis, in which the Perſians received a ſeverer blow than they had ever before expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced from Greece.</p>
               <p>Xerxes being heartily tired of this diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful buſineſs, left his generals to take care of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When he arrived at that place, he found the bridge broken down by the violence of the waves, in a tempeſt that had lately happened. He was, therefore, obliged to paſs the ſtrait in a ſmall boat; which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of returning, being compared with the oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious method in which he had ſet out, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his diſgrace ſtill more poignant and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting. The army, which he had ordered to follow him, having been unprovided with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſuffered great hardſhips by the way. After having conſumed all the corn they could ſind, they were obliged to live upon herbs, and even upon the bark and leaves of trees. Thus harraſſed and fatigued, a peſtilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to complete their miſery; and, after a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing journey of forty-five days, in which they were purſued rather by vultures and beaſts of prey, than by men, they came to the Helleſpont, where they croſſed over, and marched from thence to Sardis. Such was the end of Xerxes's expedition into Greece: a meaſure begun in pride, and terminated in infamy and diſgrace.</p>

To the want of ſucceſs abroad was added the contempt of his ſubjects at home; and this brought on a train of treaſons, inſurrections, ſacrilege, murder; inceſt, and cruelty: ſo that the latter part of his reign was as ſcandalous, as the firſt part of it had been unfortunate.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Athens, being thus in a great meaſure freed from its fears of a foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, began to cheriſh inteſtine animoſities, and its citizens laboured with every art to ſupplant each other in aiming at places of truſt and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

Ariſtides aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that he only might be ſaid to want, who permitted his appetites to tranſgreſs the bounds of his income: and that he, who could diſpenſe with a few things, thus rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more like the gods who want nothing.</p>
               <p>Thus he lived, juſt in his public, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in his private character. His houſe was a public ſchool for virtue, and was open to all young Athenians who ſought wiſdom, or were ambitious of power.

It is even aſſerted, that he did not leave money enough behind him to pay the expences of his funeral, but that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was obliged to bear the charge of it, and to maintain his family. His daughters were married, and his ſon ſubſiſted, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public; and ſome of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children were ſupported by a penſion, equal to that which ſuch received, who had been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious at the Olympic games. But the greateſt honour that his countrymen paid to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, was in giving him the title of Juſt, a character far ſuperior to all the empty title of wiſdom or conqueſt; ſince fortune or accident
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026819_0049_101371DFEF9C6290"/>may confer wiſdom or valour, but the virtues of morality are ſolely of our own making.</p>
               <p>About the year of the world 3572, a rupture happened between the Athenians and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians; and thus the Grecian ſtates, having now no foreign enemy to diſturb them, began to harraſs and depopulate each other. But a more terrible puniſhment now began to threaten them from nature: a plague broke out in the city of Athens, a more terrible one than which is ſcarcely recorded in the annals of hiſtory. It is related, that it began in Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, from thence deſcended into Egypt, then travelled into Lybia and Perſia, and at laſt broke out like a flood upon Athens. This peſtilence baffled the utmoſt efforts of art; the moſt robuſt conſtitutions were unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand its attacks; no ſkill could obviate, nor no remedy diſpel the terrible infection. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a perſon was ſeized, he was ſtruck with deſpair, which quite diſabled him from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cure. The humanity of friends was as fatal to themſelves, as it was ineffectual to the unhappy ſufferers. Moſt of the inhabitants, for want of lodging, lived in little cottages, in which they could ſcarce breathe, while the burning heat of the ſummer encreaſed the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential malignity. They were ſeen confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly huddled together, the dead as well as the dying; ſome crawling through the ſtreets, ſome lying along by the ſides of fountains, whither they had endeavored to repair, to quench the raging thirſt that conſumed them. Their very temples were filled with dead bodies, and every
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026819_0050_10137223E97C25D0"/>part of the city exhibited a dreadful ſcene of mortality, without the leaſt remedy for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or the leaſt hopes with regard to futurity. It ſeized the people with ſuch violence, that they fell one upon another as they paſſed along the ſtreets. It was alſo attended with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common peſtilential vapours, that the very beaſts and birds of prey, though famiſhing round the walls of the city, would not touch the bodies of thoſe who died of it. Even in thoſe who recovered, it leſt ſuch a tincture of its malignity, that it ſtruck upon their ſenſes. It effaced the memory of all the paſſages of their former lives, and they knew neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor their neareſt relations. Such was the effects of this dreadful peſtilence; out of the manner in which it ended, and of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deſtroyed by it, we have no certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>We ſhall paſs over many particulars of the Peloponneſian war, as they afford only a wretched ſcene of the citizens of one Grecian ſtate ſtaining their hands with the blood of others; but we ſhall be more particular in mentioning the actions and character of thoſe heroes and philoſophers, who flouriſhed during that period. Among theſe, Pericles formed no inconſiderable character. He was deſcended from the greateſt and moſt illuſtrious families of Athens; his father, Xanthippus, defeated the Perſians at Mycale, and his mother, Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruta, was niece to Caliſthenes, who expellant the tyrants, and ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d a popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Athens. He had early thoughts of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026819_0051_1013722613FF6E38"/>riſing in the ſtate, and took leſſons from Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras, in the philoſophy of nature. He ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died politics with great aſſiduity, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly devoted himſelf to eloquence, which, in a popular ſtate, he conſidered as the fountain of all promotion. His ſtudies were crowned with ſucceſs; and the poets, his contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, affirm, that his eloquence was ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that, like thunder, he ſhook and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Greece. He had the art of uniting force and beauty; there was no reſiſting the ſtrength of his arguments, or the ſweetneſs of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Thucydides, his great opponent, was often heard to ſay, that though he had often overthrown him, the power of his perſuaſion was ſuch, that the audience could never perceive him fallen.</p>
               <p>To this eloquence he added alſo a thorough inſight into human nature, as well as a perfect acquaintance with the diſpoſition of his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. It was a conſtant ſaying with him to himſelf, "Remember, Pericles, thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak to men born in the arms of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and do thou take care to flatter them in their ruling paſſion." He reſembled the tyrant Piſiſtratus, not only in the ſweetneſs of his voice, but the features of his face, and his whole air and manner. To theſe natural and acquired graces, he added thoſe of fortune: he was very rich, and had an extenſive alliance with all the moſt powerful families of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The death of Ariſtides, and ſome other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtances, gave opportunities to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026819_0052_101372282B4627D0"/>his growing ambition: yet he at firſt concealed his deſigns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith the moſt cautious reſerve, till finding the people encreaſe in his intereſt, he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at their head, and oppoſed the principal men of the ſtate with great appearance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted virtue. The chief obſtacle to his riſe was Cimon, whoſe candour and liberality had gained him a numerous party of all ranks and denominations. In oppoſition to him, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles called in popular aſſiſtance, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the public money in bribes, largeſſes, and other diſtributions, he eaſily gained the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to eſpouſe his intereſts.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid a ſecure foundation in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, he next ſtruck at the council of the Areopagus, which was compoſed of the moſt reſpectable perſons of all Athens; and, by the aſſiſtance of one Ephialtes, another popular champion, he drew away moſt cauſes from the cognizance of that court, and brought the whole order into contempt. In this manner, while Cimon was permitted to conduct the war abroad, he managed all the ſupplies at home; and, as it was his intereſt to keep Cimon at a diſtance, he took care to provide him with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of foreign employment.</p>
               <p>Pericles every day gained new ground, till he at laſt found himſelf poſſeſſed of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole ſtate. It was then that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change his behaviour, and from acting the humble and fawning ſuppliant, he aſſumed the haughty airs of royalty. He now no longer ſubmitted himſelf to the caprice of the people, but changed the democratic ſtate of Athens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026819_0053_1013722D204D1AA0"/>a kind of monarchy, without departing, however, from the public good. He would ſometimes, indeed, win his fellow-citizens over to his will; but at other times, when he found them obſtinate, he would in a manner compel them to conſult their own intereſts.— Thus between power and purſuaſion, public profuſion, and private oeconomy, political falſehoods, and private integrity, Pericles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the principal ruler at Athens, and all ſuch as were his enemies became the enemies of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Fickleneſs and inconſtancy, however, were the prevailing characters of the Athenians; and, as theſe carried them on to their greateſt exceſſes, they ſoon brought them hack within the bounds of moderation and prudence. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles had long been a favourite. but the ſtate having ſuffered great calamities, he at laſt came to be obnoxious: they had depoſed him from the command of the army; but ſoon repented of their raſhneſs, and reinſtated him, a ſhort time after, with more than former authority.— However, he did not live long to enjoy his honours. He was ſeized with the plague, which, like a malignant enemy, ſtruck its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt blow at parting. Being extremely ill, and ready to breathe his laſt, the principal citizens, and ſuch of his friends that had not forſaken him, diſcourſing concerning the loſs they were about to ſuſtain, ran over his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and computed the number of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. They did not imagine that Pericles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to what they ſaid, as he ſeemed inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026819_0054_10137232469739B0"/>but it was far otherwiſe, as not a ſingle word of their diſcourſe had eſcaped him. At laſt, cried he, "Why will you extol a ſeries of actions, in which Fortune had the greateſt part? There is one circumſtance which I would not have forgotten, yet which you have paſſed over: I could wiſh to have it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, as the moſt glorious circumſtance of my life, that I never yet cauſed a ſingle citizen to put on mourning." Thus died Pericles, in whom were united a number of excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities without impairing each other. He was as well killed in naval affairs as in the conduct of arraies; as well ſkilled in the arts of raiſing money as of employing it; eloquent in public, and pleaſing in private; he was a patron of artiſts, at once informing them by his taſte and example.</p>
               <p>Not long after the death of Pericles, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians made peace, and every thing now promiſed a reſtoration of former tranquility; but a new promoter of troubles was now beginning to make his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and from him, thoſe who wiſhed for peace had every thing to fear: this was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Alcibiades, the diſciple of Socrates, a youth equally remarkable for the beauty of his perſon, and the graces of his mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The ſtrict intimacy between Alcibiades and Socrates is one of the moſt remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his life. This philoſopher obſerving excellent natural qualities in him, which were greatly heightened by the beauty of his perſon,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026819_0055_10137233DE14C670"/>beſtowed incredible pains in cultivating ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a plant, leſt, being neglected, it ſhould wither as it grew, and in the end degenerate. Alcibiades, indeed, was expoſed to numberleſs dangers: the greatneſs of his extraction, his vaſt riches, the authority of his family, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his guardians, his perſonal talents, and, ſtill more than theſe, the flattery and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of all who approached him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſtrong endeavours that were uſed to divert this young Athenian from a correſpondence, which alone was capable of ſecuring him from ſo many ſnares, he devoted himſelf entirely to it. He had the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded wit; he was fully ſenſible of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates' extraordinary merit, and could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the charms of his ſweetly inſinuating elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which at that time, had a greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over him than the alurements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He was ſo zealous a diſciple of that great maſter, that he followed him wherever he went, took the utmoſt delight in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, received his inſtructions, and even his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primands, with wonderful docility, and was ſo moved with his diſcourſes, as even to ſhed tears, and abhor himſelf: ſo weighty was the force of truth in the mouth of Socrates, and in ſo odious a light did he ſhow the vices, to which Alcibiades began to abandon himſelf.</p>
               <p>Alcibiades, in thoſe moments when he liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to Socrates, differed ſo much from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he appeared quite another man.

This viciſſitude of flights and returns of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolutions, and relapſes into vice, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time; but ſtill Socrates was not diſguſted with his levity, and always flattered himſelf with the hopes of bringing him back to his duty. Hence certainly aroſe the ſtrong mixture of good and evil that always appeared in his conduct, the inſtructions his maſter had given him ſometimes prevailing, and, at other times, the fire of his paſſion hurrying him, in a manner, againſt his own will, into things of a quite oppoſite nature. Among the various paſſions that were diſcovered in him, the ſtrongeſt and moſt prevailing was a haughty turn of mind, which would force all things to ſubmit to it, and could not bear a ſuperior, or even an equal.</p>
               <p>Alcibiades, with ſuch a caſt of mind as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was diſguſted with the latter, becauſe they directed themſelves only to Nicias, of whom they had a very high opinion; and, on the contrary, ſeemed to take no manner of notice of him, though his anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had enjoyed the rights of hoſpitality among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:026819_0057_1013723B42F16EE8"/>
Having found means to carry his point againſt the Lacedaemonians, he was declared general, and appointed to command the fleet; but was ſoon afterwards diſgraced. After having experienced ſtrange viciſſitudes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, being ſometimes baniſhed or condemned to death by the Athenians, at other times at the head of their fleets and armies, he at laſt took ſhelter at the court of Perſia, where the Lacedaemonians found means to perſuade that monarch to diſpatch him. Alcibiades was then in a ſmall town in Phrigia, where he lived with his concubine Timandra. Thoſe who were ſent to kill him, not daring to enter his houſe, contented themſelves with ſurrounding and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it on fire. Alcibiades having quitted it through the flames, ſword in hand, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians were afraid to ſtay to come to blows with him, but flying and retreating as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, they poured their darts and arrows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him from a diſtance, and he fell dead upon the ſpot. Timandra took up his body, and having adorned and covered it with the fineſt robes ſhe had, ſhe made as magnificent a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for it as her condition would admit.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of Alcibiades, whoſe great virtues were ſtifled and ſuppreſſed by ſtill greater vices. It is not eaſy to ſay, whether his good or bad qualities were moſt pernicious to his country; for with the one he deceived, and with the other he oppreſſed it. In him diſtinguiſhed valour was united with robility of blood. He was eloquent, of great ability in affairs, inſinuating, and formed for charming
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026819_0058_1013723D644E7EA0"/>all mankind. He loved glory, but indulged at the ſame time, his inclination for pleaſure; nor was he ſo fond of pleaſure, as to neglect his glory for it. He knew how to give into, or abſtract himſelf from, the allurements of luxury, according to the ſituation of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Never was there ductility of genius equal to his: he metamorphoſed himſelf, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible facility, into the moſt contrary forms, and ſupported them all with as much eaſe and grace as if each had been natural to him.</p>
               <p>The death of Alcibiades naturally leads us to give the character of his maſter, one of the greateſt philoſophers that the world perhaps ever produced, the immortal Socrates. He was the ſon of an obſcure citizen of Athens, and, emerging from the meanneſs of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He oppoſed the power of the thirty tyrants, who had uſurped the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Athens, and ſpoke loudly againſt the bigotry and proſecution of the times. He poſſeſſed unexampled good-nature, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal love to mankind.

He had no open ſchool like the reſt of the philoſophers, nor ſet times for his leſſons. He had no benches prepared, nor even mounted a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026819_0059_101372472F3EE110"/>times and ſeaſons; he taught in all places, and upon all occaſions; in walking, converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at meals, in the army, and in the midſt of the camp, in the public aſſembly of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or people. Such was the man, whom a faction in the city had long devoted to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he had been, for many years before his death, the object of their ſatire and ridicule.</p>
               <p>Ariſtophanes, the comic poet, was engaged to expoſe him on the ſtage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he compoſed a piece called The Clouds, wherein he introduced the philoſopher in a baſket, uttering the moſt ridiculous abſurdities. This was the firſt blow ſtruck at him; but it was not till twenty years afterwards that Melites appeared in a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal manner as his accuſer, and entered a regular proceſs againſt him. His accuſation conſiſted of two heads: the firſt was, that he did not admit the gods acknowledged by the republic, and introduced new divinities; the ſecond, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

How far the whole charge affected him is not eaſy to determine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is certain, that amid ſo much zeal and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition as then reigned in Athens, he never dared openly to oppoſe the received religion, and was therefore forced to preſerve an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of it; but it is very probable, from the diſcourſes he frequently held with his friends, that in his heart he diſpiſed and laughed at their monſtrous opinions and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous myſteries, as having no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the fables of the poets; and that he
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026819_0060_1013724BE26D0CA0"/>had attained to the notion of the one only true God, inſomuch that, upon the account both of his belief of the Deity, and the exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of his life, ſome have thought fit to rank him among the Chriſtian philoſophers.</p>
               <p>Upon the day aſſigned, the proceedings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in the uſual forms, the parties appeared before the judges, and Melitus ſpoke. The worſe his cauſe, and the leſs it was provided with proofs, the more occaſion he had for addreſs and art to cover its weakneſs. He omitted nothing that might render Socrates odious; and inſtead of reaſons, which could not but fail him, he ſubſtituted the deluſive glitter of a lively and pompous eloquence. Socrates' defence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſo great a maſterpiece of ancient ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that even the narrow limits this work is confined to, will not permit of our paſſing it ever in ſilence.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026819_0062_1013724F6F26E470"/>placed me, by commanding me to paſs my life in the ſtudy of philoſophy, for the inſtruction of myſelf and others; this would be a moſt criminal deſertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal as an impious man, who does not believe the gods. Should you reſolve to acquit me, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhould not heſitate to make anſwer, Athenians, I honor and love you, but I ſhall chooſe rather to obey God than you, and to my lateſt breath ſhall never renounce my philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, nor ceaſe to exhort and reprove you, according to my cuſtom, by telling each of you, when you come in my way, My good friend and citizen of the moſt famous city in the world for wiſdom and valour, are you not aſhamed to have no other thoughts than that of amaſſing wealth, and of acquiring glory, credit, and diguities, whilſt you neglect the treaſures of prudence, truth, and wiſdom, and take no pains in rendering your ſoul as good and perfect as it is capable of being.</p>
               <p>"I am reproached with abject fear and meanneſs of ſpirit, for being ſo buſy in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting my advice to every one in private and for having avoided to be preſent in your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, to give my counſel to my country. I think I have ſufficiently proved my courage and fortitude, both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the ſenate when I oppoſed the violence and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants.</p>
               <p>"For the reſt, Athenians, if, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme danger I now am, I do not imitate the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026819_0063_1013725367797FD0"/>behaviour of thoſe, who, upon leſs emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have implored and ſupplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, relations, and friends, it is not through pride and obſtinancy, or any contempt for you, but ſolely for your honor, and for that of the whole city. You ſhould know, that there are among our citizens thoſe, who do not regard death as an evil, and who give that name only to injuſtice and infamy. At my age, and with the reputation, true or falſe, which I have, would it be conſiſtent for me, after all the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it myſelf, and to belie in my laſt actions all the principles and ſentiments of my paſt life?</p>
               <p>"But without ſpeaking of my ſame, which I ſhould extremely injure by ſuch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to intreat a judge, nor to be abſolved by ſupplications. He ought to be perſuaded and convinced. The judge does not ſit upon the bench to ſhew favour, by violating the laws; but to do juſtice in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to them. He does not ſwear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge with impunity whom he pleaſes, but to do juſtice where it is due. We ought not, therefore, to accuſtom you to perjury, nor you to ſuffer your ſelves to be accuſtomed to it; for, in ſo doing, both the one and the other of us equally injure juſtice and religion, and both are criminals.</p>
               <p>"Do not, therefore, expect from me, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, that I ſhould have recourſe among you to means, which I believe neither honeſt nor
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026819_0064_10137256C0E850A8"/>lawful; eſpecially upon this occaſion, wherein I am accuſed of impiety by Melitus; for, if I ſhould influence you by my prayers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induce you to violate your oaths, it would be undeniably evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and juſtifying myſelf, I ſhould furniſh my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries with arms againſt me, and prove that I believe no divinity. But I am very far from ſuch bad thoughts: I am more convinced of the exiſtence of God than my accuſers; and ſo convinced, that I abandon myſelf to God and you, that you may judge of me as you ſhall deem beſt for yourſelves."</p>
               <p>Socrates pronounced this diſcourſe with a firm and intrepid tone: his air, his action, his viſage, expreſſed nothing of the accuſed; he ſeemed the maſter of his judges, from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and greatneſs of his ſoul with which he ſpoke, without however loſing any thing of the modeſty natural to him. But how ſlight ſoever the proofs were againſt him, the faction was powerful enough to find him guilty, and his death was certainly a concerted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng.</p>
               <p>By his firſt ſentence, the judges only declared Socrates guilty; but when, by his anſwer, he appeared to appeal from their tribunal to that of juſtice and poſterity; when, inſtead of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf guilty, he demanded rewards and honour from the ſtate, the judges were ſo very much offended, that they condemned him to drink hemlock, a method of execution in uſe among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:026819_0065_1013725E072E6CB8"/>
Socrates received this ſentence with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt compoſure. Apollodorus, one of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples launching out into bitter invectives, and lamenting that his maſter ſhould die <hi>innocent,</hi> "What, (replied Socrates, with a ſmile.) would you have me die guilty? Melytus and Ayntus may kill, but they cannot hurt me."</p>
               <p>After his ſentence, he ſtill continued with the ſame ſerene and intrepid aſpect, with which he had long enforced virtue, and held tyrants in awe. When he entered his priſon, which now became the reſidence of virtue and probity, his friends followed him thither, and continued to viſit him during the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his condemnation and death, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thirty days.</p>
               <p>The day before the death of Socrates, Crito, his intimate friend, went to him early in the morning to let him know, that in depended only on himſelf to quit the priſon; that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailor was gained; that he would find the doors open, and offered him a ſafe retreat in Theſſaly. Socrates laughed at his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and anſwered, that he reverenced the laws of his country, and reſolved to obey them in all things, even in his death.</p>
               <p>Socrates employed the laſt day of his life in entertaining his friends on the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject of death; he explained to them all the arguments for believing the ſoul to be immortal, and refuted all the objections againſt it. After he came out of the bath, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were brought to him, for he had three,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026819_0066_1013725F97172DB8"/>two very little, and the other grown up. He ſpoke to them for ſome time, gave orders to the women who took care of them, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed them. Being returned into his chamber, he laid himſelf down upon his bed.</p>
               <p>The keeper of the priſon entered at the ſame inſtant, and having informed him, that the time for drinking the hemlock was come, which was at ſun ſet, the keeper was ſo much afflicted with ſorrow, that he turned his back and fell a weeping. The fatal cup, however, was at laſt brought, and Socrates aſked what it was neceſſary for him to do. "Nothing more (replied the officer) than as ſoon as you have drank off the draught, to walk about till you find your legs grow weary, and afterwards to lie down upon your bed." He took the cup without any emotion, or change in his colour or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and regarding the man, with a ſteady and aſſured look, "Well, (ſaid he) what ſay you of this drink: may one make a libation out of it?" Upon being told, there was only enough for one doſe, "At leaſt, (continued he) we may ſay our prayers to the gods, as it is our duty, and implore them to make our exit from this world, and our laſt ſtage happy, which is what I moſt earneſtly beg of them." After having ſpoken theſe words, he kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for ſome time, and then drank off the whole draught with an amazing tranquility and ſerenity of aſpect, not to be expreſſed or conceived.</p>
               <p>Till then his friends, with great violence to themſelves, had refrained from tears; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026819_0067_10137261906981F0"/>he had drank the potion, they were no longer their own maſters, and wept abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Apollodorus, who had been in tears during almoſt the whole converſation, began then to raiſe great tries, and to lament with ſuch exceſſive grief, as pierced the hearts of all that were preſent. Socrates alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unmoved, and even reproved his friends, though with his uſual mildneſs and good nature. "What are you doing? (ſaid he to them) Oh! what is become of your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue! Was it not for this I ſent away the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they might not fall into theſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes?

               <p>In the mean time he kept walking to and fro; and, when he found his legs grow weary, he laid down upon his bed, as he had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. The poiſon then operated more and more. When Socrates found it began to gain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>olapius: diſcharge that vow for me, and pray do not forget it." Soon after this, he breathed his laſt. Crito went to his body, and cloſed his mouth and eyes. Such was the and of Socrates, in the firſt year of the ninety-fifth olympaid, and in the ſeventieth of his age.</p>

It was not till ſome time after the death of this great man, that the people of Athens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their miſtake, and began to repent of it. Their hatred being ſatisfied, their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices expired, and time having given them an opportunity for reflection, the notorious injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſentence appeared in all its horrors. Nothing was heard throughout the city but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in favour of Socrates. The Academy, the Lycaeum, private houſes, publick walks, and market places, ſeemed ſtill to re-echo the ſound of his loved voice. "Here (ſaid they) he formed our youth, and taught our children to love their country, and to honor their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. In this place he gave us his admirable leſſons, and ſometimes made us ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, to engage us more warmly in the purſuit of virtue. Alas! how have we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him for ſuch important ſervices!" Athens was in univerſal mourning and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The ſchools were ſhut up, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes ſuſpended. His accuſers were called to account for the innocent blood they had cauſed to be ſhed: Melitus was condemned to die, and the reſt baniſhed. Plutarch obſerves, that all thoſe, who had any ſhare in this black ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, were held in ſuch abomination among the citizens, that no one would give them fire, anſwer them any queſtion, nor go into the ſame bath with them; and they had the place cleaned where they had bathed, leſt they ſhould be polluted by touching it, which drove them into ſuch deſpair, that many of them killed themſelves. The Athentans, not contented
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026819_0069_1013726CA7A7D718"/>with having puniſhed his accuſers, cauſed a ſtatue of braſs to be erected to him, of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of the celebrated Lyſippus, who placed it in one of the moſt conſpicuous parts of the city. Their reſpect an gratitude roſe even to a religious veneration: they dedicated a chapel to him, as to a hero and demi-god, which they called the chapel of Socrates.</p>

               <p>THE Athenians had hitherto taken the lead in the Grecian ſtates; but the Spartans, who had completely conquered them, became their maſters, and ſunk them into obſcurity.</p>
               <p>At this period, Ageſilaus, who was choſen king of Sparta, was ſent into Aſia with an army, under pretence of freeing the Grecian ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

This ſucceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Perſian monarch, inſtead of meeting Ageſilaus openly in the field, to ſubvert his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt among the Grecian ſtates by the power of bribery; and indeed this confederacy was now ſo weakened, its concord and unanimity ſo to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed, that they were open to ever offer. The love of money was now rooted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Spartans, however, being freed from the terror of foreign enemies, proceeded to ſpread terror among the petty ſtates of Greece, whom they compelled to pay obedience to their will. Theſe proceedings of the Spartans, however, gave birth to a powerful confederacy againſt them; and, through a ſucceſſion of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both by ſea and land, the Spartans grow every day weaker, and their enemies more dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>It ſoon began to appear, that the Thebans, one of the ſtates of Greece, lately oppreſſed by the Spartans, were growing into power; and, while Sparta and Athens were weakening each other by mutual conteſts, this ſtate, which had enjoyed all the emoluments, without any of the expences of the war, was every day growing more vigorous and independent. The Thebans, who now began to take the lead in the affairs of Greece, were naturally a hardy and robuſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of ſlow intellects, and ſtrong conſtitutions. It was a conſtant maxim with them, to ſide either with Athens or Sparta in their mutual conteſts, and which ſoever they inclined to, they were generally of weight enough to turn the balance. However, they had hitherto made no other uſe of that weight than to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the ſpirit which now appeared among them was firſt implanted by Pelopidas, their deliverer from the Spartan yoke; but ſtill further carried to its utmoſt height by Epima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026819_0071_10137275B811B6C8"/>who now began to figure in the affairs of Greece.</p>
               <p>Epimanondas was one of thoſe few exalted characters, who have ſcarce any vice, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every virtue, to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt of mankind. Though in the beginning, poſſeſſed of every quality neceſſary for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſtate, he choſe to lead a private life, employed in the ſtudy of philoſophy, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an example of the moſt rigid obſervance of all its doctrines. Truly, a philoſopher, and poor out of taſte, he deſpiſed riches, without affecting any reputation from that contempt; and, if Juſtin may be credited, he coveted glory as little as he did money. It was always againſt his will that commands were conferred upon him; and he behaved himſelf, when inveſted with them, in ſuch a manner as did more honour so dignities, than dignities did to him. Fond of leiſure, which he devoted to the ſtudy of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, he ſhunned public employments, and made no intereſt but to be excluded from them. His moderation concealed him ſo well, that he lived obſcure, and almoſt unknown. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, however, diſcovered him at laſt. He was taken from his ſolitude by force, to be placed as the head of armies; and he demonſtrated, that philoſophy, though generally held in contempt with thoſe who aſpire at the glory of arms, is wonderfully uſeful in forming heroes; for it was, in his opinion, a great advance towards conquering an enemy, to know how to conquer ourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:026819_0072_1013727961A18AF8"/>
Such was the general appointed to command the Theban army, and act in conjuction with Pelopidas. The Thebans being left out in the general treaty of peace, and thus having the Spartans and Athanians againſt them, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under the utmoſt conſternation, and all Greece looked upon them as loſt and undone. Nothing now remained on both ſides but to prepare for action. Epimanondas immediately raiſed all the troops he could, and began his march; but his army did not amount to ſix thouſand men, while the enemy had above four times that number.</p>
               <p>The two armies met at Leuctra, and drew up on a plain. Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of a body conſiſting of Lacedaemonians, in whom he confided moſt, and whoſe files were twelve deep, to take the advantage, which his ſuperiority of horſe gave him in an open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Archidamus, the ſon of Ageſilaus, was at the head of the allies, who formed the left wing.</p>
               <p>Epimanondas, who reſolved to charge with his left, which he commanded in perſon, ſtrengthened it with the choice of his heavy armed troops, whom he drew up fifty deep; the ſacred battalion was upon his left, and cloſed the wing; the reſt of his infantry were poſted upon his right, in an oblique line, which, the farther it extended, was the more diſtant from the enemy. By this uncommon diſpoſition, his deſign was to cover his flank on the right; to keep off his right wing, as a kind of reſerved body, that he might not hazard the event of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026819_0073_1013727D59ADD658"/>battle upon the weakeſt part of his army. He was aſſured that, if he could penetrate the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonian phalanx, the reſt of the army would ſoon be put to the rout.</p>
               <p>The action began with the cavalry. As the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans were better mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedaemonian horſe, the latter were not long before they were broken, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into ſome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Epimanondas following his horſe cloſe, marched ſwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, detached a body of troops, with orders to take Epimanondas in flank, and to ſurround him. Pelopidas upon ſight of that movement, advanced with incredible ſpeed and boldneſs, at the head of the Sacred Battalion, to prevent the enemy's deſign, and flanked Cleombrotus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, by that ſudden and unexpected unexpected at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, was put into diferder.

But when he fell dead with his wounds, the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, to complete the victory, and the Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, to avoid the ſhame of abandoning the body of their king, redoubled their efforts, and a great ſlaughter enſued on both ſides.

The Thebands remained maſters of the field of battle, erected a trophy, and permitted the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to bury their dead.</p>
               <p>The Lacedaemonians had never received ſuch a blow: the moſt bloody defeat, till then, had ſcarce ever coſt them more than four or five hundred of their citizens; here they loſt four thouſand men, of whom one thouſand were La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians, and four hundred Spartans, out of ſeven hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</p>
               <p>So great a victory was followed with inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous effects: numbers of the Grecian ſtates, who had hitherto remained neuter, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of the conquerors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their army to the amount of 70,000 men. Epimanondas entered Laconia with an army, the twelfth part of which were not The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans; and finding a country hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by an enemy, he ran through it with fire and ſword, deſtroying and plundering, as far as the river Eurotas.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Spartans, ſtruck with conſternation at their late defeat, applied to the Athenians for ſuccour, who, after ſome heſitation, determined to aſſiſt them with all
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026819_0075_101372848B0430C0"/>their forces; and a ſlight advantage the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans had gained over the Thebans, in which they did not loſe a man, gave a promiſing dawn of ſucceſs. The war was then carried on with unabating vigour on both ſides. The Theban troops were headed by their favourite general Epimanondas; thoſe of Sparta by Ageſilaus, the only man in Greece that was then able to oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>Epimanondas, having failed in an attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sparta, was reſolved, before he laid down his command, which was now nearly expiring, to endeavour to effect ſomething that might compenſate for his failure. In order to protect Sparta, Ageſilaus had withdrawn all the troops from Mantinca; thither, therefore, Epima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas reſolved to bend his courſe. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to attack the town, he diſpatched a troop of horſe to view its ſituation, and to clear the fields of ſtragglers; but juſt before they had reached Mantinea, an army of ſix thouſand Athenian auxiliaries arrived by ſea, who, without taking any refreſhment to their men or horſes, ruſhed out without the city, and attacked and defeated the Theban horſe. In the mean time, Epimanondas was advancing with his whole army, with the enemy cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his rear. Finding it impoſſible to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his purpoſe, before he would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, he determined to halt and give them battle. He had now got within a ſhort way of the town, which has had the honour of giving its name to the conflict of that day—a conflict
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026819_0076_1013728BB2C38778"/>the moſt ſplendid and beſt conteſted, that ever figured in the hoſtory of any country.</p>
               <p>The Greeks had never fought among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with more numerous armies: the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians conſiſted of more than twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and two thouſand horſe; the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, of thirty thouſand foot, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe. The Theban general marched in the ſame order of battle, in which he intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the enemy, to loſe, in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his army, a precious time that cannot be recovered.</p>
               <p>He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a column upon the hills, with his left wing foremoſt, as if he did not intend to fight that day. When he was oppoſite to them, at a quarter of a league's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he deſigned to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by his ſtand; and, reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the camp, and ſuffered that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to be extinguiſhed, which a near approach of a battle is accuſtomed to kindle in the hearts of ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>Epimanondas, however, by ſuddenly wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his troops to the right, having changed his column into a line, and having drawn out the choice troops, whom he had in his march poſted in front, made them double their files upon the front of his left wing, to add to its ſtrength, and to put it into a condition to attack in point
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026819_0077_1013728DA2316330"/>the Lacedaemonian phalanx, which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the center and right wing of his army to move very ſlowly, and to half before they came up, with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops, of whom he had no great opinion.</p>
               <p>He expected to decide the victory by that body of choſen troops, which he commanded in perſon, and which he had formed into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn to attack the enemy in a wedge-like point. He had perſuaded himſelf, that if he could penetrate the Lacedaemonian phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force conſiſted, he ſhould not find it difficult to rout the reſt of the army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops. After having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his whole army in this manner, he moved on to charge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A peace, therefore, was propoſed, which was ratified by all the ſtates of Greece, except Sparta: the conditions of which were, that every ſtate ſhould maintain what they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and hold it independant of any other power. A ſtate of repoſe followed this peace; in which the Grecian powers ſeemed to ſlacken from their former animoſities, and there was little done for ſeveral years following.</p>

               <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, a power was growing up in Greece, hitherto unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but now too conſpicuous and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to be overlooked in the general picture: this was that of the Macedonians; a people hitherto obſcure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and courageous, had never yet preſumed to intermeddle in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Greece. Now ſeveral circumſtances concurred to raiſe them from that obſcurity, and to involve them in meaſures, which, by degrees, wrought a thorough change in the ſtate of Greece.</p>
               <p>This ſtate began to make a figure about the beginning of the ninety-ſixth Olympiad. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, the father of Alexander the Great, who had been the pupil of Epimanondas, was no ſooner become king of Macedon, than he began to diſtinguiſh himſelf. He ſucceeded in every thing he undertook, by the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his addreſs, and the force of his eloquence, of which he was a great maſter.— He firſt gained the affections of his ſubjects, then trained and exerciſed them. and reformed their diſcipline. It was at this time he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did ſo much execution. It was an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ancient manners of fighting among the Grecians, who generally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The reſt, whoſe diſtance from the front redered their pikes uſeleſs, reſted them upon the ſhoulders of thoſe who ſtood before them, and ſo locking them together in file, preſſed forward to ſupport and puſh on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ranks, whereby the aſſault was rendered more violent and irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p>Philip having, by ſome means or other, ſet the Greeks to quarrelling among themſelves, thought it his intereſt to remain neuter in the commotions he had partly occaſioned. It was conſiſtent with the ambitious policy of this prince to be intent only upon his own intereſt, and not to engage in a war, by which he could reap not the leaſt benefit; and to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a juncture, in which all Greece, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and divided by a great war, gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to extend his frontiers, and puſh his conqueſts, without any apprehenſions of oppoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was alſo well pleaſed to ſee both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties weaken and conſume each other, as he ſhould thereby be enabled to fall upon them afterwards to greater advantage.</p>
               <p>Philip, as ſoon as his ſon Alexander was born, loſt no time in acquainting Ariſtotle of what had happend. He wrote to that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026819_0085_101372B0F9DF8958"/>philoſopher, in terms the moſt polite and flattering; begging of him to come and undertake his education, and to beſtow on him thoſe uſeful leſſons of inaguanimity and virtue, which every great man ought to poſſeſs, and which his numerous avocations rendered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be attempted by him. He added, "I return thanks to the Gods, not ſo much for having given me a ſon, as for having given him to me in the age in which Ariſtole lives."</p>
               <p>Though brevity will not permit us to follow every method Philip took to enſlave all Greece, yet we muſt not omit to mention a circumſtance that happened at the ſiege of Merhone, where Philip loſt one of his eyes in a very ſingular manner. Aſter of Amphipolis had offered his ſervices to Philip, telling him, that he was ſo excellent a markſman, that he could bring down birds in their moſt rapid flight. The monarch made this anſwer: "Well, I will take you into my ſervice, when I make war upon ſtarlings;" which anſwer ſtung the archer to the quick. A repartee prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> often of fatal conſequence to him who makes it. Aſter, having thrown himſelf into the city, let fly an arrow, on which was written, "To Philip's left eye." This carried a moſt cruel proof that he was a good markſman, for he hit him in the right eye; and Philip ſent him back the ſame arrow, with this inſcription. "If Philip takes the city, he will hang up Aſter;" and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he was as good as his word. A ſkilful ſurgeon drew the arrow out of Philip's eye with ſo much art and dexterity, that not the leaſt
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026819_0086_101372B56577EB40"/>ſcar remained; and though he could not ſave his eye, yet he took away the blemiſh.</p>
               <p>The haſty ſtrides Philip was now making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enſlaving all Greece, particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the attention of Demoſthenes, who rouſed the Athenians from their lethargy of pleaſure. This celebrated orator ſaw, from the beginning, the ambition of Philip, and the power, of which he was poſſeſſed to carry him through his deſigns. This illuſtrious orator and ſtateſmen was born in the laſt year of the ninety ninth Olympiad. He was the ſon of an eminent Athenian citizen, who raiſed a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable fortune by the manufacture of arms. At the age of ſeven years, he loſt his father; and, to add to this misfortune, the guardians, to whom he was entruſted, waſted and embezzled a conſiderable part of his inheritance. Thus oppreſſed by fraud, and diſcouraged by a weak and effeminate habit of body, he yet diſcovered an early ambition to diſtinguiſh himſelf as a popular ſpeaker. His firſt eſſay was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his guardian, by whom he had been ſo injuriouſly treated; but the goodneſs of his cauſe was here of more ſervice than the abilities of the young orator: for his early attempts were unpromiſing. He twice afterwards attempted to harrangue the people; but he ſucceeded ſo badly, that they even hiſſed him, when he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After a length of time, however, after proper inſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unwearied application, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared again in public, and ſucceeded ſo we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:026819_0087_101372B7A70472F8"/>that people flocked from all parts of Greece to hear him. From thence he was looked upon as the ſtandard of true eloquence, inſomuch that none of his contry men have been put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with him, nor even among the Romans, any but Cicero. His eloquence was grave and auſtere, like his temper; maſculine and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, bold, forcible, and impetuous; abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with metaphors, apoſtrophes, and interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which, with his ſolemn way of invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and appealing to the gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of thoſe who fell at Salamis and Marathon, had ſuch a wonderful effect upon his hearers, that they thought him inſpired. But Demoſthenes could not have made ſuch impreſſions on them, if his talent of ſpeaking had not been ſupported by their opinion of his integrity. It was that which added weight and emphaſis to every thing he ſaid, and animated the whole; it was that which chiefly engaged their attention, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined their councils, when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he ſpoke from his heart and had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to manage but that of the community. Of this he gave the ſtrongeſt proof in his zeal againſt Philip, who ſaid he was of more weight againſt him than all the fleets and armies of the Athenians, and that he had no enemy but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes. He was not wanting in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to corrupt him, as he had done moſt of the leading men in Greece; but this great orator, withſtood all his efforts; and as it was obſerved, all the gold in Macedon could not bribe him.</p>

Though Philip's public character was by no means a credit to him, yet the following act of private juſtice does him honour. A certain ſoldier in the Macedonian army had, in many inſtances, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of Philip's favour and approbation. On ſome occaſion, he embarked on board a veſſel, which was wrecked in a violent ſtorm, he himſelf caſt on the ſhore helpleſs and naked, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the appearance of life. A Macedonian, whoſe lands were contiguous to the ſea, came opportunely to be witneſs of his diſtreſs, and with all humane and charitable tenderneſs, flew to the relief of the unhappy ſtranger. He bore him to his houſe, laid him in his own bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, cheriſhed, comforted, and for forty days ſupplied him freely with all the neceſſaries and conveniences, which his languiſhing condition could require. The ſoldier, thus happily reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from death, was inceſſant in the warmeſt expreſſions of gratitude to his benefactor, aſſured him of his intereſt with the king, and of his power and reſolution of obtaining for him, from the royal bounty, the noble returns which ſuch extraordinary benevolence had merited. He was now completely recovered, and his kind hoſt ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some time after, the ſoldier preſented himſelf before the king; he recounted his misfortunes, magnified his ſervices, and, having looked with an eye of envy on the poſſeſſions of the man who had preſerved his life, was now ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026819_0089_101372C1D3A90CF0"/>to every ſenſe of gratitude, as to requeſt the king to beſtow upon him the houſe and lands where he had been ſo kindly and tenderly entertained. Unhappily, Philip, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, inconſiderately and precipitately granted his infamous requeſt. This ſoldier now returned to his preſerver, repaid his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by driving him from his ſettlement, and taking immediate poſſeſſion of all the fruits of his honeſt induſtry.

All were equally effected by the event, and all equally reſolved to conquer, or die in defence of their liberty.</p>
               <p>The fatal morning now arrived, which was for ever to decide the cauſe of liberty, and the empire of Greece. Before the riſing of the ſun, both armies were ranged in order of battle. The Thebans, commanded by Theogenes, a man of but moderate abilities in war, and ſuſpected of corruption, obtained the poſt of honor on the right wing of the confederate Greeks, with that famous body in the front, called the Sacred Band, formed of generous and warlike youths, connected and endeared to each other by all the noble enthuſiaſm of love and friendſhip. The centre was formed of the Corinthians and Peloponneſians, and the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians compoſed the leſt wing, led by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Lyſicles and Chares. On the left of the Macedonian army ſtood Alexander, at the head of a choſen body of noble Macedonians, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the famous cavalry of Theſſaly. As this prince was then but nineteen years old, his father was careful to curb his youthful impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, and to direct his valour, and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſurrounded him with a number of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:026819_0093_101372D2D65BA9D0"/>officers. In the centre were placed thoſe Greeks who had united with Philip, and on whoſe courage he had the leaſt dependence; while the king himſelf commanded on the right wing, where his renowned phalanx ſtood, to oppoſe the impetuoſity, with which the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were well known to begin their onſet.</p>

At the ſame time, the Athenians, on the right wing, fought with a ſpirit and intrepidity wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the character which they boaſted, and of the cauſe by which they were animated. Many brave efforts were exerted on each ſide, and ſucceſs was for ſome time doubtful; till at length, part of the center, and the left wing of the Macedonians, except the phalanx, yielded to the impetuous atrack of the Athenians, and ded with ſome precipitation. Happy had it been on that day for Greece, if the conduct and abilities of the Grecian generals had been equal to the valour of their ſoldiers; but theſe brave champions of liberty were led on by the deſpicable creatures of intrigue and cabal.— Tranſported by the advantage now obtained, the preſumptuous Lyſicles cried out, "Come of, my gallant countrymen, the victory is ours; let us purſue theſe cowards, and drive them to Macedon." Thus, inſtead of improving the happy opportunity, by charging the phalanx in flank, and ſo breaking that formidable body, the Athenians wildly and precipitately preſſed forward, in purſuit of the flying enemy, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all the diſorder and tumult of a rout.</p>
               <p>Philip ſaw this fatal error with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a ſkilful general, and the ſecret exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſing from the aſſurance of aporoach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victory.

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026819_0095_101372D7D8C01710"/>firm and collected, and fell, with their united force, on the Athenians, now confident of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and blind to their danger. The ſhock was irreſiſtible, they were at once overwhelmed, many of them lay cruſhed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring by their wounds; while the reſt eſcaped from the dreadful ſlaughter by a ſhameful and precipitate ſlight, bearing down, and hurrying away with them, thoſe troops that, had been ſtationed for their ſupport. Now Demoſthenes, that renowned orator and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe noble ſentiments and ſpirited ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues had raiſed the courage on this day ſo eminently excited, betrayed that weakneſs, which has ſullied his great character.

The ridicule and malice of his enemies related, or perhaps invented, another ſhameful circumſtance; being impeded in his ſlight by ſome brambles, his imagination was ſo poſſeſſed by the preſence of an enemy, that he loudly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for quarter.</p>
               <p>While Philip was thus triumphant on his ſide, Alexander continued the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans in ſpite of all their acts of valor, who now fled from the field, and were purſued with great carnage. The center of the confederates war
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026819_0096_101372DB867E71F0"/>thus totally abandoned to the fury of a victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy. But ſlaughter enough had been already made; more than one thouſand of the Athenians lay dead on the field of battle, two thouſand were made priſoners. and the loſs of the Thebans was not inferior. Philip, therefore, determined to conclude his important victory by an act of apparent clemency, which his ambition and policy really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks ſhould be ſpared, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his own deſigns, and ſtill expecting to appear in the field the head and leader of that body, which he had now completely conquered.</p>
               <p>This defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill conduct of the generals Lyſicles and Chares; the former whereof the Athenians put to death at the inſtance of a judge, named Lycurgus, who had great credit and influence with the people, but was a ſevere judge, and a moſt bitter accuſer. "You, Lyſicles, (ſaid he) were general of the army: a thouſand citizens were ſlain, and two thouſand taken priſoners; a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy has been erected to the diſhonour of this city, and all Greece is enſlaved. You had the command when all theſe things happened; and yet you dare to live, to view the light of the fun, and bluſh not to appear publicly in the forum: you, Lyſicles, who are born the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of your country's ſhame!" It does not appear that Charles underwent any kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for his ſhare of this action; though, according to his general character, he deſerved it more than his colleague: he had no talent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026819_0097_101373848584DF50"/>from a common ſoldier. Timotheus ſaid of him, that, "inſtead of being a general, he was ſitter to carry the general's baggage."</p>
               <p>After the battle of Chaeronea, ſuch orators as oppoſed Demoſthenes, having all riſen up in concert againſt him, and having cited him to take his trial according to law, the people not only declared him innocent of the ſeveral accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations laid to his charge, but conferred on him additional honors.</p>
               <p>Philip, however, did not long enjoy the fruits of his conqueſts in Greece. Pauſanius, a young Macedonian nobleman, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moſt ſhameful inſult from Attilus, a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Philip's, he applied to the monarch for redreſs; but not being able to obtain it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on the deſtruction of Philip.

The tumult and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſuch as might be expected from ſo fatal an event: ſome of the Macedonians crowded round the fallen king with efficious and ineffectual care, while others purſued Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanius. Among theſe were Perdiccas, Attalus, and Leonatus, who coming up with him juſt as he was preparing to remount his horſe, from which he had been thrown by his foot tangling in a vine, they fell upon him, and diſpatched him.

               <p>IN the year of the world 3648, and 356 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of Chriſt, Alexander, the ſon of Philip, aſcended the throne of Macedon; and took poſſeſſion of a kingdonm rendered flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and powerful by the policy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reign. Alexander, upon his acceſſion to the throne, ſaw himſelf ſurrounded with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme dangers; the barbarous nations, with whom Philip contended during his whole reign, thought this change for their advantage; and, deſpiſing the youth and inexperience of the young monarch, reſolved to ſeize this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of regaining their freedom. Nor had he leſs to fear from the Greeks themſelves, who now thought this a convenient opportunity to reſtore their ancient form of government; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their former injuries, and reclaim thoſe rights they had enjoyed for ages. Alexander; however, reſolved to prevent their machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to give them no time to complete their confederacies againſt him.

               <p>The firſt object of Alexander's ambition was the conqueſt of Perſia: and he now expected, that he ſhould have leiſure and opportunity to prepare for ſo great an enterprize. He was however, ſoon called to a new undertaking; for the Athenians, Thebans, and Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, united againſt him, hoping by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Perſia, to recover their freedom. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and activity were the characteriſties of Alexander. Having heard of the union formed againſt him by the Grecian States, he croſſed over the craggy top of Mount Oſſa, to elude the Theſſilonians, who had poſſeſſed themſelves of the defiles lying between Theſſaly and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon; and moved on with ſuch rapidity, that his appearance in Greece gave the firſt news of his preparation for war. A great battle was ſoon fought, in which the Thebans exerted themſelves with a bravery and ardour much above their ſtrength; but they were at laſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on all ſides, the greateſt part of them were cut to pieces, and the city taken, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and deſtroyed.

This dreadful example of ſeverity towards ſo powerful a city as Thebes, ſpread the terror of his arms through all Greece, and made all things give way before him. He ſummoned at Corniſh the aſſemblies of the ſeveral ſtates and free cities of Greece, to obtain from them the ſame ſupreme command againſt the Perſians, which had been granted to his father a little before his death. No aſſembly ever debated on a more important ſubject: it was the weſtern world deliberating upon the ruin of the eaſt, and the method for executing a revenge which had been ſuſpended for more than an age. The aſſembly held at this time gave riſe to events, the relation of which will appear aſtoniſhing, and almoſt incredible; and to revolution; which contributed to change the diſpoſition of moſt things in the political world. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of the aſſembly were ſhort: the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were the only people who ventured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate: though ſeveral others were inimical to the intereſts of the Macedonians; but they were forced to ſubmit, and Alexander was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed general ſinuo againſt the Perſians.</p>
               <p>Having thus far accompliſhed his wiſhes, and after having completely ſettled his affairs in Macedonia, he ſet out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026819_0102_101372E203749520"/>near three-ſcore years of age, and the common men fifty; and when they were either aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or drawn up at the head of a camp, they had the air of a venerable ſenate. Such was the army that was to decide the fortune, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Greece, but of all the eaſtern world.</p>
               <p>When the news of Alexander's landing in Aſia, without oppoſition, was brought to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, he teſtified the utmoſt contempt for the Macedonian army, and indignation at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their generals. In a letter which he wrote, he reprehended his andacious inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and gave orders to his various governors, in the different parts of his dominions, that, if they took Alexander alive, to whip him with rods, make priſoners of his whole army, and ſend them as ſlaves to one of the moſt deſerted parts of his dominions. Thus confiding in the glittering but barbarous multitude he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he diſpoſed of the enemy as already vanquiſhed; but confidence goes but a ſhort part of the road to ſucceſs. The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he had gathered only brought unwieldy ſplendor into the field, and, inſtead of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſecurity, encreaſed his embarraſſments.</p>
               <p>Alexander, in the mean time, marched on at the head of his heavy-armed infantry, drawn up in two lines, with the cavalry in the wings, and the baggage following in the rear. Being arrived on the banks of the Grannicus, he there found the Perſian horſe, which were very numerous, on the oppoſite ſhore, forming a large front, in order to oppoſe Alexa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der, whenever he ſhould attempt to paſs. The two
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026819_0103_101372E3CCCBD160"/>armies continued a long time in ſight of each other, on the banks of the river, as if dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the event. The Perſians waited till the Macedonians ſhould enter the river, in order to charge them to advantage upon their landing; and the latter ſeemed to be making choice of a place proper for landing.</p>
               <p>At laſt, Alexander ordered his horſe to be brought, commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him and behave gallantly. He himſelf commanded the right wing, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio the left. The king firſt cauſed a ſtrong detachment to march into the river, himſelf following it with the reſt of the forces. He made Parmenio advance afterwards with the left wing, the trumpet ſounding, and the whole army raiſing cries of joy. The Perſians, ſeeing this detachment advance forward, began to let fly their arrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and march to a place where the declivity was not ſo great, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. but now the horſe engaged with great fury, one part endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to land, and the other ſtriving to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them. The Macedonians, whoſe cavalry were inferior in number, beſides the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground, were wounded with the darts that were ſhot from the eminence; not to mention, that the flower of the Perſian horſe were drawn together in this place. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, therefore, at firſt gave ground, after having loſt the firſt ranks, which made a vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defence. Alexander, who cloſely followed them, reinforced them with his beſt troops, headed them himſelf, animated them by his
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026819_0104_101372E935322618"/>preſence, puſhed the Perſians, and routed them; upon which the whole army followed after, croſſed the river, and attacked the enemy on all ſides.</p>
               <p>Spithrobates, lieutenant-governor of Ionia, and ſon-in-law to Darius diſtinguiſhed himſelf above the reſt of the Perſian generals by his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior bravery. Being ſurrounded by forty Perſian lords, all of them his relations, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced valor, and who never moved from his ſide, he carried terror wherever he went. Alexander obſerving in how gallant a manner he ſignalized himſelf, clapt ſpurs to his horſe, and advanced towards him. They immediately engaged, and each having thrown a javelin, wounded the other ſlightly. Spithrobates fell furiouſly ſword in hand upon Alexander, who, being prepared for him, thruſts his pike into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very moment Rafaces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the ſide, gave him ſo furious a blow on the head with a battle axe, that he beat off his plume, but went no deeper than the hair. As he was going to repeat his blow on the head, which now appeared through his frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured helmet. Chrus cut off Rafaces' hand with one ſtroke of his ſcimitar, and thereby ſaved his ſovereign's life.

               <p>Alexander afterwards took Miletus, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed Halicanaſſus to the very foundation. He next reſtored Ada, queen of Caria, to her kingdom, of which ſhe had been diſpoſſeſſed ſome time before; and as a teſtimony of the deep ſenſe ſhe had of the favours received from Alexander, ſhe ſent him every day meats dreſſed in the moſt exquiſite manner, and the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent cooks of every kind. Alexander an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the queen upon this occaſion, that all this train was of no ſervice to him; for that he was poſſeſſed of much better cooks, whom Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas his governor had given him: one of whom prepared him a good dinner, and the other an excellent ſupper: theſe were Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Exerciſe.</p>

He ſoon afterwards marched into Phrygia, the ancient dominion of the celebrated king Midas. Having taken the capital city, he was deſirous of ſeeing the famous cheriot, to which the gordian knot was tied. This knot, which faſtened the yoke to the beam, was tied with ſo much intricacy, that it was impoſſible to diſcover where the ends begun, or how they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an oracle had foretold, that the man who could untie it ſhould poſſeſs the empire of Aſia. Alexander being firmly perſuaded that the oracle was meant for him, after many fruitleſs trials, inſtead of attempting to untie it in the uſual manner, drew his ſword, and cut it into pieces, crying out, ſuch was the only way to untie it. The prieſt hailed the omen, and declared that Alexander fulfilled the oracle.</p>
               <p>Darius having been employed, for a long time, in collecting a numerous army to oppoſe Alexander, advanced towards the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates. Over his tent was exhibited, to the view of his whole army, the image of the ſun in jewels, while wealth and magnificence ſhone in every quarter of the army. Firſt they carried ſilver altars, on which lay fire, called by them Sacred and Eternal; and theſe were followed by the Magi, ſinging hymns, after the manner of their country. They were accompanied by three hundred and ſixty-five youths, equalling the number of days in a year, clothed in purple ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:026819_0108_101372F97B2F5E00"/>by a courſer of prodigious ſize, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's Horſe; and the equerries were dreſſed in white, each having a golden rod in his hand.</p>
               <p>Ten chariots, adorned with ſculptures of gold and ſilver, followed afterwards. Then marched a body of horſe, compoſed of twelve nations, whoſe manners and cuſtoms were various, and all armed in a different manner. Next advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe, whom the Perſians called <hi>The Immortals,</hi> amounting to ten thouſand, who ſurpaſſed the reſt of the barbarians in the ſumptuouſneſs of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, were cloathed in robes of gold tiſſue, with veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments having ſleeves to them, quite covered with precious ſtones. Thirty paces from them, followed thoſe called the king's relations, to the number of fifteen thouſand, in habits very much reſembling thoſe of women, and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dreſs, than the glitter of their arms. Thoſe called the Dourphori came afterwards: they carried the king's cloak, and walked before the chariot, in which he ſeemed to ſit as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both ſides with images of the gods, in gold and ſilver; and from the middle of the yoke, which was covered with jewels, roſe two ſtatues, a cubit in height, the one repreſenting war, the other peace, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a golden eagle between them, with wings extended, as ready to take flight.

Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's children, and thoſe who had the care of their education, with a band of eunuchs. Then marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and ſixty, in the equipage of queens, followed by ſix hundred mules, and three hundred ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, which carried the king's treaſure, and guarded by a great body of archers.

               <p>ALEXANDER, as frequently happens to the greateſt captains, felt ſome emotions, when he ſaw that he was going to hazard all at once. The more fortune had favoured him hitherto, the more he now dreaded her frowns: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was approaching, which was to determine his fate. On the other ſide, his courage revived from the reflection, that the reward of his toils exceeded the dangers of them; and, though he was uncertain with regard to the victory, he at leaſt hoped to die gloriouſly, and like Alexander. However, he did not divulge theſe thoughts to any one, well knowing that, upon the approach of a battle, a general ought not to diſcover the leaſt, marks of ſadneſs or perplexity, and that the troops ſhould read nothing but reſolution and intrepidity in the countenance of their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>Having made his ſoldiers refreſh themſelves, and ordered them to be ready by three o'clock in the morning, he went to the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026819_0111_1013730210474C20"/>and there, by torch light, ſacrificed, after the mander of his country, to the gods of the place. As ſoon as the ſignal was given, his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was ready to march and fight, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by day-break at the ſeveral poſts aſſigned them. But the ſpies now bringing word, that Darius was not above thirty furlongs from them the king cauſed his army to halt, and then drew it up in battle array. The peaſants, in the greateſt terror, came alſo, and acquainted Darius with the arrival of the enemy, which he would not at firſt believe, imagining that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander fled before him, and was endeavoring to eſcape. This news threw his troops into the utmoſt confuſion, who, in their ſurpriſe, ran to their arms with great precipitation and diſorder.</p>
               <p>The ſpot where the battle was fought, lay near the city of Iſſus, which the mountains bounded on one ſide, and the ſea on the other. The plain that was ſituated between them both muſt have been conſiderably broad, as the two armies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in it. The river Pinarius ran through the middle of this plain, from the mountain to the ſea, and divided it very nearly into two equal parts. The mountain formed a hollow kind of gulf, the extremity of which, in a curved line, bounded part of the plain.</p>
               <p>Alexander had at firſt advanced very ſlowly, to prevent the ranks on the front of the phalanx from breaking, and haired by intervals, but when he was got within bow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Both ſides fought with the utmoſt bravery and reſolution; and, being now forced to fight cloſe, they charged both ſides ſword in hand, when a dreadful ſlaughter enſued each enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging man to man. Alexander wiſhed nothing ſo ardently as to kill with his own hand Darius, who, being ſeated on a high chariot, was conſpicuous to the whole army. Oxathres, brother to Darius, obſerving that Alexander was going to charge that monarch with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigour, ruſhed before his chariot with the horſe under his command, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf above the reſt. The horſes that drew Darius's chariot loſt all command, and ſhook the yoke ſo violently, that they were upon the point of overturning the king, who, ſeeing himſelf going to fall alive into the hands of his enemies, leaped down and mounted another chariot. The reſt, obſerving this, fled as faſt as poſſible, and throwing down their arms, made the beſt of their way. Darius, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he ſaw his left wing broken, was one of the firſt who fled in his chariot; but getting afterwards into craggy rugged places, he mounted on horſeback, throwing down his bow, ſhield, and royal mantle. Alexander, however did not attempt to purſue him, till he ſaw his phalanx had conquered the Greeks who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately oppoſed them, and that the Perſian horſe were put to flight; which proved of great advantage to the prince that fled. In this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſixty thouſand of the Perſian infantry, and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026819_0113_1013730B6F4516E8"/>ten thouſand horſemen, were ſlain; while of Alexander's army, there ſell but two hundred and eighty in all.</p>
               <p>Syſigambis, Darius's mother, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's queen, were found remaining in the camp, with two of the king's daughters, his ſon, yet a child, and ſome Perſian ladies; for the reſt had been carried to Damaſcus, with part of Darius's treaſure, and all ſuch things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court. No more than three thouſand talents were found in his camp; but the reſt of the treaſure ſell afterwards into the hands of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio, at the taking of the city of Damaſcus.</p>
               <p>The next day, Alexander viſited his royal priſoners; and his noble and generous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour on this occaſion, Plutarch occaſion to ſay, that "the princeſſes of Perſia lived in an enemy's camp, as if they had been in ſome ſacred temple, unſeen, unapproached, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted." Syſigambis was diſtinguiſhed by extraordinary marks of Alexander's favours: Darius himſelf could not have treated her with more reſpect than did that generous prince. He allowed her to regulate the funerals of all the Perſians of the royal family, who had fallen in battle; and, through her interceſſion, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſeveral of Darius' nobles, who had juſtly incurred his diſpleaſure. This magnanimous conduct has done more honour to Alexander's character, than all his ſplendid conqueſts. The gentleneſs of his manners to his ſuppliant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, his chaſtity and continence, when he had the power to enforce obedience, were ſetting an
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026819_0114_1013730EE319DAE8"/>example to heroes, which it has been the pride of many ſince to imitate.</p>
               <p>After this conqueſt, all Phoenicia, the capital city Tyre, only excepted, was yielded to the conqueror. Good fortune followed him to faſt, that it rewarded him beyond his expectations. Antigonus, his general in Aſia, overthrew the Capadocians, Paphlagonians, and others lately revolted. Ariſtodemus, the Perſian admiral was overcome at ſea, and a great part of his fleet taken. The city of Damaſcus, alſo, in which the treaſures of Darius were depoſited, was given up to Alexander.</p>
               <p>Alexander next went to Sidonia, whoſe king, Strabo, he dethroned for his attachment to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and permitted Hephaeſtion to elect in his ſtead, whomſoever of the Sidonians he ſhould judge worthy of ſo exalted a character. This favourite was quartered at the houſe of two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were young, and of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable family in the city. To theſe he offered the crown; but they refuſed it, telling him, that, according to the laws of their country, no perſon could aſcend the throne unleſs he were of the royal blood. Hephaeſtion, admiring this greatneſs of ſoul, which could contemn what others ſtrive to obtain by ſire and ſword, "Continue, (ſaid he to them) in this way of thinking, you who ſeem ſenſible, that it is much more glorious to refuſe than to accept a diadem. However, name me ſome perſon of the royal family, who may remember when he be king, that it was you who ſet the crown on his head." The brothers obſerving, that ſeveral

His honeſty and integrity had reduced him, as well as many more, to ſuch extreme poverty. Solely intent upon his labour, he did not hear the claſhing of the arms which had ſhaken all Aſia. The two brothers went immediately in ſearch of Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonymus, with the royal garment, and found him weeding in his garden. When they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured him king, Abdolonymus looked upon the whole as a dream; and, unable to gueſs the meaning of it, aſked if they were not aſhamed to ridicule him in that manner. But as he made a greater reſiſtance than ſuited their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, they themſelves waſhed him, and threw over his ſhoulders a purple robe richly embroidered with gold; then, after repeated oaths of their being in earneſt, they conducted him to the palace.</p>

               <p>The Macedonians had already ſubdued Syria and Phoenicia, the city of Tyre excepted. This city was juſtly entitled the Queen of the ſea, that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations. She boaſted of having firſt invented navigation, and taught mankind the art of braving the winds and waves by the aſſiſtance of a frail bark. The happy ſituation of Tyre, the conveniency and extent of its ports, the character of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who were induſtrious, laborious, patient, and extremely courteous to ſtrangers, invited thither merchants from all parts of the globe: ſo that it might be conſidered, not ſo much a city belonging to any particular nation, as the common city of all nations, and the centre of their commerce.</p>
               <p>Alexander thought it neceſſary, both for his pride and his intereſt, to take the city, though it was generally ſuppoſed to be impregnable from its fortifications, and inacceſſible from its ſituation.

               <p>WHILST Alexander was carrying on the ſiege of Tyre, he received a ſecond let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Darius, in which that monarch ſeemed more ſenſible of his power than before: he now gave him the title of king, and offered him ten thouſand talents, as a ranſom for his captive m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>a in marriage, with all the country he had conquered, as far as the river Euphrates: he hinted to him the inconſtancy of fortune, and deſcribed at large the powers he was ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe terms were ſo conſiderable, that, when the king debated upon them in council, Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, one of his generals, could not help obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if he were Alexander, he would agree to ſuch a propoſal. To which Alexander nobly replied, "And ſo would I were I Parmenio." He therefore treated the propoſal of Darius with haughty contempt, and refuſed to accept of treaſures which he already conceived as his own.</p>
               <p>From Tyre, Alexander marched to Jeruſalem where the Jews opened their gates to receive him. From this city, he went on to Gaza, where he found a more obſtinate reſiſtance than
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026819_0119_1013732126478B98"/>he had expected; but at length, taking the town by ſtorm, and having cut the garriſon conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ten thouſand men, to pieces, with brutal ferocity, he ordered B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etis, the governor, to be brought before him; and having in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to intimidate, him commanded, at laſt, that holes ſhould be bored through his heels, and thus to be tied by cords to the back of his chariot, and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of the city. This he did in limitation of Achilles, whom Homer deſcribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the ſame manner: but it was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that poet to very little advantage, to imitate this hero in the moſt unworthy part of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>He then marched into Egypt, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the whole of it, without meeting with the leaſt oppoſition. He afterwards viſited the temple of Jupiter, and cauſed himſelf to be acknowledged by the prieſts as the ſon of that god. Having ſettled his affairs in Egypt, he ſet out to march againſt Darius, who was now preparing to oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>On his march, Statira, the wife of Darius, died in child-bed, and was honoured with a funeral ceremony due to her exalted character and ſtation. The news of that melancholy event was carried to Darius by Tricus, one of Statira's eunuchs, who had affected his eſcape from the Macedonian camp. The news of Statira's death overwelmed the mind of Darius with the deepeſt ſorrow: but when he was told of the generous manner, in which the royal
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026819_0120_10137324EDE52158"/>captives had been treated, he broke out into this exclamation: "Ye gods, the guardians of our births, and who decree the fate of nations, grant that I may be enabled to leave the Perſian ſtate rich and flouriſhing as I found it; that I may have it in my power to make Alexander a proper return for his generoſity to the deareſt pledges of my affection! But, if the duration of this empire is near at an end, and the greatneſs of Perſia about to be forgotten, may none but Alexander be permitted to ſit on the throne of Cyrus? Such ſentiments in a deſpotic prince muſt give a very favourable idea of the liberality of his mind.</p>
               <p>The armies of Alexander and Darius were now haſtily approaching each other, and at length met on a plain near the city of Arbela. The army of Darius, conſiſted, at leaſt, of ſix hundred thouſand foot, and forty thouſand horſe: and the other of no more than forty thouſand foot, and about eight thouſand horſe. The two armies engaged, and the battle was obſtinate and bloody; but the Perſians were at length routed, and Darius and his army put to ſlight. Alexander then marched for Babylon, and entered that city in triumph, being received by its inhabitants in the moſt magnificent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He next took poſſeſſion of Perepolis, at the head of his victorious ſoldiers; who, though the inhabitants made no reſiſtance, began to cut in pieces all thoſe who ſtill remained in the city. However, the king ſoon put an end to the maſſacre, and forbad his ſoldiers to commit any further violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:026819_0121_101373298696D038"/>
While Alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of ſucceſs, the wretched Darius was by this time arrived at Ecbatana, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of Media. There remained ſtill with this fugitive prince thirty thouſand foot; among whom were four thouſand Greeks, who were faithful to him to the laſt. Beſides theſe he had four thouſand ſlingers, and upwards of three thouſand Bactrian horſe, whom Beſſus, their governor, commanded. Darius, even with ſo ſmall a force, ſtill conceived hopes of oppoſing his rival, or at leaſt of protracting the war; but he was ſurrounded with traitors, his want of ſucceſs having turned all mankind againſt him. Nabarzanes, one of the greateſt lords of Perſia, and general of the horſe, had conſpired with Beſſirs, general of the Bactrians, to commit the blackeſt of all crimes: to ſeize upon the perſon of the king, and lay him in chains, which they might eaſily do, as each of them had a great number of ſoldiers under his command. Their deſign was, if Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould purſue them, to ſecure themſelves by giving up Darius alive into his hands; and, in caſe they eſcaped, to murder that prince, and afterwards uſurp his crown, and begin a new war. Theſe traitors ſoon won over the troops, by repreſenting to them, that they were going to their deſtruction; that they would ſoon be cruſhed under the ruin of an empire, which was juſt ready to fall; at the ſame time that Bactriana was open to them, and offered them immenſe riſhes. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſoon prevailed upon the perfidious army,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026819_0122_1013732CCD6BDA20"/>the Greek mercenaries excepted, who rejected all their propoſals with diſdain. Darius, thus betrayed by his generals, and purſued by his enemies, the Greeks ſolicited the honour of protecting his perſon, aſſuring him they would ſo do, at the expence of the laſt drop of their blood. But his noble ſpirit would not ſuffer him to accept the offer: "If my own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (ſaid he) will not give me protection, how can I ſubmit to receive it from the hands of ſtrangers?" His faithful Grecian ſoldiers, finding it beyond their power to grant him any relief, threw themſelves upon the mercy of Alexander; who, in conſideration of their noble ſpirit, forgave them, and employed them in his own ſervice.</p>
               <p>The traitors ſeized and bound their monarch in chains of gold, under the appearance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as he was a king; then encloſing him in a covered chariot, they ſet out towards Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triana. In this manner they carried him with the utmoſt diſpatch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until being informed, that the Grecian army was ſtill cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them, they found it impoſſible either to conciliate the friendſhip of Alexander, or to ſecure a throne for themſelves. They, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once more gave Darius his liberty, and deſired him to make the beſt of his eſcape with them from the conqueror; but he replied that the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already ſuffered; and, appealing to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander for juſtice, refuſed to follow a band of traitors. At theſe words they fell into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fury, wounding him with their darts and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:026819_0123_1013732FACB04AD8"/>their ſpears, and left him to linger in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, unattended, the remainder of his wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways; while the victorious Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians at length coming up, found Darius in ſolitude, lying in his chariot, and drawing near his end. However, he had ſtrength enough, before he died, to call for drink, which a Macedonian, Polyſtratus by name, brought him. On this melancholy occaſion, the generoſity of the unfortunate monarch ſhone forth, in the addreſs he made to this ſtranger: "Now, indeed, (ſaid he) I ſuffer the extremity of miſery, ſince it is not in my power to reward thee for this act of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity." He had a Perſian priſoner, whom he employed as his interpreter. Darius, after drinking the liquor that had been given him. turned to the Macedonian, and told him, that in the deplorable ſtate to which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he however ſhould have the comfort to ſpeak to one who could underſtand him, and that his laſt words would not be loſt. He therefore charged hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to tell Alexander, that he had died in his debt, that he gave him many thanks, for the great humanity he had exerciſed towards his mother, his wife, and his children, whoſe lives he had not only ſpared, but reſtored to their former ſplendour; that he be ſought the gods to give victory to his arms, and make him monarch of the univerſe; that he thought he need not entreat him to revenge the execrable murder committed on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as that was the common cauſe of kings.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:026819_0124_10137331710B0208"/>After this, taking Polyſtratus by the hand, "Give him (ſaid he) thy hand, as I give thee mine: and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my gratitude and affection." Having ſaid theſe words, he breathed his laſt.</p>
               <p>Alexander coming up a moment after, and ſeeing Darius's body, he wept bitterly; and, by the ſtrongeſt teſtimonies of affection that could be given, proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappineſs of a prince who deſerved better. He immediately pulled off his military cloak, and threw it on Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius's body; then cauſing it to be embalmed, and his coffin to be adorned with royal magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, he ſent it to Syſigambis. to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred with the honours uſually paid to the deceaſed Perſian monarchs, and entombed with his anceſtors. Thus died Darius, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age, ſix of which he reigned with felicity. In him the Perſian empire ended, after having exiſted from the time of Cyrus the Great, a period of 299 years.</p>
               <p>The traitor Beſſus did not eſcape the fate due to his crimes. Alexander purſued him, to avenge on the murderer the death of his royal maſter. After wandering, in anxiety and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from province to province, he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by the aſſociates of his guilt, into the hands of Alexander, by whom he was put to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE death of Darius only ſerved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the ſpirit of ambition in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to purſue further conqueſts. He croſſed Parthia, and arrived in the province of Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, which ſubmitted to his arms. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſubdued the Mandii, the Arii, the Dran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae, the Hrachoſii, and ſeveral other nations, into which his army marched with greater ſpeed than people generally travel. He frequently would purſue an enemy for whole days and nights together, almoſt without ſuffering his troops to take any reſt. By this prodigious rapidity, he came unawares upon nations, who thought him at a great diſtance, and ſubdued them before they had time to put themſelves in a poſture of defence.</p>
               <p>Alexander, now enjoying a little repoſe, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndoned himſelf to ſenſuality; and he, whom the arms of the Perſians could not conquer, fell a victim to their vices. Nothing was now to be ſeen but games, parties of pleaſure, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and exceſſive faſting, in which he uſed to revel whole days and nights. Not ſatisfied with the buffoons, and the performers on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental muſic, whom he had brought with him out of Greece, he obliged the captive wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom he carried along with him, to ſing ſongs after the manner of their country. He happened, among thoſe women, to perceive
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:026819_0126_1013734294C6D518"/>one who appeared in deeper affliction than the reſt, and who by a modeſt, and at the ſame time a noble confuſion, diſcovered a greater reluctance than the others to appear in public. She was a perfect beauty, which was very much heightened by her baſhfulneſs, whilſt ſhe threw her eyes to the ground, and did all in her power to conceal her face. The king ſoon imagined, by her air and mien, that ſhe was not of vulgar birth; and enquiring himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the lady anſwered, that ſhe was grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter to Ochus, who not long before had ſwayed the Perſian ſcepter, and daughter of his ſon; that ſhe had married Hyſtaſpes, who was related to Darius, and general of a great army. Alexander, being touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, when he heard the unhappy fate of a princeſs of the blood royal, and the ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which ſhe was reduced, not only gave her liberty, but returned all her poſſeſſions; and cauſed her huſband to be ſought for, in order that ſhe might be reſtored to him. This ſingle act of generoſity ſhould draw a veil over many of his faults.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have ſeen Alexander triumphing by a courſe of virtue, we are now to behold him ſwollen up by ſucceſs, ſpoiled by flattery, and enervated by vices, exhibiting a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful character, and mixing the tyrant with the hero. Upon a charge of a real or imaginary plot againſt him, he firſt put Philotas to death, and afterwards the father, Parmenio, who was at the time of his death ſeventy years of age,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026819_0127_101373450901B9A0"/>and had ſerved his maſter with fidelity and zeal, which in the end was thus rewarded. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thus uniting in his perſon at once great cruelty and great enterprize, ſtill marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſearch of new nations, whom he might ſubdue.</p>
               <p>Having ſubdued the Maſſage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ae, the Dahae, and other nations, he entered the province of Barſaria, from thence he advanced to Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander, and appointed Clitus governor of that province. This was an old officer, who had fought under Philip, and ſignalized himſelf on many occaſions. At the battle of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous, as Alexander was fighting bareheaded, and Raſaces had his arm raiſed, in order to ſtrike him behind, Clitus covered the king with his ſhield, and cut off the barbarian's hard.— This favour, however, only advanced Clitus to a poſt of greater danger. One evening, as an entertainment, the king, after drinking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, began to celebrate his own exploits, in a manner which ſhocked all his old generals. Clitus, who was alſo intoxicated, contradicted Alexander in all his aſſertions, and ſung, with an air of inſolence, verſes reflecting highly on the price, who ſeeing the general near him, he ſtruck him dead with a javelin. The king had no ſooner murdered his faithful ſervant, than he perceived the atrociouſneſs of the act; he threw himſelf upon the dead body, forced out the javelin, and would have deſtroyed himſelf, had he not been prevented by his guards, who ſeized and carried him forcibly to his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026819_0128_10137347282E1260"/>where the flattery and perſuaſions of his friends at length ſerved to alleviate his remorſe. Alexander, in order to divert his melancholy, aſſembled his army, and marched in purſuit of new conqueſts.</p>
               <p>He advanced into India, which having never been a warlike nation, he ſubdued it with the rapididity rather of a traveller than a conqueror. Numberleſs petty ſtates ſubmitted to him, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that his ſtay would be ſhort, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts evaneſcent. Sailing down the river In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, and conquering every thing in his way, he at laſt come to the country of the Oxydraci and the Mallis, the moſt valiant people in the Eaſt. However, Alexander defeated them in ſeveral engagements, diſpoſſeſſing them of their ſtrong holds, and at laſt marched againſt their capital city, where the greateſt part of their forces were retired. It was upon this occaſion, that ſeizing a ſcaling ladder, himſelf firſt mounted the wall, followed only by two of his officers. His attendants believing him to be in danger, mounted ſwiftly to ſuccour him; but the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der breaking, he was left alone. It was now that his raſhneſs became his ſafety; for leaping from the wall into the city, which was crowded with enemies, ſword in hand, he repulſed ſuch as were neareſt, and even killed the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who advanced in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near, he received all the darts of the enemy in a ſhield, and kept even the boldeſt at a diſtance. At laſt, an Indian diſcharging an arrow of three feet
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026819_0129_1013734973485390"/>long, it pierced his coat of mail and his right breaſt, and ſo great a quantity of blood iſſued from the wound, that he dropped his arms, and lay as dead. The Indian came to ſtrip him, ſuppoſing him really what he appeared: but Alexander that inſtant recalled his ſpirits, and plunged a dagger in his ſide. By this time, a part of the king's attendants came to his ſuccour, and forming themſelves round his body, till his ſoldiers without found means of burſting the gates, ſaved him, and put all the inhabitants, without diſtinction, to the ſword.</p>
               <p>The wound which at firſt ſeemed dangerous, having, in the ſpace of ſix or ſeven days, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a more favourable appearance, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mounted his horſe, and ſhewed himſelf to the army, who ſeemed to view him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable pleaſure. Then continuing his voyage, and ſubduing the country on each ſide, as he paſſed along, the pilots perceived from the ſwell of the river, that the ſea could not be far diſtant; and they informed the king, that they already felt the breezes of the ocean. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much aſtoniſhed the Macedonian ſoldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the gentle floods of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, they were amazed when they ſaw the Indus riſe to a great heighth, and overflrow the country, which they conſidered as a mark of divine reſentment. They were no leſs terrified ſome hours afterwards, when they ſaw the river forſake its banks, and leave thoſe lands unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which it had ſo lately overflowed. Thus,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:026819_0130_1013734B1CDCE2B0"/>after a voyage of nine months, he at laſt ſtood upon the ſhore; and after having offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacrifices to Neptune, and looked wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the immenſe expanſe of waters before him, he is ſaid to have wept for having no more worlds left to conquer. Here he put an end to his excurſions; and, having appointed Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus admiral of his fleet with orders to coaſt along the Indian ſhore as far as the Perſian gulf, he ſet out with his army for babylon.</p>
               <p>His army ſuſtained incredible hardſhips on their return: paſſing through a country deſtitute of all ſorts of proviſions, they were obliged to feaſt on the beaſts of burden, and were forced to burn thoſe rich ſpoils, for the ſake of which they had encountered ſo many dangers. Thoſe diſeaſes alſo, that generally accompany famine, compleated their calamity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them in great numbers: but the king's fortitude appeared to great advantage on this occaſion. The army being in abſolute want of water, ſome ſoldiers were ſent to endeavor to find out a ſpring. They fortunetely fell upon one; but it yielded them but a very ſmall quantity of water. With what they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the ſoldiers returned rejoicing to the king, who, inſtead of drinking it, poured it upon the ground, unwilling that his ſoldiers ſhould ſuſtain a calamity, in which he refuſed to bear a part. This generous act inſpired the ſoldiery with freſh ſpirits.</p>
               <p>After a march of ſixty days, they arrived in the province of Gedroſis, the fertility of which
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:026819_0131_10137355B77B04A8"/>ſoon baniſhed from the minds of the ſoldiery all their former difficulties. Alexander paſſed through the country, not in the military pomp of a conqueror, but in the licentious diſguiſe of an enthuſiaſt: ſtill willing to imitate Bacchus, he was drawn by eight horſes, on a ſcaffold in the form of a ſquare ſtage, where he ſpent the days and nights in feaſting. Along the roads where he paſſed, were placed caſks of wine in great abundance, and theſe the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers drained in honour of their mock deity. The whole country echoed with the ſound of inſtruments, and the howling of bacchanals, who, with their hair diſhevelled, and frantic mirth, ran up and down, abandoning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every kind of lewdneſs. This vice produced one of a much more formidable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the king's mind; for it always inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his paſſions to cruelty, and the executioner generally crowned the feaſt.</p>
               <p>After various combats, conqueſts, cruelties, follies, and exceſſes, Alexander arrived at Babylon. On his approach to the city, many ſiniſter omens were obſerved; on which account the Chaldeans, who pretended to foreſee future events, attempted to perſuade him not to enter that city. The Greek philoſophers, on the other hand, diſplayed the futility of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Babylon was a theatre for him to diſplay his glory on; and ambaſſadors from all the nations he had conquered were there in readineſs to celebrate his triumphs. After mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt magnificent entry, he gave audience
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:026819_0132_1013735816A8FAC8"/>to the ambaſſadors with a grandeur and dignity ſuitable to his power, yet with the affability and politeneſs of a private courtier.</p>
               <p>Alexander, finding Babylon, in extent and conveniency Iupperior to all other cities of the Eaſt, he reſolved to make it the ſeat of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and for that purpoſe was deſirable of adding to it all the ornaments poſſible. Though he was much employed in projects of this kind, and in ſchemes beyond human power to execute, he ſpent the greater part of his time in ſuch pleaſures as this magnificent city afforded; but his pleaſures often terminated in licentiouſneſs and riot. The recollection of the cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which he had put a period to the lives of ſome of his beſt friends and favourites feſtered in his mind, and caſt a thick gloom over his ſpirits; to diſſipate which, required the application of ſome very powerful remedy. The remedy, to which he had recourſe, was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</hi> He was, of courſe frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to banquets, at which he drank ſo immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as often to have no command left of himſelf.</p>
               <p>On a particular occaſion, having ſpent the whole night in a debauch, a ſecond was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: he accepted the invitation, and drank to ſuch exceſs, that he fell upon the floor, to appearance dead, and in this lifeleſs manner was carried, a ſad ſpectacle of debauchery, to his palace. The fever continued, with ſome intervals, in which he gave the neceſſary orders for the ſailing of the fleet, and the marching
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:026819_0133_1013735C05AACE40"/>of his land forces, being perſuaded he ſhoud ſoon recover. But at laſt, finding himſelf paſt hopes, and his voice beginning to fail, be gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his corps to the temple of Ammon. He ſtruggled, however, with death for ſome time, and raiſing himſelf upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the ſoldiers, who preſſed to kiſs it. Being then aſked to whom he would leave his empire, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "To the moſt worthy." Perdiccas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enquiring at what time he ſhould pay him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honours, he replied, "When you are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py." With theſe words he expired, being thirty-two years and eight months old, of which he had reigned twelve, with more fortune than virtue.</p>
               <p>By the death of this illuſtrious conqueror were fulfilled many of the prophecies of the ſacred writers. One of them is ſingularly ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: "The temple of Belus ſhall be broken down to the ground, never to raiſe from its ruins." That the word of God might ſtand firm, Alexander is cut off, at the very inſtant he is preparing to rebuild that temple, and to raiſe Babylon to its wanted ſplendour. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander left one ſon, named Hercules, who was born of Barſine, the daughter of Artabazus, and widow of Memnon. Both Roxana and Statira are ſaid to have been left pregnant.</p>
               <p>In whatever light we view this monarch, we ſhall find little to admire, and leſs to imitate. That courage, for which he was celebrated, is but a ſubordinate virtue; that fortune, which
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:026819_0134_1013735D9925DDC0"/>conſtantly attended him, was but an accidental advantage; that diſcipline, which prevailed in his army, was produced and cultivated by his father; but his intemperance, his cruelty, his vanity, his paſſion for uſeleſs conqueſts, were all his own. His victories, however, ſerved to crown the pyramid of Grecian glory; they ſerved to ſhow, to what a degree the arts of peace can promote thoſe of war. In this picture, we view a combination of petty ſtates, by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the reſt of the world united, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mankind an example of the ſuperiority of intellect over brutal force.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER having. by his laſt words, bequeathed his empire "to the moſt worthy," men who had been accuſtomed to rule with abſolute power, in diſtant, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, populous, and wealthy provinces, muſt have been highly pleaſed to find, that their ſovereign's will threw no bar in their way to dominion or power. There was one, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who appeared to have an extraordinary claim to diſtinction: Perdiccas, to whom Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, in his laſt moments, had delivered his royal ſignet. Poſſeſſed of merit, equal at leaſt to that of his competitors, this adventitious circumſtance might ſeem to have given him a
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:026819_0135_101373619185B3D8"/>ſuperior title to the vaſt object in queſtion; but his rivals were too proud to ſuffer an equal to be exalted above them, without throwing ſome embarraſſment in his way; and too fond of power to beſtow a title to an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, without advancing their own pretenſions. Accordingly they all remonſtrated, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Perdicca's elevation; and, finding that they were not likely to ſucceed in their private ſchemes, by acting intereſtedly, they reſolved to overturn his, by acting juſtly, in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the claims of the lawful heirs to the crown. Theſe were Hercules, the ſon of Alexander; and Aridaeus, Alexander's own brother. There was little or no conteſt about Aridaeus's right to a ſhare in the ſovereignty. He had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be inſane; and that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, perhaps more than his conſanguinity to the king, procured him an eaſy admiſſion to the throne. The right of Hercules was not ſo readily recognized: his mother was not of royal extraction; and as Alexander had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhewn a preference to Roxana and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira, and had, moreover, omitted to mention Hercules in his laſt hours, his title was at once ſet aſide; but the excluſive right to the throne was not to be granted to one perſon. It was therefore judged proper, by all the leading men, to divide the ſovereignty between Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus and the child to be born of Roxana, ſhould it prove a ſon. This appointment was eaſily acceded to, as the government that was naturally to be expected from it, would have fall ſcope for the exerciſe of avarice and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026819_0136_1013736937251890"/>This ſettlement being made, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious competitors for the Macedonian empire retired to their reſpective employments.</p>
               <p>Roxana being delivered of a ſon, whom they named Alexander, Olympias had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to take charge of her infant grandſon, and to ſanction the new adminiſtration of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon by her preſence. On her arrival at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, ſhe firſt let loſe her ſavage revenge on Aridaeus, and his queen Eurydice. Aridaeus, the ſon of Philip by a concubine had from his infancy been ſubjected to that averſion and hatred from Olympias, which the relationſhip that ſubſiſted between her and him naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. The infirmity of his underſtanding was ſaid to have been the effect of a potion, which ſhe gave him. Cyna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, the mother of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus' queen, had been murdered at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of Olympias. Amyntas, her father the ſon of Philip the Firſt's elder brother, had alſo been deſtroyed through her contrivance: ſo that neither Aridaeus, nor Eurydice his wife, could be ſuppoſed to look upon her with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence. Indeed, they had every reaſon to apprehend bad conſequences from her getting into power, and they ſet themſelves to provide for the worſt. Eurydice raiſed an army, and marched to meet Olympias; but on the two armies meeting, the troops of Eurydice went over to the ſtandard of Olympias, and Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus and his queen fell into her hands.</p>
               <p>Olympias perſecuted the royal couple with all that unrelenting hatred which mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſpoſition: they were confined to a
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:026819_0137_1013736ACEF9C938"/>priſon, which was ſo ſmall, that they could ſcarcely turn themſelves in it. Their wretched ſuſtenance was thrown in at a little hole, through which paſſed light and air, and all the other limitted comforts they were permitted to enjoy. Percerving that this barbarous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no other effect than to excite the compaſſion of the people, and fearing that their commiſeration would ſoon be converted into indignation towards her, ſhe reſolved to put a period to the miſerable exiſtence of her priſoners. She inſtructed ſome Thracians to enter the priſon, and diſpatch Aridaeus, which they did without remorſe. He had reigned ſix years and four months.</p>
               <p>This inhuman action being perpetrated, Olympias ſent meſſengers to the queen, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a poinard, a rope, and a cup of poiſon, deſiring her to chooſe which ſhe pleaſed. They found her binding up the wounds of her bleeding ſpouſe, with linen which ſhe had torn from her own body, and paying all that decent and ſolemn reſpect to the lifeleſs corſe, which became her deplorable ſituation. She received the meſſage that was brought to her with the greateſt compoſure; and, after entreating the gods, that Olympias might be rewarded with the like preſent, ſhe took the rope, and ſtrangled herſelf. Thus were that hapleſs pair cut off. Olympias had now ſeen a period to the life of Aridaeus, whom ſhe had long ſince deprived of every rational en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, by robbing him of his underſtanding; and ſhe had completed the ruin of Eurydice
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026819_0138_1013736DF4E941F0"/>and her family, by conſigning her to an end ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to that, which her violent and vindictive paſſions had formerly procured to her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate parents. Nor was her thirſt of blood yet quenched: for he cauſed Nicanor, the brother of Caſſander, to be put to death. The body of Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s, another brother of Caſſander, which had long reſted in the tomb, ſhe had brought forth, and expoſed on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and an hundred Macedonians of noble birth were ſeized and executed, on ſuſpicion of having been in the intereſt of Caſſander. At laſt, however, the fortune of war threw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power of Caſſander, who delivered her into the hands of thoſe whoſe kindred ſhe had murdered, and who thereupon cut her throat.</p>
               <p>The furious contentions that now ſubſiſted among the ambitious ſurviving captains of Alexander, deluged Greece in blood, and brought on the moſt unnatural murders. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe horrid and unnatural ſcenes we have already deſcribed, Roxana and her ſop Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander were impriſoned, and treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and Hercules, the ſon of Alexander by Bartine, the only remaining branch of the royal family, was murdered about two years after. Nor more than twenty eight years had elapſed ſince the death of Alexander, and not a ſingle branch of his houſe remained to enjoy a portion of that empire, which Philip and his ſon had acquired at the price of the greateſt policy, dangers, and bloodſhed. Such, to the royal family of Macedon, were the effects

               <p>Among the laſt kings of Macedon, was Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, ſon of Demetrius. He had two ſons, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus and Demetrius; the former of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the latter of a deſign to aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perſeus took care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch evidence againſt his brother, as might not fail of convicting him, and Demetrius was accordingly put to death. Philip, when too late, diſcovered that he had been impoſed upon by a forgery, and died of a broken heart. He was ſucceeded by his ſon Perſeus, who, ſome time after, was taken priſoner by the Romans, led in triumph through the ſtreets of Rome, and then thrown into a dungeon, where he ſtarved himſelf to death.</p>
               <p>The fatal diſſention among the Grecian chiefs expoſed them to the inroads of every neighbouring power. The Romans, after the defeat of Perſeus, eſtabliſhed a new form of government in Macedon. The whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was divided into four diſtricts; the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of each were to have no connection, intermarriage, or exchange of poſſeſſions, with thoſe of the other diſtricts; and, among other regulations tendings to reduce them to a ſtate of the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="unknown:026819_0141_1013737942AC2C70"/>were expoſed to the incurſions of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Triumphal games at Amphipolis, to which all the neighbouring nations, both Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans and Aſiatics, were invited, announced the extended dominion of Rome, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation not only of Macedon, but of all Greece; for the Romans now found nothing in that part of the world that was able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.</p>
               <p>Greece, now ſunk in that maſs of nations which compoſed the Roman empire, had loſt every veſtige of national exiſtence; and, while ſhe was excluded from all participation in the proſperity of her conquerors, ſhe ſhared deeply in her misfortunes. The civil wars of Rome drenched Greece with blood; and, when that war was concluded, whoever had not appeared on the ſide of the victor, was conſidered as his enemy. Greece, in common with the other Roman provinces, had ſuffered many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions under the emperors, and from the repeated invaſions of barbarians, when the acceſſion of Conſtantine the Great to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial throne, ſeemed to promiſe to the Grecian annals a new aera of glory, and ſome comfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for their paſt misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The hopes of Greece, however, were even here diſappointed; for Conſtantine, by dividing his dominions among his three ſons, involved the empire in the flames of civil war; and his ſon Julian, who at loſt prevailed, overturned every thing his father had done. He was unable to protect the public proſperity, undermined by the deſpotiſm of a military government, and a
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:026819_0142_1013737E23555960"/>general puſillanimity of manners. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited attacks on the empire on every ſide. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian was forced to yield a conſiderable territory to the Perſian monarch. In Britain, the Roman ramparts were oppoſed in vain to the hardy valour of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orth; even the legionary troops had been found unable to ſuſtain the ſhocks of the unconquered Caledonians. The German tribes renewed their inroads into Gaul; Africa rebelled, and a ſpirit of diſcontent and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection began to appear among the barbarian tribes on the Danube. In the reign of the Emperor Valens, the Huns, a new tribe of barbarians, in manners and aſpect more horrid than any that had yet appeared on the Roman frontiers, plundered and drove from their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements the Gothic tribes on the further ſide of the Danube. Gratian, nephew and heir to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, ſhared the empire with Theodoſius, whom the calamities of the times raiſed to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the whole. The abilities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal valour of this prince beſtowed on the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire an appearance of vigour during his reign; but his ſons Arcadius and Honorius, between whom he divided the empire, brought up in the boſom of a luxurious palace, and ſunk in effeminacy, were unequal to the taſk of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an empire weakened by diviſion. The reign of Honorius concluded the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the Eaſt Alaric, the Gothic chief, who, twenty-five years before, deemed it an honour to bear arms on the ſide of the empire, was adorned with the imperial purple.

The chief inhabitants were thoſe families who, during the incurſions of the barbarians, had made their eſcape to the mountains.

               <p>However, even in the midſt of war, devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſlavery, Greece continued long to be the ſeat of philoſophy and the fine arts. Whatever conjectures may be formed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advancement of ſcience in India and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:026819_0144_10137382B4F06DE0"/>in Egypt, it is certain, that Greece was the country which enlightened, exalted, and adorned the reſt of Europe, and ſet an example of whatever is beautiful and great. It was the genius of Greece that formed thoſe very poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and heroes, who firſt bent her lofty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under the yoke of foreign dominion. It was in Thebes, under the tuition of Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas, that her heroes were trained to a love of glory, and of all thoſe arts and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both peace and war, by which it is beſt attained. It was a Grecian philoſopher who taught Alexander how to manage the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and govern the minds of men; while the writings of Homer, by a moſt powerful contagion, inſpired his mind with a contempt of danger and death in the purſuit of glory.— As the light of Greece illuminated her Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian, ſo it ſpread over her Roman conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Philoſophy, literature, and arts, began to follow glory and empire to Rome in the times of Sylla and Lucullus, and, in their progreſs, drew to different ſchools every man of rank and faſhion in Italy. Wealth, luxury, and corruption, and at laſt tyranny, baniſhed it from Rome; but while it laſted, it made up, in ſome degree, for the want of liberty; if it were unable to reſiſt oppreſſive power, it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the mind in the midſt of ſufferings.— Even in the worſt of times, when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire was in the laſt period of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
