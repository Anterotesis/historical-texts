            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS it ſeem, it has not been thought either indecent or unfair to renew the attacks upon Mr. Littlepage's character, <hi>in his abſence,</hi> it is become neceſſary, to make a general collection of the ſucceſſive publication of that gentleman. Anſwers will be found in them to every thing which has been advanced, or can be further ſaid upon the ſubject of his conteſt with Mr. Jay, as far as relates to the <hi>original letters,</hi> on either part.<note n="*" place="bottom">As theſe letters have been lately publiſhed, and may now be had of the Printer, a re-publication of them is judged unneceſſary.</note> At the ſame time a ſhort preliminary recapitulation of the circumſtances which preceded and led to the diſcuſſion, will ſerve to place, in the cleareſt point of view, not only the propriety and conſiſtency, but even <hi>neceſſity</hi> of his conduct, in the appeal which he firſt made to the Public.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of November, 1785, Mr. Littlepage arrived in New-York, and the ſame day wrote the following letter to Mr. Jay.</p>

                  <p>I Had the honor to call at your Excellency's houſe this evening, to pay you my reſpects, and at the ſame time to <hi>inform you that every exertion has been made, on my part, to acquit myſelf of my pecuniary obligations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</hi> I am ſorry to add, that accumulated embaraſſments prevented me from accompliſhing it <hi>before</hi> my departure from Virginia, where I arrived only in July laſt, <hi>and am at preſent on my return to Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have, however, taken <hi>explicit arrangements with my uncle on that head, and am AUTHORISED to make you the moſt poſsitive aſſurances on his part, that your re-imburſement ſhall not be delayed longer than circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances render unavoidable.</hi> I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>To that letter Mr. Littlepage received no anſwer, and although he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repeatedly ſaw Mr. Jay, nothing further paſſed upon the ſubject; the only concluſion which he could draw from that conduct, was, that Mr. Jay was ſatisfied with the aſſurances he had received, or did not think <hi>perſonal engagements</hi> from Mr. Littlepage neceſſary; ſuch, if requeſted, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to take, as both his <hi>time</hi> and <hi>circumſtances then permitted.</hi>

On the 25th November, Mr. Littlepage ſent to Mr. Jay, in quality of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary for foreign affairs, a letter of recommendation in his favor from his CATHOLIC MAJESTY, addreſſed to his Excellency the <hi>Preſident of Congreſs;</hi> accompanied by ſeveral other letters from different Generals in the ſervice of Spain and France. Mr. Jay having in conſequence intimated to Mr. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, that it would be proper for him, at the ſame time, to <hi>communicate</hi> his <hi>views</hi> and <hi>deſires</hi> from Congreſs, he replied by the following letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  <p>THE Miniſter of his Catholic Majeſty will deliver to you differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent letters of recommendation in my favor, which I requeſt may be laid before Congreſs, and the originals, or atteſted copies of them, returned to me. Encouraged by the condeſcention of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> King, who has deigned to recommend me to Congreſs, the requeſt which I take the liberty of making to them, will not, I hope, be deemed importunate or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous.</p>
                  <p>The character of a CITIZEN of AMERICA, I conſider as the firſt of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; to ſerve my country is my higheſt ambition, to merit her eſteem would be my nobleſt recompence; but as America has happily no farther occaſion for the exertions of military zeal, Congreſs, I hope, will not think my conduct inconſiſtent with the duty of a citizen of the United States, when I inform them that my intention is to return to Europe, where ſome years of my future life will be devoted to the ſervice of a monarch. The name of the KING of POLAND reflects ſufficient honor upon all who boaſt his patronage: Of his eſteem, at leaſt, I ſhould think myſelf aſſured, under the ſanction of a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Permit me then, Sir, to requeſt, that you will officially notify to Congreſs that, <hi>if not incompatible with the principles of the conſtitution, or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi> I humbly petition them to honor me with <hi>a letter of recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> addreſſed to his POLISH MAJESTY.

            <p>Only the demand reſpecting <hi>any reward</hi> from the Catholic King, could be either proper or neceſſary;—and upon that point Mr. Jay ſtood in need of <hi>no information;</hi>—Mr. Littlepage, however, returned an explicit and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory anſwer to the whole: His uneaſineſs having been increaſed at being informed that an adjournment of Congreſs would take place in two days time, from that abſence of ſome of the members, he wrote to Mr. Jay, informing him of that circumſtance, intreating him to conſider the emergency of his affairs and re-iterating his ſolicitations for him to ſend in his report to Congreſs immediately.</p>
            <p>In the evening of the 2d December Mr. Littlepage was informed that the adjournment of Congreſs had <hi>that day</hi> taken place, and nothing had been done in his buſineſs!!!</p>
            <p>He then began to penetrate into the myſtery of Mr. Jay's conduct; but, however ſhocked at a ſimilar proſtitution of <hi>public duty</hi> to <hi>private animoſity,</hi> he confined his expoſtulations to a letter, requeſting Mr. Jay "to <hi>return him, if poſſible, the papers in queſtion,</hi> as he was ſtill under the neceſſity of not poſtponing his voyage to Europe, where the loſs of them might be infinitely prejudicial to him." He concluded by intreating Mr. Jay to remember, <hi>"that thoſe honorable atteſtations of his conduct were his only reward for ſome ſevere ſervice, and, at leaſt, a diſintereſted zeal in the cauſe of his country:—It could not ſurely be conſiſtent with the INTENTIONS OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESS,</hi> or, <hi>he hoped, with Mr. Jay's feelings, that he ſhould be DEPRIVED OF EVEN THEM."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day following he received an anſwer, informing him that the letters had been ſent to Congreſs, and could not be returned without <hi>their</hi> order.— The anſwer was on <hi>Saturday;</hi>—the packet was to ſail on <hi>Monday;</hi>—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs no longer exiſted as a body;—the cruel alternative to which Mr. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlepage was then reduced is too obvious to need farther explanation.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of his affairs in Europe would not, however, as yet permit him to heſitate upon the choice he had to make; but immediately after a new mine was ſprung againſt him: the <hi>ſame day,</hi> without the <hi>leaſt previous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> or even a <hi>demand having ever been made upon him,</hi> Mr. Littlepage
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020462_0006_0FAF10D241E8B948"/>was arreſted in his lodging, at the ſuit of Mr. Jay, for the ſum due to him by Bon. Lewis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> late guardian to Mr. Littlepage.</p>
            <p>Such an inſult to any gentleman would have loudly called for vengeance and reparation; but in that inſtance it was attended with many aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: —Mr. Littlepage was informed that the moſt malicious inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him had been infuſed into the minds of all diſpoſed to liſten to them: in a word, that the whole of Mr. Jay's proceedings was the reſult of a <hi>deelared enmity</hi> and <hi>premeditated deſign</hi> to <hi>injure,</hi> and, if poſſible, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> him in the eyes of the public.</p>
            <p>Thus perſecuted, inſulted, and juſtly exaſperated, Mr. Littlepage at laſt reſolved, notwithſtanding the public character of his enemy, to call him to a ſevere account; in conſequence he ſent him a challenge, which was refuſed: he then reſolved to appeal to the public, but by the mediation of a worthy friend to both parties, he was induced to demand once more an explanation: in conſequence he wrote the following letter to Mr. Jay:</p>

If ſuch was your intention, I certainly am at liberty to <hi>juſtify</hi> myſelf, and perhaps to <hi>retort</hi> upon you.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be happy to find myſelf miſtaken, and if you will condeſcend to explain your conduct, many diſagreeable things may be yet avoided. Your anſwer will be definitive. In the mean time, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>A PAMPHLET, containing my private correſpondence with John Jay, Eſquire, and publiſhed ſince my departure from America, has been tranſmitted to me.</p>
            <p>Confidence in the juſtice and impartiality of my country firſt induced me to appeal to her ſolemn tribunal; malice, perſecution and inſult, united in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering recrimination on my part but a juſt defence, and I have ſtill more, the ſatisfaction to think that I have given an uſeful leſſon to the world, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking a character, which hypocriſy and diſſimulation had ſo long concealed. The ſhafts of calumny, I dare hope, have been long blunted againſt my fame; and I ſhould think myſelf degraded by entering into a further juftification, was it not to convince my fellow-citizens, that no ſituation in the European world can diminiſh the ſubmiſſion and reſpect which I ſhall ever pay to their judgment: To merit their eſteem will ever be my higheſt ambition; my firſt duty is, to leave on unſpotted name amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Had the publication of my correſpondence with Mr. Jay been unſoiled by his obſervations, I ſhould have thought it needed on my part neither comment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020462_0009_0FAF10D4837C2A88"/>nor defence. It commences at an age, when few inferences are to be drawn from either opinion or conduct, which can juſtly affect the heart or morals. If, inſtead of the effuſions of a warm and grateful mind, that zeal for my country, that ardour for military fame, and enthuſiaſtic ſenſe of honor, which even my connexion with Mr. Jay could not extinguiſh, mine had been replete with the imprudent ſallies and <hi>inconſequential</hi> errors ſo common to my age; ſurely the voice of candour would ſtill heſitate to decide, until <hi>maturity</hi> ſhould either <hi>fix</hi> or <hi>obliterate</hi> the ſtain, which only at a <hi>certain period</hi> becomes <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> If it was intended to prove that I <hi>once</hi> thought differently of Mr. Jay, I entreat the Public to obſerve that I have never ceaſed to avow it; at an age of error I certainly eſteemed him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part approaches nearer to manhood. It contains ſome ripened ideas upon Mr. Jay, joined to ſome warm expoſtulations with him for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards me, dictated by ſentiments as void of art as the expreſſions which convey them. But there, too, his malignity has been baffled to point out one line which can be juſtly conſtrued into a breach of honor, and ſtill leſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, Even the pitiful ſubterfuge which he at laſt found, may be conſidered as no light encomium upon my character. I am accuſed, it ſeems, of having dared to reproach him with injuſtice and cruelty, during a ſcene of diſtreſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to my ſituation in <hi>Minorca,</hi> and my letters to him in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> which will for ever remain engraved in my memory. Does he from thence, too, pretend a freſh claim to my gratitude? Would not his conduct, on the contrary, have even juſtified me, in conſidering every <hi>paſt obligation as cancelled,</hi> and might I not here appeal to the ſympathy and indignation of the world?</p>
            <p>Upon another occaſion, I recollect, he has inſinuated that I acted the part of <hi>an incendiary, to pay court to him, and render his advances more liberal.</hi> He will hardly deny, that at the period alluded to, I ſtood in infinitely more need of his liberality, and ſtill the public has ſeen that I proved, at beſt, but a <hi>ſnarling courtier.</hi> I confeſs I am even at a loſs to conceive his motives for laying that part of our correſpondence before the public; was it to prove his <hi>generoſity,</hi> or PATRIOTISM? In the firſt inſtance, a youth of no unpromiſing diſpoſitions, confided to his care and friendſhip, who had been guilty of no diſhonorable, or even imprudent act,—at whoſe reputation, on the contrary, he himſelf rejoiced;<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide his firſt letter to me at Mahon, No. 27 of his pamphlet. <hi>"You are well ſpoken of, and I rejoice to hear it."</hi> That letter was written <hi>after</hi> he had <hi>proteſted my bill</hi> in favor of Mr. Harriſon; although <hi>without even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting me</hi> with that circumſtance.</note>—ought ſurely to have had ſome claim to the common rights of <hi>humanity,</hi> if not to <hi>friendſhip</hi> and <hi>indulgence.</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:020462_0010_0FAF10D5868C9320"/>
The concluſion reſulting from the ſecond ſtate of the queſtion is infinitely more ſerious: in that I am to be conſidered only in the character of a <hi>citizen of America;—the firſt</hi> ever <hi>recognized</hi> as ſuch by the court of Spain, at a moſt critical aera in politics;—the firſt Proteſtant who was ever publicly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to ſerve in the army of the Catholic King:—In a word, placed in a ſituation which, inſignificant as I was, had attracted the attention of part of Europe upon me:—at a juncture like that, did it become A MINISTER OF THE UNITED STATES, after having himſelf ſolicited my admiſſion into the family of the commander in chief, both from the miniſter of ſtate,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide his letter to the court of Florida-Blanca, of the 17th, and to the Count de Montmorin, of the 24th of June, <hi>1781,</hi> contained in No. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> and the ambaſſador of France; after acknowledging the ſervice,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide his letter to Benjamin Lewis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> No, <hi>14,</hi> "Gentlemen of weight and diſtinction adviſed me to conſent to his going," and adding <hi>"that it would ſerve the American cauſe,"</hi> and juſt before, "ſo popular did his application ſoon promiſe, and indeed begin to be, that ſome, on whoſ attachment he had no great reaſon to rely, &amp;c. &amp;c." alluding, I ſuppoſe to Mr. Carmichael.</note> which I rendered to my country; did it become him, I again repeat, to abandon me, deprive me of all credit and reſources, and reduce me to the hard neceſſity of <hi>rearing,</hi> in the midſt of the campaign, or derogating from my <hi>own honor</hi> and the <hi>dignity of my country,</hi> by imploring the charity of ſtrangers?— Theſe conſiderations were ſo obvious that the only citizen of America at hand, although perſonally almoſt a ſtranger to me, nobly exerted himſelf in what <hi>had then</hi> become a <hi>public cauſe;</hi> whilſt the <hi>repreſentative of Congreſs,</hi> with the trifling ſalary of 2,500<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling per annum, held back, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to cavil <hi>at expreſſions,</hi> until finding the campaign drawing towards a concluſion, and himſelf in want of a private ſecretary, he condeſcended to forgive my complaints, and, by an unheard of effort of generoſity, made me a remittance of 20 guineas.</p>
            <p>For my own part, although I regard the campaign in Minorca as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt trial of my youth, I ſhall ever look back to it with the pleaſing ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a mind unconſcious of reproach, and even elate with triumph. At that criſis, I confeſs, I conſidered myſelf as much a repreſentative of my country as her well-paid miniſter;—That idea alone added enthuſiaſm to ambition;—the latter may lead to glory, but the firſt urges to martyrdom. Perhaps, I may add, conſidering my ſituation, the motives which animated me, and the difficulties I had to encounter, my countrymen may conceive ideas of my principles and character very different from thoſe which my adverſary has long laboured to infuſe. In juſtice, however, to the many elevated cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020462_0011_0FAF10D61F0E2260"/>who honored-me with their friendſhip in the army of Spain, I muſt declare, that, could I have ſubmitted even to accept their preſſing and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated offers, that part of my diſcuſſion with Mr. Jay would have been abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the public not expoſed to the indecency of ſeeing even my ſervant's accounts laid before them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide No. <hi>

            <p>With reſpect to my letter of the 15th June, 1781, I can only repeat what I have advanced in my publication of the 7th Dec. laſt, in which the ſecret ſprings of Mr. Jay's political machine are diſplayed to view. That I was moſt egregiouſly <hi>duped</hi> in the whole of that tranſaction I have never ſcrupled to confeſs:—without (unfortunately) entertaining at that time the ſmalleſt doubt upon Mr. Jay's veracity. I certainly expected a more <hi>explicit anſwer</hi> from him to accuſations which I had produced upon his <hi>own authority:</hi> That letter, he does not deny, was written at <hi>his own requeſt, to ſerve as a proof of the charges contained in it, in defence of BOTH OUR CHARAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS:</hi>

               </note> conſequently the ſame motives, which rendered ſuch teſtimony of importance to <hi>him,</hi> gave me a right to expect that his reply would be ſo far conſonant to it as to afford me the ſame advantage. His manner of evading it is equally ſingular and <hi>characteriſic: "As to the minute particulars you mention,</hi> MY FEELINGS ARE TOO MUCH AWAKENED TO HAZARD <hi>any other reflection on them at preſent,</hi> &amp;c."<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. No. <hi>13, p. 13,</hi> it his anſwer to my letter of the 15th June.</note> Does this convey the moſt diſtant hint of his <hi>requiring further proof</hi> of thoſe facts, or doubting of their authenticity? Does not, on the contrary, his expreſſion of fearing to <hi>hazard</hi> a reply upon a ſubject, which had too much <hi>awakened his feelings,</hi> imply that he avoided entering into it, leſt, notwithſtanding his natural apathy, he ſhould be tranſported beyond the bounds of decorum? This artful diſplay of warmth and <hi>ſympathetic</hi> indignation, it is evident was calculated to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my paſſions, to ſooth and blind me to his purpoſe.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:020462_0012_0FAF10D6DB345B00"/>
That he may not, however, be again led into an error, which has already proved fatal to him, of relying too much upon his ſuppoſed <hi>inviſibility</hi> in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar tranſactions, I ſhall once more condeſcend to anſwer his arguments upon that letter.</p>
            <p>The paragraph which he has ſelected from the reſt to diſplay his logic, is that in which I mention that "attempts were made to render me diſcontented with him, and at the ſame time to ſeduce me into purſuits which would tend to prejudice me in his opinion." The latter part I explained in a ſhort note up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my publication of the 7th December, to which I muſt refer.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>"Gallantry:"</hi>—The recording angel, I hope, has dropped a tear and blotted it out forever.</note> As to the attempts alluded to in another ſenſe, ſince it ſeems the moſt trifling of my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile adventures are of importance to the public, they were briefly theſe. In the courſe of my correſpondence with Mr. Jay, it has been that I frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance, as one of the motives which firſt induced me to leave his family, the <hi>painful obſcurity</hi> in which I was ſecluded, and which I even regarded as an obſtacle to my <hi>political hopes.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide No. <hi>35.</hi> my letter to Benjamin Lewis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> In one of my letters, I expreſsly declare that all intercourſe with <hi>Spaniards</hi> was at that time <hi>difficult,</hi> and, to me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally IMPOSSIBLE.<note n="§" place="bottom">Vide the ſame letter.</note> Conſequently the information which I <hi>then</hi> gave Mr. Jay of Mr. Carmichael's machinations againſt him in Madrid, muſt have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to very little. In the mean time I was not abſolutely upon ſuch terms with Mr. Carmichael as to exclude common civility between us; and he even more than once, apologized for not introducing me into the circle of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, under pretext that it would give umbrage to Mr. Jay. The <hi>latter,</hi> I muſt add, he frequently inſinuated, <hi>had his reaſons</hi> for not procuring me more extenſive connexions. But whether he believed theſe motives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſyſtem of <hi>economy</hi> or <hi>politics,</hi> for every thing had a tincture of the latter, I really cannot determine. For my own part, I ſhould never have conſtrued thoſe <hi>inuendos</hi> into <hi>attempts</hi> to render me <hi>diſcontented</hi> with Mr. Jay, had he not at the ſame time informed me that Mr. Carmichael laboured to <hi>prepoſſeſs even him</hi> againſt me, by <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>inſidious reports.</hi>
               <note n="X" place="bottom">

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:020462_0013_0FAF10D94C1ADC98"/>
But to return once more to the point in queſtion: Whatever might have been Mr. Carmichael's views in his inſinuations to me, I confeſs I never thought I had reaſon to complain of Mr. Jay in that particular. The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſguſt which that able negociator had ſound means to inſpire into all ranks of Spaniards, had reduced him to almoſt a ſtate of ſolitude in the midſt of the moſt hoſpitable capital of Europe. Even that circumſtance contributed to inſlame his jealouſy and reſentment againſt Mr. Carmichael, to whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues he imputed it; and it muſt be confeſſed the perſonal addreſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating talents of the latter, formed a moſt ſtriking contraſt with his own aukward dignity and natural phlegm. Never, I cannot forbear obſerving, was a negociation conducted with ſuch frivolous, and ſometimes ridiculous circumſtances, as that which Mr. Jay at laſt terminated, like the defence of his character, in, literally, NOTHING. Syſtems adopted and changed—plots, counter-plots, and machinations of every kind employed;—in ſhort, every wheel of political machinery put in motion—not to penetrate the Spaniſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but <hi>his own ſecretary!!!</hi> The object, after all, ſeldom extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conjectures upon a <hi>converſation,</hi> or concluſions from a <hi>viſit.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, particularly, were deemed of ſuch importance, that one would have thought the treaty between America and Spain depended more upon <hi>viſiting-cards</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In one of Mr. Jay's ſhorteſt letters to Congreſs, of <hi>80</hi> pages in folio, I remember he dwells particularly upon the important circumſtance of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>"drank a diſh of chocolate"</hi> with D. Bernardo del Campo, firſt under ſecretary.</note> than <hi>miniſierial propoſitions.</hi> The public will eaſily conceive this in a genius ſo univerſal and comprehenſive, who could at once attend to the great intereſts of the country he repreſented, and to my ſervants accounts; who could at the ſame time diſcuſs the articles of a treaty, and write me a letter in forty pages, to prove what he ought to have ſaid ſix months before.</p>
            <p>But, after having ſo greatly contributed to the amuſement and edification of the public by this diſplay of his character and eloquence, in his diſſertation upon <hi>one</hi> part of my letter, why has he paſſed over the <hi>remainder</hi> in ſilence? The paragraph which follows is no leſs worthy of attention: "<hi>The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous falſehoods have been reported even to yourſelf by the</hi> SAME PERFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIOUS AND CRUEL AUTHOR." How did I come to the knowledge of theſe <hi>falſehoods</hi> reported to <hi>himſelf?</hi> He has quoted an anecdote, related in terms as ambiguous and obſcure as the receſſes of his ſoul: For my part, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect nothing of it; but even admitting the fact to have been ſuch as he has ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is <hi>one</hi> inſtance; I ſpeak in the <hi>plural</hi> number: Did he ever object to this ſevere and direct accuſation, for which, at leaſt, I could have no other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than his <hi>information?</hi> Did he ever <hi>blame,</hi> or requeſt me to <hi>mitigate</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:020462_0014_0FAF10DA67FEFBB0"/>the harſh terms of INFAMOUS FALSEHOODS, reported to HIMSELF, by a CRUEL and PERFIDIOUS AUTHOR, if all that had only reference to <hi>one</hi> charge, which <hi>he himſelf had occaſioned,</hi> and of which, to uſe his own words, <hi>"he did not believe Mr. Carmichael capable,"</hi> and ſtill more, "<hi>in which that gentleman had acted a part both</hi> HONORABLE and FRIENDLY to me?" To extinguiſh animoſities, and, above all, <hi>to rectify the miſtakes which occaſion them,</hi> is a duty to heaven and to mankind: But to kindle the flame of diſcord, to urge one man on to <hi>mortal enmity</hi> againſt another by <hi>falſe accuſations,</hi> afterwards to <hi>deny</hi> the fact, <hi>affect to miſunderſtand words, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſenſe,</hi> and conſign the whole to the public <hi>under a falſe colouring</hi>— merits an epithet which, fortunately for ſociety, is only to be found in the <hi>name of JAY.</hi>

               <hi>Frown, frown!—for bluſh thou canſt not!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, I muſt confeſs, I might have found ſome difficulty in extricating myſelf from this ſnare without the authority of his letter of the 29th Dec. 1781, * part of which I have quoted in my former publication. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that letter, it ſeams, is confined to <hi>one ſhort negative aſſertion,</hi> viz. That the facts alledged in it can only be conſidered as reſulting<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>p. 76,</hi> "They ſay nothing of Mr. Carmichael, but what ſprung from the letter in queſtion.</note> from my letter of the 15th June.</p>
            <p>I have been ſo long accuſtomed to the <hi>miraculous</hi> in Mr. Jay's character, that nothing on his part can appear to me either novel or aſtoniſhing. The public, perhaps, may be differently affected: What then, this man, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be great in all little things; this ſtateſman formed from the chaos of law and politics, this <hi>poiſonous worm of Machiavellian excrement;</hi> entangled in the ſnares of his own duplicity, is at length obliged to ſacrifice his vanity to the opinion of the world, and would willingly confeſs himſelf to have been the <hi>dupe of a boy, a beardleſs boy!! Riſum teneatis, amici?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more I muſt intreat the public to attend to the words of that letter of the 29th Dec. 1781. It will be eaſy to diſtinguiſh between what had reference to mine, and what was <hi>foreign,</hi> and even <hi>antecedent</hi> to it: For example, in the very firſt line of my quotation he ſays, <hi>The ſecond inſtance you adduce is, that I</hi> EXPRESSED MY APPREHENSIONS TO YOU ONE DAY, <hi>that a</hi> CERTAIN GENTLEMAN <hi>would be glad to have a handle againſt me,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide No. <hi>26</hi> of his pamphlet.</note>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:020462_0015_0FAF10DA86D9A1B0"/>&amp;c. He adds, <hi>"I remember this circumſtance, and you have ſtated it right."</hi> Has this referrence to my letter, or to any thing from me?—does not he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the converſation to have been <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> on his part, and the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications made directly to me.</hi> Again, "AS EXPERIENCE † <hi>had taught me to expect little</hi> FAIR <hi>or</hi> FRIENDLY <hi>from the gentleman in queſtion</hi> I DID APPRREHEND," &amp;c. a little further he expreſsly ſays, "<hi>though</hi> I DO NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU, <hi>yet I was not without ſuſpicions,</hi>" &amp;c. Surely my <hi>information</hi> could not have extended to facts or ſuſpicions which he had not even explained to me.</p>
            <p>Throughout the whole of his letter he never once appeals either to <hi>mine</hi> of the 15th <hi>June,</hi> or to my <hi>knowledge</hi> of the facts alledged. On the contrary, he even communicates to me a circumſtance which <hi>perſonally</hi> affects me, and could only tend to inſlame my reſentment againſt Mr. Carmichael: "<hi>that</hi> SAME GENTLEMAN <hi>perceiving that the</hi> SPANIARDS (<hi>among whom he had</hi> AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE, AND NOT FOR THE BEST PUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSES, <hi>repreſented you,</hi>") &amp;c. &amp;c. In ſhort, the misfortune of my adverſary, upon this, as well as ſimilar points, ſeem to be his confounding his principle in common life, with the habitual practice of his profeſſion—he defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the point of honor, as he would at the bar, and thinks reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like a bad cauſe, may be ſaved by a <hi>quibble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even ſuppoſing for a moment no proof to have exiſted on either part, but aſſertions and negatives, notwithſtanding his modeſt exordium in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to his pamphlet, the American public, I preſume, would hardly ſuſpend their judgment <hi>upon a queſtion of duplicity</hi> between a <hi>young ſoldier</hi> and a <hi>veteran lawyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As another proof of his principles in argument as well as politics, I beg leave to inſtance one of his late quotations, intended to prove that I advanced, upon my <hi>own knowledge,</hi> facts to the prejudice of Mr. Carmichael:—the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph is taken from my letter to him of the 1ſt February, 1782, from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon. In his quotations, page 67.69, of his pamphlet, it runs thus, <hi>"On the contrary, political reaſons ſeemed to point out another line of conduct; had I deſiſted, Carmichael would have had a handle againſt one of us,"</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. Here is no leſs than an <hi>entire paragraph omitted</hi> and which, it will be ſeen, changes the ſenſe of the whole: it is as fallows: <hi>On the contrary,</hi>

            <p>With reſpect to his ſyſtem of detaining me in Madrid, after the ſiege of Mahon, and upon which he is alſo <hi>negative,</hi> the public will reflect, that certain combinations of circumſtances ſometimes render concluſions inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and literal proofs unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>He himſelf, upon that point, has quitted his common methodical road, and recurs to preceding and ſubſequent facts, from which he only draws an inference of probability: upon this ground I meet him: he begins, rather unfortunate, by denying the <hi>term</hi> of my reſidence with him at the period alluded to:—he affirms that I could not have arrived in Madrid <hi>"early in April"</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide page <hi>73.</hi> "His laſt letter before his return to Madrid is dated 25th March at Mahon; conſequently his return to Madrid could not have been early in that month."</note> becauſe my laſt letter to him from Minorca is dated on the 25th <hi>March.</hi> His ignorance of geography ſeems to have led him into this miſtake, as, I preſume, he calculated upon the month which the fleet had employed in their paſſage from Cadiz to Minorca: that Iſland, any map will inform him, is only ſixty leagues diſtant from the coaſt of Catalonia, where I landed on my return. My journal for 1782 ſays, "On the 27th March failed, with the Duke de Crillon, from Mahon, landed at Barcelona on the 29th, and <hi>reached Madrid on the 9th April.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The interim from thence to the time of his departure for Paris, I think, can be little ſhort of ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>I never ſaw Dr. Franklin's letter, ſummoning him to France, nor do I know the preciſe time of its reception; but I again affirm, that previous to that event, <hi>he had prevailed upon me to renounce my military views and direct my hopes to the diplomatic line.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">I deſire it may be underſtood, that I never conſidered, or repreſented myſelf as ſerving in quality of Mr. Jay's private ſecretary—I never ſolicited either ſalary or reward for my ſervices, and even ſhould have thought myſelf off ended by a propoſal of the kind from him.

                  <p>I muſt own my military Quixotiſm is not yet abated, and I could wiſh to aſſiſt at the Gibraltar buſineſs; however, as the general has ordered me a paſſage in his ſhip to Barcelona, I ſhall from thence proceed to <hi>Madrid,</hi>

            <p>Mr. Jay continues to animadvert upon that letter, and very judiciouſly calls the attention of the reader to the <hi>neceſſity of his taking explicit arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with me:</hi> He adds, <hi>that he preſſed me to go to America; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the inconveniences to which I expoſed him upon the point of ſupplies; that I warmly intreated him to permit me to continue until I could again write to America, and receive anſwers;</hi> in ſhort, that it was, <hi>after great importunity on my part, and much altercation between us, that he at length reluctantly conſented.</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:020462_0018_0FAF10DCAA839F08"/>
How far all this is conſiſtent with the ſenſe of <hi>my letter,</hi> the public will judge: From that it appears that I was perfectly ſenſible of the embarraſſments of my ſituation, and earneſtly wiſhed to put an end to them by <hi>returning to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> I even hint that I had penetrated into Mr. Jay's <hi>deſign upon me,</hi> from that part of his letter which mentions colonel Livingſton's return; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I already prepare him for a <hi>polite refuſal</hi> to ſupply the place of that gentleman, by expreſsly declaring that, <hi>"although I know he thinks poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics my proper ſphere, both inclination and neceſſity determine me to adhere to my military plans."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence then proceeded my <hi>ſudden</hi> change in ſyſtem and opinion? Was it to confirm me by his <hi>perſonal</hi> remonſtrances, in a reſolution which I had <hi>already</hi> taken of <hi>returning to America,</hi> that, inſtead of letting me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark at once from Minorca for Cadiz, and <hi>from thence to America,</hi> Mr. Jay ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to <hi>paſs by Madrid,</hi> which neceſſarily obliged me to undertake a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>by land through the whole kingdom of Spain in its greateſt extent?</hi> and yet <hi>ſecure under his Vulcanian ſhield of impudence,</hi> without alledging one often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible motive for either <hi>his conduct or my own,</hi> he aſſerts that, contrary to his moſt <hi>ſtrenuous remonſtrances,</hi> I urged him <hi>to conſent to my remaining at Madrid!</hi> This enigma has been amply explained in my publication of the 7th December laſt.</p>
            <p>As a corroborating proof of what I have there advanced, with reſpect to the arrangements which took place between Mr Jay and myſelf, in the <hi>interim</hi> from my arrival, until the time of his being ſummoned to Paris, I ſhall inſert the following extract from a letter which I wrote to Ben. Lewis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in date of the 25th April, 1782; that is near three weeks antecedent to the one which Mr. Jay has cauſed to be publiſhed. The words are as follow:</p>
            <p>"After the campaign in Minorca, I had formed the deſign of <hi>returning to America,</hi> in the hopes of obtaining a genteel employment in the army, but the preſent pacific appearance of affairs points out a political line as far more eligible for me. The reputation of having reſided ſome time at a foreign court, in the family of a miniſter, may probably recommend me to Congreſs as an object worthy their attention; for this end the efforts of my friends will not, I hope, be wanting; <hi>on Mr. Jay, at leaſt, I can rely; he</hi> ADVISES <hi>me to remain at Madrid</hi> UNTIL SOMETHING OF THE KIND MAY HAPPEN, <hi>and will continue to ſupply me,</hi>" &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to my ſecond letter to Mr. Lewis, of the 15th May following, it will be found upon examination to contain nothing contradictory to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or preſent aſſertions: It was intended to ſtimulate him to make every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his power to relieve me from the pain of my ſituation with reſpect to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020462_0019_0FAF10DEA8D32048"/>Mr. Jay; <hi>recent experience</hi> had taught me what I had to apprehend from him in pecuniary affairs; conſequently my deſign was to paint, in the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant colours, the objects which induced me to prolong my reſidence in Europe, and the inconveniences to which I ſhould be expoſed if I did not receive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by a <hi>given time.</hi> The delicacy and caution which I obſerve upon every point reſpecting Mr. Jay, would be ſufficiently accounted for from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance alone of his being entruſted with the letter; how far my ſuſpicions were juſt is proved by the event: <hi>he examined the letter, found the contents might be of uſe, kept it in his own poſſeſſion, and has ſince cauſed it to be printed.</hi> I am really curious to know upon what principle he pretends to juſtify that act of treachery. He has ſaid in one of his publications, that I gave him a <hi>number of copies</hi> to be forwarded to America: Admitting the fact, it by no means authoriſed him to <hi>keep one of them,</hi> and ſtill leſs to <hi>publiſh it;</hi> but even the excuſe is a falſehood: I mention indeed in the letter, that I ſhall ſend twelve copies of it to America; but I perfectly recollect that I never made more than <hi>three, two</hi> of which Mr. Jay took charge of, the <hi>other</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed to Mr. Harriſon at Cadiz. The public may not find that anecdote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of attention.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I am at a loſs to diſcover what imputation he aims to fix upon me by the publication of my letters to him, <hi>after</hi> his departure from Spain?<note n="*" place="bottom">His anſwer to my letter of 23d May, <hi>1782,</hi> as printed in No. <hi>37</hi> of his pamphlet, I never received, and have ſome reaſon to believe it is of a much later date.</note> He affects <hi>ſurpriſe,</hi> it is true, in his note upon that of the 10th June, 1782,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide his note upon No. <hi>38,</hi> page <hi>57.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>if I conſidered myſelf as left by him in the character of a ſpy upon Mr. Carmichael, I did not allude to it, by way of obviating that objection to my leaving Madrid.</hi> Has the weakneſs of his nerves affected his intellects? is it the impotence of deſpairing guilt, or in deriſion of the public, that he has ventured that obſervation? I can hardly ſuppoſe he has forgotten the contents of my laſt publication any more than thoſe of my letter to him at Paſſy, which he ſo well recapitulates in his pamphlet, although it was burnt the ſame day he received it. By all theſe it will appear, that his deſigns upon me at that juncture, although ſufficiently proved by his conduct, were only communicated by <hi>inuendo:</hi> a ſimilar propoſition from him in <hi>direct terms,</hi> would have haſtened the cataſtrophe with which he has been ſince repeatedly menaced. Upon another occaſion he is aſtoniſhed that in my letters to him from Mahon, I did <hi>not retract</hi> my charges againſt Mr. Carmichael of the 15th June, 1781; ſince that letter was <hi>written at his inſtigation.</hi>

I have repeatedly obſerved, that my explanation with that gentleman did not take place until <hi>the year following,</hi> after Mr. Jay's departure from Madrid: how then was I to <hi>retract</hi> what I <hi>ſtill believed?</hi>—Was Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael to appear more eſtimable, becauſe I began to diſcover the bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Mr. Jay?—or does he ſo far wrong himſelf as to ſuppoſe that the firſt ray of ſuſpicion could penetrate into the dark abyſs of his character;— could diſcern at once a complication of vices, which even perplexes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, when guided by experience and demonſtration?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, this continued ſtrain of low artifice and evaſion—miſinterpreting ſome parts of my letters and affecting not to underſtand others, can only be compared to the proverbial ſtupidity of a certain animal, who, when in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhuts his own eyes, and thinks himſelf concealed from view.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral of his notes and obſervations, he endeavours to prove an <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency</hi> in my conduct for continuing to write to him, after, I confeſs, I had <hi>ceaſed to eſteem him.</hi> But <hi>politeneſs</hi> is as different from <hi>eſteem</hi> as <hi>reſpect</hi> from <hi>ſervility.</hi> Beſides, my ſituation with reſpect to him was ſtill delicate: having been placed in a manner under his direction, I thought it incumbent upon me to preſerve an appearance of regard and deference towards him, both for my own juſtification to my friends and to avoid giving him a handle of miſrepreſentation againſt me.</p>
            <p>Further obſervations upon that point would be ſuperfluous, as few perſons can be at a loſs to conceive my motives and ſituation.</p>
            <p>His laſt charge againſt me, that I repeatedly made efforts to diſcharge<note n="*" place="bottom">I intreat the public to obſerve that theſe efforts were made in Europe. I had not for a ſeries of time even heard from my friends in America, but having by ſome favorable circumſtances acquired an extenſive credit upon my <hi>own account,</hi> I endeavoured from motives of delicacy to acquit both my friends and myſelf towards Mr Jay, to whom, of all mankind, I did not wiſh to have obligations of any nature.</note> a debt contracted under ſuch circumſtances, and for which I did not conſider myſelf as <hi>perſonally reſponſible,</hi> I ſhould think might rather afford matter for eulogy than reproach: May greater crimes never be imputed to me, nor ſupported by more reſpectable accuſers!</p>
            <p>I come at laſt to his narrative of the affair of Paſſy, and which I always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he would reſerve for a trans-atlantic diſcuſſion. He begins by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020462_0021_0FAF10E25F2747E0"/>that "I <hi>ſolicited his favor and intereſt,</hi> in Paris, by my letter of the 16th July, 1783, and when <hi>he afterwards acted contrary to my wiſhes and requeſt,</hi> that I <hi>asked his pardon</hi> in preſence of Mr. Adams for the expreſſions I had uſed." The public will obſerve that this circumſtance never once occurred to his memory until <hi>after my departure from</hi> America; but without further ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting upon his motives or conduct, the following candid ſtate of facts will ſufficiently explain my own.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of peace, the honorable Major-General Marquis De la Fayette, with whom I then ſerved in the combined armies aſſembled at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz, requeſted me to accompany him upon public buſineſs to Madrid. The letter which I had the honor to deliver from that diſtinguiſhed character to Congreſs, in December laſt, will prove how far he expreſſed himſelf ſatisfied with my ſervices upon that occaſion. He afterwards prevailed upon me to purſue my journey with him to Paris, where he ſeemed confident by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the commiſſioners of the United States to have me nominated to carry the definitive treaty to Congreſs. Although Mr. Jay was <hi>perſonally</hi> under a previous engagement to me,<note n="†" place="bottom">After my letters of the 29th Oct. and 29th Dec. <hi>1782,</hi> it will be ſeen that I conſidered myſelf as no longer connected with Mr. Jay; conſequently my delicacy in not inſiſting upon his compliance with an engagement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted under circumſtances relative to my former ſituation; and indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certain conditions, on my part, which I certainly had not fulfilled; viz. <hi>of remaining at Madrid in 1782,</hi>" cannot appear extraordinary.</note> I was ſo far from reclaiming it, that I ſtrenuouſly refuſed to ſpeak to him upon the ſubject, until the abſence of the Marquis De la Fayette, and the neceſſity of bringing matters to a deciſion obliged me to addreſs him perſonally; in conſequence I wrote him the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing note:</p>

                  <p>INTENDING to leave Paris to-morrow morning, no an excurſion to Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau to meet the Marquis de la Fayette, I take the liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs your excellency upon the ſubject of <hi>his requeſt</hi> of my being permitted to carry the definitive treaty to Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I neither <hi>wiſh</hi> nor <hi>expect</hi> you to ſacrifice any <hi>private view</hi> of your own to oblige me; but ſhould you be perſonally unintereſted, I flatter myſelf you will not refuſe your influence in my favor. As the marquis will probably be abſent ſome weeks, I wiſh to <hi>inform him poſitively</hi> of at leaſt your ſentiments on this occaſion, as they will greatly tend to influence my future arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

The <hi>"private views of his own"</hi> he could not be at a loſs to comprehend.</p>

                     <salute>My dear General,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE affair of the treaty is at length decided in favor of Mr. Adams's ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and, <hi>what will doubtleſs ſurprize you,</hi> Mr. Jay gave the caſting vote againſt me. As his conduct upon this occaſion has produced ſome ſevere crimination between us, I think it proper to give you a recital of it in the moſt <hi>minute</hi> and <hi>circumſtantial manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day after your departure, I waited upon him at <hi>Paſſy,</hi> in company with Col. Ogden. He immediately informed me that my pretenſions to being ſent with the definitive treaty to Congreſs, were <hi>inadmiſſible,</hi> as Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin had acquieſced in Mr. Adams's application in behalf of his ſecretary. I was mortified, but had in fact no reaſon to complain of the Doctor's deciſion, as he was under no poſitive engagement to me.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to your own feelings, my dear general, to judge what muſt have been my ſurprize and reſentment, when in a converſation with Dr. Franklin, <hi>a moment after,</hi> he abſolutely denied having any predilection in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Mr. <hi>Adams's clerk,</hi> and in the moſt friendly manner aſſured me that he was happy in an occaſion of ſhewing his deference to <hi>your requeſt</hi> and his perſonal regard for me.</p>
                  <p>I immediately reported his anſwer to Mr. Jay, who <hi>then</hi> in ſome <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,</hi> confeſſed "that he had engaged to give his vote for Mr. Adams's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary." I then took leave of him, and the next morning wrote him a letter, expoſing his ungenerous and unmanly conduct towards me for a long time paſt; reproaching him for his <hi>want of candour in having always given both you</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In a letter to me ſome time before the Marquis mentions, as to your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the treaty, I have had thoſe gentlemen ſounded, and it appears Mr. <hi>Adams is the ONLY ONE</hi> who has a friend to ſend.</note> 
                     <hi>and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020462_0023_0FAF10E36A89F808"/>me to underſtand that he would be far from oppoſing any obſtacle to my elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and, laſtly, his <hi>infamous duplicity</hi> with reſpect to Dr. Franklin: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with requeſting him to appoint an hour when we might adjuſt all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and animoſities, by an <hi>ultimate appeal to arms.</hi> As he did not think proper to honor me with an anſwer, I took the liberty to call upon him in the evening, and found him with <hi>Mr. Adams in conſultation upon my letter.</hi> After ſeveral repeated and vain ſolicitations for him to favor me with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in <hi>my way,</hi> Mr. Adams declared that <hi>he had informed Mr. Jay of Dr. Franklin's having acquieſced in his application, conſequently Mr. Jay had been guilty of no deception in what he had ſaid to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although I ſtrongly ſuſpected the veracity<note n="*" place="bottom">This is by no means intended as an affront to Mr. Adams. I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his conduct upon that occaſion as only calculated to <hi>extricate Mr. Jay</hi> from the <hi>diſagreeable dilemma</hi> to which he had reduced himſelf.</note> of this declaration, it deprived me all pretext for inſiſting upon Mr Jay's compliance with my demand; and after a ſuperfluous diſcuſſion of his former conduct, by Mr. Adams's mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I conſented that the affair ſhould be <hi>buried in oblivion.</hi>

            <p>If the public will compare this recital, written only the <hi>third day</hi> after the tranſaction, with that compoſed by Mr. Jay the <hi>third year</hi> after, it will moſt certainly appear that they do not <hi>"run parallel."</hi> In ſupport of the facts preceding our laſt interview, I appeal to the teſtimony of Col. Ogden. For what paſſed afterwards, if Mr. Adams recollects it, I rely too much upon his candour to fear his atteſtation. That an accommodation took place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Jay and myſelf, as far as related to the affair in queſtion, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted fact; as alſo that I apologized for having in <hi>direct terms taxed him with falſehood,</hi> after Mr. Adams had ſtepped forward to exculpate from that charge, by attributing the miſunderſtanding to himſelf. To have preſſed the matter further, would have been an implied doubt of the veracity of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, which, not only decency, but infinite conſiderations, oppoſed. My motives for <hi>ceaſing</hi> the enquiry are as obvious as thoſe which induced me to <hi>begin</hi> it.<note n="†" place="bottom">I muſt take the liberty to obſerve, that if in my former publications I have avoided entering into any details upon this affair, it was only from a principle of delicacy; as I did not chuſe to call upon the teſtimony of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by no means intereſted, and who might not wiſh to be meddled in a conteſt of this nature. But this is not the firſt time that Mr. Jay, by <hi>miſtaking</hi> my motives, has provoked me to his own loſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As to Mr. Jay's obſervation that I did not expreſs reſentment at his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his oppoſition againſt me, I only reply that I ſhould never conſider
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020462_0024_0FAF10E4302A6DD8"/>myſelf as juſtiſiable in cutting any man's throat for <hi>voting againſt me.</hi> My challenge to him was founded upon a <hi>charge of falſehood; that ground re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi> every thing returned of courſe to its primitive ſtate. But as his <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> like his <hi>reaſoning,</hi> is always <hi>poſterior to the point in queſtion;</hi> he was offended, it ſeems, at being told that I had <hi>ſpoken of the affair,</hi> and had even hinted that he had made certain admiſſions; but, inſtead of riſing into anger, he ſays he moſt heroically <hi>"avoided all intercourſe with me afterwards.</hi>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>After this candid expoſition of the principles which have actuated my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the conſequences which have reſulted from it, from the earlieſt to the preſent period of my life, the public will pronounce, <hi>for the laſt time,</hi> I hope, upon both. It is certain I have been too nearly connected with <hi>dark characters;</hi> but inſtead of caſting a ſhade upon mine, I flatter myſelf they have ſerved but to illuſtrate it; at leaſt I ſhall ever enjoy a conſcious ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reflecting that the moſt minute words and actions of my life, choſen at an age of error, imprudence and paſſion, although ſcrutinized and tortured by the malice of a JAY, have afforded nothing which can be conſtrued into a ſtain upon honor, or a breach of the moſt rigid principles of probity.</p>
            <p>I muſt now recur once more to the moſt painful part of my defence, that which reſpects Mr. Carmichael. A remark contained in one of Mr. Jay's notes, I confeſs, occaſions me ſome uneaſy ſenſations. He deſires the public to obſerve that <hi>not one of the letter which I have quoted from Mr. Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, is of a date poſterior to the time of my departure from Paris in</hi> 1784. The fact is moſt certainly true, and his alluſion to it, I confeſs has excited a doubt in my breaſt, which, for the honor of friendſhip and philanthropy, I could wiſh had been forever a ſtranger to it! It is true, I repeat, from the time of my departure from Paris at the time alluded to, I have never received one line from Mr. Carmichael! I was ſo far, however, from imputing the cauſe of his ſilence to any other motive than the conſequences reſulting from my own ſituation,<note n="†" place="bottom">I was then upon a tour through moſt of the eaſtern, and great part of the northern ſtates of Europe; from which I never returned nearer to France than Hambourg, where I embarked for America. Mr. Carmichael was in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> that I continued to write to him in the ſame friendly and affectionate manner. The ſuſpicion is, however, at preſent, but too well founded, of his having acted in <hi>colluſion with Mr. Jay;</hi> in conſequence I think it prudent to make ſuch a preparatory defence as is become neceſſary for my own juſtification, and at the ſame time cannot be injurious to Mr. Carmichael, unleſs he ſhould indeed prove an apoſtate from honor.</p>

In Mr. Jay's publication of the 7th December, 1785, are theſe words, to which he has alſo adhered in his late pamphlet: "I neither <hi>ſhewed</hi> not <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him</hi> (Mr. Carmichael) <hi>Mr. Littlepage's letter, nor any of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</hi> In the courſe of converſation HE <hi>mentioned him, and intimated</hi> HE <hi>had good reaſon to believe that Mr. Littlepage had played a</hi> DOUBLE GAME <hi>between us."</hi> Here Mr. Jay is entirely paſſive;—Mr. Carmichael, without <hi>object</hi> or <hi>ſtimulative, introduces my name,</hi> ſtained by the moſt poiſonous breath of calumny:—Without further calling in queſtion the verity of Mr. Jay's allegation, I ſhall proceed to anſwer directly to the charge:</p>
            <p>The words attributed to Mr. Carmichael fix the date of his accuſation againſt me at the expreſs period of Mr. Jay's departure from Madrid in 1782: he <hi>"then received me into his houſe, advanced me money, and in return I revealed Mr. Jay's ſecrets."</hi> Such is the ſubſtance of the 'charge; for a moment admitting it, what follows?—If Mr. Carmichael does not confeſs himſelf loſt to every manly virtue, and even deaf to the voice of prudence, he ought at leaſt to have regarded me as a dangerous confident, and in future to have avoided any connexion or intimacy between us. Even admiting that policy would have juſtified him in <hi>temporiſing</hi> ſome time longer with me, views of that nature could not ſurely have extended his ſentiments to "the <hi>prudence</hi> of a <hi>guardian</hi> and the <hi>warmth</hi> of a <hi>brother."</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His own words, which I have quoted on a former occaſion.</note> POLICY might have induced him to advance me money to ſerve a campaign, where he thought the honor of the <hi>American name</hi> intereſted: but will that account for the expreſſions of <hi>friendſhip</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> with which his <hi>letters</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually abound?—One moment he pours forth the moſt <hi>virulent complaints againſt Mr. Jay,</hi> congratulates me upon my being no longer connected with him, as I ſhould certainly, at laſt, have <hi>experienced the fate of Livingſton and himſelf:</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide my publication of the 7th December.</note> and, <hi>without the moſt diſtant alluſion to the point in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> often conjure me, <hi>"to defend him if ever he is attacked."</hi> In another inſtance he becomes the champion of my own honor, and on the 21ſt of Jan. 1783, writes to me, "<hi>Perſevere</hi> in the <hi>ſame line</hi> of conduct which has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired you the eſteem of the moſt diſtinguiſhed characters, and <hi>make yourſelf eaſy</hi> on account of any <hi>inſinuations which may be infuſed into your friends</hi> to your prejudice. Mr. Adams knows me too well not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that I <hi>would never adviſe you</hi> to purſuits which are either impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or <hi>diſhonorable.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The laſt word might have been ſpared, according to the opinion which, <hi>he tells Mr. Jay,</hi> he had <hi>long before</hi> conceived of me. But admitting him
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020462_0026_0FAF10E7458E0EE0"/>to have been influenced by POLICY alone during the whole time of my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Spain;</hi>—he continues the <hi>ſame ſtile</hi> for more than a <hi>year</hi> after my arrival in <hi>Paris.</hi> In the firſt letter which I received from him in that capital, he ſays, "I hope the pleaſures of Paris will not abſorb you ſo entirely as to make you forget your friends here, and particularly <hi>one who loves you as much as I do.</hi>" In the ſame letter he obſerves, "I am curious to know how you have been received by your <hi>quondam friends.</hi> Continue to conduct yourſelf with the <hi>ſame diſcretion,</hi> that you have <hi>hitherto</hi> done, and you will avoid any <hi>handle of miſrepreſentation to your diſadvantage.</hi>" In another letter to me of the 30th March, 1783, are theſe words: "I hope your <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> will induce you to communicate to me whatever you may learn which <hi>intereſts me perſonally.</hi> It is unneceſſary to obſerve, that not even your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for another can juſtify the <hi>ſmalleſt breach of confidence." That,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, would have been a ſevere piece of ſatire upon a perſon whoſe firſt connexion with him had been founded upon a <hi>ſimilar</hi> act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. In a letter of the 18th Auguſt, 1783, he mentions to me a deſign of coming to Paris: "I had ſome thoughts of coming to Paris, if reflections upon the <hi>nature of my ſituation,</hi> and the advice and repreſeatations of *** had not decided me to remain here. This voyage would have been uſeful to my health, and highly agreeable to me on many accounts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>affording me the occaſion of removing any prejudices which may have been conceived againſt me by perſons whom I eſteem.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Far was I from foreſeeing that the object of his journey would at laſt be to <hi>purchaſe an accommodation</hi> with <hi>our common enemy</hi> at the price of <hi>my honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further remarks upon our correſpondence would at preſent be unneceſſary; the whole of it will probably be laid before the public; at leaſt, if Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael thinks it proper, I ſhall be far from objecting to the meaſure.</p>
            <p>Although I ardently wiſh that he may <hi>ſtill</hi> appear <hi>worthy</hi> of the public and my own <hi>eſteem,</hi> I muſt, at the ſame time declare, that I have nothing to apprehend from his <hi>enmity.</hi> Whether he may be induced by policy to <hi>avow,</hi> or by a ſenſe of ſhame to <hi>deny,</hi> the accuſation againſt me, which Mr. Jay attributes to him, his ſituation will be embarraſſing. All that I have to ask of him, is to take at once a <hi>decided</hi> part;—I have fought too long in the dark; let me ſee my enemy and I can never fear him in a cauſe like this.</p>
            <p>At preſent I ſhall not trouble the public further upon his account, than by inſerting the following letter, which I wrote to him immediately after my late arrival in Europe, and upon which his <hi>ſilence,</hi> more than all the reſt, appears <hi>problematical.</hi>

                  <p>For my own part, there is nothing in that buſineſs of which I either repent or have need to be aſhamed: <hi>inſulted,</hi> almoſt <hi>diſhonored</hi> in the eyes of the world, expoſed to the malicious inſinuations of a wretch, whoſe every wiſh and effort has for a ſeries of time been to injure and diſtreſs me in every noble purſuit; denied the ſatisfaction of a man of honor, an appeal to the public was the only reſource which remained to me, to vindicate my own character, and was perhaps at the ſame time no ſlight revenge upon a man whoſe exiſtence depends upon his popularity, and whoſe malice had furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with ſuch ample materials againſt him.</p>

                  <p>As to the letter which he had quoted from me to your diſadvantage, you can be little ſurpriſed at it; both my ſituation and your own, at that time, rendered it impoſſible for any explanation to take place between us, and as I only knew you from <hi>Jay's report</hi> and <hi>repreſentation,</hi> I certainly beheld you in a <hi>moſt unfavourable point of view.</hi> That, however, I have anſwered to the public, and had previouſly explained, to <hi>your intire juſtification,</hi> to my friends in Virginia; to yourſelf I never could have mentioned it, under <hi>any other circumſtances than the preſent,</hi>

From you I have now to demand a more ſerious eclairciſſement: YOUR NAME <hi>has been uſed to traduce and vilify my character,</hi> at the very moment in which every effort was made on my part that could in the leaſt contribute to your ſervice;—while, glowing with the warmth of friendſhip, <hi>my heart</hi> and <hi>confidence were open to you;</hi>—is it poſſible that you could have ſacrificed <hi>my fame</hi> for the <hi>contemptible object of</hi> PAYING COURT <hi>to a man whom you knew to be your</hi> MORTAL ENEMY, <hi>and whoſe implacable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I had incurred</hi> ONLY <hi>upon</hi> YOUR ACCOUNT?—<hi>The accuſation againſt me</hi> YOU BEST KNOW <hi>to be a moſt</hi> ATROCIOUS <hi>and</hi> INFAMOUS FALSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOOD.

                  <p>I eſteem you too much to ſuppoſe that your juſtification will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, but, <hi>until that takes place,</hi> you will excuſe me for obſerving, that all correſpondence muſt ceaſe between us.<note n="*" place="bottom">Meaning the friendly correſpondence which formerly ſubſiſted between us, and which could not be reſumed until Mr. Carmichael had juſtified me to the public.

                     </note> I have rendered you juſtice to the public; a reciprocal obligation reſts upon you as a reparation due to <hi>my honor,</hi> and perhaps, ſir, <hi>your own.</hi>

            <p>I muſt now add, that I expect his anſwer from the preſs: To the awful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the public I refer him; there let him anſwer to his charges. I ſhall conclude by one LAST APPEAL to his <hi>honor and veracity;</hi> nay more, by <hi>warning him to remember,</hi> that although I may have been THE DUPE OF ARTIFICE, I truſt I ſhall never become THE VICTIM OF TREACHERY.</p>
            <p>As I have the vanity to think that I ſhall live for ſome time in Mr. Jay's memory, I ſhall once more deſcend to addreſs a ſhort apoſtrophe to him, which I hope will cloſe our correſpondence for ever.</p>
            <p>TO YOU, SIR, However degraded in the public and your own opinion; although reduced ſo low, that even revenge has loſt its edge, and puniſhment becomes a cruelty;—TO YOU I once more addreſs myſelf. A diſtance of near two thouſand leagues now ſeparates us;—read then with as little emotion as the ſtings of conſcience will permit you.</p>
            <p>After having exhauſted every ſhaft of calumny and malice; after having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed your reputation in one inſtance, your probity in another, and your vanity in all; in what light do you now appear before the tribunal of your country? You have been proved to have <hi>denied facts,</hi> and <hi>aſſerted falſehoods;</hi> your name is become a ſatire upon honor, and would diſcredit even truth: What, after all, was your object? To cruſh an enemy, whoſe tender age, even ſuppoſing it had afforded you the advantage over him, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, would have rendered your conduct <hi>odious,</hi> and your victory <hi>unmanly:</hi> But to have failed in the attempt, has ſubjected you at once to contempt and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule! You have ſuffered yourſelf to be guided by a principle of malice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported by courage ſufficient to ſave you from diſgrace: I am even willing to believe that ſome of your ill qualities proceed from this inherent <hi>weakneſs of mind;</hi> and it may not appear the only paradox in your character to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if nature had endued you with a greater portion of courage, ſhe would have rendered you a <hi>more noble,</hi> and perhaps, <hi>leſs formidable</hi> enemy. In a word, you poſſeſs all the qualities of a bad man without firmneſs enough to dignify guilt: One ingredient more in your mental compoſition would have qualified you to act the part of a <hi>Cataline;</hi> the want of it has left you a JAY. Vindictive from principle, an hypocrite from ſyſtem, and a coward from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, you lead the life of a <hi>Bevot,</hi> with the principles of an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and perhaps may be at laſt compelled to die the death of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> without the reputation of ſanctity or courage.</p>

               </gap>, believe me, I never wiſhed to bring it forward: A ſtate of war could never be deſirable with you, where revenge is almoſt diſhonor, and triumph becomes humiliation.</p>
            <p>Profit at leaſt from the bitter conſequences of your own imprudence, nor, like an obſtinate ſlave, become hardened by the ſcourge.</p>
