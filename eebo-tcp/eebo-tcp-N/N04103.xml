            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Behold! the Son of GOD hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Nature, and purchas'd the HOLY SPIRIT in his Graces and Comforts; and inviteth us to come, and take theſe Waters freely. This Chapter is the laſt in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cloſeth the whole Canon of ſacred Scripture. Worthy Expoſitors apprehend that we have here a further Deſcription of the glorious Joy and conſummate Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heavenly <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which is abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with a pure River of Water of Life proceeding

out of the Throne of GOD, and of the LAMB! All our Springs are in GOD, the Fountain of Grace and Glory. <hi>In his Preſence is Fulneſs of Joy, and at his right Hand are Pleaſures forevermore.</hi> Pſalm 16. 11. There is alſo the <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> GOD's People eat freely of the Fruits of it, and live forever. And there ſhall be <hi>no more Curſe.</hi> No Tempter ſhall ever approach that high and holy Place, no Sin ſhall ever defile it; and therefore it muſt be forever free from all the Fruits of the Curſe. There ſhall be <hi>no Night</hi> there, and therefore no Need of a Candle. Nor is there any Need of the Light of the Sun to make and rule the Day. No! No! that GOD who <hi>is Light,</hi> and in whom is <hi>no Darkneſs</hi> at all, forever ſhineth in his meridian Brightneſs. The Father of Lights with whom is no Shadow of turning makes one perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and eternal Day in which not the leaſt Cloud inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to hide the Light of his Countenance from his People. But is it poſſible that any of us the Children of Apoſtate <hi>Adam,</hi> who was thruſt out of the earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe for his firſt Tranſgreſſion, in which we were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved; I ſay is it poſſible, that we ſhould ever inhabit the heavenly Paradiſe? Yes! Yes! the Son of GOD came down from Heaven, and in our Nature was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Death, yea was laid in the Grave; that he might raiſe us up to ſit with him in thoſe heavenly Places. And now the Spirit and the Bride ſay, <hi>Come.</hi> Deſcend, O bleſſed Spirit of GOD! and raiſe us above the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Influence of earthly Things; refreſh our Souls with theſe living Waters, and we will run the Race ſet before us, till we enter in through the Gates into that City, of which ſuch glorious Things are ſpoken in the Word of GOD. But to return, In the Words, we have a moſt gracious Invitation given us to come, and take the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life freely. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come,</hi> —The HOLY SPIRIT of GOD who indited the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſpeaks in them; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt faith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, Harden not your Hearts.</hi> Heb. 3, 7, 8. And the Spirit exciteth holy Deſires in the Church who is the Bride, the Lamb's Wife; and accordingly the Church and every true Believer, ſay, Come. They look and long for CHRIST'S Appearing, and for the further

Manifeſtations of his Favour unto them. And when GOD's People have taſted that the LORD is gracious, they are deſirous that others ſhould come, and ſee how good the LORD is. When JESUS had revealed himſelf to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and given her the Water of Life; ſhe went her Way into the City, and ſaid to the Men, <hi>Come</hi>—John 4. 28, 9. <hi>And let him that is athirſt, Come.</hi>—All ſuch as feel their Want of CHRIST and his ſaving Benefits, and have earneſt Deſires after them, are here invited to come; which we do by Faith, when we go out of ourſelves as to any carnal Dependance upon our own Righteouſneſs and Strength, and go to GOD by JESUS CHRIST as to the Fountain of all ſaving Good. We have then a general Invitation, <hi>And who ſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> GOD will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and force the Bleſſings of the Goſpel upon any, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; but then all ſuch as thirſt after them, and are willing to receive them upon Goſpel Terms, may come and welcome: And none need be diſcouraged becauſe they have no Money or valuable Price to lay down to purchaſe them. No, theſe are all purchaſed by JESUS CHRIST at the Price of his moſt precious Blood; and they are offered to us as a free Gift, which we muſt heartily accept as it is offered. And if by the Grace of GOD we do this, they became our's. If CHRIST and his Benefits were ſet to Sale, we poor periſhing Sinners might well deſpair, and ſay our Hope is periſhed; but now that our LORD offereth himſelf and all ſaving Good freely, even the chief of Sinners ſhould be encouraged to hearken to this moſt gracious Invitation. By the <hi>Water of Life</hi> we may underſtand the ſpiritual Bleſſings purchaſed by CHRIST, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by his SPIRIT. John 4. 10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the Gift of GOD, and who it is that faith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldſt have aſked of him, and he would have given thee living Water. 7. 38, 39. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. But this ſpake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi>

The Son of GOD having taken our Nature, and been obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto Death, hath purchaſed Grace and Glory, and every good Thing for his People. And accordingly <hi>as Mediator</hi> he hath a Fulneſs of all ſpiritual Bleſſings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on his People. Col. 1. 19. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell.</hi> And he received that he mignt give. John 1. 16. <hi>And of his Fulneſs have all we received and Grace for Grace.</hi> GOD bleſſeth his People with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in him. And we have accordingly the Bleſſings of the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> Kingdom ſhadowed forth to us under thoſe Similitudes. Iſa. 32. 2. <hi>A Man ſhall be as Rivers of Water in a dry Place.</hi> Zech. 13. 1. <hi>In that Day there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the Houſe of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for Sin, and for Uncleanneſs.</hi> This prophetical Promiſe looks forward to the Goſpel-Day. And by the Fountain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened we may un lerſtand JESUS CHRIST, in the Merits of his Death, and Communications of his Spirit and Grace, revealed under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation. The Son of GOD came by Water and by Blood that he might waſh his People from the Guilt and Pollution of Sin, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify to himſelf, a peculiar People, and zealous of good

Works. Eph. 5. 25—27. <hi>CHRIST alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it: that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the washing of water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without Blemiſh.</hi> Whatever are our ſpiritual Wants, in CHRIST there is a full Supply for us. Are you ſenſible of your Ignorance and Folly? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <hi>wiſdom.</hi> Are you ſenſible of your Guilt, and need of a perfect Righteouſneſs for your Juſtification before GOD? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Are you ſenſible of the dreadful Pollution of Sin, and do you feel your need of that Holineſs without which none ſhall ſee the Lord? CHRIST is of GOD, made to his People <hi>sanctification.</hi> Are you ſenſible that you were ſold under Sin, and do you groan after Deliverance from this worſe than Egyptian Bondage? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <hi>Redemption.</hi> I Cor. 1. 30.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Goſpel of CHRIST, and the Ordinances therein appointed, are as the Conduit-Pipes thro' which GOD is pleas'd to convey the Bleſſings purchas'd by CHRIST, unto his choſen People. The <hi>Word, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> are the ordinary Means of Grace: And it is in the diligent Uſe of theſe that GOD's People muſt wait upon him for ſpiritual Bleſſings. Agreably, when it is ſaid, <hi>Come to the Waters.</hi> Iſai. 55. 1. One senſe given of the Place is, "Come to the holy Ordinances." And when GOD is graciouſly preſent in and with his Ordinances, his People are ſatisfied with the Fatneſs of his Houſe, and made <hi>to drink of the River of his Pleaſures.</hi> Pſ. 36. 8. They draw Water out of the Wells of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Joy. But if GOD deny his gracious preſence and Bleſſing, theſe outward Means are as <hi>Wells without Water,</hi> and as Clouds without Rain, which can afford no ſpiritual Refreſhment to our Souls.</p>

JESUS communicateth to his People the ſaving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he hath purchaſed for them. Tit. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; Which he ſhed on us abundantly, thro'</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Saviour.</hi> And we accordingly find that the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt was the great and comprehenſive Bleſſing which our Lord JESUS promiſed to his Diſciples, when he was about to leave this World, and go to the Father. John 16.7. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> And this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon who is one with the Father and the Son in the eſſential Perfections of the divine Nature, is ſaid to be ſent and given with Reſpect to the free Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Gifts and Graces and Comforts. And in this Reſpect, is he fitly compared to Water in the ſacred Writings. Iſa. 44. 3. <hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirſty, and Floods upon the dry Ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Offspring.</hi> John 7. 37—39. <hi>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any Man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. But this ſpake he of the Spirit.</hi> And very fitly may theſe gracious Influences be compared to Water, living Water; For by the Holy Spirit GOD cleanſeth the Souls of his People from the moral Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sin, refreſheth and reviveth the thirſty, and maketh his People fruitful in ſpiritual Knowledge, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſaeſs and Holineſs. When the Spirit is poured on GOD's People from on High, the Wilderneſs becometh a fruitful Field. But this brings me to the ſecond Thing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>In what Reſpects may the ſaving Benefits of</hi> CHRIST <hi>communicated by the Spirit, be compared to Water of Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>Upon the Account of the abſolute Need we ſtand in of them, for our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our outward Man can't ſubſiſt and hold together in vital Union, without Water; no more can our inward
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005057_0009_101693098AC602C8"/>
Man, our Souls live in a ſpiritual Senſe, without theſe Waters of Life. The beginning, Increaſe and Perfect on of the ſpiritual Life entirely depend on theſe divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. Unleſs it pleaſed GOD to viſit the Earth, and water it; we could not have Food for Man, or Beaſt; but muſt periſh with Famine. And without an Intereſt in CHRIST, and his ſaving Benefits, we muſt pine away, and periſh forever in our Sins. This is the one Thing needful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Bleſſings may be compar'd to Water <hi>for the great Value, and extenſive Uſefulneſs of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Particular is nearly related to the former; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall labour to conſider it with ſome Variety.</p>
            <p>It is worthy our thankful Obſervation, that our bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful GOD hath given us thoſe Things which are moſt uſeful to Mankind in the greateſt Abundance, and ſo made them cheap to us, tho' moſt valuable in themſelves; as the Light and Heat of the Sun, the Rain of Heaven, and living Springs of Water from the Earth. Water is of great Uſe, and extenſive Benefit to us. Our Drink is Water either pure from the Spring, or differently prepared by Nature, or Art. And of how great Uſe to keep us clean and ſweet in this dirty World? And if I might be allow'd ſomething further to enlarge the Metaphor beyond what is eſpecially pointed to in the Text, of how great Uſe is Water for Trade and Commerce? Surely we depend much upon it under GOD, for the Supports and Comforts of Life. But if we conſider the Uſefulneſs of this <hi>Element</hi> after the moſt extenſive Manner, it affords us but a defective Repreſentation of the great Uſefulneſs of CHRIST, and his ſaving Benefits, which comprehend in them a full Supply for all our Spiritual Wants; every Thing we need for the Healing, the Nouriſhing &amp; Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our precious Souls; And all of ineſtimable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, notwithſtanding ignorant and profane Sinners make ſo ſmall Account of theſe Things, I need not declare to you how pleaſant cool Waters are to the thirſty. Such as have been parched under the painful Senſe of GOD's fiery Indignation due for Sin, and then enabled to take the Waters of Life freely, will acknowledge the great Delight and Satisfaction they have received from them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005057_0010_1016930D761352A0"/>3. Theſe Bleſſings may be compared to Water of Life, <hi>for their healing, cleanſing Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are medicinal Waters, <hi>Baths</hi> that have an heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue. And ſuch are the Waters of the Fountain of Life which is open'd in CHRIST JESUS, and flow down to his People in the gracious Influences of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Faculties of our Souls are weakned and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sin. We are in a ſpiritual Senſe <hi>full of Wounds, and Bruiſes, and putriſying Sores.</hi> See Iſa. 1. 5, 6. The Eyes are blinded, the Ears are dull of hearing, the Heart is hard, the Paſſions are diſtempered with a feveriſh Heat of carnal Concupiſcence, and the Head is ſeized as with a deadly Lethargy, which renders us ſtupid and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with Reſpect to ſpiritual Things. In a Word, The Diſeaſe is mortal, and unleſs a Remedy be provided and applied, the ſecond Death will follow. But now theſe Waters of Life are of ſovereign Virtue to heal theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, and all that receive them ſhall be made whole. There was a <hi>Pool</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> call'd <hi>Betheſda,</hi> in the Uſe of which GOD was pleaſed miraculouſly to heal the Diſeaſes of his People. <hi>John</hi> 5. JESUS whoſe divine Power ſeem'd to be repreſented by the Waters of this Pool, ſaw the impotent Man lying by it, and ſaid to him, <hi>Riſe, take up thy Bed and walk.</hi> ver. 8. We are here a Number of impotent diſeaſed Creatures, as it were lying at the Pool, while we are attending the Ordinances of God's Houſe. May the Power of CHRIST be preſent to heal us! May theſe Waters of Life which flow from this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Saviour be applied to us to recover us from our ſpiritual Blindneſs of Mind, and Hardneſs of Heart! you that complain of your ſpiritual Maladies; come to theſe Waters; waſh in this <hi>Jordan,</hi> and your Souls ſhall be cleanſed and healed. Thus in <hi>Ezekiel's Viſiion</hi> of the holy Waters, it is ſaid, that <hi>where theſe Waters ſhall come, they ſhall be healed.</hi> Ezek. 47. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe ſpiritual Bleſſings may be compared to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life, <hi>as they reſtore ſpiritual Life to ſuch as were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners are in Scripture compar'd to <hi>ſick Men,</hi> as the Strength and Beauty of their Souls are impair'd by their ſpiritual Maladies, and yet there is Hope of Recovery by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005057_0011_101693102FBBC1D0"/>
CHRIST, the Lord our Healer; And they are compar'd to <hi>dead Men</hi> as they are <hi>wholly depriv'd of ſpiritual Life,</hi> have no true holy Love to GOD or other Graces in them; and are under the Curſe of the Law. And accordingly the Virtue of theſe living and Life-giving Waters exceeds all the Powers of Nature. There are Waters in the Kingdom of Nature which have a Virtue to heal ſome bodily Maladies by the Bleſſing of GOD's common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence upholding and drawing forth the Virtues in them; but none that can reſtore Life when the vital Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Soul and Body is diſſolved. This Work is wholly ſupernatural; and ſo is the ſpiritual Reſurrection of Souls, when GOD quickens them that are dead in Sin. Well then may theſe divine Influences be called Waters of Life, as they communicate Life to Souis ſpiritually dead. Thus it is ſaid of thoſe holy Waters which roſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed till they became a River which could not be paſſed over. Ezek. 47. 9. <hi>Every Thing ſhall live whither the River cometh.</hi> When our Lord JESUS poureth out his Spirit, Men are <hi>born of Water, and of the Spirit.</hi> John 3. 5. When the Spirit is thus given like Water, there's a new Life communicated by which true Converts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the bleſſed GOD, and live to him; They now receive a Power of ſpiritual Perceptions Operations and Enjoyments, which they had not before. Now they may ſay in ſome Meaſure with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave himſelf for me..</hi> O GOD, thou GOD of Salvation, to whom belong the Iſſues from Death! Pour out thy Spirit and Bleſſing upon us, and we ſhall live to ſhew forth thy Praiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe ſpiritual Bleſſings may be compar'd to Water of Life, <hi>as they continue, and ſpring up into everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Waters ſed by living Springs continue, and flow from Age to Age; while Waters from a ſudden Rain are ſoon dried up, and fail. Agreeably <hi>Job</hi> complains of his Friends, chap. 6. 15—17. <hi>My Brethren have dealt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully as a Brook, and as the Stream of Brooks they paſs away; Which are blackiſh by Reaſon of the Ice, and wherein the Snow is bid; What Time they wax warm, they vaniſh;</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005057_0012_10169311BA459A40"/>
               <hi>when it is hot, they are conſumed out of their Place.</hi> Such are our Creature-Comforts, they ſoon become as broken Ciſterns which can hold no Water. But now with GOD is the Spring of Life, and the living Waters which flow from him are pure, and they never wholly fail. John 4. 14. <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</hi> When our Lord ſays, that ſuch ſhall never thirſt, it can't intend that ſuch ſhall have no further Deſires after the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit. No, it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Grace to deſire to grow and increaſe in ſpiritual Bleſſings; But then it may intend that ſuch as receive this Gift of GOD, ſhall never more be wholly deprived of it. He may thirſt for GOD more and more, and GOD will give the Deſires of his Heart. He may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that GOD is withdrawn, but ſhall never have juſt Reaſon to ſay that GOD hath wholly forſaken him. No, GOD will never leave him 'till he hath raiſed him to his glorious Preſence in Heaven, where is <hi>Fulneſs of Joys, and Pleaſures evermore.</hi> He ſhall never thirſt after the Things of this World, as he did before. Such as have taſted how good and gracious the Lord is, will rather ſay as Jer. 18. 14. <hi>Will a Man leave the ſnow of Lebanon which cometh from the Rock of the Field? or ſhall the cold flowing Waters that come from another Place, be for ſaken?</hi> No ſurely, GOD's Children prefer theſe pure and living Waters to all the Delights of this Earth which are foul and muddy, and ſoon paſs away. When the Spirit of GOD is given to dwell in the Hearts of his People, he is in them as a Well of Water, or living Spring that can never be drawn dry. The Spirit of GOD abides in his People forever to maintain and increaſe the Life of Grace until it ſhall be perfected in Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>What is implied in thirſting? Who are they that thirſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I anſwer particularly to this Enquiry, I would ſay; we all know ſomething of what natural Thirſt means, when we feel a Deſire of Drink, of ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moiſture, by Reaſon of Drought. Now this hath been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005057_0013_10169315D593AE80"/>
accounted one of the moſt peremptory Demands of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch as ſoon becometh intolerable if wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Accordingly, We may be ſaid to thirſt in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſe, when under a painful Senſe of our ſpiritual Wants and Miſeries, we earneſtly deſire and long after JESUS CHRIST and his ſaving Benefits; his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>It ſuppoſeth a painful Senſe and Feeling of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wants and Miſeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we have been a conſiderable Time without Drink, eſpecially when hot and weary, we feel the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Senſe of it. And thus ſuch as thirſt in a ſpiritual Senſe have an afflicting Senſe of their great Wants, in being without CHRIST, deſtitute of the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit, and expos'd to the Wrath and Curſe of GOD. Indeed the Souls of Men ſince the Fall are ſo blinded and depraved by Sin, that they do not feel their Need of an Intereſt in CHRIST, and his ſaving Benefits; altho' they are pining away in their Iniquities. Give them ſenſual Satisfactions and earthly Pleaſures, and they are ready to imagine that all is well, and that they have need of nothing. As the rich Fool was ready to bleſs himſelf. Luke 12. 19. <hi>Soul thou haſt much Goods laid up for many Years; take thine Eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> Thus the ſecure Sinner feedeth of Aſhes, while a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Heart turns him aſide, that he cant deliver his Soul, nor ſay, is there not a Lie in my right Hand? But when the Spirit of GOD convinced Men of their Sin and Miſery, and ſhews them their imminent Danger of periſhing for ever; when he binds their Sins upon their Conſciences, and makes them feel ſomething of the Heat of GOD's Anger; then they find that this World with all its Enjoyments, is a dry and thirſty Land wherein is no Water, no true Satisfaction for their Souls. Now they complain with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 32.4. <hi>Day and Night thy Hand was heavy upon me; My Moiſture is turned into the Drought of ſummer.</hi> Now they labour, and are heavy laden under the Burden of their Sins; and are convinced that they muſt languiſh and die forever, unleſs it pleaſe GOD to give them CHRIST, and his ſaving Benefits.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005057_0014_1016931872A28A28"/>
They find that in departing from GOD, they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their own Mercies for lying Vanities, the Fountain of living Waters for broken Ciſterns that can hold no Water. The Deſcription given of them that were pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Thirſt in a proper Senſe, agreeth well with the Condition of theſe Sinners. Pſalm 107. 5. <hi>Thirſty, their Soul fainted in them.</hi> They find that the Threatnings of GOD's fiery Law are pointed at them, while out of CHRIST, and their Conferences are ſet on Fire as it were with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Apprehenſions of GOD's Wrath which burns to the loweſt Hell. Their own Righteouſneſſes appear as filthy Rags, altogether inſufficient to cover and defend them. And their outward Performance of religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can't give them Relief. They are ready to cry out with the Pſalmiſt 38. 3, 4. <hi>There is no Soundneſs in my Fleſh, becauſe of thine Anger, neither is there any Reſt in my Bones, becauſe of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are gone over my Head: as an heavy Burden they are too heavy for me.</hi> They are perplexed finding themſelves in a miſerable Caſe, in a Wilderneſs where there is no Water. Their ſorrowful Caſe is well deſcribed Iſai. 41. 17. <hi>The Poor and Needy ſeek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thirſt.</hi> Now they are made ſenſible that unleſs the Almighty GOD open a Fountain to them, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Wants, they muſt periſh under them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Thirſt implieth, that we earneſtly deſire and long after</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and his ſaving Benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have King <hi>David</hi>'s Thirſt expreſſed in longing Deſires. 2 Sam. 23. 15. <hi>And David longed, and ſaid, Oh that one would give me Drink of the Water of the Well of Beth-lehem, which is by the Gate.</hi> Agreeably, when Men thirſt after CHRIST, his Righteouſneſs and Grace, they have longing Deſires after theſe ſpiritual Bleſſings; yea ſuch as can not be ſatisfied with any Thing ſhort of CHRIST, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt. Thirſt is ſuch a Demand of Nature as nothing can ſatisfy but that which is ſuited to quench it. If you ſhould offer to one tormented with it, Thouſands of Silver and Gold, this could not make him eaſy; He muſt periſh with intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pain, unleſs you give him Drink. And what Good then could the whole World do him? And thus ſuch as
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005057_0015_1016931C35B37F60"/>
thirſt after CHRIST, are ſo ſenſible of their Need of him that nothing can give Reſt to their weary Souls but an Intereſt in him, and his ſaving Benefits. Now they are ready to ſay, What ſhall it profit us to gain the World, and loſe our Souls? And what ſhall we give in Exchange for our Soul? Now they long after CHRIST as the only and All-ſufficient Saviour, and are ready to ſay, Give us CHRIST, or we die, we are loſt and undone forever. Now the Favour of GOD in CHRIST is in their Eſteem better than Life, and they ſay, <hi>Whom have we in Heaven but thee? There's none upon Earth we deſire beſides thee.</hi> Our Fleſh and Heart are ready to fail. O ſave us, or we periſh! We have the ſtrong Deſires of one purſued by threatning Evils expreſs'd in this Manner. Pſalm 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O GOD. My Soul thirſteth for GOD, for the living GOD; when ſhall I come and appear before GOD?</hi> The Hart or Deer is naturally hot and thirſty, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when purſued. In like Manner, when GOD's People find themſelves purſued by deadly Enemies, and have been wearied in ſeeking Relief from Creatures, and then are convinced that there's Reſt for their weary Souls in CHRIST alone; they long after him, and the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now the Lord JESUS is precious to them as he ſaveth from Sin, and the Wrath to come; as he gives Pardon and Peace, Grace and Comfort. And they pant after the living Waters he beſtows; yea, theſe Deſires are active, and powerfully incline the Thirſty to ſeek JESUS early, and the Favour of GOD in him. Thus when <hi>David</hi> thirſted for GOD, he ſays, <hi>Early will I ſeek thee.</hi> Nor can ſuch be ſatisfied till they obtain an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in CHRIST, and his ſaving Benefits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Thirſty are ſatisfied when</hi> CHRIST <hi>draweth nigh to them, and communicates the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit to their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cool Waters are not ſo pleaſant to the Thirſty, as CHRIST and his Grace are to ſuch as labour and are heavy laden under the Senſe of Sin. When the Son of GOD reveals himſelf to ſuch as their only Saviour, they find Reſt and Refreſhment in him, as in one every Way able to ſupply their ſpiritual Wants, and fill their empty Souls with Good.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005057_0016_101692F119760160"/>
Now they begin to feel the Truth and ſtrong Conſolation of thoſe Words, John 6. 34. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, I am the Bread of Life; be that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Indeed they deſire the Favour of GOD in CHRIST more and more; but then they reſolve they will go no whither elſe for the Waters of Life; In him they happily find a Fountain opened that can never be drawn dry. And the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their Souls is, ever give us this Water, give thy Spirit more abundantly. When the royal Pſalmiſt had ſaid to GOD, <hi>my Fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and thirſty Land, where no Water is;</hi> He well expreſſeth the Satisfaction he ſhould take in the Communications of GOD's Favour, Pſalm 63. 3. <hi>Becauſe thy loving Kindneſs is better than Life; my Lips ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> And V. 5. <hi>My Soul ſhall be ſatisfied as with Marrow and Fatneſs; and my Mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful Lips.</hi> How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing are Pardon and Grace to ſuch as were ready to ſink under the heavy Burden of Sin! O how chearfully do they ſubmit to CHRIST's Yoke finding it eaſy, and his Burden light, compared with that intollerable Load which before lay upon them. I truſt I may appeal to the Experience of Numbers here preſent, and inquire whether you have not found more true Satisfaction in looking to JESUS CHRIST in the Exerciſe of Faith and godly Sorrow for Sin, than ever you did in gratifying your fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, Mat. 5. 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled.</hi> CHRIST, his Righteouſneſs and Grace fill and ſatisfy the Soul. When Men pant after the Things of this World as their choſen Portion and Happineſs, they are deluded as with Dreams and Shadows. That Deſcription agreeth well to their Caſe, Iſa. 29.8. <hi>It ſhall be even as when a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and behold his Soul is empty; Or as when a thirſty Man dreameth, and behold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he is faint, and his Soul hath Appetite.</hi> But when thirſty Souls drink of the Water of Life, they obtain ſome fore-taſtes of the Joys of Heaven, Pſalm 36. 8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the Fatneſs of thy Houſe; and thou ſhall make them drink of the River of thy Pleaſure;.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005057_0017_1016665BC9FF43E0"/>IV. <hi>We proceed in the laſt Place to ſhew that ſuch as thirſt are invited to come and take the Water of Life freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How full and general is the Invitation! Here is <hi>Come</hi> three Times over. The Spirit and the Bride ſay, <hi>Come.</hi> And ſuch as hear and believe the Word of GOD, are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſay, <hi>Come.</hi> To every one that thirſteth, it is ſaid, <hi>Come.</hi> And then all that are willing, are invited to take the Water of Life freely. And altho' ſome Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors underſtand the firſt <hi>Come,</hi> of CHRIST's coming; yet I can't ſee why all may not unite to encourage thirſty Souls to go to CHRIST for the Water of Life. When the Son of GOD was upon Earth in his human Nature, <hi>He ſtood and cried, ſaying If any Man thirſt let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> Joh. 7.37. And now that he is aſcended into Heaven, he continueth to invite Sinners in the moſt Condeſcending Manner, to come to him; and promiſeth Rev. 21. 6. <hi>I will give unto him that is athirſt of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Water of Life freely.</hi> When the thirſty are invited to come, it may then intend that they are invited to go to CHRIST, and ſo to receive the Water of Life. Accordingly we may under this Head of Diſcourſe inquire 1. What is implied in coming or going to CHRIST? 2. Shew that all who are athirſt, are invited to go to him, and take the Water of Life freely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is implied in coming, or going to</hi> CHRIST? <hi>Or what is the coming to Chriſt here preſſed upon us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>It is a ſpiritual Motion of the Soul by which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, for ſaking other Things, repairs unto</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>to truſt in him alone for Salvation, upon the Command and Promiſe of GOD's Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a ſpiritual Motion of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in the Exerciſe of Faith that we go to JESUS CHRIST. Thus our Saviour himſelf explains the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. John 6. 35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and he that believeth on me, ſball never thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>In going to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>muſt for ſake other Thing; as vain and unable to ſave us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are very prone to place carnal Confidence in their earthly Enjoyments, in themſelves, in their outward reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Privileges, Duties, and Reformations. But in order to our going to CHRIST, we muſt be convinced that a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005057_0018_10169321CE011928"/>
vain ſhall we hope for Salvation from theſe Things; and accordingly we muſt be ſenſible that theſe are but Refuges of Lies, if placed in the Room of CHRIST; And therefore while we wait upon GOD in the Uſe of the Means of Grace, we muſt take heed we do not <hi>ſtop here;</hi> but muſt fly to CHRIST as the only City of Refuge, when the Law, and our own Conſciences condemn us, We muſt go to JESUS, ſenſible that there is <hi>none other Name under Heaven among Men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Acts 4.12.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>We muſt truſt in</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>alone, and have our whole Dependance on him for Salvation</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> Joh. 6. 68. <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou baſt the Words of eternal Life.</hi> Convinced of our Guilt, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Impotency to every Thing ſpiritually good, we muſt go out to CHRIST, to truſt in him for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi> Such as obey this Goſpel-Call, truſt in the Name of the LORD, and ſtay upon him as the LORD their <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt; that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the Works of the Law; for by the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified.</hi> And they alſo depend on JESUS as their Head of Influence, from whom they muſt receive Grace to work out their own Salvation. While at this Work, they look to their Saviour, to work in them to will and to do.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, <hi>We muſt go to</hi> CHRIST <hi>upon the Command and promiſe of GOD's Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Senſible of our ſpiritual Poverty and Wretchedneſs, we muſt take our Encouragement, not from any pretended Worthineſs of our own; but from GOD, his infinite Perfections, his moſt gracious Call and Invitation, his Command and Promiſe. 1 John 3. 23. <hi>This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> He that cometh to CHRIST, goeth in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to GOD's Authority; He ſays, tho' I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to obtain Salvation by JESUS CHRIST, yet ſurely GOD is worthy to be obeyed; and it is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Men to ariſe, and go to CHRIST. He alſo takes Encouragement from the Promiſes of that GOD who
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005057_0019_101693246E2BFA10"/>
cannot lie. He receiveth the Record which GOD hath given of his Son, that in him there is eternal Life, and that who ſoever believeth in him ſhall be ſaved. And as he realiſeth CHRIST's Ability to ſave, ſo he relieth upon his Word as faithful and true, John 6. 37. <hi>Him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And thus he that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to CHRIST, receiveth him as offered in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as thirſt are invited thus to come, and take the Water of Life freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Invitation extends to all that do not wilfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept themſelves. All that live within the Sound of the Goſpel, and who are ſenſible of their ſpiritual Wants, are invited. <hi>He every one that thirſteth, come to the Waters.</hi> All ſuch as are under legal Convictions and Terrors, are invited to go weary and heavy laden to CHRIST. Surely then when Men are beaten off from all their carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, and made willing to go out to CHRIST as wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miſerable in themſelves, to receive theſe living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as the free Gift of GOD. I ſay, ſurely theſe ſhall not be ſent empty away. No, GOD will rather work Miracles of Grace, than theſe ſhould periſh with Thirſt, Iſ a 41. 17, 18. <hi>When the Poor and Needy ſeek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the GOD of Iſrael will not for ſake them. I will open Rivers in high Places, and Fountains in the midſt of the Valleys; I will make the Wilderneſs a Pool of Water, and the dry Land Springs of Water.</hi> All ſuch as are heartily willing to receive CHRIST, whole CHRIST, will be made welcome, <hi>Who ſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> My Hearers! GOD is in earneſt, be you ſo too. I declare to you in the Name of the Lord, that you ſhall all have your own Choice. One hearty Conſent of Soul ſecureth a Title to CHRIST, and his ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefits, John 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life.</hi> If any of you periſh in your Sin, it muſt be <hi>becauſe you will not come to Chriſt, that you may have Life,</hi> John 5. 40. Thouſands and ten Thouſands have obey'd GOD's Voice, and not an Inſtance can be given of ſo much as one ſingle Perſon that has been rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let us then with one Heart and Voice lift up a Cry to the GOD of all Grace, <hi>Lord, make us willing in the Day of thy Power!</hi>

               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Behold, and admire the Fulneſs and Riches of the Grace of GOD in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Father of Glory hath given his only begotten Son to die for us. The Son of GOD hath in our Nature been obedient to Death, that he might open the Fountain of Grace and Mercy for the full Supply of all our Wants. And now the Spirit and the Bride ſay, <hi>Come</hi> — O the Riches of the Grace of GOD in CHRIST! All the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal Bleſſings of the Goſpel are freely offered, freely given. Let us not then deſpiſe the Riches of GOD's Goodneſs, nor turn his Grace into Wantonneſs; but let us be drawn by this Grace, as with the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us inquire whether we thirſt after Chriſt, and his ſaving Benefits?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such, we have heard, are invited to come, and aſſured they ſhall be welcome. Let us then examine whether we have had a painful Senſe of our ſpiritual Wants and Miſeries? Have we felt the Burden of our Sins, and been convinced, that we muſt periſh forever unleſs GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us? Have we accordingly longed after CHRIST, and his Righteouſneſs and Grace, as the Bleſſings which alone can ſatisfy our thirſty Souls? Are we bro't off from truſting to our own Duties and Privileges? And can we now ſay that nothing ſhort of an Intereſt in CHRIST ſhall ſatisfy us? Do we thus continue following the Lord, reſolving by his Grace that we will never go from him to ſeek our Happineſs in Creatures? But that if he caſts us off, we will go mourning all our Days. If this be the Caſe, GOD will ſooner or later ſatisfy the longing Soul. Our Saviour pronounceth ſuch bleſſed, and they ſhall be bleſſed. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let what hath been ſaid encourage ſuch as have a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Senſe of their ſpiritual Wants, to go to Chriſt that they may be filled.</hi> Do not ſit down diſcouraged; but ariſe, and go to CHRIST. Behold! he calls, and moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly invites you to come. <hi>If any Man thriſt, let him come to me, and drink.</hi> It is true, you can't go in your own Strength, Joh. 6. 44. <hi>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> But GOD can
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005057_0021_10169328ABE5E270"/>
by his Spirit perſuade and enable you, more eaſily than you can ſpeak a Word. Look up to the Lord then in earneſt Prayer, and ſay as Cant. 1. 4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee; the King hath brought me into his Chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy Love more than Wine; the Upright love thee.</hi> You may depend upon it, GOD your Saviour is ſincere in this Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The Son of GOD in our Nature, fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and endured the Curſe, that he might bleſs his People with all ſpiritual Bleſſings. When our Lord ſuffered upon the Croſs, he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt.</hi> And ſurely he will not refuſe to ſatisfy the longing Deſires of his People that go to him. Let not then the Senſe of your Wants and Unworthineſs hinder you; for CHRIST hath purchaſed theſe Bleſſings for ſuch as you, and inviteth you to come and take them freely. Did he die to purchaſe them for needy periſhing Sinners, and will he reject ſuch when they come to him for them? Far be ſuch a Tho't from us. What you have to do is in a believing humble Manner to receive what is freely offered you. And here I may further ſay, that the more preſſing and urgent your Neceſſities are, the more Haſte you ſhould make to CHRIST; and the deeper Senſe you have of theſe Wants, the greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement have you that you ſhall be made welcome; for thus runs the Promiſe, Pſalm 81. 10. <hi>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> The Fountain is ſtill open, and full as ever. The Merits and Righteouſneſs of CHRIST have loſt nothing of their Virtue, by being communicated to ſuch vaſt Numbers; and the Influences of the bleſſed Spirit of GOD are as powerful to cleanſe and refreſh your Souls, as ever they were. And I may add, that the preſent <hi>remarkable Day of Grace,</hi> in which GOD is giving ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings with a liberal Hand, may well encourage you to go to GOD as to a Fountain opened in CHRIST for the Supply of all your Wants. O be perſuaded then to hearken and conſider, to hear and obey the Calls of the Goſpel, that your Souls may live! O let it not be ſaid that while many others thankfully accept the Invitations of the Goſpel, that you reject them. <hi>How ſhall you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Certainly you will not be able to eſcape the Damnation of Hell; yea, you muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005057_0022_1016932A47C7E9B0"/>
receive a double Damnation, as you are under the Curſe of the Law, and will then be found Deſpiſers of the Grace of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let thoſe of us who are invited to ſit down at the Lord's Table the next Sabbath, look to it that we go to that holy Feaſt with earneſt Deſires after Chriſt, and the Bleſſings which flow from his Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Ordinance we have a Feaſt on that Sacrifice which CHRIST offered once for all, and are invited to eat and drink his Fleſh and Blood after a ſpiritual Manner, which are Meat and Drink indeed. But then, we muſt open our Hearts to the Lord Jeſus, then he will come in to us, and will ſup with us, and we with him. <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in.</hi> Pſal. 24. 7. Let every Heart be conſecrated as a living Temple unto him, then this King of Glory will be both our Companion, and our Feaſt. He will ſay to us, as Cant. 5. 1. <hi>Eat, O Friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.</hi> And by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father and the Son in this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we ſhall be prepared for that glorious Place and State of which we read, Rev. 7. 15—17. <hi>Therefore are they before the Throne of GOD, and ſerve him Day and Night in his Temple; and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them. They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto Fountains of living Waters; and GOD ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</hi>
