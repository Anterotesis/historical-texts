            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>TO understand political power right, and derive it from its original, we must consider what state all men are naturally in, and that is, a <hi>state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom</hi> to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A <hi>state</hi> also <hi>of equality</hi> wherein all the power and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there being nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This <hi>equality</hi> of men by nature, the judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> looks upon as so evident in itself, and beyond all question, that he makes it the foundation of that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to mutual love amongst men, on which he builds the duties they owe one another, and from whence he derives the great maxims <hi>of justice</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi>

                  </gap>punc; so by the like reason, when his own preservation comes not

in competition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought he, as much as he can, <hi>to preserve the rest of mankind,</hi> and may not, unless it be to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another.</p>
               <p>And that all men may be restrained from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others rights, and from doing hurt to one another, and the law of nature be observed, which willeth the peace and <hi>preservation of all mankind,</hi> the <hi>execution</hi> of the law of nature is, in that state, put into every man's hands, whereby every one has a right to punish the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors of that law to such a degree, as may hinder its violation: for the <hi>law of nature</hi> would, as all other laws that concern men in this world, be in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there were no body that in the state of nature had a <hi>power to execute</hi> that law, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders. And if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he has done, every one may do so: for in that <hi>state of perfect equality,</hi> where natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another, what any may do in prosecution of that law, every one must needs have a right to do.</p>
               <p>And thus, in the state of nature, <hi>one man comes by a power over another</hi>; but yet no absolute or arbitrary power, to use a criminal, when he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or boundless extravagancy of his own will; but only to retribute to him, so far as calm reason and conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for <hi>reparation</hi> and <hi>restraint</hi>: for these two are the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call <hi>punishment.</hi> In transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which is that measure God has set to the actions of men, for their mutual security; and so he becomes dangerous to mankind, the tye, which it to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from injury and violence, being slighted and broken by him. Which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for by the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one, who hath
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012834_0005_0F8B405B68604DC0"/>
transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his example others, from doing the like mischief. And in this case, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, <hi>every man hath a right to punish the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and be executioner of the law of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some men: but before they condemn it, I desire them to resolve me, by what right any prince or state can put to death, or <hi>punish an alien,</hi> for any crime he commits in their country. It is certain their laws, by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated will of the legislative, reach not a stranger: they speak not to him, nor, if they did, is he bound to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them. The legislative authority, by which they are in force over the subjects of that commonwealth, hath no power over him. Those who have the supreme power of making laws in <hi>England, France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> are to an <hi>Indian,</hi> but like the rest of the world, men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority: and therefore, if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish offences against it, as he soberly judges the case to require, I see not how the magistrates of any community can <hi>punish an alien</hi> of another country; since, in reference to him, they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another.</p>
               <p>Besides the crime which consists in violating the law, and varying from the right rule of reason, whereby a man so far becomes degenerate, and declares himself to quit the principles of human nature, and to be a noxious creature, there is commonly <hi>injury</hi> done to some person or other, and some other man receives da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by his transgression: in which case he who hath received any damage, has, besides the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment common to him with other men, a particular right to seek <hi>reparation</hi> from him that has done it: and any other person, who finds it just, may also join with him that is injured, and assist him in recovering from the offender so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he has suffered.</p>
               <p>From these <hi>two distinct rights,</hi> the one of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing</hi> the crime <hi>for restraint,</hi> and preventing the like offence, which right of punishing is in every body; the other of taking <hi>reparation,</hi> which belongs only to the injured party, comes it to pass that the magistrate, who

               <p>And hence it is, that he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power, does thereby <hi>put himself into a state of war</hi> with him; it being to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as a declaration of a design upon his life: for I have reason to conclude, that he who would get me into his power without my consent, would use me as he pleased when he had got me there, and destroy me too when he had a fancy to it; for no body can desire to <hi>have me in his absolute power,</hi> unless it be to compel me by force to that which is against the right of my freedom, <hi>i. e.</hi> make me a slave. To be free from such force is the only security of my preservation; and reason bids me look on him, as an enemy to my preservation, who would take away that <hi>freedom</hi> which is the fence to it; so that he who makes an <hi>attempt to enslave</hi> me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereby puts himself into a state of war with me.

                  </hi> given it to mankind in common. But this being supposed, it seems to some a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, how any one should ever come to have a <hi>property</hi> in any thing: I will not content myself to answer, that if it be difficult to make out <hi>property,</hi> upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God gave the world to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his posterity in common, it is impossible that any man but one univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal monarch, should have any <hi>property</hi> upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God gave the world to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his heirs in succession, exclusive of all the rest of his posterity. But I shall endeavour to shew, how men might come to have a <hi>property</hi> in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that without any express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of all the commoners.</p>
               <p>God who hath given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and convenience. The earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be <hi>a means to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate</hi> them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild <hi>Indian,</hi> who knows no inclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, <hi>i. e.</hi> a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</p>
               <p>Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, yet every man has a <hi>property</hi> in his own <hi>person:</hi> this no body has any right to but himself. The <hi>labour</hi> of his body, and the <hi>work</hi> of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his <hi>labour</hi> with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his <hi>property.</hi> It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this <hi>labour</hi> something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this <hi>labour</hi> being the unquestionable property of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012834_0015_0F8B40651F2D1440"/>
labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.</p>
               <p>He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. That <hi>labour</hi> put a distinction between them and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one say, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated, because he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his? Was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common? If such a consent as that was necessary, man had starved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the plenty God had given him. We see in <hi>commons,</hi> which remain so by compact, that it is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state nature leaves it in, which <hi>begins the property</hi>; without which the common is of no use. And the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this or that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners. Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my <hi>property,</hi> without the assignation or consent of any body. The <hi>labour</hi> that was mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> removing them out of that common state they were in, hath <hi>fixed</hi> my <hi>property</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>By making an explicit consent of every commoner, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to any one's appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common, children or servants could not cut the meat, which their father or master had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them in common, without assigning to every one his peculiar part. Though the water running in the fountain be every one's, yet who can doubt, but that in the pitcher is his only who drew it out? His <hi>labour</hi> hath taken it out of the hands of nature, where it was common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and belonged equally to all her children, and <hi>

               <p>It will perhaps be objected to this, that if gathering the acorns, or other fruits of the earth, <hi>&amp;c</hi> makes a right to them, than any one may <hi>ingross</hi> as much as he will. To which I answer, Not so. The same law of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that does by this means give us property, does also <hi>bound</hi> that <hi>property</hi> too. <hi>God has given us all things richly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nothing was made by God for man to spoil or destroy. And thus, considering the plenty of natural provisions there was a long time in the world, and the few spenders; and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend itself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ingross it to the prejudice of others; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially keeping within the <hi>bounds,</hi> set by reason, of what might serve for his <hi>use</hi>; there could be then little room for quarrels or contentions about property so established.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>chief matter of property</hi> being now not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012834_0017_0F8B40669E8C9268"/>
too is acquired as the former. <hi>As much land</hi> as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of, so much is his <hi>property.</hi> He by his labour does as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inclose it from the common. Nor will it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate his right, to say every body else has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inclose, without the consent of all his fellow-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, all mankind. God, when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the penury of his condition required it of him. God and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> improve it for the benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was his own, his labour. He that in obedience to this command of God, subdued, till<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was his <hi>property,</hi> which another had no title to, nor could without injury take from him.</p>
               <p>Nor was this <hi>appropriation</hi> of any parcel of <hi>land,</hi> by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in effect, there was never the less left for others because of his inclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could think himself injured by the drinking of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, though he took a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is perfectly the same.</p>
               <p>God gave the world to men in common; but since he gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of life they were capable to draw from it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supposed he meant it should always remain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and uncultivated. He gave it to the use of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious and rational, (and <hi>labour</hi> was to be <hi>his title</hi> to it;) not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. He that had as good left for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, as was already taken up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needed not complain, ought not to meddle with what was already improved by another's labour: if he did, it is plain he desired the benefit of another's pains, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though it be common, in respect of some men, it is not so to all mankind; but is the joint property of this country, or this parish.

God commanded, and his wants forced him to <hi>labour.</hi> That was his <hi>property</hi> which could not be taken from him where-ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we see are joined together. The one gave title to the other. So that God, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to subue, gave authority so far to <hi>appropriate:</hi> and the condition of human life, which requires labour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to work on, necessarily introduces private posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

This <hi>measure</hi> did confine every man's <hi>possession</hi> to a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate proportion, and such as he might appropriate to himself, without injury to any body, in the first a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have here rated the improved land very low, in making its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an hundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated waste of <hi>America,</hi> left to nature, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi> where they are well cultivated?</p>

               <p>The same <hi>measures</hi> governed the <hi>possession of land</hi> too: whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could feed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make use of, the cattle and product was also h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if either the grass of his inclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of his plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the earth, notwithstanding his inclosure, was still to be looked on as waste, and might be the possession of any other. Thus, at the beginning, <hi>Cain</hi> might take as much ground as he could till, and make it is own land, and yet leave enough to <hi>Abel</hi>'s sheep to feed on; a few acres would serve for both their possessions. But as families increased, and industry enlarged their stocks, their <hi>possessions enlarged</hi> with the need of them; but yet it was commonly <hi>without any fixed property in the ground</hi> they made use of, till they incorporated, settled themselves
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012834_0021_0F8B406BE00C4CC8"/>
together, and built cities; and then, by consent, they came in time, to set out the <hi>bounds of their distinct territories,</hi> and agree on limits between them and their neighbours; and by laws within themselves, settled the <hi>properties</hi> of those of the same society: for we see, that in that part of the world which was first inhabited, and therefore like to best peopled, even as low down as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s time, they wandered with their flocks, and their herds, which was their substance, freely up and down; and this <hi>Abraham</hi> did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a country where he was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Whence it is plain, that at least a great part of the <hi>land lay in common</hi>; that the inhabitants valued it not, nor claimed property in any more than they made use of. But when there was not room enough in the same place, for their herds to feed together, they by consent, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiii.5. separated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their pasture, where it best liked them. And for the same reason <hi>Esau</hi> went from his father, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and planted in <hi>mount Seir, Gen.</hi> xxxvi.6.</p>
               <p>And thus, without supposing any private dominion, and property in <hi>Adam,</hi> over all the world, exclusive of all other men, which can no way be proved, nor any one's property be made out from it; but supposing the <hi>world</hi> given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it was, to the children of men <hi>in common,</hi> we see how <hi>labour</hi> could make men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for their private uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room for quarrel.</p>
               <p>Nor is it so strange, as perhaps before consideration it may appear, that the <hi>property of labour</hi> should be able to overbalance the community of land: for it is <hi>labour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that <hi>puts the difference of value</hi> on every thing; and let any one consider what the difference is between an acre of land planted with tobacco or sugar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sown with wheat or barley, and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any husbandry upon it, and he will find that the improvement of <hi>labour makes</hi> the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very modest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to say, that of the <hi>products</hi> of the earth useful to the life of man nine tenths are the <hi>effects of labour</hi>: nay, if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about them, what in them is purely owing to <hi>nature,</hi> and what to <hi>labour,</hi> we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundreths are wholly to be put on the account of <hi>labour.</hi>

               <p>And as different degrees of industry were apt to give men possessions in different proportions, so this <hi>invention of money</hi> gave them the opportunity to continue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them: for supposing an island, separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world, wherein there were but an hundred families, but there were sheep, horses and cows, with other useful animals, wholsome fruits, and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the island, either because of its commonness, or perishableness, fit to supply the place of <hi>money</hi>; what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family, and a plentiful supply to its <hi>consumption,</hi> either in what their own industry produced, or they could barter for like perishable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> useful commodities, with others?

It would not be worth the inclosing, and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature, whatever was more than would supply the conveniencies of life to be had there for him and his family.</p>
               <p>Thus in the beginning all the world was <hi>America,</hi> and more so than that is now; for no such thing as <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> was any where known. Find out something that hath the <hi>use and value of money</hi> amongst his neighbours, you shall see the same man will begin presently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his possessions.</p>
               <p>But since gold and silver, being little useful to the life of man in proportion to food, raiment and carriage, has its <hi>value</hi> only from the consent of men, whereof <hi>labour</hi> yet <hi>makes,</hi> in great part, <hi>the measure,</hi> it is plain, that men have agreed to a disproportionate and unequal <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the earth,</hi> they having, by a tacit and voluntary consent, found out a way how a man may fairly possess more land than he himself can use the product of, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in exchange for the overplus gold and silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any one; these metals not spoiling or decaying in the hands of the possessor. This partage of things in an inequality of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate possessions, men have made practicable out of the bounds of society, and without compact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly agreeing in the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate the right of property, and the possession of land is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by positive constitutions.</p>
               <p>And thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, without any difficulty, <hi>how labour could at first begin a title of property</hi> in the common things of nature, and how the spending it upon our uses bounded it. So that there could then be no reason of quarreling about title, nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it gave. Right and conveniency went together; for as a man had a right to all he could employ his labour upon, so he had no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to labour for more than he could make use of This left no room for controversy about the title, nor for incroachment on the right of others; what portion a man carved to himself, was easily seen; and it was use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.</p>

               <head>Of Paternal Power.</head>
               <p>IT may perhaps be censured as an impertinent criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism, in a discourse of this nature, to find fault with words and names, that have obtained in the world: and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones, when the old are apt to lead men into mistakes, as this of <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power</hi> probably has done, which seems so to place the power of parents over their children wholly in the <hi>father,</hi> as if the <hi>mother</hi> had no share in it; whereas, if we consult reason or revelation, we shall find, she hath an equal title. This may give one reason to ask, whether this might not be more properly called <hi>parental power?</hi> for whatever obligation nature and the right of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lays on children, it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent causes of it. And accordingly we see the positive law of God every where joins them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without distinction, when it commands the obedience of children, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi> Exod. xx.12. <hi>Whosoever curseth his father or his mother,</hi> Lev. xx.9. <hi>Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father.</hi> Lev. xix.3. <hi>Children, obey your parents,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. vi.1. is the stile of the Old and New Testament.</p>
               <p>Had but this one thing been well considered, without looking any deeper into the matter, it might perhaps have kept men from running into those gross mistakes, they have made, about this power of parents; which, however it might, without any great harshness, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was created a perfect man, his body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason, and so was capable, from the first instant of his being to provide for his own support and preservation, and govern his actions according to the dictates of the law of reason which God had implanted in him. From him the world is peopled with his descendants, who are all born infants, weak and helpless, without knowledge or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but to supply the defects of this imperfect state, till the improvement of growth and age hath removed them. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after them all <hi>parents</hi> were, by the law of nature, <hi>under an obligation to preserve, nourish, and educate the children</hi> they had begotten; not as their own workmanship, but the workmanship of their own maker, the Almighty, to whom they were to be accountable for them.</p>

So that, however it may be mistaken, <hi>the end of law is</hi> not to abolish or restrain, but <hi>to preserve and enlarge freedom</hi>: for in all the states of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings capable of laws, <hi>where there is no law, there is no freedom</hi>: for <hi>liberty</hi> is, to be free from restraint and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from others; which cannot be, where there is no law: but freedom is not, as we are told, <hi>a liberty for every man to do what be lists</hi>: (for who could be free, when every other man's humour might domineer over him?) but a <hi>liberty</hi> to dispose, and order as he lists, his person, actions, possessions, and his whole property, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the allowance of those laws under which he is, and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another, but freely follow his own.</p>
               <p>The <hi>power,</hi> then, <hi>that parents have</hi> over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, arises from that duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their off-spring, during the imperfect state of childhood. To inform the mind, and govern the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall take its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren want, and the parents are bound to: for God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given man an understanding to direct his actions, has allowed him a freedom of will, and liberty of acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the bounds of that law he is under. But whilst he is in an estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has not <hi>understanding</hi> of his own to direct his <hi>will,</hi> he is not to have any <hi>will</hi> of his own to follow: he that <hi>understands</hi> for him, must <hi>will</hi> for him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012834_0030_0F8B4076D207A190"/>This holds in all the laws a man is under, whether natural or civil. Is a man under the law of nature? <hi>What made him free</hi> of that law? what gave him a free disposing of his property, according to his own will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of that law? I answer, a state of maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein he might be supposed capable to know that law, that so he might keep his actions within the bounds of it. When he has acquired that state, he is presumed to know how far that law is to be his guide, and how far he may make use of his <hi>freedom,</hi> &amp; so comes to have it; till then, some body else must guide him, who is presumed to know how far the law allows a liberty. If such a state of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, such an age of discretion <hi>made him free,</hi> the same shall make his son free too. Is a man under the law of <hi>England? What made him free</hi> of that law? that is, to have the liberty to dispose of his actions and possessions according to his own will, within the permission of that law? A capacity of knowing that law; which is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by that law, at the age of one and twenty years, and in some cases sooner. If this <hi>made</hi> the father <hi>free,</hi> it shall <hi>make</hi> the son <hi>free</hi> too. Till then we see the law allows the son to have no will, but he is to be guided by the will of his father or guardian, who is to understand for him. And if the father die, and fail to substitute a deputy in his trust; if he hath not provided a tutor, to govern his son, during his minority, during his want of understanding, the law takes care to do it; some other must govern him, and be a will to him, till he hath <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a state of freedom,</hi> and his understanding be fit to take the government of his will. But after that, the father &amp; son are equally <hi>free</hi> as much as tutor &amp; pupil after nonage; equally subjects of the same law together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dominion left in the father over the life, liberty, or estate of his son, whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature, or under the positive laws of an established government.</p>
               <p>But if, through defects that may happen out of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of nature, any one comes not to such a degree of reason, wherein he might be supposed capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, and so living within the rules of it, he is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver capable of being a free man,</hi> he is never let loose to the disposure of his own will (because he knows no bounds to it, has not understanding, its proper guide) but is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012834_0031_0F8B407720EA6828"/>
continued under the tuition and government of others, all the time his own understanding is uncapable of that charge. And so <hi>lunatics</hi> and <hi>ideots</hi> are never set free from the government of their parents; <hi>children, who are not as yet come unto those years whereat they may have; and innocents which are excluded by a natural defect from ever having;</hi> thirdly, <hi>madmen, which for the present cannot possibly have the use of right reason to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have for their guide, the reason that guideth other men which are tutors over them, to seek and procure their good for them, says</hi> Hooker, Eccl. Pol. <hi>lib</hi> i. <hi>sect.</hi> 7. All which seems no more than that duty, which God and nature has laid on man, as well as other creatures, to preserve their off-spring, till they can be able to shift for themselves, and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of <hi>parents</hi> regal authority.</p>
               <p>Thus we are <hi>born free,</hi> as we are born rational; not that we have actually the exercise of either: age, that brings one, brings with it the other too. And thus we see how <hi>natural freedom and subjection to parents</hi> may consist together, and are both founded on the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. A <hi>child</hi> is <hi>free</hi> by his father's title, by his father's understanding, which is to govern him till he hath it of his own. The <hi>freedom of a man at years of discretion,</hi> and the <hi>subjection</hi> of a child <hi>to</hi> his <hi>parents,</hi> whilst yet short of that age, are so consistent, and so distinguishable, that the most blinded contenders for monarchy, <hi>by right of fatherhood,</hi> cannot miss this <hi>difference</hi>; the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate cannot but allow their consistency: for where their doctrine all true, were the right heir of <hi>Adam</hi> now known, and by that title settled a monarch in his throne, invested with all the absolute unlimitted power Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> talks of; if he should die as soon as his heir were born, must not the <hi>child,</hi> notwithstanding he were never so free, never so much sovereign, be in subjection to his mother and nurse, to tutors and governors, till age and education brought him reason and ability to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self &amp; others? The necessities of his life, the health of his body, &amp; the information of his mind, would require him to be directed by the will of others, and not his own; and yet will any one think, that this restraint and subjection were inconsistent with, or spoiled him of that liberty or sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty he had a right to, or gave away his empire to those who had the government of his nonage?

His command over his children is but temporary, and reaches not their life or property: it is but a help to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and imperfection of their nonage, a discipline necessary to their education: and though a <hi>father</hi> may dispose of his own possessions as he pleases, when his children are out of danger of perishing for want, yet <hi>his power</hi> extends not to the lives or goods, which either their own industry, or a another's bounty has made their's; nor to their liberty neither, when they are once arrived to the infranchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the years of discretion. The <hi>father</hi>'s <hi>empire</hi> then ceases, and he can from thence forwards no more dispose of the liberty of his son, than that of any other man: and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which a man may withdraw himself, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from divine authority to <hi>leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though there be a time when a <hi>child</hi> comes to be as <hi>free</hi> from subjection to the will and command of his father, as the father himself is free from subjection to the will of any body else, and they are each under no

other restraint, but that which is common to them both, whether it be the law of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or municipal law of their country; yet this freedom exempts not a son from that <hi>honour</hi> which he ought, by the law of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>to</hi> pay his <hi>parents.</hi> God having made the parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of mankind, and the occasions of life to their children; as he hath laid on them an obligation to nourish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preserve, and bring up their off-spring; so he has laid on the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a perpetual obligation of <hi>honouring their parents,</hi> which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shewn by all outward expressions, ties up the child from any thing that may ever injure or affront<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> disturb or endanger, the happiness or life of those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions of defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose means he entered into being, and has been capable of any enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life: from this obligation no state, no freedom can absolve children. But this is very far from giving parents a power of command over their children, or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their lives or liberties. It is one thing to owe honour, respect, gratitude and assistance; another to require an absolute obedience and submission. The <hi>honour due to parents,</hi> a monarch in his throne owes his mother; and yet this lessens not his authority, nor subjects him to her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The subjection of a minor places in the father a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary government, which terminates with the minority of the child: and the <hi>honour due from a child,</hi> places in the parents a perpetual right to respect, reverence, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and compliance too, more or less, as the father's care, cost, and kindness in his education, has been more or less. This ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and conditions of a man's life. The want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing these two powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that which the father hath in the right of <hi>tuition,</hi> during minority, and the right of <hi>honour</hi> all his life, may perhaps have caused a great part of the mistakes about this matter: for to speak properly of them, the first of these is rather the privilege of children, and duty of parents, than any prerogative of paternal power.

taking care of it: and though the <hi>power of commanding and chastising</hi> them go along with it, yet God hath wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for their off-spring, that there is little fear that parents should use their power with too much rigour; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess is seldom on the severe side, the strong byass of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture drawing the other way. And therefore God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when he would express his gentle dealing with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> he tells them, that though he chastened them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>he chastened them as a man chastens his son,</hi> Deut. viii.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>On the other side, <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>support,</hi> all that which gratitude requires to return for the benefits received by and from them, is the indispensible duty of the child, and the proper privilege of the parents.

And that duty which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the word <hi>honour,</hi> requires less obedience, tho' the obligation be stronger on grown, than younger chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for who can think the command, <hi>Children obey your parents,</hi> requires in a man, that has children of his of his own, the same submission to his father, as it does in his yet young children to him; and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Though the obligation on the parents to <hi>bring up</hi> their children, and the obligation on children to <hi>honour</hi> their parents, contain all the power on the one hand, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission on the other, which are proper to this relation, yet there is <hi>another power</hi> ordinarily <hi>in the father,</hi> whereby he has a tie on the obedience of his children; which tho' it be common to him with other men, yet the occasions of shewing it, almost constantly happening to fathers in their private families, and the instances of it elsewhere being rare, and less taken notice of, it passes in the world for a part of <hi>paternal jurisdiction.</hi> And this is the power men generally have to <hi>bestow their estates</hi> on those who please them best, the possession of the father being the expectation and inheritance of the children, ordinarily in certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, according to the law and custom of each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet it is commonly in the father's power to bestow it with a more sparing or liberal hand, according as the behaviour of this or that child hath comported with his will and humour.</p>
               <p>This is no small tie on the obedience of children: and there being always annexed to the enjoyment of land, a submission to the government of the country, of which that land is a part; it has been commonly supposed that a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> could <hi>oblige his posterity to that government,</hi> of which he himself was a subject, and that his compact held them; whereas, it being only a necessary condition annexed to the land, and the inheritance of an estate which is under that government reaches only those who will take it on that condition, and so is no natural tie or engagement, but a voluntary submission: for <hi>every man's children</hi> being by nature as <hi>free</hi> as himself, or any of his ancestors over were, may, whilst they are in that freedom, choose what society they will join themselves to, what commonwealth they will put themselves under. But if they will enjoy the <hi>inheritance</hi> of their ancestors, they must take it on the same terms their ancestors had it, and submit to all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed to such a possession. By this power, indeed fathers oblige their children to obedience to themselves,

But how a <hi>family,</hi> or any other society of men, differ from that which is properly <hi>political society,</hi> we shall best see, by considering wherein <hi>political society</hi> itself consists.</p>
               <p>Man being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the law of nature, equally with any other man, or number of men in the world, hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men; but to judge of and punish the breaches of that law in others, as he is persuaded the offence deserves, even with death itself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in crimes where the heinousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires it. But because no <hi>political society</hi> can be, nor subsist, without having in itself the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that society; there, and there only is <hi>political society,</hi> where every one of the members hath qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thus all private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every particular member being excluded the community comes to be umpire, by settled standing rules indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authority from the community, for the execution of those rules, decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any

Those who are united into one body, and have a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authorities to decide controversies between them, and punish offenders, are in <hi>civil society</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but those who have no such common people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean on earth, are still in the state of nature, each being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where there is no other, judge for himself, and executioner; which is, as I have before shewed it, the perfect <hi>state of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the common-wealth comes by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions which they think worthy of it, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the members of that society, (which is the <hi>power of making laws</hi>) as well as it has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its members, by any one that is not of it, (which is the <hi>power of war and peace</hi>;) and all this for the preservation of the property of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that society, as far as is possible.

Government is every where antecedent to records, and letters seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil society has, by other more necessary arts, provided for their safety, case, and plenty: and then they begin to look after the history of their founders, and search into their <hi>original,</hi> when they have outlived the memory of it: for it is with <hi>common-wealths</hi> as with particular persons, they are commonly <hi>ignorant of their own births and infancies</hi>: and if they know any thing of their <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi>

they are beholden for it, to the accidental records that others have kept of it. And those that we have, of the beginning of any polities in the world, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> where God himself immediately interposed, and which favours not at all paternal domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, are all either plain instances of such a beginning as I have mentioned, or at least have manifest footsteps of it.</p>
               <p>He must shew a strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, who will not allow, that the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> were by the uniting together of several men free and independent one of another, amongst whom there was no natural superiority or subjection. And if <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Acosta</hi>'s word may be taken, he tells us, that in many parts of <hi>America</hi> there was no government at all. <hi>There are great and apparent conjectures,</hi> says he, <hi>that these men,</hi> speaking of those of Peru, <hi>for a long time had neither kings nor common-wealths, but lived in troops, as they do this day in</hi> Florida, <hi>the</hi> Cheriquanas, <hi>those of</hi> Brasil, <hi>and many other nations, which have no certain kings, but as occasion is offered, in peace or war, they choose their captains as they please,</hi> l. i. c. 25. If it be said, that every man there was born subject to his father, or the head of his family; that the subjection due from a child to a father took not away his freedom of uniting into what political society he thought fit, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved. But be that as it will, these men, it is evident, were actually <hi>free</hi>; and whatever superiority some politicians now would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it not, but by consent were all <hi>equal,</hi> till by the same consent they set rulers over themselves. So that their <hi>politic societies</hi> all <hi>began</hi> from a voluntary union, and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the choice of their governors, and forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And I hope those who went away from <hi>Sparta</hi> with <hi>Palantus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentioned by <hi>Iustin,</hi> l. iii. c. 4. will be allowed to have been <hi>freemen independent</hi> one of another, and to have set up a government over themselves, by their own consent. Thus I have given several examples, out of history, of <hi>people free and in the state of nature,</hi> that being met together incorporated &amp; <hi>began a commonwealth.</hi> And if the want of such instances be an argument to prove
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012834_0054_0F8B3FA2F7A53958"/>
that <hi>government</hi> were not, nor could not be so <hi>begun,</hi> I suppose the contenders for paternal empire were better let it alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than urge it against natural liberty: for if they can give so many instances, out of history, of <hi>governments begun</hi> upon paternal right, I think (though at best an argument from what has been, to what should of right be, has no great force) one might, without any great danger, yield them the cause. But if I might advise them in the case, they would do well not to search too much into the <hi>original of governments,</hi> as they have begun <hi>de facto,</hi> lest they should find, at the foundation of most of them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very little favourable to the design they promote, and such a power as they contend for.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, reason being plain, on our side, that men are naturally free, and the examples of history shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>governments</hi> of the world, that were begun in peace, had their beginning laid on that foundation, and were <hi>made by the consent of the people</hi>; there can be little room for doubt, either where the right is, or what has been the opinion, or practice of mankind, about the <hi>first erecting of governments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not deny, that if we look back as far as history will direct us, towards the <hi>original of common-wealths,</hi> we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man. And I am also apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that where a family was numerous enough to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by itself, and continued entire together, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others, as it often happens, where there is much land, and few people, the government commonly began in the father: for the father having, by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the same power with every man else to punish, as he thought fit, any offences against that law, might thereby punish his transgressing children, even when they were men, and out of their pupilage; and they were very likely to submit to his punishment, and all join with him against the offender, in their turns, giving him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by power to execute his sentence against any transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and so in effect make him the law-maker, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor over all that remained in conjunction with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He was fittest to be trusted; paternal affection secured their property and interest under his care; and the custom of obeying him, in their childhood, made it easier to submit to him, rather than to any other. If therefore they must have one to rule them, as govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012834_0055_0F8B3FA3A41BD5E0"/>
is hardly to be avoided amongst men that live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who so likely to be the man as he that was their common father; unless negligence, cruelty, or any other defect of mind or body made him unfit for it? But when either the father died, and left his next heir, for want of age, wisdom, courage, or any other qualities, less fit for rule; or where several families met, and consented to continue together; there, it is not to be doubted, but they used their natural freedom, to set up him, whom they judged the ablest, and most likely, to rule well over them. Conformable hereunto we find the people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> who (living out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>each of the conquering swords, and spreading domination of the two great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi>) enjoyed their own natural freedom, though, <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus, though looking back as far as records give us any account of peopling the world, and the history of nations, we commonly find the <hi>government</hi> to be in one hand: yet it destroys <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They had neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion, nor did the fashion of the age, nor their possessions, or way of living, (which afforded little matter for covetousness or ambition) give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder they put themselves into such a <hi>frame of government,</hi> as was not only, as I said, most obvious and simple, but also best suited to their present state and condition; which stood more in need of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against foreign invasions and injuries, than of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of laws. The equality of a simple poor way of living, confining their desires within the narrow bounds of each man's small property, made few controversies, and so no need of many laws to decide them, or variety of officers to superintend the process, or look after the execution of justice, where there were but few trespasses, and few offenders. Since then those, who liked one another so well as to join into society, cannot but be supposed to have some acquaintance and friendship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and some trust one in another; they could not but have greater apprehensions of others, than of one another: and therefore their first care and thought can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be supposed to be, how to secure themselves against foreign force. It was natural for them to put themselves under a <hi>frame of government</hi> which might best serve to that end, and chuse the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their wars, and lead them out against their enemies, and in this chiefly be their <hi>ruler.</hi>

And then they have nothing to do, but barely to shew us which that is; which when they have done, I doubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him.</p>
               <p>Though it be a sufficient answer to their objection, to shew that it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against; yet I shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ittle farther.</p>

                  <hi>All men,</hi> say they, <hi>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:012834_0061_0F8B3FA8E102E5B0"/>
It is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural <hi>subjection that they were born in,</hi> to one or to the other that tied them, without their own consents, to a subjection to them and their heirs.</p>
               <p>For there are no examples so frequent in history, both sacred and profane, as those of men withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their obedience, from the jurisdiction they were born under, and the family or community they were bred up in, and <hi>setting up new governments</hi> in other places; from whence sprang all that number of petty common-wealths in the beginning of ages, and which always mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, as long as there was room enough, till the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or more fortunate, swallowed the weaker; and those great ones again breaking to pieces, diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This has been the practice of the world from its first beginning to this day; nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind, that they are <hi>born under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and ancient polities,</hi> that have established laws, and set forms of government, than if they were born in the woods, amongst the unconfined inhabitants, that run loose in them: for those, who would persuade us, that <hi>by being born under any government, we are naturally subjects to it,</hi> and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature, have no other reason (bating that of paternal power, which we have already answered) to produce for it, but only, because our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or progenitors passed away their natural liberty, and thereby bound up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government, which they themselves submitted to. It is true, that whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements or promises any one has made for himself, he is under the obligation of them, but <hi>cannot,</hi> by any <hi>compact</hi> whatsoever, <hi>bind his children or posterity:</hi> for
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012834_0062_0F8B3FA99F9E0268"/>
his son, when a man, being altogether as free as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, any <hi>act of the father can no more give away the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the son,</hi> than it can of any body else: he may indeed annex such conditions to the land, he enjoyed as a subject of any common-wealth, as may oblige his son to be of that community, if he will enjoy those possessions which were his father's; because that estate being his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's property, he may dispose, or settle it, as he pleases.</p>
               <p>And this has generally given the occasion to mistake in this matter; because common wealths not permitting any part of their dominions to be dismembered, nor to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> enjoyed by any but those of their community, the son cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father, but under the same terms his father did, by becoming a member of the society; whereby he puts himself pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently under the government he finds there established, as much as any other subject of that common-wealth. And thus <hi>the consent of freemen, born under government,</hi> which only <hi>makes them members of it,</hi> being given se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately in their turns, as each comes to be of age, and not in a multitude together; people take no notice of it, and thinking it not done at all, or not necessary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are naturally subjects as they are men.</p>
               <p>But, it is plain, <hi>governments</hi> themselves understand it otherwise; they claim <hi>no power over the son, because of that they had over the father</hi>; nor look on children as being their subjects, by their fathers being so. If a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England</hi> have a child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by an <hi>English</hi> woman in <hi>France,</hi> whose subject is he? Not the king of <hi>England</hi>'s; for he must have leave to be admitted to the privileges of it: nor the king of <hi>France</hi>'s; for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away, and breed him as he pleases? and who ever was judged as a <hi>traytor</hi> or <hi>deserter,</hi> if he left or warred against a count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, for being barely born in it of parents that were aliens there? It is plain then, by the practice of governments themselves, as well as by the law of right reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>a child is born a subject of no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or government.</hi> He is under his father's tuition and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, till he comes to age of discretion; and then he is a freeman, at liberty what government he will put himself under, what body politic he will unite himself to: for if an <hi>Englishman</hi>'s son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> born in <hi>France,</hi> be at liberty, and may do so, it is evident there is no tie upon him by his father's being a subject of this kingdom; nor is he bound
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012834_0063_0F8B3FAAEFA816A8"/>
up by any compact of his ancestors. And why then hath not his son, by the same reason, the same liberty, though he be born any where else? Since the power that a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath naturally over his children, is the same where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be born, and the ties of natural obligations, are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every man</hi> being, as has been shewed, <hi>naturally free,</hi> and nothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly power, but only his own <hi>consent</hi>; it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, what shall be understood to be a <hi>sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of a man's <hi>consent, to make him subject</hi> to the laws of any government. There is a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent, which will concern our present case. No body doubts but an express <hi>consent,</hi> of any man entering into any society, makes him a perfect member of that society, a subject of that government. The difficulty is, what ought to be looked upon as a <hi>tacit consent,</hi> and how far it binds, <hi>i. e.</hi> how far any one shall be looked on to have consented, and thereby submitted to any government, where he has made no expressions of it at all. And to this I say, that every man that hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth thereby give his <hi>tacit consent,</hi> &amp; is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during such enjoyment, as any one under it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this his possession be of land, to him and his heirs for ever, or a lodging only for a week; or whether it be barely travelling freely on the highway; and in effect, it reaches as far as the very being of any one within the territories of that government.</p>
               <p>To understand this the better, it is fit to consider, that every man, when he at first incorporates himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any commonwealth he, by his uniting himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, annexed also, and submits to the community, those possessions, which he has, or shall acquire, that do not already belong to any other government: for it would be a direct contradiction, for any one to enter into society with others for the securing and regulating of property; and yet to suppose his land, whose property is to be regulated by the laws of the society, should be exempt from the jurisdicton of that government, to which he himself, the proprietor of the land, is a subject. By the same act therefore, whereby any one unites his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

Hence it is, that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that are out of it, are managed by the public; and an injury done to a member of their body, engages the whole in the reparation of it. So that under this consideration, the whole community is one body in the state of nature, in respect of all other states or persons out of its community.</p>
               <p>This therefore contains the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and all the transactions, with all persons and communities without the common-wealth, and may be called <hi>federative,</hi> if any one pleases.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so must necessarily be left to the prudence and wisdom of those, whose hands it is in, to be managed for the public good: for the <hi>laws</hi> that concern subjects one amongst another, being to direct their actions, may well enough <hi>preced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what is to be done in reference to <hi>foreigners,</hi> depending much upon their actions, and the variation of designs and interests, must be <hi>lest</hi> in great part <hi>to</hi> the <hi>prudence</hi> of those, who have this power committed to them, to be managed by the best of their skill, for the advantage of the common-wealth.</p>

And thus the <hi>community</hi> perpetually <hi>retains a supreme power</hi> of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the subject: for no man or society of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having a power to deliver up their <hi>preservation,</hi> or consequently the means of it, to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute will and arbitrary dominion of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when ever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and unalterable law of <hi>self-preservation,</hi> for which they entered into society. And thus the <hi>community</hi> may be said in this respect to be <hi>always the supreme power,</hi> but not as considered under any form of government, because this power of the people can never take place till the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be dissolved.</p>
               <p>In all cases, whilst the government subsists, the <hi>legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative is the supreme power</hi>: for what can give laws to another, must needs be superior to him; and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative of the society, but by the right it has to make laws for all the parts, and for every member of the society, prescribing rules to their actions, and giving power of execution, where they are transgressed, the <hi>legislative</hi> must needs be the

But when he quits this representation, this public will, and acts by his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate will, he degrades himself, and is but a single pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person without power, and without will, that has any right to <hi>obedience</hi>; the members owing no <hi>obedience</hi> but to the public will of the society.</p>

of convoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive, and has one of these two limitations in respect of time: that either the original constitution requires their <hi>assembling</hi> and acting at certain intervals, and then the executive power does nothing but ministerially issue direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their electing and assembling, according to due forms; or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections, when the occasions or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old, or making of new laws, or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies, that lie on, or threaten the people.</p>

               <p>The <hi>power of assembling and dismissing the legislative,</hi> placed in the executive, gives not the executive a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over it, but is a fiduciary trust placed in him, for the safety of the people, in a case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fixed rule: for it not being possible, that the first fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the government should, by any foresight, be so much masters of future events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the <hi>assemblie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore they have a very wrong notion of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who say, that the people have <hi>incroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prerogative,</hi> when they have got any part of it to be defined by positive laws: for in so doing they have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, but only declared, that that power which they indefinitely left in his or his ancestors hands, to be exercised for their good, was not a thing which they intended him when he used it otherwise: for the end of government being the good of the community, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an <hi>incroachment</hi> upon any body, since no body in government can have a right tending to any other end: and those only are <hi>incroachments</hi> which prejudice or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the public good. Those who say otherwise, speak as if the prince had a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community, and was not made for it; the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments. And indeed, if that be so, the people under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not a society of rational creatures, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a community for their mutual good; they are not such as have set rulers over themselves, to guard, and promote that good; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who keeps them and works them for his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or profit. If men were so void of reason, and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, as to enter into society upon such terms, <hi>prerogative</hi> might indeed be, what some men would have it, an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power to do things hurtful to the people.</p>

               <p>And therefore he that will look into the <hi>history of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will find, that <hi>prerogative</hi> was always <hi>largest</hi> in the hands of our wisest and best princes; because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, observing the whole tendency of their actions to be the public good, contested not what was done without law to that end: or, if any human frail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y or mistake (for princes are but men, made as others) appeared in some small declinations from that end; yet 't was visible, the main of their conduct tended to nothing but the care of the public. The people therefore, finding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be satisfied with these princes, whenever they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without, or contrary to the letter of the law, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esced in what they did, and, without the least complaint, let them inlarge their <hi>prerogative</hi> as they pleased, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly, that they did nothing herein to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their laws, since they acted conformable to the foundation and end of all laws, the public good.</p>
               <p>Such god-like princes indeed had some title to arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power by that argument, that would prove absolute monarchy the best government, as that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self governs the universe by; because such kings partake of his wisdom and goodness.

most dangerous to the liberties of their people: for when their successors, managing the government with different thoughts, would draw the actions of those good rulers into precedent, and make them the standard of their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> as if what had been done only for the good of the people was a right in them to do, for the harm of the people, if they so pleased; it has often occasioned contest, and sometimes public disorders, before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could recover their original right, and get that to be declared not to be <hi>prerogative,</hi> which truly was never so; since it is impossible that any body in the society should ever have a right to do the people harm; though it be very possible, and reasonable, that the people should not go about to set any bounds to the <hi>prerogative</hi> of those kings, or rulers, who themselves transgressed not the bounds of the public good: for <hi>prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of <hi>calling parliaments</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as to precise time, place, and duration, is certainly a <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the king, but still with this trust, that it shall be made use of for the good of the nation, as the exigencies of the times, and variety of occasions, shall require: for it being impossible to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to assemble in, and what the best sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the choice of these was left with the executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as might be most subservient to the public good, and best suit the ends of parliaments.</p>
               <p>The old question will be asked in this matter of <hi>prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> But <hi>who shall be judge</hi> when this power is made a right use of? I answer: between an executive power in being, with such a prerogative, and a legislative that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his will for their convening, there can be no <hi>judge on earth</hi>; as there can be none between the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and the people, should either the executive, or the legislative, when they have got the power in their hands, design, or go about to enslave or destroy them. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no other remedy in this, as in all other cases where they have no judge on earth, but to <hi>appeal to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>: for the rulers, in such attempts, exercising a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the people never put into their hands, (who can never be supposed to consent that any body should rule over them for their harm) do that which they have not a right to do. And where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012834_0089_0F8B3FC328BC8338"/>
have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment. And therefore, though the <hi>people cannot</hi> be <hi>judge,</hi> so as to have, by the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that society, any superior power, to determine and give effective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where there lies no appeal on earth, <hi>viz.</hi> to judge, whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven. And this judgment they cannot part with, it being out of a man's power so to submit himself to another, as to give him a liberty to destroy him; God and nature never allowing a man so to abandon himself, as to neglect his own preservation: and since he cannot take away his own life, neither can he give another power to take it. Nor let any one think, this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder; for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates not, till the inconveniency is so great, that the majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it amended. But this the executive power or wise princes, never need come in the danger of: and it is the thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all others, they have most need to avoid, as of all others the most perilous.</p>

               <p>THOUGH I have had occasion to speak to these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately before, yet the great mistakes of late about government, having, as I suppose arisen from confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these distinct powers one with another, it may not, perhaps, be amiss to consider them here together.</p>
               <p>First, then, <hi>paternal</hi> or <hi>parental power</hi> is nothing but that which parents have over their children, to govern them for the children's good, till they come to the use of reason, or a state of knowledge, wherein they may be supposed capable to understand that rule, whether it be the law of nature, or the municipal law of their country, they are to govern themselves by: capable, I say, to know it, as well as several others, who live as freemen under that law. The affection and tenderness which God hath planted in the breast of parents towards their

                  </gap>n why it should be thought to extend to life and death at any time, over their children, more than over any body else; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any pretence why this <hi>parental power</hi> should keep the child, when grown to a man, in subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the will of his parents, any farther than having received life and education from his parents, obliges him to respect, honour, gratitude, assistance and support all his life, to both father and mother. And thus, tis true, the <hi>paternal</hi> is a natural <hi>government,</hi> but not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending itself to the ends and jurisdictions of that which is political. The <hi>power of the father doth not reach</hi> at all to the <hi>property</hi> of the child, which is only in his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Political power</hi> is that power, which every man having in the state of nature, has given up into the hands of the society, and therein to the governo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, whom the society hath set over itself, with this express or tacit trust, that it shall be employed for their good, and the preservation of their property: now this <hi>power,</hi> which every man has <hi>in the state of nature,</hi> and which he parts with to the society in all such cases where the society can secure him, is to use such means, for the preserving of his own property, as he thinks good, and nature allows him; and to punish the breach of the law of nature in others, so as (according to the best of his reason) may most conduce to the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind. So that the <hi>end and measure of this power,</hi> when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, it can have no other <hi>end or measure,</hi> when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions; and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be preserved; but a <hi>power to make laws,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex such <hi>penalties</hi> to them, as may tend to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole, by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt, that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful.

                  </gap> an absolute, arbitrary power one man has over another, to take away his life, whenever he pleases. This is a power, which neither nature gives, for it has made no such distinction between one man and another; nor compact can convey: for man not having such an arbitrary power over his own life, cannot give another man such a power over it; but it is the <hi>effect only of forfeiture,</hi> which the aggressor makes of his own life, when he puts himself into the state of war with another: for having quitted reason, which God hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man, and the common bond whereby human kind is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one fellowship and society; and having renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the way of peace which that teaches, and made use of the force of war, to compass his unjust ends upon another, where he has no right; and so revolting from his own kind to that of beasts, by making force, which is their's, to be his rule of right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he renders himself liable to be destroyed by the injured person, and the rest of mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will join with him in the execution of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as any other wild beast, or noxious brute, with whom mankind can have neither society nor security<note n="†" place="bottom">Another copy corrected by Mr. Locke, has it thus, <hi>Nex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious brute that is destructive to their being.</hi>

And thus <hi>captives,</hi> taken in a just and lawful war and such only, are <hi>subject to a despotical power,</hi> which, as it arises not from compact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the state of war continued: for what compact can be made with a man that is not master of his own life? what condition can he perform? and if he be once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be master of his own life, the <hi>despotical, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power</hi> of his master ceases. He that is master of himself, and his own life, has a right too to the means of preserving it; so that <hi>as soon as compact enters, sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ceases,</hi> and he so far quits his absolute power, and puts an end to the state of war, who enters into condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature gives</hi> the first of these, <hi>viz. paternal power to parents</hi> for the benefit of their children during their minority, to supply their want of ability, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how to manage their property. (By <hi>property</hi> I must be understood here, as in other places, to mean
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012834_0092_0F8B3FC55F671000"/>
that property which men have in their persons as well as goods.) <hi>Voluntary agreement gives</hi> the second, <hi>viz. political power to governors</hi> for the benefit of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to secure them in the possession and use of their properties.

               <p>He, that shall consider the distinct rise and extent, and the different ends of these several powers, will plainly see, that <hi>paternal power</hi> comes as far short of that of the <hi>magistrate,</hi> as <hi>despotical</hi> exceeds it; and that <hi>absolute dominion,</hi> however placed, is so far from being one kind of civil society, that it is as inconsistent with it, as slavery is with property. <hi>Paternal power</hi> is only where mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity makes the child incapable to manage his property; <hi>political,</hi> where men have property in their own dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal; and <hi>despotical,</hi> over such as have no property at all.</p>

We are told by some, that the <hi>English</hi> monarchy is founded in the <hi>Norman</hi> conquest, and that our princes have thereby a title to absolute dominion: which if it were true, (as by the history it appears other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) and that <hi>William</hi> had a right to make war on this island; yet his dominion by conquest could reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> that were then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this country. The <hi>Normans</hi> that came with him, and helped to conquer, and all descended from them, are freemen, and no subjects by conquest; let that give what dominion it will. And if I, or any body else, shall claim freedom, as derived from them, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: and it is plain, the law that has made no distinction between the one and the other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not there should be any difference in their freedom or privileges.</p>
               <p>But supposing, which seldom happens, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors and conquered never incorporate into one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the same laws and freedom; let us see next <hi>what power a lawful conqueror has over the subdued</hi>: and that I say is purely despotical. He has an absolute power over the lives of those who by an unjust war have forfeited them; but not over the lives or fortunes of those who engaged not in the war, nor over the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons even of those who were actually engaged in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say then the <hi>conqueror</hi> gets no power but only over those who have actually assisted, concurred, or consented to that unjust force that is used against him:

for the people having given to their governors no power to do an unjust thing, such as is to make an unjust war, (for they never had such a power in themselves) they ought not to be charged as guilty of the violence and unjustice that is committed in an unjust war, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they actually abet it; no more than they are to be thought guilty of any violence or oppression their governors should use upon the people themselves, or any part of their fellow subjects, they having impowered them no more to the one than to the other. Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, it is true, seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction, but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together: but yet this alters not the right; for the conquerors power over the lives of the conquered, being only because they have used force to do, or maintain an injustice, he can have that power only over those who have concurred in that force; all the rest are innocent; and he has no more title over the people of that country, who have done him no injury, and so have made no forfeiture of their lives, than he has over any other, who, without any injuries or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, have lived upon fair terms with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>power a conqueror gets</hi> over those he overcomes <hi>in a just war, is perfectly despotical</hi>: he has an absolute power over the lives of those, who, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves in a state of war, have forfeited them; but he has not thereby a right and title to their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This I doubt not, but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine, it being so quite contrary to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the world; there being nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries, than to say such an one conquered it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if conquest, without any more ado<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conveyed a right of possession. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the practice of the strong and powerful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how universal soever it may be, is seldom the rule of right, however it be one part of the subjection of the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not to argue against the conditions cut out to them by the conquering sword.</p>
               <p>Though in all war there be usually a complication of force and damage, and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the estate, when he uses force against the persons of those he makes war upon; yet it is the use of force only that puts a man into the state of war: for whether by force he begins the injury, or else having quietly, and by fraud,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012834_0096_0F8B3FC9ECF110E0"/>
done the injury, he refuses to make reparation, and by force maintains it, (which is the same thing, as at first to have done it by force) it is the unjust use of force that makes the war: for he that breaks open my house, and violently turns me out of doors; or having peaceably got in, by force keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; supposing we are in such a state, that we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judge on earth, whom I may appeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: for of such I am now speaking. It is the <hi>unjust use of force</hi> then, that <hi>puts a man into the state of war</hi> with another; and thereby he that is guilty of it makes a forfeiture of his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e: for quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reason, which is the rule given between man and man, and using force, the way of beasts, he becomes lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be destroyed by him he uses force against, as any savage ravenous beast, that is dangerous to his being.</p>
               <p>But because the miscarriages of the father are no faults of the children, and they may be rational and peaceable, notwithstanding the brutishness &amp; injustice of the father; the father, by his miscarriages and violence, can forfeit but his own life, but involves not his children in his guilt or destruction. His goods, which nature, that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as is possible, hath made to belong to the children to keep them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, do still continue to belong to his children: for supposing them not to have joined in the war, either thro' infancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> absence, or choice, they have done nothing to forfeit them: <hi>nor has the conqueror any right</hi> to take them away, by the bare title of having subdued him that by force attempted his destruction; though perhaps he may have some right to them, to repair the damages he has sustained by the war, and the defence of his own right; which how far it reaches to the possessions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall see by and by. So that he that <hi>by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest has a right over a man's person</hi> to destroy him if he pleases, has <hi>not</hi> thereby a right over <hi>his estate</hi> to possess and enjoy it: for it is the brutal force the aggressor has used, that gives his adversary a right to take away his life, and destroy him if he pleases, as a noxious creature; but it is damage sustained that alone gives him title to another man's goods: for though I may kill a thief that sets on me in the high-way, yet I may not (which seems less) take away his money, and let him go: this would be robbery on my side. His force, and the state of war
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012834_0097_0F8B3FCAA0727520"/>
he put himself in, made him forfeit his life, but gave me no title to his goods. The <hi>right</hi> then of <hi>conquest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only to the lives</hi> of those who joined in the war, <hi>not to their estates,</hi> but only in order to make reparation for the damages received, and the charges of the war, and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>conqueror</hi> have as much justice on his side, as could be supposed, he <hi>has</hi> no <hi>right</hi> to seize more than the vanquished could forfeit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his life is at the victor's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and his service and goods he may appropriate, to make himself reparation; but he cannot take the goods of his wife and children; they too had a title to the goods he enjoyed, and their shares in the estate he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed: for example, I in the state of nature (and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are in the state of nature one with another) have injured another man, and refusing to give satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it comes to a state of war, wherein my defending by force what I had gotten unjustly, makes me the aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. I am conquered: my life, it is true, as forfeit, is at mercy, but not my wife's and children's. They made not the war, nor assisted in it. I could not forfeit their lives; they were not mine to forfeit. My wife had a share in my estate; that neither could I forfeit. And my chidren also, being born of me, had a right to be maintained out of my labour or substance. Here then is the case: the conqueror has a title to reparation for damages received, and the children have a title to their father's estate for their subsistence: for as to the wife's share<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether her own labour, or compact, gave her a title to it, it is plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her husband could not forfeit what was her's. What must be done in the case? I answer; the fundamental law of nature being, that all, as much as may be, should be preserved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully to <hi>satisfy</hi> both, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's losses,</hi> and children's maintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his full satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give way to the pressing and preferable title of those who are in danger to perish without it.</p>
               <p>But supposing the <hi>charge</hi> and <hi>damages of the war</hi> are to be made up to the conqueror, to the utmost farthing; and that the children of the vanquished, spoiled of all their father's goods, are to be left to starve and perish; yet the satisfying of what shall, on this score, be due to

               <p>Over those then that joined with him in the war, and over those of the subdued country that opposed him not,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012834_0099_0F8B3FCC6DE25680"/>
and the posterity even of those that did, the conqueror, even in a just war, hath by his conquest, no <hi>right of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>: they are free from any subjection to him, and if their former government be dissolved, they are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to begin and erect another to themselves.</p>
               <p>The conqueror, it is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> usually, by the force he has over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compels them, with a sword at their breasts, to stoop to his conditions, and submit to such a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he pleases to afford them; but the enquiry is, what right he has to do so? If it be said, they submit by their own consent, then this allows their own <hi>consent</hi> to be <hi>necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule</hi> over them. It remains only to be considered, whether <hi>promises ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by force,</hi> without right, can be thought consent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>how far they bind.</hi> To which I shall say, they <hi>bind not at all</hi>; because whatsoever another gets from me by force, I still retain the right of, and he is obliged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to restore. He that forces my horse from me, ought presently to restore him, and I have still a right to retake him. By the same reason, he that <hi>forced a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> from me, ought presently to restore it, <hi>i. e.</hi> quit me of the obligation of it; or I may resume it myself, <hi>i. e.</hi> chuse whether I will perform it: for the law of nature laying an obligation on me only by the rule she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her rules: such is the extorting any thing from me by force. Nor does it at all alter the case to say, <hi>I gave my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> no more than it excuses the force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and passes the right, when I put my hand in my pocket, and deliver my purse myself to a thief, who demands it with a pistol at my breast.</p>
               <p>From all which it follows, that the <hi>government of a conqueror,</hi> imposed by force on the subdued, against whom he had no right of war, or who joined not in the war against him, where he had right, <hi>has no obligation</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>But let us suppose, that all the men of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being all members of the same body politic, may be taken to have joined in that unjust war wherein they are subdued, and so their lives are at the mercy of the conqueror.</p>
               <p>I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this concerns not their children who are in their minority: for since a father hath not, in himself, a power over the life or liberty of his child, no act of his
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012834_0100_0F8B3FCE707B29D0"/>
can possibly forfeit it. So that the children, whatever may have happened to the fathers, are freemen, and the absolute power of the <hi>conqueror</hi> reaches no farther than the persons of the men that were subdued by him, and dies with them: and should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Every man is born with a double right: <hi>first,</hi> a <hi>right of freedom to his person,</hi> which no other man has a power over, but the free disposal of it lies in himself. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a <hi>right,</hi> before any other man, <hi>to inherit</hi> with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren his <hi>father's goods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the first of these, a man is <hi>naturally free</hi> from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to any government, tho' he be born in a place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its jurisdiction; but if he disclaim the lawful govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the country he was born in, he must also quit the right that belonged to him by the laws of it, and the possessions there descending to him from his ancestors, if it were a government made by their consent.</p>
               <p>By the second, the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of any country, who are descended, and derive a title to their estates from those who are subdued, and had a government forced upon them against their free consents, <hi>retain a right to the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of their ancestors,</hi> though they consent not freely to the government, whose hard conditions were by force imposed on the possessors of that country: for the first <hi>conqueror never having had a title to the land</hi> of that country, the people who are the descendents of, or claim under those who were forced to submit to the yoke of a government by constraint, have always a right to shake it off, and free themselves from the usurpation of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which the sword hath brought in upon them, till their rulers put them under such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice consent to. Who doubts but the Grecian christians, descendants of the ancient pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors of that country, may justly cast off the Turkish yoke, which they have so long groaned under, whenever they have an opportunity to do it? For no government can have a right to obedience from a people who have not freely consented to it; which they can never be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012834_0101_0F8B3FCF1F575890"/>
to do, till either they are put in a full state of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuse their government and governors, or at least till they have such standing laws, to which they have by themselves or their representatives given their free consent, and also till they are allowed their due property, which is so to be proprietors of what they have, that no body can take away any part of it without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without which, men under any government are not in the state of freemen, but are direct slaves under the force of war.</p>
               <p>But granting that the <hi>conqueror</hi> in a just war has a right to the estates, as well as power over the persons, of the conquered; which, it is plain, he <hi>hath</hi> not: nothing of <hi>absolute power</hi> will follow from hence, in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the government; because the descendants of these being all freemen, if he grants them estates and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to inhabit his country, (without which it would be worth nothing) whatsoever he grants them, they have, so far as it is granted, <hi>property</hi> in. The nature whereof is, that <hi>without a man's own consent</hi> it <hi>cannot be taken from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>persons</hi> are <hi>free</hi> by a native right, and their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> be they more or less, are <hi>their own, and at their own dispose,</hi> and not at his; or else it is no <hi>property.</hi> Supposing the conqueror gives to one man a thousand acres, to him and his heirs forever; to another he lets a thousand acres for his life, under the rent of 50l. or 500l. <hi>per. ann.</hi> has not the one of these a right to his thousand acres forever, and the other, during his life, paying the said rent? and hath not the tenant for life a <hi>property</hi> in all that he gets over and above his rent, by his labour and industry during the said term, supposing it be double the rent? Can any one say, the king, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, after his grant, may by his power of conqueror take away all, or part of the land from the heirs of one, or from the other during his life, he paying the rent? or can he take away from either the goods or money they have got upon the said land, at his pleasure? If he can, then all free and voluntary <hi>contracts</hi> cease, and are void in the world; there needs nothing to dissolve them at any time, but power enough: and all the <hi>grants</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of <hi>men in power</hi> are but mockery and collusion: for can there be any thing more ridiculous than to say, I give you and your's this for ever, and that in the surest

               <p>The short of the <hi>case in conquest</hi> is this: the conqueror, if he have a just cause, has a despotical right over the persons of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that actually aided, and concurred in the war against him, and a right to make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates, so he injure not the right of any other.

               <head>Of TYRANNY.</head>
               <p>AS usurpation is the exercise of power, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath a right to; so <hi>tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right,</hi> which no body can have a right to. And this is making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private separate advantage. When the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, however intitled, makes not the law, but his will, the rule; and his commands and actions are not direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the preservation of the properties of his people, but the satisfaction of his own ambition, revenge, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, or any other irregular passion.</p>
               <p>If one can doubt this to be truth, or reason, because it comes from the obscure hand of a subject, I hope the authority of a king will make it pass with him. King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, in his speech to the parliament, 1603, tells them thus, <hi>I will ever prefer the weal of the public, and of the whole commonwealth, in making of good laws and constitutions to any particular and private ends of mine; thinking ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a lawful king doth directly differ from a tyrant: for I do acknowledge, that the special and greatest point of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is between a rightful king and an usurping tyrant, is this; that whereas the proud and ambitious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doth think his kingdom and people are only ordained for satisfaction of his desires and unreasonable appetites, the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the procuring of the wealth and property of his people.</hi> And again, in his speech to the parliament, 1609, he hath these words, <hi>The king binds himself by a double oath, to the observation of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws of his kingdom; tacitly, as by being a king, and so bound to protect as well the people, as the laws of his kingdom; and expresly, by his oath at his coronation: so as every just king, in a settled kingdom, is bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that paction made to his people, by his laws, in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his government agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with</hi> Noah <hi>after the deluge. Hereafter, feed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012834_0105_0F8B3FD22EAB6340"/>
summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease while the earth remaineth. And therefore a king govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a settled kingdom, leaves to be a king, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into a tyrant, as soon as he leaves off to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his laws.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Therefore all kings that are not tyrants, or perjured, will be glad to bound themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ves within the limits of their laws; and they that persuade them the contrary, are vipers, and pests both against them and the commonwealth.</hi> Thus that learned king, who well understood the notion of things, makes the difference betwixt a <hi>king</hi> and a <hi>tyrant</hi> to consist only in this, that one makes the laws the bounds of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the good of the public, the end of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the other makes all give way to his own will and appetite.</p>
               <p>It is a mistake, to think this fault is proper only to monarchies; other forms of government are liable to it, as well as that: for wherever the power, that is put in any hands for the government of the people, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their properties, is applied to other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harrass, or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it; there it presently becomes <hi>tyranny,</hi> whether those that thus use it are one or many. Thus we read of the thirty tyrants at <hi>Athens,</hi> as well as one at <hi>Syracuse</hi>; and the intolerable dominion of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins,</hi> if the law be transgressed to another's harm; and whosoever in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority exceeds the power given him by the law, and makes use of the force he has under his command, to compass that upon the subject, which the law allows not, ceases in that to be a magistrate; and, acting without authority may be opposed as any other man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by force invades the right of another. This is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. He that hath authority to seize my person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a robber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ, notwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such a legal authority, as will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power him to arrest me abroad And why this should not hold in the highest, as well as in the most in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>punc; and but imagine he has not right done him? This will unhinge and overturn all polities, and, instead of government and order, leave nothing but anarchy and confusion.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, that <hi>force</hi> is to be <hi>opposed</hi> to nothing, but to unjust and unlawful <hi>force</hi>; whoever makes any opposition in any other case, draws on himself a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation both from God and man; and so no such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or confusion will follow, as is often suggested: for,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As, in some countries, the person of the prince by the law is sacred; and so, whatever he commands or does, his person is still free from all question or violence, not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But yet opposition may be made to the illegal acts of any inferior officer, or other commissioned by him; unless he will by actually putting himself into a state of war with his people, dissolve the government, and leave them to that defence which belongs to every one in the state of nature: for of such things who can tell what the end will be? and a neighbour kingdom has shewed the world an odd example. In all other cases the <hi>sacredness</hi> of the <hi>person exempts him from all inconveniencies,</hi> whereby he is secure, whilst the government stands, from all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and harm whatsoever: than which there cannot
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012834_0107_0F8B3FD3B4B57050"/>
be a wiser constitution: for the harm he can do in his own person not being likely to happen often, nor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend itself far; nor being able by his single strength to subvert the laws, nor oppress the body of the people, should any prince have so much weakness, and ill nature as to be willing to do it, the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs, that may happen sometimes, when a heady prince comes to the throne, are well recompensed by the peace of the public, and security of the government, in the person of the chief magistrate, thus set out of the reach of danger: it being safer for the body, that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer, than that the head of the republic should be easily, and upon flight occasions, exposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But this privilege, belonging only to the king's person, hinders not but they may be questioned, opposed, and resisted, who use unjust force, though they pretend a commission from him, which the law authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes not; as is plain in the case of him that has the king's writ to arrest a man, which is a full commission from the king; and yet he that has it cannot break open a man's house to do it, nor execute this command of the king upon certain days, nor in certain places, though this commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion have no such exception in it; but they are the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the law which if any one transgress, the king's commission excuses him not: for the king's authority being given him only by the law, he cannot impower any one to act against the law, or justify him, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, in so doing; the <hi>commission,</hi> or <hi>command of any magistrate, where he has no authority,</hi> being as <hi>void</hi> and insignificant, as that of any private man; the difference between the one and the other, being that the magistrate has some authority so far, and to such ends, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man has none at all: for it is not the <hi>commission,</hi> but the <hi>authority,</hi> that gives the right of acting; and <hi>against the laws there can be no authority.</hi> But, notwithstanding such resistance, the king's person and authority are still both secured, and so <hi>no danger to governor or government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Supposing a government wherein the person of the chief magistrate is not thus sacred; yet this <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> of the lawfulness of <hi>resisting</hi> all unlawful exercises of his power, <hi>will not</hi> upon every slight occasion endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, or <hi>imbroil the government:</hi> for where the injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party may be relieved, and his damages repaired by
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012834_0108_0F8B3FD4683234F8"/>
appeal to the law, there can be no pretence for force, which is only to be used where a man is intercepted from appealing to the law: for nothing is to be accounted hostile force, but where it leaves not the remedy of such an appeal; and it is such <hi>force</hi> alone, that <hi>puts</hi> him that uses it <hi>into a state of war,</hi> and makes it lawful to resist him. A man with a sword in his hand demands my purse in the high-way, when perhaps I have not twelve pence in my pocket: this man I may lawfully kill. To ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I deliver 100l. to hold only whilst I alight, which he refuses to restore me, when I am got up again, but draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his sword to defend the possession of it by force, if I endeavour to retake it. The mischief this man does me is a hundred or possibly a thousand times more than the other perhaps intended me (whom I killed before he really did me any); and yet I might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt the other lawfully. The reason whereof is plain; because the one using <hi>force,</hi> which threatned my life, I could not have <hi>time to appeal</hi> to the law to secure it: and when it was gone, it was too late to appeal. The law could not restore life to my dead carcass: the loss was irreparable; which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the law of nature gave me a right to <hi>destroy</hi> him, who had put himself in a state of war with me, and threatened my destruction. But in the other case, my life not being in danger, I may have the <hi>benefit of appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the law, and have reparation for my 100l. that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But if the unlawful acts done by the magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate be maintained (by the power he has got,) and the remedy which is due by law, be by the same power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed; yet the <hi>right of resisting,</hi> even in such manifest acts of tyranny, <hi>will not</hi> suddenly or on slight occasions, <hi>disturb the government</hi>: for if it reach no farther than some private men's cases, though they have a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, and to recover by force what by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force is taken from them; yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest, wherein they are sure to perish; it being as impossible for one, or a few op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed men to <hi>disturb the government,</hi> where the body of the people do not think themselves concerned in it, as for a raving mad-man, or heady mal-content to overturn a well-settled state; the people being as little apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the one, as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:012834_0109_0F8B3FD557A86D50"/>But if either these illegal acts have extended to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the people; or if the mischief and oppression has lighted only on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, and consequences seem to threaten all: and they are perswaded in their consciences, that their laws, and with them their estates, liberties, and lives are in danger, and perhaps their religion too; how they will be hindered from resisting illegal force, used against them, I cannot tell. This is an <hi>inconvenience,</hi> I confess, <hi>that attends all governments</hi> whatsoever, when the governors have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected of their people; the most dangerous state which they can possibly put themselves in; wherein they are the less to be pitied, because it is so easy to be avoided; it being as impossible for a governor, if he really means the good of his people, and the preservation of them, and their laws together, not to make them see and feel it, as it is for the father of a family, not to let his children see he loves, and takes care of them.</p>
               <p>But if all the world shall observe pretences of one kind, and actions of another; arts used to elude the law, and the trust of prerogative (which is an arbitrary power in some things left in the prince's hand to do good, not harm to the people) employed co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HE that will with any clearness speak of the <hi>dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government,</hi> ought in the first place to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between the <hi>dissolution of the society</hi> and the <hi>dissolution of the government.</hi> That which makes the community, and brings men out of the loose state of nature, into <hi>one politic society,</hi> is the agreement which every one has with the rest to incorporate, and act as one body, and so be one distinct common wealth. The usual, and almost only way whereby <hi>this union is dissolved,</hi> is the inroad of foreign force making a conquest upon them: for in that case, (not being able to maintain and support themselves, as <hi>one intire</hi> and <hi>independent body</hi>) the union belonging to that body which consisted therein, must necessarily cease, and so every one return to the state he was in before, with a liberty to shift for himself, and provide for his own safety, as he thinks fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in some other society. Whenever the <hi>society is dissolved,</hi> it is certain the government of that society cannot remain. Thus conquerors swords often cut up governments by the roots, and mangle societ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The world is too well instructed in, and too forward to allow of, this way of dissolving of governments, to need any more to be said of it; and there wants not much argument to prove, that where the <hi>society is dissolved</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the government cannot remain; that being as impossible, as for the frame of an house to subsist when the materials of it are scattered and dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused heap by an earthquake.</p>
               <p>Besides this over-turning from without, <hi>governments are dissolved from within,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When the <hi>legislative</hi> is <hi>altered.</hi> Civil society being a state of peace, amongst those who are of it, from whom the state of war is excluded by the umpirage, which they have provided in their legislative, for the ending all differences that may arise amongst any of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is in their <hi>legislative</hi> that the members of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth are united<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and combined together into one coherent living body. This <hi>is the soul that gives form, life, and unity,</hi> to the common-wealth: from hence the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:012834_0111_0F8B3FD7EC779738"/>
several members have their mutual influence, sympathy, and connexion: and therefore, when the <hi>legislative</hi> is broken, or <hi>dissolved,</hi> dissolution and death follows: for the <hi>essence and union of the society</hi> consisting in having one will, the legislative when once established by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, has the declaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it were keeping of that will. The <hi>constitution of the legislative</hi> is the first and fundamental act of society, whereby provision is made for the <hi>continuation of their union,</hi> under the direction of persons, and bonds of laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made by persons authorized thereunto, by the consent and appointment of the people, without which no one man, or number of men, amongst them, can have authority of making laws that shall be binding to the rest. When any on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or more, shall take upon them to make laws, whom the people have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed so to do, they make laws without authority, which the people are not therefore bound to obey; by which means they come again to be out of subjection, and may constitute to themselves a <hi>new legislative,</hi> as they think best, being in full liberty to resist the force of those, who without authority would impose any thing upon them. Every one is at the disposure of his own will, when those who had by the delegation of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the declaring of the public will, are excluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such authority or delegation.</p>
               <p>This being usually brought about by such in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth who misuse the power they have; it is hard to consider it aright, and know at whose door to lay it, without knowing the form of government in which it happens. Let us suppose then the legislative placed in the concurrence of three distinct persons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A single hereditary person, having the constant, supreme, executive power, and with it the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking and dissolving the other two within certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An assembly of hereditary nobility.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An assembly of representatives chosen, <hi>pro tempore</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the people. Such a form of government supposed, it is evident,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That when such a single person, or prince, sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws, which are the will of the society, declared by the legislative, then the <hi>legislative is changed</hi>: for that being in effect the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

whose rules and laws are put in execution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be obeyed; when other laws are set up, and other rules pretended, and inforced, than what the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative, constituted by the society, have enacted, it is plain that the <hi>legislative is changed.</hi> Whoever introduces new laws, not being thereunto authorized by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental appointment of the society, or subverts the old, disowns and overturns the power by which they were made, and so sets up a <hi>new legislative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the prince hinders the legislative from assembling in its due time, or from acting freely, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to those ends for which it was constituted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative is altered</hi>: for it is not a certain number of men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have also freedom of debating, and leisure of perfecting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is for the good of the society, wherein the legislative-consists; when these are taken away or altered, so as to deprive the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the due exercise of their power, the <hi>legislative</hi> is truly altered; for it is not names that constitute go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, but the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany them; so that he, who takes away the freedom, or hinders the acting of the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in its due seasons, in effect takes <hi>away the legislative,</hi> and <hi>puts an end to the government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When, by the arbitrary power of the prince, the electors, or ways of election, are altered, without the consent, and contrary to the common interest of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there also the <hi>legislative is altered</hi>: for, if others than those whom the society hath authorized thereunto, do chuse, or in another way than what the society hath prescribed, those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The delivery also of the people into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a foreign power, either by the prince, or by the legislative, is certainly a <hi>change of the legislative,</hi> and so a <hi>dissolution of the government:</hi> for the end why people entered into society being to be preserved one intire, free, independent society, to be governed by its own laws; this is lost, whenever they are given up into the power of another.</p>
               <p>Why, in such a constitution as this, the <hi>dissolution of the government</hi> in these cases is to be imputed to the prince, is evident: because he, having the force, treasure and offices of the state to employ, and often persuading
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:012834_0113_0F8B3FD9F10A7180"/>
himself, or being flattered by others, that as supreme magistrate he is uncapable of controul; he alone is in a condition to make great advances toward such changes, under pretence of lawful authority, and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress opposers, as factious, sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and enemies to the government: whereas no other part of the legislative, or people, is capable by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to attempt any alteration of the legislative, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out open and visible rebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of, which, when it prevails, produces effects very little different from foreign conquest. Besides, the prince in such a form of government, having the power of dissolving the other parts of the legislative, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendering them private persons, they can never in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sition to him, or without his concurrence, alter the legislative by a law, his consent being necessary to give any of their decrees that sanction. But yet, so far as the other parts of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government, and do either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or not, what lies in them, hinder such designs, they are guilty, and partake in this, which is certainly the greatest crime men can be guilty of one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>There is one way more whereby such a government may be dissolved, and that is, when he who has the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme executive power, neglects and abandons that charge, so that the laws already made can no longer be put in execution. This is demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy, and so effectually <hi>to dissolve the government</hi>: for laws not being made for themselves, but to be, by their execution, the bonds of the society, to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and function; when that totally ceases, the <hi>government</hi> visibly <hi>ceases,</hi> and the people become a confused multitude, without order or connexion. Where there is no longer the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of justice, for the securing of men's rights, nor any remaining power within the community to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the force, or provide for the necessities of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there certainly is <hi>no government lest.</hi> Where the laws cannot be executed it is all one as if there were no laws; and a government without laws is, I suppose, a mystery in politics, unconceivable to human capacity, and inconsistent with human society.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:012834_0114_0F8B3FDA9B64B5E8"/>In these and the like cases, <hi>when the government is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi> the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good: for the <hi>society</hi> can never, by the fault of another, lose the native and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right it has to preserve itself, which can only be done by a settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the laws made by it. But the state of mankind is not so miserable that they are not capable of using this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, till it be too late to look for any. To tell <hi>people</hi> they <hi>may provide for themselves,</hi> by erecting a new legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, when by oppression, artifice, or being delivered over to a foreign power, their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may expect relief when it is too late, and the evil is past cure. This is in effect no more than to bid them first be slaves, and then to take care of their liberty; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may act like freemen. This, if barely so, is rather mockery than relief; and men can never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from tyranny, if there be no means to escape it till they are perfectly under it: and therefore it is, that they have not only a right to get out of it, but to prevent it.</p>
               <p>There is therefore, secondly, another way whereby <hi>governments are dissolved,</hi> and that is, when the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or the prince, either of them, act contrary to their trust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>legislative acts against the trust</hi> reposed in them, when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject, and to make themselves, or any part of the community, masters, or arbitrary disposers of the lives, liberties, or fortunes of the people.</p>
               <p>The reason why men enter into society, is the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their property; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative, is, that there may be laws made and rules set, as guards and fences to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all the members of the society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it can never be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple submitted themselves to legislators of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; whenever the <hi>legislators endeavour to take away,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012834_0115_0F8B3FDB2F6D5F68"/>
and destroy the property of the people,</hi> or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any farther obedience, and are left to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the <hi>legislative</hi> shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to grasp</hi> themselves, <hi>or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power</hi> over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they <hi>forfeit the power</hi> the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which they are in society. What I have said here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the legislative in general, holds true, also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society. He <hi>acts</hi> also <hi>contrary to his trust,</hi> when he either employs the force, treasure, and offices of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to corrupt the <hi>representatives,</hi> and gain them to his purposes; or openly pre-engages the <hi>electors,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to their choice, such, whom he has, by sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his designs; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised before hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public security? for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their <hi>representatives,</hi> as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, as the necessity of the commonwealth, and the public good should, upon examination, and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, be judged to require. This, those who give their votes before they hear the debate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not capable of doing. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:012834_0116_0F8B3FDBE5288AF0"/>
of the people, and the law-makers of the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, is certainly as great a <hi>breach of trust,</hi> and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the arts of perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who thus employ it contrary to the trust went along with it in its first institution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once attempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.</p>
               <p>To this perhaps it will be said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the people being ignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expose it to certain ruin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>no government will be able long to subsist,</hi> if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may set up a new legislative, whenever they take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the old one. To this I answer, Quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. People are not so easily got out of their old forms, as some are apt to suggest. They are hardly to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame they have been accustomed to. And if there be any original defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption; it is not an easy thing to get them changed, even when all the world sees there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it. This slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions, has, in the many revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been seen in this kingdom, in this and former ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> still kept us to, or, after some interval of fruitless attempts, still brought us back again to our old legislative of king, lords and commons: and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes heads, they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line.</p>
               <p>But it will be said, this <hi>hypothesis</hi> lays a <hi>ferment for</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>rebellion.</hi> To which I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> No more than any other <hi>hypothesis</hi>: for when the people are made miserable, and find themselves <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the ill usage of arbitrary power,</hi> cry up their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as much as you will, for sons of <hi>Iupiter</hi>; let them be sacred and divine, descended, or authorized from
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012834_0117_0F8B3FDCEC56D480"/>
heaven; give them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. <hi>The people generally ill treated,</hi> and contrary to right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them. They will wish and seek for the opportunity, which in the change, weakness and accidents of human affairs, seldom delays long to offer itself. He must have lived but a little while in the world, who has not seen exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this in his time; and he must have read very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, who cannot produce examples of it in all sorts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answer, such <hi>revolutions happen</hi> not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs. <hi>Great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes</hi> in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the <hi>slips</hi> of human frailty, will be <hi>born by the people</hi> without mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prevarications and artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they lie under, and see whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are going; it is not to be wondered, that they should then rouze themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavour to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected; and without which, ancient names, and specious forms, are so far from being better, that they are much worse, than the state of nature, or pure anarchy; the inconveniencies being all as great and as near, but the remedy farther off and more difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I answer, that <hi>this doctrine</hi> of a power in the people of providing for their safety a-new, by a new legislative, when their legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their property, is <hi>the best fence against rebellion,</hi> and the probablest means to hinder it: for <hi>rebellion</hi> being an opposition, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but authority, which is founded only in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and laws of the government; those, whoever they be, who by force break through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by force justify their violation of them, are truly and properly <hi>rebels</hi>: for when men, by entering into society and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of property, peace, and unity amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, those who set up force again in opposition to the laws, do <hi>rebellare,</hi> that is, bring back again the state of war, and are properly rebels: which they who are in
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012834_0118_0F8B3FDD62BF91A0"/>
power, (by the pretence they have to authority, the temptation of force they have in their hands, and the flattery of those about them) being likeliest to do; the properest way to prevent the evil, is to shew them the danger and injustice of it, who are under the greatest temptation to run into it.</p>
               <p>In both the fore-mentioned cases, when either the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative is changed, or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they were constituted; those who are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are <hi>guilty of rebellion</hi>: for if any one by force takes away the established legislative of any society, and the laws by them made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes away the umpirage, which every one had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, for a peaceable decision of all their controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and a bar to the state of war amongst them. They, who remove, or change the legislative, take away this decisive power, which no body can have, but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and consent of the people; and so destroying the authority which the people did, and no body else can set up, and introducing a power which the people hath not authorized, they actually <hi>introduce a state of war,</hi> which is that of force without authority: and thus, by removing the legislative established by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, (in whose decisions the people acquiesced and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to that of their own will) they untie the knot, and <hi>expose the people a-new to the state of war.</hi> And if those, who by force take away the legislative, are <hi>rebels,</hi> the <hi>legislators</hi> themselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when they, who were set up for the protection, and preservation of the people, their liberties and properties, shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away; and so they putting themselves into a state of war with those who made them the protectors and guardians of their peace, are properly, and with the greatest aggravation, <hi>rebellantes,</hi> rebels.</p>
               <p>But if they, who say <hi>it lays a foundation for rebellion,</hi> mean that it may occasion civil wars, or intestine broils, to tell the people they are absolved from obedience when illegal attempts are made upon their liberties or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who were their magistrates, when they invade their properties contrary to the trust put in them; and that therefore this doctrine is not to be allowed, being so destructive to the peace of the world: they may as well say, upon the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012834_0119_0F8B3FDEA18A49D8"/>
same ground, that honest men may not oppose robbers or pirates, because this may occasion disorder or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. If any <hi>mischief</hi> come in such cases, it is not to be charged upon him who defends his own right, but <hi>on him that invades</hi> his neighbours. If the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he has, for peace sake, to him who will lay violent hands upon it, I desire it may be considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a kind of peace there will be in the world, which consists only in violence and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors. Who would not think it an admirable peace betwixt the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without resistance, yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf? <hi>Polyphemus</hi>'s den gives us a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of such a peace, and such a government, wherein <hi>Ulysses</hi> and his companions had nothing to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to suffer themselves to be devoured. And no doubt <hi>Ulysses,</hi> who was a prudent man, preached up <hi>passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and exhorted them to a quiet submission, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to them of what concernment peace was to mankind; and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should offer to resist <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who had now the power over them.</p>
               <p>The end of government is the good of mankind; and which is <hi>best for mankind,</hi> that the people should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the properties of their people?</p>
               <p>Nor let any one say, that mischief can arise from hence, as often as it shall please a busy head, or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government. It is true, such men may stir whenever they please; but it will be only to their just ruin and perdition: for till the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be grown general, and the ill designs of the rulers become visible or their attempts se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sible to the greater part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people who are more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance, are not apt to stir. The examples of particular injustice, or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man, moves them not. But if they universally have a persuasion, grounded upon manifest evidence, that designs are carrying on against their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the general course and tendency of things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

This I am sure, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, either ruler or subject, by force goes about to invade the rights of either prince or people, and lays the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for <hi>overturning</hi> the constitution, and frame of <hi>any just government,</hi> is highly guilty of the greatest crime, I think, a man is capable of, being to answer for all those mischiefs of blood, rapine and desolation, which the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pieces of governments bring on a country. And he who does it, is justly to be esteemed the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and pest of mankind, and is to be treated accordingly.</p>
               <p>That <hi>subjects</hi> or <hi>foreigners,</hi> attempting by force on the properties of any people, may be <hi>resisted</hi> with force, is agreed on all hands.

Must they see their cities pillaged, and laid in ashes, their wives and children exposed to the tyrant's lust and fury, and themselves and families reduced by their king to ruin, and all the miseries of want and oppression, and yet fit still? Must men alone be debarred the common privilege of opposing force with force, which nature allows so freely to all other creatures for their preservation from injury? I answer: Self-defence is a part of the law of nature; nor can it be denied the community, even against the king himself: bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the king shall shew an hatred, not only to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, but sets himself against the body of the commonwealth, whereof he is the head, and shall, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the whole, or a considerable part of the people, in this case the people have a right to resist and defend themselves from injury: but it must be with this caution, that they only defend themselves, but do not attack their prince: they may repair the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges received, but must not for any provocation exceed the bounds of due reverence and respect. They may repulse the present attempt, but must not revenge past violences: for it is natural for us to defend life and limb, but that an inferior should punish a superior, is against nature.

people become free and superior, the power which they had in the</hi> interregnum, <hi>before they crowned him king, devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them again. But there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this state. After considering it well on all sides, I can find but two. Two cases there are, I say, whereby a king,</hi> ipso facto, <hi>becomes no king, and loses all power and regal authority over his people; which are also taken notice of by</hi> Winzerus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The first is, If he endeavour to overturn the government, that is, if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth, as it is recorded of</hi> Nero, <hi>that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to cut off the senate and people of</hi> Rome, <hi>lay the city waste with fire and sword, and then remove to some other place. And of</hi> Caligula, <hi>that he openly declared, that he would be no longer a head to the people or senate, and that he had it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> his thoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both ranks, and then retire to</hi> Alexandria: <hi>and he wisht that the people had but one neck, that he might dispatch them all at a blow. Such designs at these, when any king har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in his thoughts, and seriously promotes, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives up all care and thought of the common-wealth; and consequently forfeits the power of governing his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as a master does the dominion over his slaves whom he hath abandoned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The other case is, When a king makes himself the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of another, and subjects his kingdom which his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors left him, and the people put free into his hands, to the dominion of another: for however perhaps it may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>et because he has hereby lost the principal part of regal dignity,</hi> viz. <hi>to be next and immediately under God, supreme in his kingdom; and also because he betrayed or forced his people, whose li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he ought to have carefully preserved, into the power and dominion of a foreign nation. By this, as it were, alienation of his kingdom, he himself loses the power he had in it before, without transferring any the least right to those on whom he would have bestowed it; and so by this act s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts the people free, and leaves them at their own disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In these cases <hi>Barclay,</hi> the great champion of absolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> monarchy, is forced to allow, that a king may be <hi>resisted,</hi> and <hi>ceases to be a king.</hi> That is, in shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, not to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply cases, in whatsoever he has <hi>no authority,</hi> there he
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012834_0126_0F8B3FE4415BBF70"/>
is <hi>no king,</hi> and may be <hi>resisted</hi>: for wheresoever the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ceases, the king ceases too,</hi> and becomes like other men who have no authority. And these two cases he instances in, differ little from those above mentioned, to be destructive to governments, only that he has omitted the principle from which his doctrine flows; and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment agreed on, and in not intending the end of government itself, which is the public good and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of property. When a king has dethroned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and put himself in a state of war with his people, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no king, as they would any other man, who has put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a state of war with them; <hi>Barclay,</hi> and those of his opinion, would do well to tell us. This farther I desire may be taken notice of out of <hi>Barclay,</hi> that he says, <hi>The mischief that is designed them, the people may prevent before it be done</hi>: whereby he allows <hi>resistance</hi> when tyranny is but in design. <hi>Such designs as these</hi> (says he) <hi>when any king harbours in his thoughts and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and thought of the common-wealth</hi>; so that, according to him, the neglect of the public good is to be taken as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of such <hi>design,</hi> or at least for a sufficient cause of <hi>resistance.</hi> And the reason of all, he gives in these words, <hi>Because he betrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought carefully to have preserved.</hi> What he adds, <hi>into the power and dominion of a foreign nation,</hi> signifies nothing, the fault and forfeiture lying in the loss of their <hi>liberty,</hi> which he <hi>ought to have preserved,</hi> and not in any distinction of the persons to whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion they were subjected. The peoples right is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded, and their liberty lost, whether they are made slaves to any of their own, or a <hi>foreign nation;</hi> and in this lies the injury, and against this only have they the right of defence. And there are instances to be found in all countries, which shew, that it is not the change of nations in the persons of their governors, but the change of government, that gives the offence. <hi>Bilson,</hi> a bishop of our church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes, does, if I mistake not, in his treatise of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012834_0127_0F8B3FE4EDAD38D8"/>

But I thought <hi>Hooker</hi> alone might be enough to satisfy those men, who relying on him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a strange fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whether they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in made the tools of cunninger workmen, to pull down their own fabrick, they were best look. This I am sure, their civil policy is so new, so dangerous, and so destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to both rulers and people, that as former ages never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped, those to come, redeemed from the impositions of these <hi>Egyptian</hi> under-task masters, will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers, who, whilst it seemed to serve their turn, resolved all government into absolute tyranny, and would have all men born to, what their mean souls fitted them for, slavery.</p>
               <p>Here it is like, the common question will be made, <hi>Who shall be judge,</hi> whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust? This, perhaps, ill-affected and factious men may spread among the people, when the prince only makes use of his due prerogative. To this I reply, <hi>The people shall be judge</hi>; for who shall be <hi>judge</hi> whether his trustee or deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him, but he who deputes him, and must, by having deputed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have still a power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card him, when he fails in his trust? If this be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in particular cases of private men, why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment, where the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of millions is concerned, and also where the evil, if not prevented, is greater, and the redress very difficult, dear, and dangerous?</p>
               <p>But farther, this question, <hi>(Who shall be judge?)</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean, that there is no judge at all: for where there is no judicature on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, <hi>God</hi> in heaven is <hi>judge.</hi> He alone, it is true, is judge of the right. But <hi>every man</hi> is <hi>judge</hi> for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To conclude, The <hi>power that every individual gave the society,</hi> when he entered into it, can never revert to the individuals again, as long as the society lasts, but will always remain in the community; because without this there can be no community; no commonwealth, which is contrary to the original agreement: so also when the society hath placed the legislative in any assembly of men, to continue in them and their successors, with direction and authority for providing such successors, <hi>the legislative can never revert to the people</hi> whilst that government lasts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause having provided a legislative with power to continue forever, they have given up their political power to the legislative, and cannot resume it. But if they have set li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the duration of their legislative, and made this supreme power in any person, or assembly, only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary; or else, when by the miscarriages of those in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it is forfeited; upon the forfeiture, or at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the time set, <hi>it reverts to the society,</hi> and the people have a right to act as supreme, and continue the legislative in themselves; or erect a new form, or under the old form place it in new hands, as they think good.</p>
