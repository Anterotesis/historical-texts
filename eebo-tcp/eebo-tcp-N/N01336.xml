            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He that hath put on the New man, ought to put on the ſingular member,

In this Verſe in which our Text is, the Apoſtle doth ſhew the Uſe, and requires the Practice of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> Bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering: For what ſignifies it to have Vertues, and to neglect to Exerciſe them?

Two requiſite Actions: The One is, <hi>Forbearing one another;</hi> this is the <hi>firſt</hi> act of the fore mentioned Vertues: Now he is ſaid to forbear another, who being hurt by another, either in words or deeds, doth not forthwith ſeek to revenge himſelf, or right himſelf; but endeavours in a ſpirit of lenity, love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to reduce the Offender to a right temper and diſpoſition of Soul; and this is the moſt Chriſtian and Noble way of overcoming Injuries; for in this way the true Chriſtian overcomes and conquers himſelf.

Yea, in this way the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth not only overcome, but he overcomes in the moſt legitimate way: He takes the method that God hath directed him to. Prov. 24.29. <hi>Say not, I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</hi> Rom. 12.17. <hi>Recompence to no man evil for evil.</hi> v. 21. <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi>

                     <hi>[And forgiving one another]</hi> In this Action there is more contained than in the former: For there are ſome who ſometimes tolerate Injuries, becauſe they can't revenge them, or becauſe they judge it not expedient: Yet Malice boils in their hearts, and a diſpoſition of revenge: Now this the Apoſtle would have true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans guard againſt, according to Chriſt's Precept.

Iſa. 43.25 <hi>I even I am He, that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not Remember thy Sins.</hi> Miſery, which is the Effect of Sin, is the Object of Mercy; but it is not the Deſert of it; eſpecially when that very miſery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we are brought by Sin, is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001587_0010_0FB3DCCA17765900"/>a miſery wilfully contracted by our ſelves; and not only ſo, but is ſtill a Sinning-Miſery; a Miſery accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſtupidity, and ſenſeleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Averſion from, and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt GOD, and that very <hi>Mercy,</hi> that ſhould deliver us. GOD commends the freeneſs and fulneſs of his Goodneſs to us, by taking the <hi>Seaſon</hi> to be Merciful, when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is moſt Miſerable, not becauſe our Miſery deſerves His Pity. Ezek. 16.6. <hi>I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live: Yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live.</hi> This forgiveneſs is thus brought about: Man, that was infinitely bound to love and obey the Author of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moſt ungratefully and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily Sinned againſt Him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſervedly incurred the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Curſe of the moſt Juſt and True GOD, and forfeited his own Being: Yet, tho' Man had deſtroyed himſelf, this Compaſſionate GOD, of his own free Sovereign Will, and without any
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001587_0011_0FB3DCCB9D7006A8"/>Motive, and by his own Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, contrived a Way, whereby his moſt exact Truth &amp; Juſtice might be ſatisfyed, and yet his Creature ſaved, and his Mercy and Goodneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might be evidenced unto Men and Angels: By an Everlaſting Covenant between the FATHER and the SON, the SON He muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our Nature, and offer up One Great Sacrifice for Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. This was that Myſtery hid from Ages and Generations; the Myſtery that the glorious Angels deſire to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. The great Myſtery of Godlineſs, is <hi>GOD manifeſted in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 3.16. And this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice thus freely given to our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended LORD, we have Redemption, and the Remiſſion of our Sins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14.

Jer. 31.34. <hi>I will forgive their Iniquity, and will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Sin no more.</hi> And this one Sacrifice of CHRIST, offered up once for all, is a full ſatisfaction for all the Sins of his Elect, to the end of the World, accepted by Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> conſenting to be Sent, (and certain Means appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) actually to apply it, and to make it effectual to us; And God gives us Faith to lay hold upon it. So that the true Original of forgiveneſs is the free love of <hi>God,</hi> which gave <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Sacrifice for Sin, and accepted that Sacrifice as the true price of our Pardon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. The Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe of forgiveneſs is that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby Pardon is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated for as many as lay hold upon Him by Faith. The acts which that Eternal Counſel appointed to be the Means of the actual receiving of the Pardon thus offered are Prayer and Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. Faith in Chriſt is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001587_0013_0FB3DCCE98E5FA48"/>appointed to be the Inſtrument of an Actual or Effectual Application of forgiveneſs; and this faith is the gift of <hi>God, Joh</hi> 6.44. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. Prayer for Pardon, by faith in the blood of Chriſt is a Means by Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtain Pardon actually to be applyed to the Soul.

1. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The Conſideration of this ſhould have the force of an Argument to perſwade true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to forgive others. If CHRIST hath forgiven them, then they ſhould forgive thoſe that have offended them; becauſe the Members muſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to their Head: for it is very inconſiſtent to have a Proud and Wrathful Member under a humble Head crowned with Thornes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Hence the Example of Chriſt is urged by Chriſt and his Apoſtles chiefly in thoſe things which belong to Charity and Humility. <hi>If I have waſhed your feet, you ought to waſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers feet, for I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> Joh. 13.14, 15, 16, 17.1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> V. 22, 23. <hi>Who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again: when he ſuffered, be threatened not; but committed Himſelf to Him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001587_0016_0FB3DCD318343E48"/>Chriſt walked.</hi> Chriſt having ſhewn moſt tender Reſpect to us, tho' we have been moſt faulty, 'twere a baſe and unworthy ingratitude as well as Diſſimilitude to Him if we ſhould not ſhew a very tender Reſpect to His Members, tho' faulty.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The Conſideration of this ſhould have the force of a Rule to Direct true Chriſtians to forgive others. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Example hath the force of a Rule in directing the true Chriſtian in his Spiritual Life, as it contains a perfect Idea of Virtue. Hence ſaid <hi>Bernard,</hi> What have you to do with Virtues, who are Ignorant of the Vertues of CHRIST? Where I pray you is true Prudence, unleſs in the Doctrine of CHRIST? Where is true Temperance, unleſs in the Life of CHRIST? Where is true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, unleſs in the Paſſion of CHRIST? But let us ſhew this in acts of forbearing and forgiving: In Chriſt's acts we have a moſt perfect rule of Imitation, whether we behold
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001587_0017_0FB3DCD49711F5C8"/>what <hi>Chriſt</hi> did bear and forgive, or from whom, or laſtly in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Chriſt</hi> did forbear and forgive.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In Chriſt's Example of forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and forgiveneſs we have a moſt perfect rule of Imitation, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>What</hi> CHRIST did bear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. CHRIST was treated with moſt bitter and heavy Revilings; He was called a Glutton, and Wine-bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a friend of Publicans &amp; Sinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.18. They called him a Devil a Mad-man, a Blaſphemer, an Impoſtor, and what not? Nay, they did not only treat him with ill Words, but with ill Deeds; they did ſpit upon him, they crowned him with thornes, they beat him with many ſtripes cruelly, they crucifyed him: Yet theſe ſo many and ſo great Injuries he bore Patiently and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave them. Luk. 23.34. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. In Chriſt's Example of forbearance &amp; forgiveneſs, we have a moſt perfect
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001587_0018_0FB3DCD6190EFA60"/>rule of Imitation, if we conſider the Perſons from whom he received thoſe Injuries, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Rulers of the People, from the People themſelves, from thoſe that were Ignorant, from thoſe that were Malicious, from Strangers, from his Acquaintance, from Jews, from Gentiles; In a word, CHRIST received Injuries from all ſorts of men, yet he bore them all Patiently, and forgave them all, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. bearing no private Spleen againſt any.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In Chriſt's Example of forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and forgiveneſs, we have a moſt perfect rule of Imitation, if we conſider the Manner of his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and forgiveneſs. CHRIST did not do it thro' Infirmity, becauſe he was not able to Reſiſt; but he did it thro' humble and voluntary Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe he was willing to ſuffer. Iſa. 53.7. <hi>He was Oppreſſed, and he was Afflicted, yet be opened not his Mouth: he was brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, &amp; as a Sheep before her ſhearers
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001587_0019_0FB3DCD79979BE68"/>is dumb, ſo be opened not his Mouth,</hi> Mat. 26.53. CHRIST did not do it with a Deceitful and Diſſembling mind, Meditating and deſiring future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; but Chriſt did it with a pure heart, and an Inflamed Charity, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Earneſtly to his Father freely to forgive them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34 Such hath been Chriſts moſt perfect forbearance and forgiveneſs of Injuries! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As Chriſt hath forgiven you, ſo do ye;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to write after this Copy, and tho' we cannot arrive at the Perfection of it, yet we ſhould En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after an Imitation of it, as far as we can.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. A neceſſary or infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is when there is a neceſſary connection between the forgiveneſs of Sin, and that which doth argue it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> ſo that the one cannot be without the other. And of theſe infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences there are two ſorts.</p>
                        <p>(1.) That which is inherent in the Pardoned Sinner, and that is, a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualification wrought in the heart,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001587_0028_0FB3DCE517FF0548"/>which brings forth fruit in the Life: which the Apoſtle calls <hi>ſomething ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying Salvation;</hi> ſuch is <hi>Love, Heb.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
                        <p>(2.) That which is Adherent, and conſequent, and that is a Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Thus Chriſt Teſtifies &amp; ſaith, <hi>Her Sins which are many are forgiven;</hi> ſo Mat 9.3. <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee:</hi> Both theſe are infallible Evidences, and the Witneſs of the SPIRIT is never without the Evidence of ſome ſaving work in the heart, but always follows it in order of Nature.</p>
                        <p>Qu. 2. <hi>The Nature of Sincere Love, what it is?</hi> I ſhall lay it down in theſe five Particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Object of this Sincere love which infallibly evidences forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> conſidered in the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Perſon, and of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of his Office, and Work. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ſpecial Object of this Evidencing love, He lyes next the Soul in this love; And it is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001587_0029_0FB3DCE699D4D6B8"/>of his Perſon, that draws forth this love of the Soul to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he ſee's <hi>Chriſt</hi> altogether lovely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. — 16. He beholds all created and increated Excellency in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yea, the Excellency of Chriſts Relation, and of his Office where-with he is inveſted, as perſonally united to our Nature, and call'd of <hi>God,</hi> to be the great high Prieſt of our Profeſſion, and that One only Mediator between God and us, this moves the Soul to love <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5, 6. The Soul looks not only on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as able, nor only as willing, but alſo as obliged and ingaged by His Fathers call, and his own voluntary ingagement, to ſave to the utmoſt all that come unto <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Him, Heb.</hi> 7.25. And the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſts work for Sinners, in his double State of Humiliation &amp; Exaltation moves him to love Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Act of this ſincere love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a deliberate free full &amp; earneſt choice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the moſt Excellent and Deſirable One, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Deut.</hi>
                           <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001587_0030_0FB3DCE81ADD7CB8"/>30.15—20. <hi>[Pleaſe to turn to the place.]</hi> The heart is ſet upon getting <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Principle thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. The Soul is willing to ſuffer the loſs of all, to part with all for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3 7, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The inward Principle &amp; Spiritual virtue whence this ſincere love flows, is the New Creature, or a gracious frame: Love is a Grace that in its frame comprehends all Graces; and therefore is a gracious frame ſet on work by <hi>Faith,</hi> created together with it, by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt: For love is the fulfilling of the whole Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. Love to God, and to Man, and to God-Man, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore love fits and prepares the Spirit of a Chriſtian to the whole work of practical Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and therefore contains in it, a body of gracious qualifications, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing &amp; inclining the Soul effectually to be for Chriſt alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The End this ſincere love aims at, and which it is carryed out after,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001587_0031_0FB3DCE998D53D20"/>is Union to, and Communion with CHRIST, and with GOD in Chriſt by the HOLY GHOST, and that it may glorify Chriſt in all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges &amp; duties of the New Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The ſeat &amp; ſubject of this love, it is the whole Soul, yea the whole Man. This holy frame animates the whole man, &amp; carries it out to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt;</hi> not only the <hi>Head</hi> to know him, and the <hi>Heart</hi> to make out after him, and take up its full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, but the <hi>whole man</hi> to be his for ever, Body &amp; Soul. Hence the Spouſe ſo often Expreſſeth her love thus, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine.</hi>

2. Becauſe ſincere love to Chriſt, is one of thoſe better things than common gifts, even thoſe things that accompany Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

Would we then know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Sins are forgiven? Let us Examine whether we love our Lord Chriſt in Sincerity? Many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ſuch Evidences as are not infallible, but may deceive them: ſo there is a falſe and hypocritical love that will not Evidence Pardon, but deceive thoſe that conclude their Pardon from it; and no evidence will ſecure us that we are forgiven, without ſincere love to Chriſt. Let us therefore Examine, whether our love to Chriſt be ſincere?</p>
                        <p>Now ſincere love to Chriſt ſprings from the Souls thro'-conviction of its own utterly loſt condition, by reaſon of its own Sin, and Gods Wrath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Curſe, and alſo from a

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, No, in no wiſe; the one ought to be done, the other ought not to be left undone, both are incumbent Duty, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord of Life &amp; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in whoſe Commands there is no contradiction: As for our forgiving others, it has been already proved to be a Duty: And as for Church dealing with a Brother that has juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended us; it will appear to be a Duty, if we conſider, That Church dealing is a duty of Brotherly Love and Charity; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>If
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001587_0041_0FB3DCF89BC204A0"/>thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone,</hi> Mat. 18.15. The neglect of this Church Dealing involves us in the guilt of other mens ſins, and of their periſhing in them. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.7, 11. Here take a few Rules.</p>
                        <p>Rule 1. <hi>Church Dealing is not only a Duty of Obedience unto God, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto Chriſt, but of Righteouſneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man.</hi> Hence it is ſet down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Duties which we Owe to man. Lev. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> And thus it is Commanded in the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Rule 2. <hi>Though it be a Duty of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs towards man, yet it is limited unto men ſtanding under Church Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one unto another.</hi> Becauſe it is a Church Duty, &amp; we owe it to all in Church Relation, both hypocritical and ſincere; yea, we owe it to them as Church-Members; for it is a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001587_0042_0FB3DCFA180E8220"/>Church Ordinance to be managed in a Church way.</p>
                        <p>Rule 3. <hi>Hence it is a Duty of Church Love and Charity.</hi> It is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med towards all with Church Love and Charity; that is, that Charity which ariſeth from, and is grounded upon Church Relation. 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Love the Brotherbood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Rule 4. <hi>There is a peculiar exerciſe of this Church Love and Charity, between thoſe that are truly gracious, and in that Relation each unto other, ariſing from their Inviſible-Church-Relation to Chriſt, &amp; one to another.</hi> This Church Love and Charity ought to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; there are ſtanding Rules of this Church Love and Charity, whereby it is to be regulated; and by thoſe Rules we are to judge of Repentance or Impenitency; thoſe Rules muſt be Conſcienciouſly obſerved, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right improvement of this Judgment of Church Charity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the right Rules of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much of the regular and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001587_0043_0FB3DCFB980287B8"/>improvement of Church Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: We muſt ſhun both Extreams, either being too remiſs, or too ſtrict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Rule 5. <hi>We are to proceed unto and throughout the whole courſe of Church Dealing, by this Church Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the ſincere, fervent, and religious improvement of it from firſt to laſt.</hi> That is, we ought to exerciſe it with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſincerity, both towards God, &amp; one toward another, for God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and one anothers Good and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and with utmoſt fervency, that is, of Holy Zeal of God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and man's Salvation, and that with a religious reſpect of Duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and one towards another. Indeed, the life and ſpirit of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it is from the Exerciſe of this Spiritual Gracious Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe this Spiritual Love and Charity is that ſpiritual and gracious Principle, whereby the Duty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. There is indeed need of the Exerciſe of Faith, Humility, Self
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001587_0044_0FB3DCFD1DE45800"/>denial, Zeal, Meekneſs &amp; Patience, and all Grace, unto the right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Duty; but Love and Charity is the moſt proper Principle, which ſets and keeps all other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on work; &amp; therefore we ſhould not intermeddle in Church Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without true Chriſtian Love and Charity. It is true, that it is our duty to intermeddle with Church Dealing, and we cannot without great ſin omit it; but it is as true, that we ſhall greatly profane Holy Diſcipline, if we want this Love &amp; Charity. Oh then! let us take heed that we do not intermeddle with Church-Dealing, with a contrary Spirit unto Chriſtian Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that is, with a ſpirit of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Envy, Malice, Anger, Wrath, Bitterneſs, or with a ſpirit of carnal Self-love.</p>
                        <p>Rule 6. and laſt. <hi>This true Chriſtian Love and Charity, will move and diſpoſe thoſe in whom it is, to Deſire to forgive Others, as Chriſt hath forgiven them.</hi> It
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001587_0045_0FB3DCFE97F09210"/>will teach them to recompence to no man Evil for Evil, nor to be overcome of evil, but to endeavour to overcome evil with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17, 21. It will reach them, to love their Enemies, to do good to them that hate them, to bleſs them that curſe them, and to Pray for them that deſpitefully uſe them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.27, 28. And therefore it will move them to uſe all ſuitable &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means [Church dealing is one agreeable Means and Method to be uſed] to recover their Souls from the Errour of their way; and thereby to Evidence their ſincere love to the glory of God, and the Spiritual and Eternal good of the Soul of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Brother. Now it will Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be our duty to forgive thoſe that have injured us, as Chriſt hath forgiven us If we conſider,</p>

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001587_0085_0FB3DD3A9C21C458"/>we have ſhewn, that the moſt Odious and Loathſome Corruptions &amp; Cauſes have their foul iſſue &amp; effect in Strife; They ſpawn forth ſtrife, they have their vile Activity in ſtrife, they ſmite on the Anvil of ſtrife, the Coals of Sinful ſtrife of Brethren are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually blown up by the loathſome Breath of moſt Noiſome and Noxious Luſts; And Belial Luſts are very Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, and have a glorious time of it when they have produced ſtrife among Brethren.

                     <p>So much for the Firſt Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That which has a moſt Sinful Nature and moſt Heinous Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is very Contagious, and cauſes Men to commit a Multitude of vile Tranſgreſſions, is an Odious &amp; Horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001587_0086_0FB3DD3C1D718960"/>Evil, earneſtly &amp; zealouſly to be Striven againſt by the Saints of God: But Sinful Strife of Brethren has a moſt Sinful Nature and moſt Heinous Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations; It is very Contagious, and cauſes men to commit a Multitude of vile Tranſgreſſions: It is therefore an Odious and Horrendous Evil. The ſweetneſs &amp; excellency of the Divine Law of Peaceableneſs ſhews the Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Nature of the Unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Luſt of ſtrife. Strife is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; vile, if the Will of GOD be very Good &amp; Holy; For 'tis the Will of GOD that we meddle not with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. That the Servants of the LORD ſtrive not; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. That Chriſtians walk not in ſtrife; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. <hi>But that they live Peaceably with all Men,</hi> Rom. 12.18.

Yea that, <hi>as much as in them lieth they live
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001587_0087_0FB3DD3D96789FE0"/>Peaceably.</hi> We ſee then that the Vice of Strife and the Will of GOD are contrary. Now to Contradict the Perfect &amp; Acceptable Will of GOD is Odious Again, That's Odious that is moſt Different from, and Unlike to the moſt Lovely Nature of GOD; Now Strife is moſt Unlike to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD; and moſt Different from the moſt Pacifick Perfections of GOD, moſt Different from the Love, Sweetneſs &amp; Goodneſs of GOD, from His Radiant Philanthropy, Benignity, Fidelity, Equity, Compaſſion, Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, Clemency, Patience, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, Long-ſuffering, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Qualities that demonſtrate Him to be the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> and not of a Contentious Nature. Again, That's Odious that's contrary to a Man's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying GOD, as GOD; now 'tis contrary to a Mans Glorifying GOD, as GOD, by Sinful Strife to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly Quarrelling with, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, Grieving, Vexing &amp; Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Children of GOD, who bear
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001587_0088_0FB3DD3F16784608"/>the Image of their Heavenly Father. Again, that's Odious to a Saint that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates him from the Lord; Now ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Strife doth ſo; For as when a Man carries it Litigiouſly &amp; Abuſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Neighbours Child, he ſcarce knows how to look his Father in the Face; ſo a Chriſtian by reaſon of his Rebellious, Abuſive, Injurious, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Guilty Strife doth grow Shy &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, and is Staggered in his Hope and Boldneſs, and has not his wonted Freedom in the Preſence of GOD. Again, that's an Odious Evil, and may well ſtrike the Saints with ſome degree of horrour, in which they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Rebels againſt the Light, and Covenant-Breakers with God &amp; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and acted by the Devil &amp; Vileſt Luſts, and Practically juſtifying of the Ungodly in their Sins againſt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and hardning them therein; Now in their Sinful Strife with the Brethren they find themſelves Rebels againſt Light, Covenant-breakers, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden, Devil-driven, and on the ſide
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001587_0089_0FB3DD4096F70B28"/>of thoſe that Hate the LORD, with bliſtered &amp; bleeding Conſciences, a Tattered &amp; Sullied Livery, and a Blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Character; Aggravations, (One would think) ſufficient to ſtartle them, and to Terrify them from Medling any more with Strife againſt the Brethren. Verily the Nearer and more Frequent Communion a man has with GOD, the leſs he has to do with this Iniquity, and the more he doth and will abhor and eſchue it. Again, If an evil be Contagious, Spreading, and Infectious, it is the more Odious &amp; Horrid: Now the Plague of Sinful Strife is Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; Infectious: It ſpreads quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and over-ſpreads whole Streets, Towns, Churches, Realms: It fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like Leaven, Diffuſes it ſelf like Volatile Spirits, Runs like the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and carries all before it like the Devouring Fire. A few Strangers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iſraelites fall a luſting, and ſtrait way all the Congregation of Iſrael luſt alſo, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4. And <hi>Corah</hi> ſtrives with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and preſently

One Righteous Man (in his Error) blows the Trumpet of Strife againſt another Righteous Man, and bids him Defiance; and perhaps at firſt a Duel only of Words is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; yet preſently great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes take the Alarm, and are Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Strong Parties, into the Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Errour, Engaging in Fierce Battle; and among them, Many that are not Saints but carnal; and tho' the Saints are Recovered of their Wounds, by Soveraign Grace; yet Others dye and periſh for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.21. filling up the Meaſure of their Sins, by their Oppoſition to the Righteous, in which they manifeſt their Spite &amp; Hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and againſt CHRIST in them. Now the irrecoverable Periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Carnal Perſons thro' the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Example of Good Mens Strife, it renders the Sinful <hi>Strife</hi> of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001587_0091_0FB3DD4398C969C8"/>Good Men very Odious in the eyes of ſuch as deſire Mens Salvation, and abhor to have a Sinful hand in their Eternal Ruine. Again, That's an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious &amp; Formidable Evil to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD, that Seduceth them to Commit, and Involves them in the Guilt &amp; Filth of a Multitude of Great Tranſgreſſions; Now Sinful Strife doth thus ſeduce &amp; involve them: Strife opens the Catarracts &amp; Sluces of Sin to make an Univerſal Deluge: Prov. 17.14. <hi>Where</hi> this <hi>Strife is, there is Confuſion and every evil Work: James</hi> 3.16. Therefore <hi>he Loveth Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Loveth Strife,</hi> Prov. 17.19. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Omiſſions &amp; Neglects of Known Duty, Odious Obſtructions of that which is Good, and Oppoſitions to it, and Odious Perpetrations of Evil are from Sinful Strife. To Exerciſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards GOD, and to Worſhip GOD inwardly and externally are Great Duties, Sweet &amp; Precious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; But this Odious Strife is a Foe, and a Bar to the Well-doing of 'em.

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001587_0093_0FB3DD4697642CA8"/>with GOD; It ſo creeples the Soul, that it can't raiſe it ſelf up Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as it was wont before, and it cauſes that the Saint ſhall have but Little Time and leſs Heart for Acts of Religion, <hi>(that require the whole Heart, and ſufficient Time,)</hi> and too little Life, Power, and Vigour therein. The Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Strife muſt be Suppreſſed or the Religion of Prayer will be Hindred, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4, 7, 9.</p>
                     <p>Many of the Dear Children of God can give evidence to this heavy charge againſt Strife from their own dear experience. Thus Devotion &amp; Religion may ſay to wicked Strife; <hi>Hoſt thou found me O mine Enemy!</hi> and verily Juſtice and Charity may each of them ſay ſo alſo; for this Strife is an odious Foe to them both. This Strife will not allow a man to be his Brothers Keeper; nor permit him to think worthily of his Brother, or ſpeak peaceably to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully of him, much leſs to act profitably for him; but as to the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001587_0094_0FB3DD4817F9E4C8"/>
                        <hi>Admoniſhing</hi> of him for his good, with pity, kindneſs, meekneſs, ſweetneſs and wiſdom, this curſed Strife moſt powerfully prevents &amp; obſtructs that. And as for the Exerciſe of the Duty of Brotherly Forgiveneſs, Strife is like the made Horſe in the Chariot that pulls backward, and the ſinful Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt be forc'd to ſay the Fifth Petition of the Lord's Prayer back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or elſe he will Curſe himſelf; for if God ſhould no otherwiſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him then he Forgives his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Brother, he were undone. Yea, this Odious Strife will neither do good it ſelf, (and never did good for good's ſake) nor will let others do it; hence when one Party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and engages in any Enterprize tending to much Publick Good, the Evil Spirit of Strife ſtirs up the other Party to manifeſt an Antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and from Emulation, and through Jealouſies and Miſpriſions, and by Miſrepreſentations and other ill Practices to be putting of inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
