            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DIRECTIONS FOR RECOVERING PERSONS, WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE Dead, from Drowning, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OF the many calamities to which mankind are ſubject, there are none more produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of diſtreſs, than ſudden and violent deaths.</p>
            <p>IN great cities, inſtances of this kind (from drowning, ſuffocation and other accidents) are very numerous; and this melancholy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is much aggravated by reflecting, that a large proportion of thoſe who are thus loſt to their friends and country, might be ſaved if they were properly treated.</p>
            <p>THAT this is the caſe, appears clearly from the reports of ſeveral reſpectable ſocieties in Europe, which were formed for the purpoſe, and have happily ſucceeded in the humane attempt, of reſtoring to life, perſons apparently killed by the accidents above mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:021159_0003_0FB24D85A8AB6468"/>
IT is now only twenty years ſince the firſt ſociety of this kind was formed at Amſterdam, and but thirteen ſince the firſt exiſtence of that in London, and yet near one thouſand perſons have been preſerved from death by theſe two inſtitutions. Societies of the ſame kind have been formed at Paris, Venice, Hamburgh and Milan; and from their reports, it alſo appears, not only that a large proportion of perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently dead, have been recovered, but that this recovery may be effected, after they have been a long time in that ſituation.</p>
            <p>AS the inhabitants of this part of America are expoſed, not only to all thoſe accidents which occur in England and Holland, but to ſeveral others which rarely take place there (as thoſe produced by exceſſive heat and cold, and by light ning) they muſt have additional inducements to form an inſtitution of this kind: And altho' its objects are of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, the following plan for attaining them, will ſhew, that the buſineſs of ſuch an inſtitution is very practicable and eaſy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi>—AS people in general are uninformed of the proper methods to be purſued in ſuch caſes, and as medical aſſiſtance cannot always be procured in time, it will be neceſſary to lodge directions reſpecting the proper treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all thoſe places where ſuch accidents commonly occur.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021159_0004_0FB24D8737D43C80"/>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>—IT will be neceſſary to depoſit at thoſe places, ſuch apparatus and medicines as have been found moſt uſeful in theſe caſes; as the time loſt in waiting for them, if they are not at hand, may deprive the unfortunate perſon of all chance of recovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi>—It will alſo be neceſſary to place at proper diſtances, near rivers, a number of grapples and other inſtruments, for extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeedily from the water, thoſe who fall into it.</p>
            <p>BY theſe means, the Societies above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have had the ſatisfaction of reſtoring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the fatherleſs, and living children to parents who were deploring their loſs;—and have rendered to humanity, the important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of preſerving from death, a large number of uſeful members of the community. Their great ſucceſs influenced a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia, to aſſociate themſelves for the ſame purpoſe, under the name of the "Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society;" who, as they are deſirous of the concurrence of their fellow-citizens, have ſubjoined their conſtitution; and hope that thoſe who approve of it, will unite with them in carrying it into execution.</p>

            <head>The CONSTITUTION of the HUMANE SOCIETY.</head>
            <p>THE HUMANE SOCIETY, inſtituted in the year 1770, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of drowned perſons, having for ſome years paſt not been ſufficiently attended to, it is now agreed to revive it; and further, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in its objects, perſons diſordered by noxious vapours, lightning, drinking cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and from the action of exceſſive heat and cold upon the body; for which purpoſe, the following plan is adopted:—</p>
            <p>THAT every perſon, paying one dollar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, for the uſe of the inſtitution, ſhall be deemed a contributor.</p>
            <p>THAT the contributors ſhall chooſe Twelve Managers, on the ſecond Wedneſday in March, of every year, who ſhall, as ſoon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, chooſe from among themſelves, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, two inſpectors, and a ſecretary. They ſhall likewiſe chooſe a treaſurer from among the contributors. They ſhall hold ſtated meetings on the ſecond Wedneſday of every month. Their buſineſs ſhall be to regulate all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the inſtitution. Five Managers to make a quorum.</p>

            <head>DIRECTIONS, for RECOVERING PERSONS, who are ſuppoſed to be DEAD, from DROWNING.</head>
            <p n="1">I. AS ſoon as the body is taken out of the water, it muſt be conveyed to a houſe, or any other place, where it can be laid dry and warm, avoiding the uſual deſtructive methods <hi>of hanging it by the heels, rolling it on a barrel,</hi> or <hi>placing it acroſs a log on its belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE clothes muſt be immediately ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, and the body wrapped up in blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, well warmed. It ſhould be laid on its back, with the head a little raiſed. If the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be cold, it ſhould be placed near a fire; but if the weather ſhould be warm, it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to place it between two blankets well heated; taking care to prevent the room from being crouded, with any perſons who are not neceſſarily employed about the body.</p>
            <p n="3">III. AS ſoon as it can poſſibly be done, a bellows ſhould be applied to one noſtril, while the other noſtril and the mouth are kept cloſed, and the lower end of the prominent part of the wind-pipe (or that part which is called by the anatomiſts, <hi>Pomum Adami</hi>) is preſſed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The bellows is to be worked in this ſituation; and when the breaſt is ſwelled by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021159_0007_0FB24D8BA780FDC8"/>it, the bellows ſhould ſtop, and an aſſiſtant ſhould preſs the belly upwards, to force the air out. The bellows ſhould then be applied as before, and the belly ſhould again be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and this proceſs ſhould be repeated from twenty to thirty times in a minute, ſo as to imitate natural breathing as nearly as poſſible. Some volatile ſpirits, heated, ſhould be held under the valve of the bellows, while it works. If a bellows cannot be procured, ſome perſon ſhould blow into one of the noſtrils, through a pipe or quill, while the other noſtril and mouth are cloſed as before; or if a pipe or quill be not at hand, he ſhould blow into the mouth, while both noſtrils are cloſed; but whenever a bellows can be procured, it ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as air forced in by this means, will be much more ſerviceable than air which has already been breathed.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. AT the ſame time, the whole body ſhould be rubbed with the hand, or with hot woolen cloths. The rubbing ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearte, but continued with induſtry a long time, and particularly about the breaſt.</p>
            <p n="5">V. DURING this time, a large quantity of aſhes, or ſalt, or ſand, ſhould be heated; and as ſoon as it is milk-warm, the body ſhould be placed in it; the blowing and rubbing are then to be continued as before; and when the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021159_0008_0FB24DD38C0EAF68"/>aſhes, or ſalt, are cooled, ſome warmer muſt be added, ſo that the whole may be kept milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm.</p>
            <p>THESE methods ſhould be continued three or four hours, as in ſeveral inſtances they have proved ſucceſsful, although no ſigns of life appeared until that time. When the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is able to ſwallow, he ſhould take ſome wine, or rum and water; bleeding or purging ought not to be uſed, without conſulting a phyſician, who ſhould be called in as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

            <p n="2">2d, DRINK only a ſmall quantity at once, and let it remain a ſhort time in your mouth before you ſwallow it; or,</p>
            <p n="3">3d, WASH your hands and face, and rinſe your mouth with cold water before you drink. If theſe precautions have been neglected, and the diſorder incident to drinking cold water hath been produced, the firſt, and in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the only remedy to be adminiſtered, is ſixty drops of liquid laudanum in ſpirit and water, or warm drink of any kind.</p>

            <p>WHEN laudanum cannot be obtained, rum and water, or warm water ſhould be given. Vomits and bleeding ſhould not be uſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting a phyſician.</p>

            <p>BY procuring a free circulation of air, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ventilators, or opening the doors or windows, where it is confined, or by changing the air, by keeping fires in the infected place, or by throwing in water, in which ſtone-lime has been diſſolved.</p>
            <p>THESE precautions ſhould be taken, before entering into ſuch ſuſpected places, or a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed candle ſhould be firſt introduced, which will go out, if the air is bad. When a perſon is let down into a well, he ſhould be carefully watched, and drawn up again on the leaſt change. But when a perſon is apparently dead, from the above-mentioned cauſe, the firſt thing to be done is to remove the body to a cool place in a wholeſome air; then let the body be ſtripped, and let cold water be thrown from buckets over it for ſome time. This
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021159_0010_0FB24DD6C2064F80"/>is particularly uſeful in caſes of apparent death from drukenneſs.—Let the treatment now be the ſame as that for drowned perſons.

            <p>THE general treatment recommended for curing the diſorders brought on by noxious vapours, is to be applied; but the dangerous effects of this may be prevented, by taking care not to ſit near it when burning; to burn it in a chimney; and where there is no chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to keep the door open, and to place a large tub of water in the room.</p>
            <p>IN all theſe, as well as in caſes of drowned perſons, moderate purges and bleeding are only to be uſed, with the advice of a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</p>

            <p>DISORDERS from this cauſe, or (as they are vulgarly termed) <hi>ſtrokes of the ſun,</hi> may be expected, when a perſon who is expoſed to his rays, is affected with a violent head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, attended with throbbing or with gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs; where the diſorder takes place, theſe ſymptoms are followed by faintineſs and great inſenſibility, with violent heat and drineſs of the ſkin, redneſs and drineſs of the eyes, difficulty of breathing, and, according as the diſeaſe is more or leſs violent, with a difficulty, or entire inability of ſpeaking or moving.</p>
            <p>TO guard againſt theſe dangerous effects of heat, it will be proper,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:021159_0012_0FB24DFE5B3FEFD8"/>
1ſt, TO avoid labour, or violent exerciſe, or expoſing yourſelf to the rays of the ſun, immediately after eating a hearty meal:</p>
            <p n="2">2d, TO avoid drinking ſpirits of any kind, when you are thus expoſed. Theſe add an internal fire to the heat of the ſun, and are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly hurtful in harveſt. Vinegar and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſweetened with molaſſes or brown ſugar, butter-milk and water, ſmall beer, whey, or milk and water, are the moſt proper drinks for people who are expoſed to exceſſive heat. But the leſs a perſon drinks of liquors of any kind <hi>in the forenoon,</hi> the better will he endure the heat of a warm day. It will alſo be proper,</p>
            <p n="3">3d, TO wear a white hat, or to cover a black one with white paper, when you are neceſſarily expoſed to the hot ſun, and to avoid ſtanding ſtill when in ſuch a ſituation.</p>
            <p n="4">4th, TO retire into the ſhade as ſoon as you begin to be affected with pain or throbbing in the head, with giddineſs or with faintineſs.</p>
            <p>If theſe precautions have been neglected, and the ſymptoms above deſcribed have come on, it will be proper,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, TO remove the perſon ſo affected into a cool, dry place, and to looſen all his garments, particularly thoſe around his neck and breaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:021159_0013_0FB24DFF4F8F8540"/>
2d, TO examine whether the pulſe at the wriſts or temples beats forcibly, and if it does, to bleed immediately; but if the pulſe be weak, or cannot be perceived, bleeding muſt not be performed.</p>
            <p n="3">3d, TO place his feet and legs (or if it can be done) the lower half of his body, in warm water. But if this remedy fails,</p>
            <p n="4">4th, DR. Tiſſot adviſes to apply linen cloths wet with cold water, or with cold water and vinegar, to the temples and all over the head.</p>
            <p n="5">5th, TO adminiſter plentiful draughts of vinegar and water ſweetened.</p>
            <p>IN all caſes of this kind, a phyſician ſhould be ſent for, unleſs the patient recovers ſpeedily.</p>

               <hi>To prevent the</hi> Effects <hi>of</hi> exceſſive Cold.</head>
            <p>Perſons are in danger of being deſtroyed by it, when they become very drowſy, or are affected with general numbneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of the body. As the cold which proves fatal, generally affects the feet firſt, great care ſhould be taken to keep them as warm as poſſible.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:021159_0014_0FB24E025E6BA8A0"/>
1ſt, BY protecting them when you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cold with wool, or woollen ſocks within the ſhoes or boots, or with large wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtockings drawn over them, or when you ride, with hay or ſtraw wrapped round them.</p>
            <p n="2">2d, BY keeping up a briſk circulation in the blood veſſels of the feet, by <hi>moving them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly;</hi> or when this is impracticable, from a confined ſituation, and two or more perſons are expoſed together,</p>
            <p n="3">3d, BY placing their feet, <hi>without ſhoes,</hi> againſt each other's breaſts.</p>
            <p>IF notwithſtanding theſe precautions, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be rendered ſleepy or inſenſible by cold, he muſt exert himſelf and move about quickly, for if he ſhould ſleep in the cold, he will inevitably periſh. When a perſon who is travelling in company, begins to be affected in this manner, his companions ſhould force him to walk briſkly or to run.</p>
            <p>WHEN cold has produced apparent death, the body ſhould be placed in a room without fire, and rubbed ſteadily with ſnow, or cloths wet with cold water, at the ſame time that the bellows is applied to the noſe, and uſed as in the caſe of drowning. This treatment ſhould be continued a long time, although no ſigns of life appear, for ſome perſons have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021159_0015_0FB24E03B11E0D08"/>who were to appearance lifeleſs for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours.</p>
            <p>When the limbs only are affected by cold, they ſhould be rubbed gently with ſnow, or bathed in cold water with ice in it, until their feeling and power of motion returns; after which, the bathing or rubbing with ſnow is to be repeated once every hour, and continued a longer or ſhorter time, as the pains are more or leſs violent.</p>
            <p>THE perſon thus affected ſhould be kept from the fire, for warmth and acrid appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of every kind are very injurious.</p>
