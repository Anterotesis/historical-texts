            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And they all treat them, not as points of more ſpeculation, the contemplation of which has a tendency to encreaſe our knowledge, elevate our conceptions, enlarge our views and exalt our minds, (which is doubtleſs the caſe) but alſo and chiefly as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the utmoſt importance and concern to us all, which when cordially believed and attentively conſidered, have (through divine grace) the moſt happy influence on our temper and conduct. And I have often thought that Chriſtianity would flouriſh much more than it does among us, if the Miniſters of the Goſpel imitated in this,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031758_0004_0FEE2F4439800438"/>their example, and led both ſaints and ſinners to the more frequent and ſerious conſideration of thoſe events which will ſoon take place.</p>

That we may do it for a few moments at this time, I have made choice of this moſt alarming paſſage of Scripture, in which the Apoſtle, with a view to their comfort and ſupport under their ſufferings, puts the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Church of God at Theſſalonica in remembrance of the very different ſtate of things which would ſoon take place, with regard to them and their perſecutors. <hi>God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will recompence tribulation to thoſe who trouble you, and to you who are troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who</hi> (adds he) <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are all very important points, and well deſerve our moſt ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>I ſhall confine myſelf at preſent to the firſt of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The certainty and manner of our Lord's ſecond coming.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>certainty</hi> of his ſecond coming, they who read and credit the Oracles of God, can entertain no doubt at all concerning it. It is there foretold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſo frequently and clearly, and with ſuch a variety of method and expreſſion, that the moſt careleſs reader can hardly avoid obſerving and underſtanding it. If therefore I produce ſome ſcripture-teſtimonies of this truth, it is not ſo much with a view to illuſtrate and confirm it, as to impreſs ſo uſeful a ſubject more deeply upon our minds. For it is too manifeſt, that it may be believed and underſtood, where it has, by no means, its proper influence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I obſerve then, that this event was foretold by the ancient Prophets as well as by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Even <hi>Enoch of old propheſied, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all.</hi> A truth this of which the Pſalmiſt was not ignorant, for in the 50th Pſalm, he teſtifies, "<hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence; a fire ſhall devour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031758_0007_0FEE314F486C5770"/>him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtuous rround about him: he ſhall call the heavens from above and the earth, that he may judge his people.</hi> Theſe predictions, ſo clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that their ſenſe muſt be obvious to all, are confirmed and illuſtrated by the teſtimony of Daniel, chap. vii. ver. 9.10. <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſays he) <hi>till the thrones were caſt down and the Ancient of Days did ſit, whoſe garments was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire; a fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him: thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands miniſtered unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtood before him: the judgment was ſet, and the books were opened!</hi> What a ſublime and inimitably grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which we have here, mix'd with admirable ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity! How far does it exceed, in theſe reſpects, every thing to be met with in merely human compoſitions! How plainly does it appear to have been the effect, not of genius and art, but of a mind through the influences of the divine ſpirit, elevated with the grandeur, awed with the majeſty, and ſtruck with the terror of the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe ancient prophecies of our Lord's ſecond coming have the ſanction of his own authority, not only as being inſpired by him, but as being confirmed by moſt expreſs declarations, delivered by himſelf as well while upon earth as after his aſcenſion into heaven, and that both before friends and enemies. I ſhall produce only two or three of theſe as a ſpecimen of the reſt. Thus when Caiaphas, the Elders and Scribes, had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or preſumptuous wickedneſs rather, to call their Creator and final Judge to take his trial at their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; before theſe he teſtified, <hi>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031758_0008_0FEE2F47533CE570"/>Son of Man ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</hi> To his friends and followers, he often foretold the ſame event, though with a different view, not merely to convince and alarm, but alſo and eſpecially to comfort and encourage them. Thus, when predicting and deſcribing the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the ruin of the Jewiſh church and polity, he ſlides, (as it were) inſenſibly into the important ſubject typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that, declaring, <hi>After the tribulation of thoſe days, the ſun ſhall be darkened and the moon ſhall not give her light, and the ſtars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken; and then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in heaven; then ſhall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</hi> And in the next chapter, (Matt. xxv.) which, it ſeems, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the laſt public diſcourſe that our Lord delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was offered up, he declares to all, <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him; then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſhall be gathered all nations.</hi>
            </p>

To theſe expreſs and particular declarations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by our Lord, while he tabernacled upon earth in his ſtate of humiliation, we may ſubjoin his teſtimony from heaven, after he entered upon his ſtate of exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was inveſted with all power in heaven and on earth. The <hi>faithful and true witneſs,</hi> the <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> when he takes his ſolemn leave of us, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the records of truth, teſtifies, both to friends and foes. <hi>Behold I come quickly, bleſſed is he that keepeth the ſayings of the prophecy of this book.</hi> And again, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

            <p n="5">5. But that a doctrine ſo ſuperior to reaſon and yet abſolutely certain and deeply intereſting, might want to kind of evidence calculated to gain it credit, meſſengers were ſent immediately from heaven to bear witneſs to it. Thus when our Lord had given his apoſtles their laſt commiſſion, and <hi>while they beheld, was taken up from them, a cloud receiving him out of their ſight; while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven as he went up, behold two men ſtood by them in white apparel, who alſo ſaid, "Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ſame Jeſus who is taken up into heaven, ſhall ſo come again in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. This teſtimony of the holy angels, or of the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, is frequently confirmed by that of the Holy Spirit in the mouths of the Apoſtles. But as I would not be tedious, I forbear to quote any particular paſſages, chuſing rather to refer you to their ſermons, as recorded by St. Luke in the Acts, and to their various epiſtles, where you frequently meet with many glorious deſcriptions of this grand event. The teſtimonies already produced are more than ſufficient, not only to eſtabliſh us in the firm belief of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth, but alſo (which is moſt wanting) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it deeply upon our minds. Good reaſon have we to ſettle it in our hearts, that as our Lord is <hi>gone before
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031758_0010_0FEE2F4AC85095F8"/>to prepare a place for us, ſo he will come again to receive us to himſelf, that where he is we may be alſo; and to thoſe who look for him he will appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> Yes,

If, like the evil ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, we ſay in our heart, Our Lord delayeth his coming, and begin to ſmite our fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, our Lord ſhall come in a day when we look not for him, and in an hour that we are not aware of, and will cut us aſunder, and appoint us our portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and unbelievers.

            <p n="1">1. There is hardly any ſubject within the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of religion, concerning which people in general are ſo groſsly miſtaken as the knowledge of God. All men profeſs to know God, tho' alas! the generality, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy tempers and wicked works, contradict that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and prove themſelves to be entire ſtrangers to him.—If a man have but heard or read a little about the Author of his being, if he believe his exiſtence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he forthwith concludes that he knows God, and is very much offended if you preſume to call it in queſtion; tho', at the ſame time, this pretended knowledge has no happy influence upon him, but his ſpirit and behaviour are juſt the ſame, one might ſuppoſe they would be, if he were a mere atheiſt in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though he profeſſes to be perſuaded of the infinite glory and ineffable majeſty of the eternal Jehovah, yet
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031758_0028_0FEE312538E8FC28"/>does he not inwardly reverence and humbly adore him but is light and trifling, ſtupid and inſenſible, perhaps, even in his immediate preſence, and during the ſolemnity of his divine worſhip. Tho' he declares his aſſent to the immaculate holineſs and inflexible juſtice of the Governor and final judge of the world, yet is he not abaſed and confounded under a ſenſe of his ſinfulneſs and guilt, nor does he abhor himſelf as in duſt and aſhes; but he is proud and impenitent, preſuming upon the goodneſs of his heart, if his life has not been altogether blameleſs, and laying his own righteouſneſs as the foundation of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. Tho' (he thinks) he has no doubt at all of the boundleſs mercy and incomprehenſible love of God in Chriſt; yet does he not chearfully truſt him with humble confidence, and joyfully praiſe him with grateful acknowledgements; the pure flame of divine love does not glow upon the altar of his heart, nor does he devote his body and ſoul as a living ſacrifice to God by Jeſus Chriſt. But, on the contrary, he deſponds and repines under dark and afflictive diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, while he ungratefully admits the vain world, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah's rival, to ſhare, yea, <hi>engroſs</hi> his affections, and moſt treacherouſly harbours ſin and ſatan, the Lord's enemies, in the inmoſt receſſes of his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So little is he benefited by the knowledge of God. But, in truth, what he has is not the knowledge of God, for if it were, it would infallibly produce the effects aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to this principle in the word of God. It would beget in him deep humility before God, entire confidence towards him, fervent love to him, and univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; in ſhort, holineſs and happineſs, a pledge and

               </gap>aſing before him from day to day, is a never-failing conſequence of our knowledge of God, and love to him; and <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> then, <hi>ſhall we not be uſhamed</hi> of profeſſing theſe endowments <hi>when we have reſpect to all his commandments, and keep a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. And here I cannot but obſerve upon the whole, how well the ſcriptures guard the knowledge of God (which is only another word for true religion) on all ſides againſt the falſe claims which deluded men put in for it from oppoſite quarters. The ſelf-righteous Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031758_0035_0FEE317D482EE4F8"/>who lays his own works of which he has a miſtaken opinion, as the foundation of his acceptance with God, is cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> off by the two firſt of the particulars I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, for he is neither abaſed before God for his ſins, nor has he an humble confidence in the Divine mercy. The third of theſe remarks, ſhews the emptineſs of the <hi>Formaliſt</hi>'s boaſt, whoſe luke warm heart and trifling ſpirit teſtify againſt him, that he has not the love of God in him. And as for the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> who <hi>makes void the law thro' ſaith, and continues in ſin becauſe grace abounds,</hi> he finds his reproof and condemnation in the laſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. For tho' <hi>he ſays he knows God</hi> (and indeed he has need to <hi>ſay</hi> it, for no one would have inferred it from his life,) yet becauſe <hi>he keepeth not his commandments,</hi> we are ſure <hi>he is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. From this account of the knowledge of God, and its inſeparable effects, it is eaſy to ſee who they are that <hi>know him not,</hi> and of conſequence who they are upon whom Chriſt, at his ſecond coming, will take vengeance. They are thoſe who have no higher and better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, than that which they have attained by the exerciſe of their natural faculties and rational pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the conſideration of his word and works, having never received the <hi>ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Eph. i. 17.) <hi>in the knowledge of him.</hi> They are thoſe who have indeed <hi>heard of God by the hearing of the ear,</hi> but have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ever (as it were) <hi>ſeen him</hi> by faith, or been inwardly enlightened with a diſcovery of his glorious perfections, and therefore do not <hi>abhor themſelves, and repent as in duſt and aſbes:</hi> They are thoſe who do not know <hi>God in Chriſt reconciling them unto himſelf,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031758_0036_0FEE312D6231F3B8"/>not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them;</hi> and therefore not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded that he is <hi>pacified towards them, after all they have done,</hi> they do not truſt in him as a tender Father and a faithful Friend, in covenant with them through Jeſus Chriſt. They are thoſe who do not <hi>behold</hi> with open face (the veil of unbelief being removed) <hi>what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon them,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not conſciouſly <hi>love him, who hath firſt loved them.</hi> They are thoſe, laſtly, who perhaps <hi>profeſs to know God,</hi> but <hi>by works deny him,</hi> not keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or keeping them merely in external things, and that with reluctance, from a principal of ſlaviſh fear, as tho' God were an hard maſter, and obedience to him a taſk enjoined, which it would be our intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be excuſed from performing.—Upon all ſuch will Chriſt, when he is revealed, take vengeance.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the other particular mentioned in our text, concerning the character of thoſe whom our Lord will condemn.</p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>They obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few obſervations on this, will greatly illuſtrate what has already been advanced, and enable us ſtill better to judge concerning our true ſtate and condition. I mean to purſue the ſame method I did under the former head, ſhewing poſitively what is implied in <hi>obeying the goſpel</hi> that we may infer from thence who they are that <hi>diſobey it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It will be eaſily underſtood what is meant by <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel,</hi> if we conſider what the goſpel is. And this may be learnt, in ſome meaſure, even from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word (tranſlated <hi>goſpel</hi> in the New Teſtament) which,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031758_0037_0FEE317EE638E980"/>it is well-known, ſignifies <hi>good news</hi> or <hi>glad tidings.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly what is termed <hi>goſpel</hi> in the 4th of St. Luke, is tranſlated <hi>good tidings</hi> in the 51ſt of Iſaiah; and the preachers of the goſpel are repreſented in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (ver. 7th) as bringing <hi>good tidings,</hi> as <hi>publiſhing peace</hi> as <hi>bringing good tidings of good, as publiſhing ſalvation,</hi> This then is the every eſſence of the goſpel, <hi>good tidings</hi> or <hi>tidings of good,</hi> even of peace and ſalvation, of peace with God, and ſalvation from ſin and miſery. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this a little,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The goſpel brings us tidings of forgiveneſs of ſins and acceptance with God, of free and full juſtification, thro' faith in the Lord Jeſus. It allows indeed, nay teſtifies, that <hi>there is none righteous</hi> (by nature) <hi>no not one, that all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, that the whole world is guilty before God, and that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> And in conſequence of this, it declares, <hi>that by the deeds of the law ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified in his ſight.</hi> But then at the ſame time it aſſures us, that <hi>God hath ſet forth his Son to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation thro' faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs</hi> (both his juſtice and mercy) <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, thro' the forbearance of God.</hi> It affirms, that <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their treſpaſſes unto them;</hi> and that he <hi>hath committed to</hi> his ſervants <hi>the word of reconciliation.</hi> And hence they agree to offer pardoning mercy to all penitent ſinners, and to bear witneſs, that <hi>whoſoever believeth on Chriſt doth receive forgiveneſs of ſins;</hi> yea, <hi>that by him all that believe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031758_0038_0FEE3133EF0696E8"/>are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified</hi> by their own obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it appears what it is to obey the goſpel in this view of it, as it is a manifeſtation of pardoning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y thro' a Mediator. It is, 1ſt. to ſee and feel ourſelves guilty before God, and therefore to renounce all co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own righteouſneſs, from a conviction of its inſufficiency for our juſtification. It is, 2dly, to apply to the all-ſufficient merits of our Redeemer, with p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hearts, forſaking our ſins, and putting our whole truſt in him for ſalvation preſent and eternal. It is, 3dly, firmly to believe and appropriate to ourſelves God's gracious promiſes of pardon and everlaſting life made to us for his ſake. This is implied in believing in Chriſt, and all who thus believe, are <hi>juſtified by the faith of Chriſt,</hi> and, in this reſpect, <hi>obey the goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Indeed we cannot thus believe ourſelves; but then for our comfort the goſpel is further a diſpenſation of the Spirit of God given to work this faith in us, witneſs this juſtification to our ſouls, and ſanctifying our nature, to reſtore us to that image of God in which we were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally created. It ſuppoſes that our <hi>ſins have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between us and God,</hi> and cauſed him to hide <hi>his face from us,</hi> whence <hi>we are alienated from the life of God,</hi> and <hi>even dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> It takes for granted (and well it may, for it is matter of daily and univerſal obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, confirmed by experience,) that we are altogether depraved and polluted thro' ſin, inſomuch that <hi>every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination of the thoughts of our hearts is only evil, and that continually:</hi> from which corrupt fountain the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſtreams are perpetually flowing; ſo that we are

            <p n="5">5. Now this ſpirit is an univerſal remedy for all the diſorders of our fallen nature—Hereby the darkneſs is removed from our minds, and the hardneſs from our hearts; our underſtanding is enlightened, our will ſubdued, our aſſections ſet upon things above, and all our unholy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and corrupt inclinations purged away. Hereby we <hi>die unto ſin,</hi> and <hi>live unto righteouſneſs; put off the old man,</hi> and <hi>put on the new.</hi> By this, the divine nature is communicated to us, and the divine image ſtampt upon us; we are transformed into the likeneſs, and conformed to the will of God. Here wiſdom lights her lamp, and from hence love kindles her fire: This feeds the flames of devotion, and without this, prayer and praiſe are cold and languid. By this, the liſe of God is opened in the ſoul, and the kingdom of God ſet up in the heart. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined to the Lord, we become one ſpirit with him, and we dwell in him and he in us. In a word, heaven is brought down upon earth, and an earneſt of our future inheritance is given us, until the full redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</p>

6. But be it obſerved, tho' this ſpirit more or leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens and ſtrives with all, (as appears not only from ſcripture, but alſo from experience, all men, the moſt abandoned not excepted, having, at one time or another, felt ſome remorſe on account of ſin, and ſome deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holineſs) yet in theſe his ſaving influences, he is only imparted to thoſe who follow his drawings, and comply with his deſign. For this ſpirit of light and love does not operate upon us as if we were inanimate matter, lifeleſs and inactive, but as rational creatures, endowed with a power to <hi>yield to,</hi> or <hi>reſiſt</hi> his ſacred operations. Accordingly, we are exhorted not to <hi>grieve</hi> or <hi>quench</hi> the holy ſpirit of God, by oppoſing his work; but, on the contrary, working with him <hi>to mortify the deeds of the body, that we may live.</hi> And <hi>living in the ſpirit,</hi> we are further directed to <hi>walk in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, to ſuffer ourſelves to be led by him into all truth, holineſs, and happineſs, that we may bring forth all his bleſſed fruits, and abound in every holy temper, word and work.— And this is the very thing implied in <hi>obeying the goſpel</hi> in this ſecond view of it, as it is a <hi>diſpenſation of the Spirit.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. Thus ſhall we be obedient to the goſpel in every other reſpect. We ſhall be delivered (as it were) into the mould of its <hi>doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. IT is remarkable, that in the account here given us, by the Apoſtle, of the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the eternally awful conſequences of it, he repreſents our Lord's ſecond coming to be rather in order to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own people, than the puniſhment of the wicked. For tho' he mentions his taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel, yet it ſeems this ſhall be done, as it were, by the by, ſince (as he declares in the 10th verſe) the end, the <hi>principal end</hi> of his coming is, that he <hi>may be glorified in his ſaints, and admired of all that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How plain is it from hence, as well as from a thouſand other conſiderations, that mercy is our Lord's darling attribute, and that judgment is his ſtrange work. He delights to diſpenſe pardons and confer rewards; but it is with reluctance that he paſſes ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031758_0045_0FEE2F005BC8CEE8"/>or inflicts puniſhment on any. From the Apoſtle's manner of repreſenting the matter, one would conclude that he would much rather paſs the poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by, did not the unchangeable perfections of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the divine authority of his laws, and the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of his government, oblige him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. But inaſmuch as all his other attributes muſt be manifeſted and honoured, as well as his love, his law magnified, and the equity of his government main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; therefore he muſt and will <hi>render to every man according to his works: to them who, by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eternal life; but to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man who worketh evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile, for there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi> As certainly as he will account his ſaints <hi>worthy</hi> through the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, <hi>of the kingdom for which they ſuffer,</hi> ſo certainly, <hi>when he is revealed, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, will</hi> he <hi>take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In two former diſcourſes on theſe words, the <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of our Lord's ſecond coming, as alſo the <hi>character</hi> of thoſe he will then condemn, have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſidered. I now proceed, as was propoſed, to ſhew</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of their miſery. But that we may juſtify the ways of God to man, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any abuſe which might be made of this doctrine to the diſparagement of the divine goodneſs, I think it
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031758_0046_0FEE31445DD34CB8"/>proper to premiſe a few words concerning the reaſon of their condemnation and puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is ſignified in the words of our text which ſpeak of Chriſt's "taking vengeance on them," and "pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing them." The expreſſions (eſpecially in the Greck, "<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,") intimate an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and injurious conduct in them towards God, which being examined into, they now receive the due reward of their deeds. Enquire we then what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been, and we ſhall eaſily ſee the reaſon of their miſery. And here I do not mention their violation of the law of innocence or covenant of works, made with our firſt parents before their fail, becauſe the ſcripture no where that I remember) repreſents this as the cauſe of the condemnation of any at the day of judgment. But with our Lord, I obſerve, <hi>This is the condemnation</hi> (the reaſon of the condemnation of thoſe who periſh) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, their deeds being evil. They rejected the council of God againſt themſelves;</hi> they <hi>neglected</hi> the goſpel <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they would not come unto Chriſt that they might have life;</hi> they refuſed <hi>him to reign over them;</hi> they buried (inſtead of improving) their talent of light and power, ſlighted the divine mercy, <hi>counted the blood of the coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In plainer words ſtill, he dooms them to everlaſting ſire;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031758_0047_0FEE3197F25938A0"/>not becauſe he appointed them to wrath, and decreed their damnation before they were born, but becauſe he <hi>would</hi> have ſaved them, and they <hi>would not,</hi> chuſing death rather than life, and curſing rather than bleſſing!</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that you may be able to form ſome idea, (tho' after all it will be faint and inadequate) of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice manifeſted in their puniſhment, conſider both the conduct of God towards them, and theirs in return towards him: Conſider the love of the Father in giving his only begotten Son, and expoſing him to the moſt dreadful ſufferings and ignominious death for thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, who had abuſed his mercies, broken his laws, trampled under foot his authority, and rebelied againſt his government: Conſider the Son of God emptying himſelf of his glory and happineſs, aſſuming our frail na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its meaneſt form, and at laſt ſubmitting to pain and ſhame in their greateſt extremities; and all this for his bittereſt enemies, who ſlighted his dying love, refuſed his mild government, and even embraed their hands in his moſt precious blood, or daily cruciſied him afreſh: Conſider the holy Spirit of grace operating in various ways, and at different times; enlightening, awakening, convincing; alarming with fear, alluring with hope, drawing with love; comforting in trouble, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in weakneſs, ſuccouring in temptation; and this with a view to beget repentance, faith, and holineſs in the ſoul, as a ſpirit of adoption to cry in us "Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," to ſeal us to the day of redemption, and give us an earneſt of our future inheritance in our hearts: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as perſiſting in theſe kind offices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the neglect, contempt, and contumely where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

In ſhort, conſider the amazing plan of our redemption from firſt to laſt, in all its wonderful variety, in all its myſteriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> grace: Conſider the abyſs of guilt and miſery where it finds us, and from whence it delivers us; the height of bliſs and glory to which it advances us; and in which it eſtabliſhes us; together with the aſtoniſhing proceſs of divine love in the accompliſhment of this great and good work. In a word, conſider the greatneſs of this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for us, and offered to us in the goſpel; and then ſay what puniſhment, what torment do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and from an holy and juſt God muſt they meet with, who neglect and reject it!</p>
            <p n="3">3. From a <hi>juſt</hi> God I ſay, for they have doubtleſs nothing further to expect from his mercy and goodneſs. The ſun of divine love is now for ever ſet upon them. It ſhone indeed with refulgent brightneſs during the whole day of life, tho' it was never ſuffered to enlighten their minds or warm their hearts, clouds of prejudice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled from their ſenſual ſouls, obſcuring its beams, and the thick vail of unbelief excluding its light; but it will now ſhine no more! It has now reſigned them to the ſcorching fire of divine wrath, which (however reluctant they may be) will effectually enlighten and warm them; but, ah! with how different a flame! with how diſmal
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031758_0049_0FEE319B2A8AAFA0"/>a light! The ſtreams of divine grace, which long watered their ſtill-barren ſouls in vain, are now run out, or rather diverted into a more fruitful ſoil, and ſtreams of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are directed, by infinite juſtice, to flow in upon and eternally overwhelm them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Being awakened out of the long ſleep of death by the tremendous ſound of the trump of God, they are ſummoned to appear before the awful tribunal of the Univerſal Judge. A great white throne is erected, and he who is the deſire of nations and the joy of angels, ſits upon it. <hi>His head and his hair are white as ſnow, and his eyes as a flame of fire; his feet like unto fine braſs, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the ſound of many waters. In his right-hand he carries ſeven ſtars, out of his mouth goeth a ſharp two-edged ſword, and his countenance is as the ſun ſhining in his ſtrength.</hi>

            <p>Before this glorious perſon, to whom the father hath committed all judgment, and who hath all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and on earth, trembling and reluctant they make their appearance, and receive their final ſentence at his bar.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031758_0050_0FEE319CED993BA8"/>in exact proportion to their demerits. For ſince they rejected the ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tisfied all its demands by their perſonal ſufferings, which alas! they can never do. They muſt therefore ſink forever under the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous weight of that dreadful curſe; which, with reſpect to them, Chriſt bore in vain, and muſt reimburſe (if I may ſo ſpeak) by an increaſed miſery, all the expenſe which divine goodneſs has been at with them. The love and mercy which was ſhewn theſe wicked wretches, the blood which was ſhed for them, the grace which was conferred upon them, ſhall all be conſidered, and as they will demonſtrate in the blackeſt light, their ingratitude and obſtinacy, ſo will they greatly inhance their condemnation, and aggravate their torment! Having thus manifeſted their deſert of the puniſhment provided for them, that it is a debt owed them by impartial juſtice and deſpiſed mercy, I proceed, as was propoſed, to ſhew,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The nature and duration of their miſery. On this I ſhall 1ſt, make ſome general obſervations, by way of explaining the text and eſtabliſhing the doctrine.</p>
            <p>2dly, I ſhall take a more particular view of this miſery.</p>
            <p>3dly, Shall conclude with an carneſt addreſs to ſaints and ſinners.</p>
            <p>And 1ſt, I am to make ſome general obſervations, by way of explaining the text and eſtabliſhing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>

               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:031758_0051_0FEE31EAABC769A8"/>
1. The Apoſtle calls their miſery <hi>deſtruction,</hi> by which 'tis plain he does not mean "the extinction of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," or "the annihilation of their nature," becauſe this ſenſe of the word is contrary to the general tenor of the ſcriptures, which repreſent the wicked as not only exiſting after the day of judgment, but as ſuffering the moſt exquiſite torture. But by this expreſſion we are plainly to underſtand what is infinitely worſe than anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, viz. 1ſt, The utter ruin of their once holy and happy nature, with the final death of all their comforts and their hopes; and 2dly, The entire perverſion of all their powers and faculties, which are now only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in rendering themſelves moſt completely wretched. Meaning to enlarge on theſe two particulars, when I come to take a nearer view of this miſery, I ſay no more of them at preſent, but obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their deſtruction is ſaid to be <hi>from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> This intimates to us what is the chief ſource of their ruin and miſery, viz. their baniſhment from the gracious preſence of God, their excluſion from his favor and fellowſhip.—In conſequence of original ſin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they rejected the garments of ſalvation, provided by Chriſt, and offered in the Goſpel, therefore they are found, at the day of judgment deſtitute of the divine image, that ſplendid and comely apparel which is the glory of the holy angels, and which was once the chief ornament and happineſs of man in his primeval ſtate. The rotten and filthy rags of their own righteouſneſs, which they had taken pains to patch together and throw over their ſinful ſouls, only ſerve to increaſe their deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031758_0052_0FEE31AB544BC148"/>and manifeſt ſtill more their ſin and ſhame. They cannot hide their polution and defilement. In ſpite of all their endeavours, they appear polluted with the guilt of innumerable tranſgreſſions, and all over defiled with iniquity, whoſe fatal leproſy hath ſpread its loathſome influence throughout their whole ſouls, and woefully enfeebled all their powers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are, therefore, objects of divine diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and abhorrence. <hi>The God who made them will not have mercy on them, and be who formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> They are excluded the favor of Jehovah, which is better than life, which diffuſes light and joy thro' the happy regions of immortality, and baniſhes every ſhadow of evil far from their peaceful dwellings. They are debarred all communion with, and acceſs to, the Father of their ſpirits, and the God of all conſolation and good hope, who is the only true and laſting ſource of feicity to his intelligent off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pring. They are even ſhut out of the bliſsful city, denied all fellowſhip with ſaints and angels, and baniſhed far from the dwellings of liberty and joy, into the dreary territories of miſery and anguiſh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus being immenſely removed from all that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happy, and deſerted of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the light and life of the ſpiritual world; midnight darkneſs overwhelms their minds, a furious ſtorm is raiſed in their paſſions, and wandering about in endleſs perplexity, and abanioned to everlaſting deſpair, they are toſſed to and fro by the tempeſtuous hurricanes, and raging flames of thoſe ſulphurous regions; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the ruin of their once holy and happy nature, the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031758_0053_0FEE31EC47C85EE0"/>hedge of their ſouls being broken down (I mean, the divine protection being withdrawn) they are expoſed to the deſolating ravages of the devil and his angels, thoſe wild beaſts of the infernal foreſt, who ranging forth in theſe inhoſpitable realms, overſpread with a gloomy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual night, lay the garden of the Lord utterly waſte, and root up and deſtroy whatever of excellence may remain.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But this phraſe—<hi>deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> may be alſo underſtood in another ſenſe. It ſeems not only to ſignify the miſery conſequent, in the nature of things, upon their baniſhment from God's <hi>gracious</hi> preſence, their ſeparation from faints and angels, and their excluſion out of the heavenly city (generally term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their puniſhment, of loſs concerning which I cannot now ſpeak particularly:) It likewiſe may be conſidered as intimating, if it does not chiefly intead, that God himſelf, as he is preſent in heaven in all his love and goodneſs, as an inexhauſtible ſource of fclicity to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a never-failing river of pleaſure, where they may take large and repeated draughts of bliſs;—ſo is he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in hell, in his infinite joſtice and almighty wrath, as an unfathomable ſea of liquid fire, where the wicked muſt drink in everlaſting torture. For as it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which diffuſes light and joy through the happy regions of immortality, ſo it is the preſence of God in his <hi>vengeance,</hi> which ſcatters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and woe thro' the dreary realms of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As heaven would be no heaven if God did not there manifeſt his <hi>love;</hi> ſo bell would be no bell if God did not there diſplay his wrath. It is the preſence and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031758_0054_0FEE31ACF099E500"/>agency of God, which gives every thing virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, without which there can be no life, no ſenſibility, no power.—God is, therefore, himſelf preſent in hell, to ſee to the puniſhment of theſe rebels againſt his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it may be adequate to the infinity of their guilt. His fiery indignation <hi>kindles,</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed fury <hi>blows</hi> the flames of their torment, while his powerful preſence and operation maintains their <hi>being,</hi> and renders all their powers moſt acutely ſenſible; thus ſetting the keeneſt edge upon their pain, and making it cut moſt intolerably deep!</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nay further: it ſeems implied in the next expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in our text, <hi>from the glory of his power,</hi> that he will exert all his divine attributes to the utmoſt, to make them as wretched as the capacity of their nature will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. He will eſpecially glorify his <hi>power,</hi> and render it illuſtrious in their damnation.—Gladly would be have glorified his rich grace in pardening their complicated guilt, and his almighty power in reſtoring them to his image, that they might have been raiſed to a ſhare in his throne: But deſpiſing his great ſalvation, they would not come unto Chriſt that they might have life. And now, nothing remains but that he glorify himſelf in their miſery, ſince they refuſed that happineſs which he would have conferred upon them, to the manifeſtation of his own glory. For he muſt and will be glorified one way or another in all his creatures; and with reſpect to theſe ungrateful and diſobedient wretches, he has but one way left in which he can be glorified, and that is, to reward them according to their works, by recompenſing
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031758_0055_0FEE31F5DE496330"/>their ingratitude and diſobedience upon their own guilty heads.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus (as the Apoſtle teſtifies) Rom. 9. while he <hi>makes known the riches of his glory in the veſſels of mercy,</hi> which he hath <hi>afore prepared unto glory,</hi> he will alſo <hi>ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, in the veſſels of wrath, fitted</hi> (by their own wilful and unneceſſitated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence) <hi>for deſtruction,</hi> after he has <hi>firſt endured them with much long ſuffering. Shew his wrath</hi> and <hi>make his power known!</hi> dreadful expreſſions! what an unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depth of woe do they imply! Ah! miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in whom God will ſhew how ſeverely he can pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and what a fierce fire of wrath his almighty power can kindle! Surely as the condition of the ſaints muſt be inconceivably joyful, in whom God will <hi>make known</hi> (as the Apoſtle has it) <hi>the riches of his glory,</hi> i. e. diſplay how gloriouſly rich he is in goodneſs, and to what a pitch of honour and happineſs his omnipotence can raiſe the objects of his love! ſo, on the other hand, the ſtate of theſe wretches muſt be equally lamentable! Unhappy creatures! from what an height of glory and felicity, into what a depth of infamy and miſery have they knowingly and wilfully plunged themſelves! And now
<q>
                  <l>"Their dire puniſhment is ever ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>"Their conſtitution too, forever young;</l>
                  <l>"Gurſt with returns of vigour ſtill the ſame,</l>
                  <l>"At once to bear and ſatisfy the flame:</l>
                  <l>"Still they are caught, and ſtill they are purſued;</l>
                  <l>"They Yuffer ſtill, and ſtill they are renewed."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. For the Apoſtle tells us, their deſtruction will be <hi>eternal;</hi> a declaration which is confirm'd by many other
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031758_0056_0FEE31AE87CF3CB0"/>paſſages of Scripture. One or two I ſhall now produce as a ſpecimen of the reſt. Thus Daniel aſſures us: <hi>They ſhall</hi> (viz. at the general reſurrection) <hi>awake to everlaſting ſhame and contempt,</hi> even as the ſaints ſhall ariſe <hi>to everlaſting life: they ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> ſays the faithful and true witneſs, even as <hi>the righteous ſhall go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life eternal.</hi> And indeed the eternity of their miſery ſeems a natural conſequence of what has been advanced in the two laſt paragraphs. For if God will diſplay in them (as has been obſerved) the <hi>infinity</hi> of his juſtice, the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of his wrath, and the <hi>omnipotence</hi> of his power, then muſt their puniſhment be everlaſting, becauſe their nature being finite, it does not appear how he can do this in any limited duration of time, however long. And thus what is wanting in the <hi>degree</hi> of their miſery, is made up by its <hi>continuance.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon, among others, we conclude, the happineſs of the righteous ſhall be <hi>eternal,</hi> becauſe in them God will manifeſt the infinite riches of his love and goodneſs, which conſidering the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capacity of their nature, he cannot do in leſs than a boundleſs eternity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If need were, I might add in confirmation of this doctrine, diſputed by few, that as the holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſaints, ſtill continue and encreaſe in heaven, and therefore there muſt be the ſame and greater reaſon for their being rewarded with bliſs and glory, when they have been millions of ages in happineſs, than when they firſt entered the gates of Paradiſe; ſo, the depravity and diſobedience of the wicked ſtill continuing and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, there muſt be the very ſame, yea, and greater reaſon for their puniſhment, when they have been millions of ages
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031758_0057_0FEE31F771769518"/>in torment, than when they firſt departed accurſed into <hi>everlaſting fire!</hi> They muſt be perpetually ſwelling their enormous ſum of guilt, and ſtill running deeper, immenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deeper in debt to divine and infinite juſtice; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as much right to, and as certainly claiming their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in hell, as the obedience of his ſaints in heaven. For it is, in the nature of things, impoſſible he ſhould diſpenſe with the allegiance of any of his creatures.— Hence, after the longeſt imaginable period, they will be ſo far from having diſcharged their debt of puniſhment, that they will find more, infinitely <hi>more</hi> due than when they firſt began to ſuffer! Dreadful this indeed! but too true!</p>
            <p n="10">10. Indeed, the compariſon drawn from the happineſs of the ſaints, is not altogether ſuitable; but alas! the impropriety of it falls on the unfavourable ſide, and only ſtrengthens my argument the more. For whatever proofs may be brought from other quarters in favour of the eternity of their bliſs, which do not equally evince the eternal miſery of the wicked; yet, in this point of view (ſure I am) more may be ſaid for the latter than the former. For the righteous, however obedient, do no more than is their duty to do, and therefore (ſtrictly ſpeaking) <hi>merit</hi> nothing at the hand of God. They can make no claim upon his <hi>juſtice,</hi> but all their hopes of happineſs and a continuance therein, are founded upon his gracious promiſes, which he was free to make or not to make, as he thought good.—But the caſe is different with the wicked; they have <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly merited</hi> or <hi>deſerved</hi> eternal puniſhment, and are, in fact, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it. And hence their apprehenſions of it are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031758_0058_0FEE31B02091AD50"/>not barely on his threatenings, but alſo and chiefly on the unchangeable perfections of his nature.—So that it appears, if this reaſoning is juſt, they have more than double that cauſe for fearing an <hi>eternal</hi> hell, which the ſaints have for expecting an <hi>everlaſting</hi> heaven!</p>

In the mean time, the grand revolution of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal nature; the glorious exaltation of the Prince of the kings of the earth; his compleat and everlaſting triumph over principalities and powers, and all the potent enemies of his government; the coming of the final Judge of angels and of men; the deciſive trial of the whole world at his bar; and the infinite and eternal rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments then to be diſpenſed to immortal ſouls, united to incorruptible bodies;—theſe ſubjects, though inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting beyond thought, and grand beyond compariſon, are, alas! too generally treated with indifference and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect!

            <p>Secondly, Take a more particular view of the nature and duration of the miſery of the wicked, as proved and explained in the preceding Sermon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But here I coufeſs my mind recoils. I feel a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reluctance to enter upon the conſideration of ſo dark and diſmal a ſubject; a ſubject which yet I believe very neceſſary to be conſidered, and not leſs profitable. For doubtleſs our Lord, and his Apoſtles, would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend ſuch painful meditations to us, if they were not needful, and calculated to yield us much fruit. To
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031758_0066_0FEE31C15F356140"/>ſay nothing of their tendency to reſtrain us from ſin and prompt us to duty, to excite us to diligence, and awaken our ſleepy ſouls to watchful care and fearful circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reflections upon that future and eternal miſery, which is reſerved for the impenitent and unbelieving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and is the juſt deſert of us all, may be of great uſe to encreaſe our patience under all the afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this life, ſo light and momentary in compariſon of it. And, at the ſame time, to conſider this miſery in contraſt with that exceeding great and eternal weight of glory, which is the free gift of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, will tend to enlarge our conceptions of that great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Chriſt hath wrought out for us, and, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to endear the Saviour to us, to whom we owe our redemption from the curſe of the law, and our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Away then with this reluctance! with this "fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, this treacherous compaſſion," (as the benevolent and meek Doddridge calls it,) <q>which chuſes rather to leave men to be conſumed, than diſturb their ſlumbers.</q> Let us ſeriouſly addreſs ourſelves to the conſideration of a ſubject which, tho' dreary and unpromiſing in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is notwithſtanding productive of much wholeſome fruit.

            <p n="3">3. In the former diſcourſe on this ſubject, in which the text was explained and the doctrine eſtabliſhed, it was obſerved, that the deſtruction here ſpoken of, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, 1ſt, <q>The utter ruin of their once holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py nature, and the final death of all their comforts and their hopes;</q> and 2dly, <q>the entire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Then their ſleeping and dreaming end together.

But alas! the flames of hell, though black and diſmal, afford light enough to demonſtrate their folly and depravity, while the arrows of almighty indignation, prepared by inexorable juſtice, and directed by unerring wiſdom, purſue and overtake them, and piercing them thro' with unknown ſorrows, lay them low at the bottom of the fiery lake, which, fed with ſtreams of brimſtone, and blown by the breath of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, ſwells, overflows, and torments their ruin'd ſouls.</p>

               </q> Poor unhappy wretch! how infatuated muſt thou bed —If thy mind was not totally blinded by the God of this world, and thy very ſenſes drench'd in ſenſuality, and ſtupified by the opiates of ſin, if thou hadſt any power of diſcerning or feeling left, I would aſk thee how thou couldſt bear to be ſuddenly ſtript of all thy earthly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſions,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031758_0081_0FEE321B14B5F0E0"/>totally deſerted of all thy friends arreſted by mercileſs creditors, confined in a dark dungeon, loaded with heavy irons; and in this condition, ſtarving with hunger and cold, and deſtitute of every neceſſary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and attendance, to be viſited with torturing pain or ſome loathſome diſeaſe? Sure thou haſt love enough for thy money, thy credit, thy friends, thy liberty, thy health, and in fine, thy life, to ſee that all theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties befalling thee at once, would be indeed intolerable, to <hi>thee</hi> (at leaſt) who haſt no intereſt in God and heaven. But ſurely thou doſt not think that all theſe calamities put together, and ten thouſand timesmore a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Believe me, all the evils thou haſt ever beheld with thine eyes, heard with thine ears, or conceived in thy heart, nay, all that thou couldſt ever conceive, if thou waſt to ſpend an eternity in doing nothing elſe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing forms of woe and changes of miſery, if all col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together and appointed to befall thy wretched ſelf in one moment of time, would not furniſh thee with an adequate idea of that future and everlaſting ruin, in which (if thy ſpeedy repentance prevent not) thou muſt ere long, liſt up thy ghaſtly eyes, begging in vain for a drop of water to cool thy tongue, becauſe thou wilt be tormented in that flame.—And then, Eternity! Eternity! ah, to ſpend a never-ending eternity in ſuch anguiſh! To be "ages and ages, and ſucceeding ſtill new ages," weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in that lake of fire, burning with brimſtone, and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031758_0082_0FEE31E786FDE6D8"/>after millions of ages are paſt and gone, ſtill to have the wretched conſolation of thinking that thy miſery is no nearer an end, but all, as it were, to begin again! Ah! who can bear even to think of this! The very thought of ſuch woe is enough to make one's blood run chill, and fill one's ſoul with horror! It is enough to make one's head giddy with fear, to look down that dark and fiery pit into which poor ſinners are perpetually plunging, blinded and inſenſible, till the penetrating fire make them <hi>feel,</hi> and the glaring flames of Tophet open their eyes to behold themſelves undone for ever!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Ah! flee ſinner! flee from this wrath to come!— But ſtay, and firſt falling down on thy knees, ſolemnly praiſe God, that it is not yet too late. Thank him from thy inmoſt ſoul, that he has not yet cut thee down, and aſſigned thee thy portion in this place of torment! Bleſs the riches of that goodneſs and forbearance and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, which have ſo long permitted thee to live, and waited to lead thee to true repentance! But oh! dare not, at the peril of thy ſoul, tempt it any longer!— Do not perſiſt to provoke that fierce and almighty wrath which thy ſins have already kindled againſt thee, and which (had not the precious blood of Chriſt been poured upon the flame) would long, ere now, have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly conſumed thy unholy ſoul, and made thee a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vengeance to others! Do not, I ſay, perſiſt to provoke an angry God, leſt Chriſt ſhould ceaſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and his fiery indignation ſhould, in an inſtant, blaſt all thy hopes, and devour thee as his adverſary! Oh! beware! after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, of treaſuring up unto thyſelf wrath againſt the day of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031758_0083_0FEE321CAEDBD980"/>wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God! Conſider how many years the Lord Chriſt has already interceded for thy barren ſoul, <hi>Let him alone this year al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> But alas! hitherto he has prevailed in vain for thy reprieve, for to this day thou haſt borne no good fruit. Still, ſtill thou art only a cumberer of the ground! And who knows whether he has not already put up the laſt prayer for thee, and commiſſioned me by theſe terrors of the almighty, to dig for the laſt time about thy roots!— If thou beareſt fruit it is well, but if not, if even this earthquake of God's judgments do not ſhake thee; if after this Chriſt come ſeeking fruit on thee and find none, what remains but that he ſay, <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee from henceforth and forever,</hi> or, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Therefore, delay no longer, but while thy glaſs of time is not yet run out; while the ſun of divine love is not yet gone down upon thee; while the long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God the Father ſtill waits to be gracious; while the compaſſionate friend of ſinners ſtill intercedes for thee; while the ever-bleſſed Spirit is not yet provoked to bid thee an eternal adieu, but ſtill continues to ſtrive with thee;—in ſhort, while there is yet any hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee among the bleſſed Inhabitants of heaven, that thou mayeſt, after all, be ſaved; or any fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, among the fiends of hell, leſt after all thou ſhouldeſt eſcape that place of torment; before the door of ſalvation is forever ſhut againſt thee, before yawning Tophet has devoured and cloſed its mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.—Flee, ſinner I flee; at the peril of thy ſoul, flee!—But whence and whither ſhalt thou flee! Flee

Let thy <hi>converſation be as becometh the Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt.
