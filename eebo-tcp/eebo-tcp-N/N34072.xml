            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>poſe the inhumanity and injuſtice of the barbarous trade to Africa, for the purpoſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving the poor untutored Negroes, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and their offspring in bondage, was clearly ſeen to be unchriſtian and unjuſt, at ſo early a period as that in which the author wrote, viz. in <hi>1673.</hi> And it is not becauſe the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous practice hath been ſince unreproved, by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and conſciencious men, that it is not yet aboliſhed, but rather that avarice, pride, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance hath ſo unhappily prevailed over juſtice and mercy, as to continue great numbers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians in partaking of the unrighteous gain of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>And in order to preſerve from oblivion, and for general information, it is thought expedient to ſubjoin a letter from the truly pious <hi>Anthony Benezet,</hi> lately deceaſed, who was well known to be an uniform prudent advocate for relief of the oppreſſed, to the famous Abbe Raynal, with his anſwer, which firſt appeared in the Bruſſels ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, of March, <hi>1782,</hi> and from thence publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one of the news papers of this city.</p>

            </p>
            <p>"UNDERSTAND well how far your power over your ſlaves extendeth, and what limits God hath ſet thereto; ſuch as is a ſufficient difference between men and brutes, that they are of as good a kind as you, that is, they are reaſonable creatures as well as you, and born to as much natural liberty; that they have immortal ſouls, and are equally capable of ſalvation with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Remember that God is their abſolute owner, and that you have none but a derived and limited property in them; that they and you are equally under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and laws of God;—Remember that God is their tender Father, and if they be as good, doth love them as well as you, and that the greater your power is over them, the greater your charge is of them, and your duty for them; the fourth Commandment requireth maſters to ſee that all within their gates obſerve the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, ſo muſt you exerciſe both your power and love to bring them to the knowledge and faith of Chriſt, and to the juſt obedience of God's commands.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore, that keep their Negroes and ſlaves from hearing God's word, and from becoming Chriſtians, do openly profeſs contempt of Chriſt the Redeemer, and contempt of the ſouls of men, and indeed they declare that, their worldly profit is their treaſure, and their God."</p>
            <p>"If this comes to the hands of any of our natives in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044647_0004_101EC317F4368BF0"/>Barbadoes, or other iſlands and plantations, who are ſaid to be guilty of this moſt heinous ſin, yea, and to live upon it, intreat them further to conſider, how curſed a crime it is to equal men to beaſts? Is not this your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? Do you not buy them and uſe them merely to the ſame end as you do your horſes; to labour for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, as if they were baſer than you and made to ſerve you? Do you not ſee how you reproach and condemn yourſelves, while you vilify them as ſavages and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wretches? Did they ever do any thing more ſavage, than to uſe not only men's bodies as beaſts, but their ſouls, as if they were made for nothing but to actuate their bodies in your worldly drudgery?</p>
            <p>"Doth not the very example of ſuch cruelty, beſides your keeping them from Chriſtianity, directly tend to teach them to hate Chriſtianity, as if it taught men to be ſo much worſe than dogs, or tygers?</p>
            <p>"Do you not mark how God hath followed you with plagues? and may not conſcience tell you, that it is for your inhumanity to the ſouls and bodies of ſo many? Remember the late fire at the bridge, in Barbadoes; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the drowning of your governor, loſs of ſhips at ſea, and the many judgments that have overtaken you, and at the preſent, the terrible mortality that is among you.</p>
            <p>"Will not the example and warning of neighbouring countries riſe up in judgment againſt you, and condemn you? You cannot but hear how odious the Spaniſh name is made (and thereby, alas! the Chriſtian name alſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Weſt Indians) for their moſt inhuman cruelties in Hiſpaniola, Jamaica, Cuba, Peru, Mexico, and other places, which are deſcribed by Joſeph Acoſta, a jeſuit of their own; And what comfort are you like to have, at laſt, in that money which is purchaſed at ſuch a price? Will not your money and you periſh together? Will not you have a worſe than Gehazi's leproſy, with it? Yea, worſe than Achan's death by ſtoning; and as bad as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das his hanging himſelf, unleſs repentance ſhall prevent it? Do you not remember the terrible words in Jude, "<hi>Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044647_0005_101EC31A58EFBA60"/>and ran greedily after the error of Balaam;</hi> and ii. Peter, 2, 3, 14, 15, <hi>through covetouſneſs they make merchandiſe of you. An heart they have exerciſed with covetous practices; curſed children (or children of a curſe) which have forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray, following the way of Balaam, the ſon of Bezor, who loved the wages of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; but was rebuked for his iniquity; the dumb aſs ſpeaking with man's voice, forbad the madneſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> When you ſhall every one hear, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be, which thou haſt provided.</hi> Luke xii. 19, 20, 21."</p>
            <p>"What men in the world doth James ſpeak to, if not to you—James v. 1 to 4. <hi>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and bowl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten: your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire: Ye have heaped treaſure, together for the laſt days: Behold the hire of the labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped, have entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth;</hi>" How much more then the cry of betrayed ſouls?</p>
            <p>After theſe animadverſions on the iniquity of holding and treating men as ſlaves, for the private emolument of the poſſeſſors, he proceeds to conſider divers caſes under which men are held in bondage, from whence he adduces the following concluſions.</p>
            <p>"A nominal Chriſtian, who by wickedneſs forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his life or freedom, may penally be made a ſlave as well as an Infidel; and a poor and needy Chriſtian may ſell himſelf into a harder ſtate of ſervitude than he would chuſe, or we could otherwiſe put him into; but to go as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirates, and catch up poor Negroes, or people of another land, that never forfeited life or liberty, and to make them ſlaves and ſell them, is one of the worſt kinds of thefts in the world, and ſuch perſons are to be taken for the common enemies of mankind; and they that buy them, and uſe them as beaſts for their mere commodity,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044647_0006_101EC31D8DC8F610"/>and betray, or deſtroy, or neglect their ſouls, are fitter to be called incarnate Devils, than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>He then queries; "But what if men buy Negroes, or other ſlaves, of ſuch as we have juſt cauſe to believe did ſteal them by piracy, or buy them of thoſe who have no power to ſell them, and not hire, or buy them by their own conſent, or by the conſent of thoſe who had power to ſell them, nor take them captives.</p>
            <p>And anſwers, "It is their heinous fin to buy them, unleſs it be in charity to deliver them from ſlavery; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done it, undoubtedly they are preſently bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, becauſe, by right, the man is his own, and therefore, no man elſe can have a juſt title to him.</p>
            <p>Queſtion, "But may I not ſell him again, and make my money of him, ſeeing I leave him as I found him—?</p>
            <p>Anſwer, "No; Becauſe when you have taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of him, and he becomes a pretended property, then the injury that is done him is by you, which, before, was only by another; and tho' the wrong be no greater than the other did him, yet, being done by you, it is your ſin.</p>
            <p>Queſtion, "But may I not return him to him that I bought him of?</p>
            <p>Anſwer, "No; for that is but injuring him, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him to another to continue the injury: To ſay as Pilate <hi>(I am innocent of the blood of this juſt man)</hi> will be no proof of your innocence: Yea, God's law bindeth you to love, and works of love, and therefore you ſhould do your beſt to free him. He that is bound to help to ſave a man that is fallen into the hands of thieves, by the high way, if he ſhould buy that man, as a ſlave, of the thieves, may not after, give him up to thieves again.</p>
            <p>"If they be Infidels, uſe them ſo as tendeth to win them to Chriſt, and the love of religion, by ſhewing them that Chriſtians are leſs worldly, leſs cruel and leſs paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, and more wiſe, charitable, holy and meek than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perſons are. Wo to them, who by their cruelty, and covetouſneſs, do ſcandalize even ſlaves, and hinder their converſion and ſalvation. Remember that even a ſlave may be one of thoſe neighbours that you are bound
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044647_0007_101EC3246CFC1530"/>to love as yourſelves, and to do unto as you would be done by, if your caſe was his, which, if you do, you will need no more direction for his relief."</p>

                     <p>From the idea which I conceived of the juſtice and generoſity of thy ſentiments, I took the liberty of writing to thee, about 7 or 8 months paſt, under cover of my friend B. F. and likewiſe by J. B. who, we are afraid, was loſt on his paſſage. Having received no anſwer, by ſeveral veſſels, nor knowing whether my letters reached thee, or whether thine miſcarried; and a good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offering, by my friend Dr. G. I now ſeize it to ſend thee two copies of a ſmall extract of the origin and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of my brethren, the Quakers, whom, I obſerve in ſuch of thy writings which have come to our hands, thou didſt not think unworthy of thy attention.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing to add to what I already wrote thee, but ſhall repeat my wiſh of ſaluting thee affectionately, on the principles of reaſon and humanity, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that grand circle of love and charity, unconfined by our parentage or country; but which, with affectionate cordiality, embraces the whole creation, earneſtly deſiring, to the utmoſt of my abilities, to promote the happineſs of all men, even my enemies themſelves, could I have any.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech God to give thee ſtrength, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044647_0008_101EC3279A1E5338"/>continue to hold up to mankind, thy brethren, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tending to repleniſh their hearts with goodneſs, friendſhip and charity towards each other; that thus thou mayeſt do the utmoſt of thy power, to render men reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, uſeful, and conſequently happy; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that thou mayeſt ſtrenuouſly combat that falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of honour, or rather intolerable pride and folly, which ſo ſtrongly prevails in our nation, where the moſt indolent and the leaſt uſeful fancy themſelves, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the moſt noble. Let us endeavour to make them ſenſible, that men are noble but in an exact proportion to their being rational. The happineſs which is to be found in virtue alone, is ſought for by men, through the titles acquired by their fathers, for their activity in thoſe wars which have deſolated the world, or in the wealth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated by their anceſtors; two means, generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and oppreſſive, and conſequently rather the ſources of ſhame and humiliation. For, as the Chineſe Philoſopher well obſerved, <hi>"There is ſcarcely one rich man out of one hundred, who was not himſelf an oppreſſor, or the ſon of an oppreſſor."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us diſplay to princes and the rulers of nations the example of <hi>Numa-Pompilius,</hi> who, by a Conduct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that of <hi>Romulus,</hi> his predeceſſor, and moſt of his ſucceſſors, rendered the Romans, during his long reign, ſo reſpectable and happy. Above all, my dear friend, let us repreſent to our compatriots the abominable iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Guinea trade. Let us put to the bluſh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſciples of the benign Saviour of the world, for the encouragement given to the unhappy Africans, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the liberty of their own brethren. Let us riſe, and riſe with energy, againſt the corruption, introduced into the principles and manners of the maſters and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſlaves, by a conduct ſo contrary to humanity, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion. Let us be ſtill more vehement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting its baneful influence on the principles and manners of their wretched offspring, neceſſarily educated in idleneſs, pride, and all the vices to which human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is liable.</p>
                     <p>How deſirable it is that Lewis XVI, whoſe virtues
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:044647_0009_101EC3301D778C70"/>and good diſpoſitions have been ſo nobly praiſed, would ſet an example to the other potentates of Europe, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding his ſubjects to be concerned in a traffick ſo evil in itſelf, and ſo corrupt in its conſequences, and that he would alſo iſſue out ordinances, in favour of ſuch of the Negroes who now are ſlaves in his dominions.</p>
                     <p>Alas! ſhould Chriſtianity, that law of love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, work its proper effect on the hearts of its pretended diſciples, we would ſee numbers of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> traverſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and both the Indies, not to pollute themſelves with ſlavery and ſlaughter, nor to accumulate wealth, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme wiſh of the preſent nominal Chriſtians; but that Divine love would impel them to viſit remote regions, in order to make the inhabitants acquainted with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the human heart, and invite them to ſeek for the influence of that grace, propoſed by the goſpel, by which they may obtain ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>I am under the neceſſity of concluding haſtily, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting thou wouldſt excuſe faults which time does not allow me to correct, and to write to me by various oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, the veſſels bound to theſe parts, often miſſing their deſtination.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE OPPRESSED AFRICANS.</head>
            <p>WE are engaged, under a ſenſe of duty, to bear a public teſtimony againſt a ſpecies of oppreſſion which, under the ſanction of national authority, has long been exerciſed upon the natives of Africa, is grown up into a ſyſtem of tyranny, and is unhappily become a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable branch of the commerce of this kingdom: An oppreſſion which, in the injuſtice of its origin, and the inhumanity of its progreſs, has not, we apprehend, been exceeded, or even equalled, in the moſt barbarous ages.</p>
            <p>We are taught, both by the holy ſcriptures, and by the experience of ages, to believe that the Righteous Judge of the whole earth chaſtiſeth nations for their ſins, as well as individuals; and can it be expected that he will ſuffer this great iniquity to go unpuniſhed? As the deſign of the inſtitution of government is for a terror to evil doers, and the praiſe of them that do well, we wiſh it may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, whether this has been made the rule of its adminiſtration in this land. Will it not rather be found, on inquiry, that, with reſpect to the enſlaved Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, its benevolent purpoſes have been perverted; that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044647_0011_101EC3332DACCF60"/>its terrors have fallen on the innocent, while evil doers, and oppreſſors, have been openly encouraged?</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding, government, in former times, have been induced by, what we conceive to be a miſtaken, as well as an unjuſt, policy, to promote this evil, we are perſuaded that many of the preſent members of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, as true friends of civil and religious liberty, hold this unrighteous traffic in the utmoſt abhorrence. This perſuaſion, joined to the favourable reception of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our laſt Yearly-meeting, to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, encourages us to addreſs you, thus freely, on this important ſubject; and we apprehend that the abolition of this iniquitous practice is not only required by the calls of juſtice and humanity, but is alſo conſiſtent with ſound policy. For avarice in this, as in other inſtances, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated its own purpoſe. Africa, ſo populous, and ſo rich in vegetable and mineral productions, inſtead of affording all the advantages of a well regulated commerce, is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known but as a mart for ſlaves, and as the ſcene of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and barbarities, perpetrated, in order to procure them, by men profeſſing the Chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>The arguments which have been advanced by the few writers, who have attempted to juſtify this inhuman buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can have no weight with generous minds. Thoſe, in particular, which are drawn from the permiſſion to hold ſlaves among the Jews, can in no wiſe be applied to the practice amongſt us: For, bleſſed be the God and Father of all our mercies,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 26.</note> who hath made of one blood all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, we now live under a diſpenſation eſſentially different from that of the law; in which many things were permitted to the Jews, becauſe of the the hardneſs of their hearts. All diſtinctions of name and country, ſo far as they relate to the ſocial duties, are now aboliſhed.—We are taught by our bleſſed Redeemer, to look upon all men, even our enemies, as neighbours and brethren, and to do unto them as we would they ſhould do unto us.</p>
            <p>Under a diſpenſation ſo admirably adapted to promote
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:044647_0012_101EC3381E249550"/>the temporal as well as the eternal happineſs of mankind, that any ſhould deviate ſo far from its principles, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a practice ſo replete with iniquity, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that this nation, generally characterized by its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to civil and religious liberty, ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, perhaps, more than any other, to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continuance of ſlavery, is a moſt painful reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. It would ſurely have been more conſiſtent with the avowed principles of Engliſhmen, both as men and as Chriſtians, if their ſettlement in heathen countries had been ſucceeded by mild and benevolent attempts to civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize their inhabitants, and to incline them to receive the glad tidings of the goſpel. But how different a conduct, towards them, has been purſued! it has not only been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, in a political view, to thoſe commercial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which a fair and honourable treatment might have procured, but has evidently tended to increaſe the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their manners, and to excite in their minds an averſion to that religion, the profeſſors whereof ſo cruelly treat them.</p>
            <p>This traffic is the principal ſource of the deſtructive wars which prevail among theſe unhappy people, and it is attended with conſequences, the mere recital of which is ſhocking to humanity. The violent ſeparation of the deareſt relatives, the tears of conjugal and parental affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the reluctance of the ſlaves to a voyage from which they can have no proſpect of returning, muſt preſent ſcenes of diſtreſs which would pierce the heart of any, in whom the principles of humanity are not wholly effaced. This, however, is but the beginning of ſorrows with the poor captives. Under their cruel treatment on ſhipboard, where, without regard to health or decency, hundreds are confined within the narrow limits of the hold, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers periſh; and, by what is called the ſeaſoning in the iſlands, many are relieved by a premature death, from that ſeries of accumulated ſufferings which awaits their leſs happy ſurvivors. The meaſure of their afflictions yet remains to be filled; being ſold to the higheſt bidder, and branded with a hot iron, they have yet to linger on, unpitied, the whole term of their miſerable exiſtence, in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:044647_0013_101EC33CE2D37B48"/>exceſſive labour, and too often under the mercileſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of unprincipled and unfeeling men, without proper food or cloathing, or any encouragement to ſweeten their toil; whilſt every fault, real, or imaginary, is puniſhed with a rigour which is but weakly reſtrained by the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laws; inſtances of the greateſt enormity, even the moſt wanton or deliberate murder of the ſlaves, being only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, if puniſhed at all, by trifling pecuniary fines.</p>
            <p>But a bare enumeration of the calamities of this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, would exceed the limits propoſed to this ſhort addreſs: We think it not improper, however, to give the following extract from a late author, who was an eye witneſs of the miſeries of this perſecuted race.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If we bring this matter home, and, as Job propoſed to his friends, <hi>"Put our ſoul in their ſouls ſtead;"</hi> if we conſider ourſelves, and our children, as expoſed to the hardſhips which theſe people lie under, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an imaginary greatneſs;</p>
               <p>Did we, in ſuch caſe, behold an increaſe of luxury and ſuperfluity among our oppreſſors, and therewith feel an increaſe of the weight of our burdens, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our poſterity to groan under oppreſſion after us;</p>
               <p>Under all this miſery, had we none to plead our cauſe, nor any hope of relief from man, how would our cries aſcend to the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, who judgeth the world in righteouſneſs, and, in his own time, is a refuge for the oppreſſed!</p>
               <p>When we were hunger-bitten, and could not have ſufficient nouriſhment, but ſaw them in fullneſs, pleaſing their taſte with things fetched from far;</p>
               <p>When we were wearied with labour, denied the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to reſt, and ſaw them ſpending their time at eaſe; when garments, anſwerable to our neceſſities, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us, while we ſaw them cloathed in that which was coſtly and delicate?</p>
               <p>Under ſuch affliction, how would theſe painful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings riſe up as witneſſes againſt their pretended devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! And if the name of their religion were menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in our hearing, how would it ſound in our ears,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044647_0014_101EC33FB9953DD0"/>like a word which ſignified ſelf-exaltation and hardneſs of heart!</p>
               <p>When a trade is carried on productive of ſo much miſery, and they who ſuffer by it are ſome thouſands of miles off, the danger is the greater of not laying their ſufferings to heart.</p>
               <p>In procuring ſlaves from the coaſt of Africa, many children are ſtolen privately; wars alſo are encouraged among the Negroes; but all is at a great diſtance.—Many groans ariſe from dying men, which we hear not. Many cries are uttered by widows and fatherleſs child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which reach not our ears. Many cheeks are wet with tears, and faces ſad with unutterable grief, which we ſee not. Cruel tyranny is encouraged. The hands of robbers are ſtrengthened; and thouſands reduced to the moſt abject ſlavery, who never injured us.</p>
               <p>Were we, for the term of one year only, to be eye witneſſes to what paſſeth in getting theſe ſlaves; was the blood which is there ſhed, to be ſprinkled on our garments; were the poor captives, bound with thongs, heavy laden with elephants teeth, to paſs before our eyes, in their way to the ſea;</p>
               <p>Were their bitter lamentations, day after day, to ring in our ears, and their mournſul cries in the night, to hinder us from ſleeping!</p>
               <p>Were we to hear the ſound of the tumult, when the ſlaves on board the ſhips attempt to kill the Engliſh, and behold the iſſue of thoſe bloody conflicts; what pious man could be a witneſs to theſe things, and ſee a trade carried on in this manner, without being deeply affected with ſorrow?</p>
            </q>
            <p>Our religious ſociety in theſe kingdoms, and in North America, have for many years tenderly ſympathized with this unhappy people, under their complicated ſufferings, and have endeavoured to procure them relief: Nor has their caſe been without other advocates; whoſe numbers we have with much ſatisfaction obſerved to increaſe. The expectation of many, who are anxiouſly concerned for the ſuppreſſion of this national evil, is now, under Providence, fixed upon the wiſe and humane interpoſition of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044647_0015_101EC34289012530"/>to whom, with dutiful ſubmiſſion, we earneſtly recommend the ſerious conſideration of this important ſubject; with a pleaſing hope, that the reſult will be, a prohibition of this traffic in future and an extenſion of ſuch relief to thoſe who already groan in bondage, as juſtice and mercy may dictate, and their particular ſituations may admit. That ſo the bleſſings of thoſe who are ready to periſh may reſt upon you, and this nation may no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on their account, remain obnoxious to the righteous judgments of the Lord, who, in the moſt awful manner, declared by his prophet, <q>That the land ſhould trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note n="*" place="bottom">Amos iv and viii. chap.</note>, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein, for the iniquity of thoſe who oppreſs the poor, and cruſh the needy;</q> and who likewiſe pronounced a <q>Woe<note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah xxii. chap.</note> unto him that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work.</q>

            <head>NOTES ON THE SLAVE TRADE.</head>
            <p>IT may not be neceſſary to repeat what has been ſo fully declared in ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern publications, of the inconſiſtence of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very with every right of mankind, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very feeling of humanity, and every precept of Chriſtianity; nor to point out its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with the welfare, peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of every country, in proportion as it prevails; what grievous ſufferings it brings on the poor NEGROES; but more eſpecially what a train of fatal vices it produces in their lordly oppreſſors and their unhappy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. Nevertheleſs for the ſake of ſome who have not met with, or fully conſidered thoſe former publications, and in hopes that ſome who are ſtill active in ſupport of ſlavery may be induced to conſider their ways, and become more wiſe, the following ſubſtance of an addreſs or expoſtulation made by a ſenſible Author, to the ſeveral ranks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moſt immediately concerned in the trade, is now republiſhed.</p>
            <p>"And firſt, to the Captains employed in this trade. Moſt of you know the country of Guinea, perhaps now by your means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the inhabitants being murdered or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, ſo that there are few left to till
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:044647_0017_101EC34B685155B8"/>the ground; but you know, or have heard, how populous, how fruitful, how pleaſant it was a few years ago. You know the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not ſtupid, not wanting in ſenſe, conſidering the few means of improvement they enjoyed. Neither did you find them ſavage, treacherous, or unkind to ſtrangers. On the contrary they were in moſt parts a ſenſible and ingenious people; kind and friendly, and generally juſt in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by ſtealth, part by force, part made captives in thoſe wars which you raiſe or foment on purpoſe. You have ſeen them torn away, children from their parents, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from their children: Huſbands from their wives, wives from their beloved huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; brethren and ſiſters from each other. You have dragged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native ſhore. You have forced them into your ſhips, like an herd of ſwine,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following relation is inſerted at the requeſt of the author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That I may contribute all in my power towards the good of mankind, by inſpiring any of its individuals with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able abhorrence for that deteſtable practice of trading in our fellow creatures, and in ſome meaſure attone for my neglect of duty as a chriſtian, in engaging in a wicked traffic, I offer to their ſerious conſideration, ſome few occurrences of which I was an eye witneſs. That being ſtruck with the wretched and affecting ſcene they may foſter that humane principle, which is the noble and diſtinguiſhed characteriſtic of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the year <hi>1749;</hi> I ſailed from Liverpool to the coaſt of Gainea, ſome time after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a conſiderable diſtance, upon having notice from one of the Negroe Kings, that he had a parcel of ſlaves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of, I received my inſtructions and went, carrying with me an account of ſuch goods we had on board, to exchange for the ſlaves we intended to purchaſe; upon being introduced, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a ſmall caſe of ſpirits, a gun and ſome trifles, which having accepted. and underſtood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the Slaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how ſhall I relate the affecting fight I there beheld, the ſilent ſorrow which appeared in the countenance of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted father, and the painful anguiſh of the tender mother, expecting to be forever ſeparated from their tender offspring; the diſtreſſed maid wringing her hands in preſage of her future wretchedneſs, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſion of the perpetual Slavery to which they were doomed. I purchaſed eleven, who I conducted, tied two and two, to our ſhip. Being but a ſmall veſſel (ninety ton) we ſoon purchaſed our cargo, conſiſting of one hundred and ſeventy Slaves, whom thou may'ſt reader range in thy view, as they were ſhackled two and two together, pent up within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row confines of the main deck, with the complicated diſtreſs of ſickneſs, chains and contempt; deprived of every fond and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial tie and in a great meaſure reduced to a ſlave of deſperation. We had not been a fortnight at ſea, before the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this deſpair appeared, they formed a deſign of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their natural right, Liberty, by raiſing and murdering every man on board; but the goodneſs of the Almighty render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſcheme abortive, and his mercy ſpared us to have time to repent: The plot was diſcovered; the ring leader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at ſun riſe received a number of laſhes; in this ſituation be remained till ſun-ſet, expoſed to the inſults and barbarity of the brutal crew of ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with full leave to exerciſe their cruelty at pleaſure: The conſequence was, the next morning the miſerable ſufferer was found dead, fleed from the ſhoulders to the waiſt. The next victim was a youth, who from too ſtrong a ſenſe of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery refuſed nouriſhment and died diſregarded and unnoticed till the hogs had fed on part of his fleſh.</p>

You have ſtowed them together as cloſe as ever they could lie, without any regard to decency or conveniency—And when many of them had been poiſoned by ſoul air, or had ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der various hardſhips, <q>you have ſeen their remains delivered to the deep, till the ſea ſhould give up his dead.</q> You have carried the ſurvivors into the vileſt ſlavery, never to end but with life: Such ſlavery as is not found among the Turks at Algiers, no, nor among the heathens in America.</p>

May I ſpeak plainly to you? I muſt. Love conſtrains me: Love to you, as well, as thoſe you are concerned with. Is there a God? You know there is. Is he a juſt God? Then there muſt be a ſtate of retribution: A ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the juſt God will reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his work. Then what reward will he render to you. O think betimes! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you drop into eternity: Think how, <q>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that ſhewed no mercy.</q> Are you a man? Then you ſhould have a human heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044647_0020_101EC35173367170"/>of? Is there no ſuch principle as compaſſion there? Do you never feel another's pain? Have you no ſympathy? No ſenſe of human woe? No pity for the miſerable? When you ſaw the flowing eyes, the heaving breſt, or the bleeding ſides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures. Was you a ſtone or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you ſqueezed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonizing creatures down in the ſhip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the ſea, had you no relentings? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one ſigh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from your breaſt? Do you feel no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting now? If you do not, you muſt go on till the meaſure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you, as you have dealt with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for you: But if your heart does relent; tho' in a ſmall degree, know it: is a call from the God of Love. And to-day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart—To day reſolve, God being your helper to eſcape for your life—Regard not money: All that a man hath will he give for his life. Whatever you loſe, loſe not your ſoul; nothing can countervail that loſe.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044647_0021_101EC354034E7750"/>Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events be an honeſt man.</p>
            <p>This equally concerns every merchant who is engaged in the ſlave-trade. It is you that induce the African villain to ſell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to ſteal, rob, murder men, women and children without number: by enabling the Engliſh villain to pay him for ſo doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is your money, that is the ſpring of all, that improw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers him to go on, ſo that whatever he or the African does in this matter, is all your act and deed. And is your conſcience quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes and ſtupified your heart? Can you ſee, can you feel no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the caſe your own. <q>Maſter (ſaid a ſlave at Liverpool to the merchant that owned him) what if ſome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my miſtreſs, and maſter Tommy and maſter Billy, and carry them into our country and make them ſlaves, how would you like it?</q> His anſwer was worthy of a man: <q>I will never buy a ſlave more while I live.</q> O let his reſolution be yours! Have no more any part in this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044647_0022_101EC35D6B8D1BE0"/>deteſtable buſineſs. Inſtantly leave it to thoſe unfeeling wretches, <q>who laugh at humanity and compaſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this equally concerns every perſon who has an eſtate in our American plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Yea all ſlave-holders of whatever rank and degree; ſeeing men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-ſtealers. Indeed you ſay, <q>I pay honeſtly for my goods; and I am not concerned to know how they are come by.</q> Nay but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know that they are not ſtolen: Otherwiſe you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot honeſter than him. But you know they are not honeſtly come by: You know they are procured by means nothing near ſo innocent as picking of pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, houſe breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are procured by a deliberate ſeries of more complicated vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy (of fraud, robbery and murder) than was ever practiſed either by Mahometans or Pagans; in particular by murders of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is your money that pays the merchant, and thro' him the captain and African butchers. You therefore are guilty: Yea principally guilty, of all theſe frauds, robberies, and murders. You are the ſpring that puts all the reſt in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044647_0023_101EC35EF0923828"/>motion; they would not ſtir a flep without you—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blood of all theſe wretches, who die before their time, whether in their country or elſewhere, lies upon your head. The blood of thy brother, (for whether thou wilt believe it or no, ſuch he is in the ſight of him that made him) crieth againſt thee from the earth, from the ſhip and from the waters. O! whatever it coſt, put a ſtop to its cry, before it be too late. Inſtantly, at any price, were it the half of thy goods, deliver thy ſelf from blood guiltineſs! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy houſe, thy land, are at preſent ſtained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt: Spill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to ſhed blood! Do not pay him for doing it! Whether thou art a Chriſtian or no, ſhew thy ſelf a man; be not more ſavage than a lion or a bear.</p>
            <p>Perhaps thou wilt ſay, <q>I do not buy any NEGROES: I only uſe thoſe left me by my father.</q> But is it enough to ſatisfy your own conſcience! Had your father, have you, has any man living, a right to uſe another as a Slave? It cannot be, even ſetting REVELATION aſide. It cannot be, that either war, or contract, can give any man ſuch a property in another as he has in his ſheep and oxen: Much leſs is it poſſible, that any child of man, ſhould ever be born a Slave. Liberty is the right of every human creature, as ſoon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from the law of nature. If therefore you have any regard to juſtice, (to ſay nothing of mercy, nor of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed law of GOD) render unto all their due. Give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to whom Liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none ſerve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice, away with whips, chains, and all compulſion. Be gentle towards all men. And ſee that you invariably do unto every one, as you would he ſhould do unto you.</p>
