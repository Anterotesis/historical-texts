            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly, it hath been Objected,</hi> That we will not suffer Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come under the Watch and Care of the Church.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>We are so farre from being of that</hi> Opinion, <hi>as that we verily fear there is great guilt lies upon the</hi> Churches, <hi>because they have neglected their duty towards the</hi> Children in question. <hi>It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Acts 8. 21. See Mr. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism.</note> And if when they shall be adult, they do not bring forth fruits of Repentance and Faith, then (as the Fig-tree which did not bear fruit, was to be cut down) the Church is to disown them, as <hi>having no part in the Lord,</hi> and to declare, that they by their unbelief have Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanted themselves. <hi>But we see not sufficient warrant from the</hi> Word of God, <hi>to proceed to a</hi> formal Excommunication <hi>of the</hi> Children in question, <hi>because that is applicable unto none but those who have been in</hi> full Communion. <hi>Now if this be all that is striven after,</hi> That Church-children might be brought under Church-watch, <hi>why should the</hi> Contentions of Brethren be like the bars of a Castle, that cannot yield?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, it hath been Objected,</hi> That the reason of our Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the major part of the Synod, was Weakness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and meer Wilfulness, in that we could bring no Arguments, but what were sufficiently refuted.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>The very same thing hath been said of those Worthy Champions, who stood up for</hi> the Congregational-Way, in <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Assembly at</hi> Westminster, <hi>that</hi>

<pb facs="unknown:000078_0011_0F9F8FD1EB31C8F8"/>
answered, and that themselves were Self-conceited, and Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>But these</hi> Criminations <hi>were unworthy</hi> Calumniations. <hi>It was a common Reproach cast upon the Christians of old,</hi> That they were all weak and unlearned men: <hi>which made</hi> Jerome <hi>write that Book</hi> De viris Illustribus. <hi>So</hi> Stapleton <hi>makes no bones to call</hi> Whitaker, An Asse, <hi>and</hi> A Fool. <hi>And the same</hi> hissing of the Serpent <hi>have we seen in the</hi> Prelates <hi>against the Renowned</hi> Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Conformists. <hi>But, we suppose, their saying so, did not prove it was so. Nevertheless, we are content to accept of the</hi> Charge, <hi>when we are charged with</hi> Weakness and Folly: <hi>Let us</hi> be fools for Christs sake, <hi>or</hi> for his Truth; <hi>Let us</hi> fall, <hi>so the</hi> Truth may rise; <hi>let us</hi> sit in the dust, <hi>so that</hi> Truth may sit in the Throne. <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not to be otherwise esteemed, then as</hi> Weakness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it self: <hi>Yet let us not be reputed</hi> Obstinate, <hi>and such as are and will be blinde, because we dare not</hi> betray the Truth, and sin against our Consciences. <hi>For, our</hi> weightiest Reasons <hi>never were</hi> Answered <hi>unto any tolerable satisfaction, even to this day. If it be demanded here,</hi> What our Reasons were, why we accorded not with the major part of the Synod? <hi>We shall by the help of Christ, and in the fear of God, declare what our chief</hi> Reasons <hi>were, which caused our</hi> Dissent; <hi>which when they are</hi> Answered, <hi>we shall lay down our</hi> Opinion, <hi>as knowing that it is</hi> Nullus pudor ad meliora transire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Synod did acknowledge, That there ought to be true saving Faith in the Parent, according to the judgement of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal charity, or else the childe ought not to be baptized. <hi>We intreated, and urged again &amp; again,</hi> that this, <hi>which they themselves acknowledged was a Principle of Truth,</hi> might be set down for a Conclusion, and then we should all agree. <hi>But those</hi> Reverend Persons <hi>against whom we placidly disputed, would not consent to this, though</hi> our Unity lay at the Stake for it.</p>

            <p n="3">3.The Parents of the children in question, are not Members of any instituted Church, according to Gospel-Rules, because they were never under any explicite and personal Covenant. <hi>To prove which, we reason thus: If this</hi> second Generation <hi>do retain their Membership by virtue of their Parents Covenant made for them in minority; then, in case all the</hi> pro-Parents <hi>were dead, this</hi> second

Generation <hi>would be a</hi> true Church of Christ, <hi>without any further Act or Covenanting. But this</hi> second Generation <hi>are not a</hi> true Church of Christ <hi>without some further Act.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they do not retain their Membership. If they are a</hi> true Church of Christ <hi>then they have Power to Vote in</hi> Church-affairs, <hi>as to chuse Officers, and to cast out Offenders, and the like; because every</hi> true Church <hi>hath this power given to them by the Lord Jesus, who is the onely</hi> Head of his Church. <hi>But</hi> they have no such Power (<hi>say the Synod, who do expressly</hi>

               <hi>is</hi> the Membership of the Children <hi>in Controversie; when-as it seems to us, that the Scripture doth not acknowledge any such</hi> Meer Membership <hi>as they speak of.

The finding out of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and rightly applying them, would make the way to Truth shorter, the mystery of Truth clearer, and the united force of Truth stronger against Errour, a sweeter closing of Spirits among good men, and the examining of other mens Opinions easier, then walking after the larger Circumference of the voluminous Writings of men, which lead us further from these Principles, then the Scripture alone.

If they had not spiritual fitness for the Covenant, Parents, or adult persons were not regularly in Covenant, nor are their children in infancy or minority, warrantably baptized. And, when those infants are grown up, though they have not been discovenanted, by being cast out, or cut off, from their Covenant-relation; yet they are discovenanted, by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their Parents Covenant for them, through their not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that whereunto they were engaged thereby, in that, when they became adult, they did not regularly enter into Covenant with the Lord and his Church, for themselves and theirs, as their Parents, if they were godly, did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. 2. Though they say, <q>

But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches among the Gentiles now are constituted of visible Believers, for the matter of them, among whom sundry close Hypocrites creep in.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> By what is answered to the former, it appears, that personal Membership is of two sorts; 1. <hi>Purely,</hi> or <hi>meerly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal;</hi> such is the Membership of adult persons regularly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for their Membership is both <hi>subjectively,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, by their orderly covenanting for themselves. 2. <hi>Mixtly Personal;</hi> such is the Membership of the infants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in minority of confederate Parents. For their Membership is onely <hi>subjectively Personal,</hi> but <hi>formally Relative,</hi> by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenanting for them, they being unable to covenant for themselves. To apply this to childrens Membership, which they unfitly style <hi>Immediate:</hi> I say, <hi>unfitly;</hi> for two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the denominating of a <hi>Member,</hi> Mediate or Immediate, 1. <hi>To an Immediate Member,</hi> that his Membership arise 1. From his personal Faith, made visible to the Church. 2. From his personal Confederating with the Lord and his Church, for himself and his seed Such an one is an <hi>Immediate Member,</hi> because his Membership is from himself, as well as in himself. 2. <hi>To a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member,</hi> 1. That is Membership ariseth, not from his personal Faith made visible to the Church, whereof he is not capable, but from his believing confederate Parents. 2. That it is from such Parents covenanting for him. Such an one is a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member,</hi> because his Membership, though it is <hi>subjectively</hi> in himself, yet it is <hi>relatively</hi> from his Parents. Whence it will follow, that this kinde of Membership is peculiar to such infants and children in minority, onely during their non-age.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> I look at believing confederate Parents, not as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental, but as the procreant cause, as of the childes natural being, by his generating him; so also of his Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by his confederating for him, and this by Gods Institution: therefore I chuse rather to call him a <hi>mediate member,</hi> then to say he is a <hi>member immediately;</hi> to shew, that the childes Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship differs from the Parents <hi>specifically,</hi> or in the kinde of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership. For, the childes Membership is <hi>Relative,</hi> in it Essence, though <hi>Personal,</hi> in its Subject; which doth vary the Essence, or Nature of it, from the Parents, which is both in its Essence and Subject <hi>meerly Personal. Divine Institution</hi> giveth a <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>mixtly personal membership</hi> to such children by their Parents cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting for them, as the <hi>immediate procreant cause of their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> whereby the children become mediate Members, <hi>i. e. medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante Parentum foedere,</hi> which gives Being to the Membership of such children, and differenceth it from the Membership of adult persons. <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> though it doth not make every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a <hi>Publick Person,</hi> against which Title I excepted in my <hi>first Essay,</hi> and whereunto I finde no Answer here: Yet it makes such Parents Covenant to be Obligatory to such children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Parents act in covenanting for the childe, to be the childes act <hi>interpretatively,</hi> not <hi>formally,</hi> so as to make the childe an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member thereby.</p>

               <q>They adde, <hi>Hence the Essence of membership,</hi> i. e. <hi>Covenant-interest, or a place and portion within the visible Church, is really, properly, personally and immediately the portion of the childe by Divine Gift and Grant,</hi> Josh. 22. 25,27.</q>

what is wanting to little children, to invest them with an <hi>actual, compleat, proper, absolute, and immediate membership.</hi> For, though they are in Covenant, which is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, yet it is mediately, (i. e. <hi>mediante Parentum foedere</hi>) and so their Membership is mediate. 2. Divine Institution giants unto the little children of his people such a portion in his Church as they are capable of, during their minority, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them to be such Members, as such covenanting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for them can make them. 3. This Divine Institution makes their Parents Undertakers for such children, and them bound, by their Parents acting, to perform that Covenant, when they shall become capable, and when they grow fit, to covenant with the Lord and his people for themselves and theirs, and so to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in their own persons, by their personal act, immediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

               </gap> her in another way; though both are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet these different wayes makes their being in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant different, and so their Membership. He that comes to be in the Covenant by his own immediate acting, is an immediate Member: He that comes into it by anothers acting for him, is a mediate Member. For, though we are as truly, personally, and immediately Members of the Body of faln Mankinde, and by Nature Heirs of Condemnation, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though he came to it by his own personal act, and we by the act of our publick person; yet that doth not suit the case of Infants in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: for, 1. <hi>Adam</hi> stood as a publick person, in whose loyns all Mankinde were under the first Covenant, and to be happy or condemned, by his standing or falling. No Parent is such a publick person covenanting for all his Posterity, but for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and children in minority, while they are such, leaving his adult children to Covenant for themselves, if he hath any such children, when himself enters into Covenant. 2. <hi>Adams</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was onely with the Lord, not with any Church, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000078_0056_0F9F9004DCCA0E60"/>
of confederate Parents is; and therefore, if <hi>Adam</hi> had stood, his posterity had not been Church-members thereby, as the infants of Church-confederates. 3. Nor doth the Parents breaking his Covenant, make his children Heirs of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Adams</hi> did all Mankinde. So that this example of <hi>Adam</hi> is impertinently produced in this case of infants, and their Parents confederating for them, not as their publick person, but as Undertakers for their infant-seed by Gods Institution. Nor indeed is any to be accounted a publick person, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but Jesus Christ, for all that are in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14,to 20. Nor doth their similitude of <hi>a Prince giving Lands to a man and his heirs suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, while they continue loyal,</hi> suit the case in question, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants, who cannot be visibly disloyal; nor that, concerning adult persons not regularly joyned to the Church, as immediate Members, whose Parents were godly when they covenanted for them in their infancy. For, they have cut off the Entail of the Covenant from themselves and their Posterity, by their personal disloyalty: so that nothing is given to them and theirs by their Covenant which they presume to usurp, without warrant from God. They say true, that <q>

               </q> And they Answer it thus: <q>Ans. <hi>It followeth not. All priviledges that belong to members, as such, do belong to the children as well as to the parents: But all Church-priviledges do not so. A member, as such, (or all member) may not partake of all priviledges, but they are to make progress, both in memberly duties and priviledges, as their age, and capacity, and qualifications do fit them for the same.</hi>

shew, that compleat and immediate Membership, as such, doth infer compleat and immediate communion in all Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: But children in minority have not compleat and immediate communion in all Church-priviledges, without some further act or qualification: Therefore such children are not compleat and immediate Members, as such. Now to this, their Answer is insufficient: For, the best Members have need to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in memberly duties and qualifications, to fit them more and more for Church-priviledges. Yet all have that communion that suits their Membership: <hi>Infants,</hi> in Baptism, the Watch, Prayers, and Blessing of the Church, by their Parents covenanting for them: <hi>Adult persons, orderly and regularly joyned by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal covenanting for themselves,</hi> in the Seals, Voting, and Censures, which belong to them, as such Members. Nor doth the Scripture any where allow the Church to admit any one by personal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting for themselves and theirs, into any other Membership then compleat and immediate. But Infants are not capable of such Membership, without some further personal act and qualification, when they shall become adult. Therefore their Infant-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership is not compleat and immediate.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. <hi>That their Membership still continues in adult age, and ceaseth not with their Infancy, appears,</hi> 1. <hi>Because in Scripture persons are broken off onely for notorious sins, or incorrigible impenitency and unbelief, not for growing up to adult age,</hi> Rom. 11. 20.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. When I affirm, that their mediate Membership con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth during their minority, while they are under the Institution and Government of Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deny that that Membership continues in adult age, and when they are at their own disposal, or have children of their own to covenant for: because then the reason of their <hi>mediate Membership</hi> ceaseth, they being by age capable of covenanting for themselves. 2. Their first Reason doth not prove, that the Membership of all baptized in Infancy, continues in adult age: For the Text alledged, speaketh onely of such as have been received into compleat and immediate member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship regularly, by their personal Faith and Covenanting with the Church visibly, who are broken off, either by the just judgement of God, as the unbelieving Nation of the Jews are, or by the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000078_0058_0F9F9006518C5328"/>
just Censure of the Church. Whereas our question is, not of such, but of adult persons, that break off themselves from the Covenant, by profane neglect, or contempt of the Ordinances, or unsuitable Conversation. Who ever said, that any were broken off for growing up to adult age? Such intimations should be forborn by godly men.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2.<hi>The Jews children circumcised did not cease to be members by growing up, but continued in the Church, and were by virtue of their membership received in infancy, bound unto various duties, and in special unto those solemn professions that pertained unto adult mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, not as then entring into a new membership, but as making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in memberly duties,</hi> Deut. 26. 2—10. &amp; 16. 16,17. with Gal. 5. 3.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. That the Jews children circumcised were bound to various duties, and to <hi>those solemn professions that pertained to adult members,</hi> when themselves were grown up, is clear enough by the Texts alledged, and sundry other. Whereunto I willingly adde, that <hi>Baptism also bindeth the Infant-seed of Confederates to various Gospel-duties, and especially this, of using all means that Faith may be wrought in their hearts, unto obeying the Call of God, and then holding forth their Faith unto the Church, that they may take hold of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for themselves and theirs, and so become compleat and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Members.</hi> But 2. It is not proved, by those Texts, that when they were adult, they did not enter into a new Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; rather the contrary appears in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17,18. For, they entred into that Covenant personally and immediately, not in and by their Parents, as they did in Infancy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. If covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be <hi>the Form of Church-membership,</hi> (which they affirm) then a different form of covenanting, makes a different kinde of Church-membership. <hi>Immediate covenanting,</hi> makes immediate Members; <hi>Mediate covenanting,</hi> makes mediate Members.</p>
            <p>Their third Reason is, <q>
                  <hi>Those relations of Born-servants and Subjects, which the Scripture makes use of to set forth the state of children in the Church by,</hi> Lev. 25. 41,42. Ezek. 37. 25. <hi>do not (as all men know) cease with infancy, but continue in adult age. Whence also it follows, that one special end of membership received in infancy, is to leave persons under engagement, to service and subjection to

Christ in his Church, when grown up, when they are fit for it, and have most need of it.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Those Relations of born Servants and Subjects in the Text alledged, have different respects. That <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. was typical, figuring the time of Grace, whereby now Christ hath freed us from the servitude of Sin and Satan, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 32,36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14,18. to become the Servants of God in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. Parents and children, so far as they have interest in the Redemption wrought by Christ, as they are freed by him from <hi>other Lords,</hi> so they are bound thereby to <hi>serve him all the dayes of their life,</hi> Luke 1. 74,75. Therefore this relation doth not cease with infancy, but continueth in adult age. But this doth nothing concern the thing in question, concerning <hi>Mediate Membership.</hi> The other Text, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25. is a Prophecy of the calling of the Elect Nation of the Jews, and of the state of the Church under the <hi>New Jerusalem:</hi> the difference between which, and the Christian Gentiles now, I have formerly shewn: so that neither doth that fit the question. But 2. I grant, (though not as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thence) <hi>That one special end of membership received in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, is to leave persons under engagement, to service and subjection to Christ in his Church, when grown up, when they are fittest for it, and have most need of it.</hi> The engagement is strong, both on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>To train up their children,</hi> from their Infancy, <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6. 4. and upon the Children, <hi>To kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Reas. 4. <hi>There is no ordinary way of cessation of membership, but by Death, Dismission, Excommunication, or Dissolution of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: none of which is the case of the persons in question.</hi>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> This Proposition may not be granted. For, 1. It granteth the priviledge of Church-membership to such as are <hi>not actually and regularly Church-members,</hi> which is contrary to Christs Ordinance, whereby Baptism, being a publick Church-Ordinance, is due onely to them who have a publick state and Interest, such are onely the Members of the publick Ecclesiastical Body, the Church. Hence 1. An ordinary Minister cannot orderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an act proper to his Office, in reference to Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to any that are not regularly and actually Members of the visible Church, without great usurpation: as, if a man do a work proper to Magistracy, to one that is not under his Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power, he is an Usurper. So it is in this case of a Minister. To administer Baptism, is an act of his Office-power: If he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Baptism to children, whose Parents are not regularly in Church-order; in so doing, why may not the Lord say, He is an Usurper? Suppose an unbaptized person, professing his Faith, and qualified according to the description in the sixth Proposition; yet deferring for some probable causes, to adjoyn himself to the Church, for the present, should desire Baptism of any of these Ministers who framed this Proposition; Should they administer
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000078_0062_0F9F900A5D784020"/>
it to him, and so do a proper work of their Officè upon him? If yea; if they admit him to Baptism, why not to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and to the choice of Officers, and to the Censures of the Church, either actively or passively? for all these are Actions and Ordinances of one general nature: and it is meerly his want of Church-order that debars him from them. 2. The Church may not receive into any priviledge of Church-communion, such as Baptism is, (whatever cause they seem to have, in the judgement of charity, to think them fit for Church-membership, <hi>and such as had they been called, would have so acted</hi>) until they be actually in publick Church-order; no more then the Children of every good Subject of the King, may be admitted into the special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of a Corporation, whereof themselves, or their next Parents are not regularly free. <hi>All things must be done in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. whereunto, what is more contrary, then that he, who is not regularly and personally of a publick Society, should have Fellowship in a publick Priviledge, proper to that Society?

               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Parents of the children in question are visibly breakers of the Covenant, which was sealed to them by Baptism, in their Infancy, and obliged them to service and subjection to Christ in his visible Church, having confederated personally and regularly for themselves and theirs, as their Parents did before them. If they do not this, they are out of that order, by their own fault, wherein they might have given their children right to Baptism, according to Christs Institution. That right which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have not for themselves unto <hi>Baptism</hi> if they were unbaptized, they cannot give to their children. They who are not Members in their own personal and immediate right, cannot give a right of membership to their children. And though their Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in Infancy was distinct from their Parents, yet being onely mediate, by their Parents covenanting for them, it ceaseth, when they become adult, by their own fault, in that they were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

               <hi>Faith in Christ made visible to the Church,</hi> without which they are not regularly Church-members.

But, for that other part of it, <hi>To withdraw from a Church, or peccant party therein, after due means, with patience used, obstinately persisting in Errours or Scandals;</hi> this must be taken with a grain of Salt. They referre us to the <hi>Platform of Discipline,</hi> (Chap. 15. Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

But the <hi>Withdrawing of other Churches from a Church which they account peccant,</hi> is an act of different nature and kinde. For, it is not an act of publick Authority of such Churches over that Church, by virtue of <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven</hi> given to any Synod, or Council of Neighbour-Churches, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess in their first Proposition, for Answer to this second Question.</p>

This Consociation they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove to be a duty incumbent upon the Churches in <hi>New-England.</hi> I shall briefly weigh their Reasons.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>For</hi> 1. <hi>Communion of Churches being commanded, and Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation being but an Agreement to practise it, this must needs be a duty also,</hi> Psal.119.106. Nehem. 10.28,29.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It doth not necessarily follow, till they have proved that Consociation of Churches by a mutual and solemn Covenant is commanded, as Communion of Churches is. Nor do the Texts alledged prove it in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 106. <hi>David</hi> swore <hi>to keep Gods righteous judgements,</hi> and would <hi>perform it;</hi> because, though he was not bound to swear, yet he had voluntarily sworn it, and so was under a double bond to perform it: for, both his <hi>keeping Gods righteous judgements,</hi> and his <hi>performing that Vow,</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.11. 2. And his Vow was private, betwixt God and himself. Hence it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Churches are bound to consociate with a Vow or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, after the manner here described, which is not proved to be a duty, and may be unsafe for particular Churches. That Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.28,29. was their Church-covenant renewed and explained, and so was a mutual solemn Engagement, by <hi>entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Curse, and into an Oath</hi> (to which form we are not bound) and Church-covenanting is Gods Ordinance, <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 56.4, to 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 62.5. all which are Prophesies of the Churches under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. But between the covenanting of a Church within it self, and such a covenanting as this for the consociating of Churches, there are considerable differences. 1. <hi>Because this wants Warrant from the Scripture, which that hath; there being neither any Precept in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000078_0073_0F9F901BE966C528"/>
commanding it, nor any Pattern among the Primitive Churches, planted or approved by the Apostles, commanding it unto us. 2. Nor is there like Reason for such Consociation of Churches by a mutual and solemn Agreement or Covenant between Churches in a vicinity, as is for a Church-covenant within it self.</hi> For, the Church-covenant is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, because, without it, the ends of Church-fellowship can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained. For, 1. Each particular Church is a Spiritual Corporation; which therefore must receive its being from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Combination, or Foederal Engagement. 2. By virtue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they that had no natural impression to subject them to others, or to give them power over them, have mutual power each over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to command, &amp; constrain, as the case requires; of which power they could not have been made partakers without mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Engagement. 3. Hereby they come to enjoy such Spiritual and Ecclesiastick Priviledges unto which none can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without the approbation and allowance of the whole; which necessarily requires this Engagement to the whole, which is by Covenant. Thus Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> argues, to prove <hi>the necessity of a Church-covenant,</hi> Survey, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the ends of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> (which is mutual helpfulness by counsel) may be attained (without such a Consociation by mutual Engagement) <hi>by the Communion of Churches,</hi> which of it self, without any other Engagement, gives Churches a right and interest in another way mutually for their help by counsel, when their needs require it. The Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> have, by the blessing of Christ, found the benefit of the Communion of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for setling Truth and Peace among them, without such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,</hi> and may so still. 3. Such an <hi>Agreement between Churches</hi> will become a Snare unto them, by straitning them in the use and exercise of their Church-power within themselves, <hi>in re propr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

If thereby they stand bound under the fore-noted Penalty, to rest in, and practise according to the judgement and advice of such Churches, having sufficient light and consent within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without them. 3.

And is not this Consociation to be looked at as a Snare to the Churches? which 1. Transforms them from Congregational Churches into a Classical Church? And 2. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them under the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of that Classical Church? And 3. Without any warrant of Christs Institution?

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I grant, that the <hi>Synods Directions and Determinations, so farre as consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission.</hi> But what if the Members of Churches, to which they are sent, do not finde them consonant to the Word rightly understood and applied? Are they nevertheless still bound to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise according to <hi>the Synods Directions and Determinations,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Synod coucludeth that they are <hi>consonant to the Word?</hi> I suppose, no Orthodox Synod, in these times, will arrogate to it self such infallible Assistance, as <hi>the Apostles, being assembled with the Church at Jerusalem,</hi> had, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (though they argued and concluded onely from Scripture, yet that Council could not erre in their understanding and applying Scripture, having such guides as the Apostles were) but will confess that they may erre in their understanding and applying the Scriptures, whereupon they seem to ground their <hi>Directions and Determinations.</hi> And if so, it is the duty of every Church, and the Members thereof, to examine by the Scriptures whatsoever <hi>Direction or Determination</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Synod. If they finde that they are <hi>consonant to the Word of God,</hi> they are bound by Gods Authority to receive them <hi>with reverence and submission.</hi> It otherwise, <hi>we ought to obey God, rather then man,</hi> Acts 5. 29. 2. This power of the Synod (though they say it is <hi>but secondary,</hi> and that it is for their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Word, which is the principal ground thereof, and

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE SEVEN PROPOSITIONS Concluded by the SYNOD sitting at BOSTON, June 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1662.</head>
            <head>By the Reverend, Mr. NICHOLAS STREET, Teacher of the Church of Christ at New-haven.</head>
            <p n="1">I.THis Phrase, <hi>Members of the visible Church,</hi> in the first Proposition, I take to be explained in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Proposition.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By this Phrase in the second Proposition, <hi>Their Infant-seed,</hi> I suppose is meant onely their legitimate infant-seed, and is not to be extended to illegitimate children; against which a strong Argument may be gathered from <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The second Proposition doth seem to distinguish of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular Churches: Some are said to be <hi>Confederate visible Believers;</hi> whereby, I suppose, is meant, such as have immediately and personally taken hold of the Covenant themselves, both for themselves, and for their seed: for it is manifest, that it is spoken of such as are made contradistinct to an infant-seed, that cannot thus do. Some are said to be <hi>Their infant-seed,</hi> (i.) <hi>children in minority,</hi> &amp;c. And how come these to be Members? The last words in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position do shew; which are, <hi>Whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant:</hi> which doth imply at least, that they become Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in and by their next Parents covenanting for them. Hence the ground of the distinction of Membership into <hi>Immediate</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:000078_0081_0F9F902151BF26E0"/>
and <hi>Mediate</hi> is very clear. The Argument may be thus framed: Such as is the <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> for malis</hi> of the Membership, such is the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, so may it be distinguished and denominated. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, which is the <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> for malis</hi> of the Membership, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate in the Parent in the Childe mediate. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A difference in Membership is granted, both in this second Proposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some others after; and if this distinction to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the difference be not proper, let some better be laid down, that doth more aptly and fully suit the nature of the thing, and we shall receive it. In the mean time we shall hold to this, as conceiving, that the admitting of it would be a good means to preserve the Churches in purity, to prevent many unprofitable and uncomfortable disputes, and other great inconveniences, which, the rejecting of it will unavoidably make way unto.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This clause in the third Proposition, <hi>When grown up, are personally under the Which, Discipline and Government of the Church;</hi> had need be warily understood, and doth call for some clear expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation For, if it be meant that they are in the same way, and as fully under the <hi>Discipline and Government of the Church,</hi> as those who' in their own persons have taken hold of the Covenant, it cannot be assented unto: For then, in case of such delinquency, as doth call for Excommunication in another Member, they are formally to be Excommunicated. But this may not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Formal Excommunication doth not suit their state; they are within the Church onely <hi>mediately,</hi> by their Parents confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore are not to be cast out of the Church <hi>immediately and personally</hi> by formal Excommunication. 2. Besides, they are, in respect of strength, <hi>weak;</hi> and in respect of state, <hi>dead:</hi> especially being considered as in this third Proposition, <hi>without qualifications,</hi> even such as are mentioned in the fifth Proposition, which yet are <hi>separable from true and saving grace:</hi> They are too weak to bear the weight and strength of that Censure, which is <hi>mighty through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. it is to <hi>put new wine into old bottles,</hi> which Christ doth dislike in Spiritual matters, <hi>Mat.</hi>9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It seemeth to be very injurious to them, to lay them open to the highest Censure, and not to allow them proportionable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:000078_0082_0F9F902353D89100"/>
3. The main end of Excommunication, when it passeth upon such, is not like to be attained, which is, <hi>the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved,</hi> 1 Cor.5.5. The Ordinance doth suppose the Subject of it to be <hi>flesh and spirit;</hi> they who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as without qualifications to make them capable of Church-priviledges, as in this third Proposition, cannot be locked at as other then <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. In the fourth Proposition it is said, <hi>These adult persons are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion, because they are and continue Members, without such further qualifications as the Word of God requireth thereunto.</hi> But whether the children of such are to be baptized; or not, is not said; and it is necessary that it should have been expressed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the sense and meaning of the Synod might be rightly understood.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. To the fifth Proposition many things may be said.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Proposition may rationally be looked at, as holding forth the qualifications wanting to full Communion, mentioned in the fourth Proposition: And if so, then it will follow, that such as have these qualifications, have right to full Communion: if I miss it, I would be thankful to him that should shew me my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; if I am right, and do rightly express the sense of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, it were expedient that the Synod should plainly and fully express their meaning therein, to the understanding of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The qualifications are, <hi>Understanding the Doctrine of Faith, and professing their Assent thereunto; Not scandalous in life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is more required in a Church-member, even in point of knowledge, then to <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and assent thereunto.</hi> He ought, in a competent measure, to <hi>understand Church-Order and Discipline appointed by Christ,</hi> otherwise he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Covenant in judgement, or own the Covenant; neither doth he <hi>know how to behave himself in the House of God,</hi> as a Member thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devil doth <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and doth <hi>assent thereunto,</hi> Jam.2.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not scandalous in life,</hi> is wholly Negative, and may be said of irrational Animals. <hi>He</hi> onely <hi>that doth righteousness,</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, can be denominated <hi>righteous,</hi> 1 Joh.3.7.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:000078_0083_0F9F90250CC1B388"/>
4. Besides all these, there must be <hi>the work and grace of Faith</hi> held forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37, 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 31—34. before any medling with the Covenant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is said, <hi>And solemnly owning the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. The Scripture speaketh of <hi>Entring into a Covenant,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 12. of <hi>Making a Covenant with the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron.29.10. and, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.31. of <hi>Taking hold of the Covenant, Isa.</hi> 56 4. Now if their <hi>Owning the Covenant</hi> be the same; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, not onely their children are to be baptized, but themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to full Communion; if short, then it is a meer humane invention, not warranted by the Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Upon supposition, that the qualifications expressed be found in them, it is said, <hi>Their children are to be baptized.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first and second Propositions are against it. The first Proposition doth limit Baptism to <hi>the Members of the visible Church:</hi> The second Proposition doth explain who are meant by <hi>Members of the visible Church according to Scripture;</hi> 1. <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate visible Believers in particular Churches,</hi> (i.) such as have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally and immediately Confederated for themselves, as the last clause sheweth. And 2. <hi>Their Infant-seed,</hi> (i.) <hi>children in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</hi> Now these mentioned in the fifth Proposition, to whom Baptism is allowed, are neither the one nor the other. <hi> Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>grace of Faith is wanting,</hi> if there be no more then the qualifications before mentioned, and that is necessary to give their children right to Baptism, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38,39.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The children of such are not to be baptized, who themselves do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> under great offence visibly, and do not reform,</hi> Exod.20.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But so do these Parents, in not taking hold of the Covenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally and immediately, for themselves.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>It may easily and abundantly be proved, that such as have been baptized in the Church, and have lived under precious means and great light, untill they are Married, and have children, and all this while have neglected the main thing that doth concern them, which is <hi>to Believe,</hi> and upon their Believing, <hi>personally,</hi> and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to <hi>take hold of the Covenant,</hi> are under very great sin and offence. But I will onely use one Argument, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:000078_0084_0F9F902519D39668"/>
               <hi>Neglect of taking hold of the Covenant, or of entring into Covenant now under Christ and the Gospel, is as gross a neglect, as great a sin, as much displeasing to God, as was the neglect of Circumcision, the sign of the Covenant before Christ.</hi> Grounds of it are:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The thing it self is as weighty, that I say not, more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As fully under command as that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9,10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The neglect of it doth as necessarily and peremptorily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Gods highest displeasure, and everlasting destruction, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, as that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that neglect was gross, the sin great, and very displeasing to God, Gen.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24—26. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the children of such are to be baptized; if their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren again thus baptized, live to have children, themselves not <hi>personally taking hold of the Covenant,</hi> or not <hi>entring into Covenant,</hi> what shall become of them? shall they be baptized, or not?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If not;</hi> it is needful that it should be declared, that all may know where to stop, and to understand, that this Priviledge is not to exceed the <hi>Third Generation.</hi> Again, <hi>if not,</hi> it is strange that a childe should be begotten or born of a Member, and yet it self be no Member; or, if a Member, have no right to Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If so;</hi> it may be demanded, <hi>By what right?</hi> or, <hi>Where is the ground of their right to Baptism? Not in the Grandfather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Grandfather;</hi> that is generally disliked: and the second Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth limit it otherwise; but in <hi>the immediate Parent,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But, <hi>how is the right of these childrens Baptism founded upon him?</hi> Not upon <hi>his personal Confederating;</hi> for it is supposed there is none: Nor upon <hi>his owning the Covenant of his father;</hi> for his father made no Covenant: he did onely <hi>own the Covenant of his Parents,</hi> and that gave the right of Baptism to his children, as is held forth in the fifth Proposition. It remaineth therefore, that this Parent of the <hi>third Generation</hi> doth own what his Parent of the <hi>second Generation</hi> (he can go no higher) hath done, and <hi>what is that?</hi> He <hi>entred not into Covenant,</hi> but onely <hi>owned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that his father entred into.</hi> And thus these last children, who are of the <hi>fourth Generation,</hi> do come to have right to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, not by <hi>their Parents Confederation,</hi> as the <hi>second sort</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the second Proposition; nor by <hi>their Parents owning
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000078_0085_0F9F9025D0B8F9B0"/>
their fathers Covenant,</hi> as the <hi>third sort</hi> spoken of in the fifth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; but <hi>by these Parents</hi> (of the <hi>third Generation</hi>) <hi>owning their Parents</hi> of the <hi>second Generation) owing the Covenant of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> of the <hi>first.</hi> This seemeth to be an uncouth way, and very unpleasant Divinity.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The sixth Proposition I look at as an <hi>Exception</hi> to the fifth; otherwise it is cross unto it, and against it. To this I say,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e be any weight in the Arguments used under the <hi>sixth Consideration,</hi> against the baptizing of children, to whom the fifth Proposition doth allow Baptism; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they are likewise of force against the baptizing of children mentioned in this sixth Proposition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I cannot but take notice of the several sorts of Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, all giving right to Baptism: <hi>Two</hi> in the second Proposition, a <hi>Third</hi> in the fifth; a <hi>Fourth</hi> in the sixth: and if Membership, <hi>without personal Confederation by the seed of Confederate visible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> doth not end in the <hi>third Generation,</hi> then there is a <hi>Fifth,</hi> and a <hi>Sixth sort of Membership;</hi> and all these are differing one from the other. The two first are of God, and according to his Word, the rest are not.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The last Proposition seemeth to open a very wide gate in the Church, wider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
