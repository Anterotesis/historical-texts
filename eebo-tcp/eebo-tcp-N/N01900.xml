            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE new Method of receiving the Small-Pox by <hi>Inciſion</hi> (or <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> as 'tis commonly call'd) has been, you know, the Subject not only of plentiful Diſcourſe, but of angry Debate and fierce Contention among us in this Town. And it is a very unhappy Circumſtance attending us here, that almoſt every thing that is now done or doing among us, if it be at all of a publick nature, creates Heats and Animoſities. I am in hopes our good People will by and by be ſenſible of the folly and miſchief of this, and come to ſuch a Temper as will ſuffer them to <hi>differ</hi> from one another without being <hi>angry</hi> with one another. In the mean time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope that the People in other Towns where
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002247_0003_0FDAD97D8CEFFB30"/>
the Diſtemper has made its Entrance, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a better Temper, if any among them ſhould put this Method into Practice.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER ſome among us may appear againſt it out of Party and Prejudice, or make an <hi>Engine</hi> of it to ſerve Deſigns, not friendly to the Peace and true Intereſt of the Place, yet there are many who are <hi>Conſcientiouſly</hi> averſe to it, I believe; and, if theſe preſerve the <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom,</hi> they are (as a <hi>very Reverend Perſon</hi> has lately ſaid of them) greatly to be commended and honour'd in that they will not act againſt a doubting Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I perceive that the Scruples and Objections commonly offer'd by People here, have ſuch a force upon your Mind, as keeps you from going into this Method which may be your Safety and Preſervation. Now <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> (the Offices of which ſhould be ſacredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by us,) obliges me to attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and help you, in a Matter wherein your <hi>life,</hi> ſo precious in it ſelf, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly dear to me, is ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p>FOR Satisfaction about the <hi>Safety</hi> of this Method in an <hi>ordinary way of Providence,</hi> together with the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of it, I refer you to the <hi>Obſervations</hi> on it made and publiſh'd by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Colman;</hi> of the greateſt part of which Matters of Fact by him related, I have my ſelf been an Eye witneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002247_0004_0FDAD97F4D3E5D98"/>
BUT that which you want Satisfaction about is, the <hi>Scruples</hi> and Objections of a <hi>Conſcientious</hi> or Religious Nature, which are commonly offer'd by People againſt this Method, Theſe, I ſhall endeavour to anſwer and reſolve, as I am able, in a few words; and if they afford you any Light or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction reſpecting the ſame, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to whom you pleaſe; and if it ſhould be tho't worth while to make them public, I think none can cenſure me for ſtarting out of my Line, or medling with what is none of my Buſineſs, ſince the thing I am now upon relates to <hi>Religion and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE great thing urg'd againſt this Practice is, <hi>That it is not lawful for me to make my ſelf ſick when I am well: Or voluntarily to bring a Diſtemper upon my ſelf.</hi> To bring Sickneſs upon ones ſelf for its own ſake, is what no Man in his right wits would do. But to make my ſelf Sick in <hi>ſuch a way,</hi> as may probably ſerve my Health, and ſave my Life, and with ſuch a <hi>Deſign</hi> is certainly fitting and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore lawful. This is every day practis'd among People without any Scruple, in Purges and Vomits, and other things in Medical Uſe. Now, if I may lawfully make my ſelf Sick by taking ſomething in at my <hi>Mouth,</hi> why not by putting ſomething in at my <hi>Arm?</hi> Or, if I may lawfully make my ſelf Sick for <hi>one day,</hi> why not for <hi>two days,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002247_0005_0FDAD98087CBAAA0"/>
or more, as the Caſe may require? Aye, but this is to bring a <hi>Diſtemper</hi> upon my ſelf. I think it can <hi>hardly be call'd</hi> bringing it upon my ſelf, when the Caſe is ſo with me, (not having had the Diſtemper, and living in an infected Air) that I can't but expect to undergo it in a very little time. I know indeed GOD can preſerve me from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but when my Neighbours all round me are viſited, I know of no <hi>Warrant</hi> that any particular Perſon has to expect an <hi>extraordinary Preſervation.</hi> He that has no reaſon to think, but that he is as liable to the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> as other people are, and yet keeps in the Way of it, <hi>expecting that God will preſerve him untouch'd,</hi> however ſome may give it the Name of Truſt and Faith, and the like, I cannot but look upon it and call it <hi>Preſumption.</hi> In ſhort, I can't but think, when I am in ſuch Circumſtances, that I cannot <hi>rationally</hi> nor <hi>warrantably</hi> expect to eſcape the Diſtemper, it is <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> lawful for me to bring upon my ſelf a <hi>leſſer</hi> Degree of it, to prevent a <hi>greater.</hi> I'll put the Caſe thus, If I have not had the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there is in my body, what I'll call the <hi>Fuel</hi> of that Diſtemper, and there only wants the lighting of a <hi>Spark</hi> to ſet this Fuel on burning. The <hi>Air</hi> I breath in is full of theſe Sparks; and I may expect <hi>every Breath I fetch</hi> to draw ſome of them in: If now it appears upon daily Experience, that making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in my <hi>Arm,</hi> and letting the Spark in that way, the Fuel will burn with leſs fierceneſs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002247_0006_0FDAD9820A01E3C0"/>
and conſequently danger; why may'nt I take it in that way? Why muſt I needs ſtay till it come in at my <hi>Mouth</hi> or <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> or thro' ſome of the <hi>porous Parts</hi> of my body? For my part, I think the Law of <hi>Self-Preſervation,</hi> which is <hi>GOD's Law,</hi> requires me to take this Method of Safety, whereby (to uſe the apt Words of another,) the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is, thro' GOD's common Bleſſing, happily converted into a <hi>Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHAT then, will you not wait GOD's Time for it?</hi> They aſk. I think <hi>then is the Time</hi> Providence calls me to this Method of Safety, when I am in imminent and <hi>immediate</hi> danger of the Diſtemper the other way. Should any one go into the Practice of Inoculation, out of a fancy or <hi>Bravado,</hi> without his being in known hazard of the Diſtemper by the common way of Infection, I ſhould not think it warrantable. But <hi>then is GOD's time</hi> for us to uſe means of Safety, when we are in <hi>apparent danger</hi> of any deadly or deſtructive Evil.</p>
            <p>BUT then, 'tis aſk'd again, <hi>What can't you truſt GOD?</hi>—I ſuppoſe every body will allow that the Uſe of Means is not inconſiſtent with Truſt in GOD; and why there can't be Truſt in GOD in the Uſe of <hi>this</hi> means, as well as other, I cannot imagine. <hi>Why, it is a going from GOD to Man,</hi> ſome ſay. What then, can't we make Uſe of Men and Means in a time of danger without going from GOD? If any,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002247_0007_0FDAD98D18C4F910"/>
like <hi>Aſa,</hi> look to the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and <hi>not to the LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they are very irreligious and profane therein. But if any do <hi>principally</hi> and in the firſt place ſeek to GOD, may they not then innocently and lawfully make uſe of the <hi>beſt humane help</hi> the Providence of GOD affords them? I muſt profeſs and declare on the part of many of the Inoculated, that they and their Friends concern'd in them, have gone into the Practice with <hi>many Prayers</hi> to GOD, and other ſuitable expreſſions of <hi>Truſt and Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſtill ſome ſay, this Practiſe looks to them like <hi>taking God's Work out of His hand.</hi>—Indeed this Diſtemper can arreſt none without a Commiſſion from God. But yet it is not inflicted by God's <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand;</hi> we receive it in a <hi>natural way,</hi> and by means of <hi>ſecond Cauſes;</hi> and <hi>this we do in the Way of Inoculation,</hi> as well as of common Infection. If we have the Small Pox in either of theſe ways, it is ſtill the Work of God: For all ſecond Cauſes depend on and act under Him the firſt Cauſe. And, <hi>the Application of Means natural for this or that End, is it not an Application to the God of nature?</hi> If God does not co-operate by His <hi>actual Providence</hi> can the Effect be produc'd? For, <hi>who is he that ſaith, and it cometh paſs, when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> What is there of the hand or <hi>power of Man</hi> in this Work, after the Inciſion is made and the matter apply'd? The <hi>Work is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002247_0008_0FDAD98E13D80848"/>
ſtill left with God,</hi> and we muſt wait upon Him for His actual Influence and Bleſſing, even as the Huſbandman does for the Rain and Shines of Heaven, after the Seed is thrown into the Earth.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>the Small Pox is a Judgment of God, ſent to puniſh and humble us for our Sins; and what ſhall we ſo evade it, and think to turn it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us?</hi> I fully agree to it, that it is a ſore Judgment of God upon us for our Sins, which we have much deſerv'd: And it is greatly to be lamented that it has no better Effect upon the hearts of Men—. But is it Unlawful to uſe means for our Preſervation from a deſolating Judgment? <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> if at the very time that God ſends the Judgment, He ſhews us a way to eſcape the <hi>Extremity</hi> and Deſtruction at leaſt, if not the Touch of it. If a gracious God ſhews us ſo much <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as this under the Judgment, does it become us to <hi>put it away from our ſelves,</hi> or rather ſhould we not accept it with <hi>Adoring Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs?</hi> If this Town was to ſuffer an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation,</hi> that would be a more terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this, and we ſhould look upon it too as a righteous Puniſhment for our Sins; yet would any refuſe to make uſe of a <hi>Boat,</hi> or a <hi>Plank that might providentially come in his Way,</hi> thinking that to do it would be a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Evading the Judgment? <hi>I trow not,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, ſome have ſaid to me, <hi>This Method tends to take off the fears of this Diſtemper from the Minds of people; and who knows of what
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002247_0009_0FDAD98F9DDDA140"/>
Spiritual Advantage theſe fears might be to them?</hi> In Anſwer to it I aſk them, Whether GOD cannot make the <hi>Mercy</hi> of their Preſervation and Recovery in this Way of Spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them alſo, and by that <hi>lead them to Repentance?</hi> And, I truly hope, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD beſtow'd upon ſome in <hi>this way,</hi> as well as the other, will have a gracious ſanctifying Effect upon them, under the powerful working of the Spirit of Grace. I was glad to ſee the ſerious Frames <hi>ſome of them</hi> were in at the very time, how much affected they ſeem'd to be with the favour of GOD to them; what a good Profeſſion of holy Reſolution, ſome of them made.

            <p>SOME <hi>Object</hi> againſt the <hi>Practice</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Unhappy Conſequent</hi> of it among us; <hi>the Feuds and Contention, Sin and Miſchief that it has occaſion'd.</hi>—Of this, I hope, I am a mournful Spectator; And it has made me ſundry times ready to take up that Wiſh, <hi>Oh that I had Wings like a Dove!</hi> And I muſt freely declare, that I look upon that Spirit of Party and Diviſion that is reigning among us, to be a ſorer Judgment of GOD upon us, than the Diſtemper which has ſo diſtreſs'd us. But yet, I am far from thinking that the <hi>Badneſs</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> in it's ſelf is to be argu'd or infer'd from this <hi>Effect</hi> of it. For does
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002247_0010_0FDAD99410B396C8"/>
not the ſame Effect attend many other things unqueſtionably <hi>good</hi> in themſelves; ſuch as the building of Houſes for the Worſhip of GOD, the Choice of Miniſters, and of Perſons to ſerve in the State, &amp;c? Nay, the very preaching of the Goſpel in the World, tho' it be the Goſpel of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the Goſpel of <hi>Salvation</hi> too, has been, and is, <hi>accidentally,</hi> thro' the Corruption of Mens hearts, and under the Influence of the envious Enemy of Mankind, the Occaſion of all this; according as our Saviour has foretold that it would be, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Mat. 10. 34, 35. <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth: I came not to ſend Peace but a Sword. For I am come to ſet a Man at variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her Mother, and the Daughter-in-law againſt her Mother-in-law. And a Mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOME frame an Objection againſt this Practice from the <hi>Decrees of GOD.</hi> They ſay that <hi>GOD has predetermin'd and fixed the Period of every ones life, beyond which nothing ſhall protrect it; ſo that if this time be come Inoculation will not ſave the Perſons life.</hi> But this <hi>Argument</hi> may as well be urg'd againſt the Uſe of <hi>all Phyſick,</hi> nay even of <hi>Food,</hi> as againſt this Practice. I truly believe, as my Bible teaches me, that GOD has fix'd the Period of every ones life; but I alſo believe that He has done it with <hi>a Regard to Second Cauſes,</hi> or that Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which He has eſtabliſh'd; <hi>the End and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002247_0011_0FDAD9959AC52258"/>
Means are determin'd together.</hi> He that has fix'd in His own Counſel how long we ſhall live, has alſo determin'd that by ſuch and ſuch means our lives ſhall be continu'd to that Period of time. And how does any one know, but this is to be the <hi>appointed Means,</hi> of their Preſervation in life?</p>
            <p>SOME have ask'd <hi>Whether we could aſſure them their lives in this Way?</hi> It is ſtrange that any ſhould put the Queſtion! When there is none can give the Aſſurance of this <hi>not in the moſt innocent and common Means</hi> that are every day made uſe of: Why then ſhou'd they demand it in <hi>this?</hi> I know of one who died under a Vomit. Another, whom I alſo knew, died by pulling out a Tooth; the bleeding at the Gums after the Extraction of the Tooth could not be ſtopt, and in a few hours he died. And for my own part, as much as I am now for Inoculation, I am not at all ſhy to ſay, that a Perſon may miſcarry under it: For <hi>GOD is Sovereign,</hi> and will keep us in a dependance upon Him in the uſe of all Means. But if it be ſafe under the <hi>common Bleſſing</hi> of GOD, that is ſufficient to warrant me to venture upon it, when there is Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nay, if one in an hundred ſhould die in this way, while there is <hi>Demonſtration</hi> (as there <hi>then</hi> would be) that it is <hi>ten times</hi> as ſafe as the common way of infection. This, I humbly conceive, would be ſufficient to juſtify my going into it: Tho' I muſt confeſs, in this particular, I was once of another mind.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002247_0012_0FDAD99740E6D9A8"/>
BUT <hi>ſuppoſe I ſhould die in the way of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, would it not make a dying hour very dark to me, to think that I us'd means to bring it upon my ſelf?</hi> This is a Queſtion I muſt confeſs, has been the moſt <hi>affecting</hi> to me, of any that have related to this matter. But after the moſt ſerious conſideration I have beſtow'd upon it, I thus think; "If a Perſon ſhould die under Inoculation, he dies in the Uſe of the moſt <hi>likely</hi> means, he knew of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſave his life in a time of common peril; he dies <hi>then</hi> in the <hi>Way of Duty,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> in <hi>GOD's Way:</hi> If the Bleſſing is deny'd, he muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſign this his frail <hi>life</hi> unto the <hi>GOD of it, Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal Life.</hi>

            <p>THERE is one thing more ſaid againſt this Practice, which I am loth to take Notice of, becauſe of the—of it; but it being ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Mouths of People, I cannot but name it. 'Tis this, <hi>that it is originally from the Devil.</hi> Sure this is the effect of <hi>Tranſport,</hi> &amp;c. I will return a better anſwer to it than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. If it be a <hi>Method of Safety,</hi> and a <hi>Benefit to Mankind,</hi> as hitherto it appears to be, how came the Devil to be the Author of it? Was he ever a <hi>Benefactor</hi> to Mankind? No: But he is a <hi>Murderer from the beginning.</hi> Every Age of the World produces ſome <hi>new</hi> and uſeful Diſcoveries in one Profeſſion, Art and Science o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>AS to that Objection of the danger of others catching the Diſtemper of the Inoculated, there needs only this to be ſaid; That as 'tis to be ſuppos'd, the Practiſe will not be gone into till the danger of Infection becomes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a place, ſo there may be Methods eaſily taken to prevent its hazarding others that can't yet come into it. And I think there ought to be a prudent Care in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>THUS, <hi>my Friend,</hi> I have freely given you my Tho'ts about this Practice ſo <hi>much ſpoken; againſt.</hi> I muſt now leave you to judge for your ſelf; praying GOD to <hi>ſhew</hi> you <hi>his Way.</hi> If you come into the Practice, I know you will not do it in <hi>carnal Security;</hi> for that may provoke GOD to deny the Bleſſing. And, if GOD pleaſe to give it the deſir'd Succeſs, you'l religiouſly give Glory to Him, not only for delivering you from <hi>Death,</hi> but for ſaving you from ſuch a <hi>bed of Corruption,</hi> as others have many <hi>weariſome days and nights appointed</hi> them in; you'l think your ſelf the <hi>more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd</hi> to thank and praiſe your <hi>kind Phyſician,</hi> (I mean the <hi>Great One</hi>) who has wro't your Cure by ſo <hi>gentle</hi> a Method.</p>
