            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>CANDID READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> HAVING ſome time ago publiſhed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reſpecting the diſtinction of the Holy Ghoſt's bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from the common graces of the Spirit, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Moſes Brown, of Rhode-Iſland, charges me with the blunder, in ſaid letter, of endeavouring to make diſtinctions where the ſcriptures make none, and judges I have manifeſted partiality on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Upon which I would obſerve, as the beſt of men are but men at beſt, I do not pretend to ſee but in part, and underſtand but in part, and how far I have been partial or ſhall continue ſo, I am not, perhaps, ſo proper a judge, as the candid reader may be. I have not knowingly changed the ſenſe of any text I have quoted in my Letters, as I conceived of it. I have ſometimes added words explanatory of what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a text to mean. I deſire to be corrected in
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027695_0003_0FD5E17E2A9B1EA8"/>
any word or ſentence, wherein it appears I have erred. I would not knowingly juſtify a miſtake, becauſe I made it. I am not ſenſible of feeling a triumphant Spirit, as hinted by friend B. over any perſon or community that differ from me in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I fully believe there are numbers among different denominations who are for Chriſt, altho' they do not follow the baptiſt. Nor do I allow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to caſt reflections on any perſon, or community, but deſire to do as I would be done by.</p>
            <p>And although it is not agreeable to our feelings to be contradicted, it is not an unfriendly part, for one to try to convince another of his error, in a chriſtian manner. If any ſhould try, in ſuch a way, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, or prevent others from being miſled by me, I truſt I ſhall not think hard of it. I would obſerve concerning my mention of Barcklay, in my letter, I have heard friends mention, and quote him in ſuch ſort as gave me ſuſpicion that his authority with them was equal to the ſcriptures, if not ſuperior; although I did not ſuppoſe they were ſenſible of it. I have thought the ſame of others, reſpecting Calvin, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius and other great names which have been dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by their favourite followers; but I did not think ſo of all of any denomination: Neither would I be underſtood ſo to mean reſpecting the friends, but
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:027695_0004_0FD5E17FAA9B6110"/>
confeſs my expreſſion was made in too univerſal a manner, and I requeſt friend B. and all others, who have or may be offended with reading the expreſſion to forgive it. As it had no relation to the proof of what I was upon, had I not overlooked it, I ſhould have razed it; and deſire for the future it may be ſo conſidered. I am ſenſible he that undertakes to confute what he calls error, ſhould himſelf be a lover of truth and of mankind. What I have wrote in the following ſheets, I have wrote in the ſincerity of my conſcience, without any deſire either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with any who have written before me, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the more elaborate pains of any that ſhall come after me in this kind. If any reader is able to make it appear that I have contradicted the conſiſtent line of apoſtolic truth, either in the following ſheets, or what I have publiſhed heretofore reſpecting the Friends or Paedobaptiſts, inſtead of being offended, I truſt I ſhall thank him for his help provided he doth it in a chriſtian manner. I am ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of all human knowledge, and that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to aſcertain the exact ſenſe of ſome paſſages of the divine oracles. If any reader finds, by having further light than I have attained, that I have made any miſtake, I deſire his pity; and wherein he will ſhew me I have erred as a man, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027695_0005_0FD5E181945B9028"/>
he ſhall ſee that as a chriſtian, it was not my want of love to the truth, but want of light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, that miſled me. I pray the Father of lights, the author of truth, the giver of grace, may enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the mind of the reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diſtinguiſh the truth of God from the errors of men. That as a child of the true light, he may walk in the true faith and divine teaching of the Holy Spirit, in a conſtant courſe of holineſs, until he is made ready for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the ſaints in glory.</p>

               <hi>A SCRIPTURAL ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</hi> To the friends who have requeſted my thoughts on <hi>Moſes Brown's</hi> anſwer to my third letter, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptural account of the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and Fire.</head>
            <p>I HERE ſend you the obſervations I have made in the courſe of reading his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I judge the conſiſtent evidence of the holy ſcriptures, is the only rule to determine which is in the miſtake, he or myſelf. Friend B. ſays, I ſhall not find any of their men of note, or authors, who admit that it ever was a duty under the goſpel to be baptized in water, page 4. In the ſame page they allow, (as he ſaith) it was practiſed by ſome of the Apoſtles for a ſeaſon, as was circumciſion, &amp;c. but that it was ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined as a goſpel ordinance, they diſſent. He further, in the ſame page, conceives Paul was made able to ſee and diſtinguiſh between the preceeding diſpenſation of the law of John, and that of the goſpel, &amp;c. Hence it is evident, according to his and their opinion, that ſome of the Apoſtles, as well as the baptiſts, were in a miſtake in baptizing with water. In a word, Brown's ſuperſtructure, erected againſt my 3d. letter, is built upon two pillars, which if I can remove by fairly comparing expreſs ſciptures, it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027695_0007_0FD5E18A86FF90A0"/>
muſt ſurely fall. It is evident he holds John's miniſtry was a middle diſpenſation, between old and new teſtament times; or a ſecond law, after Moſes, before Chriſt; for he terms it the law of John, page 4. This I conceive to be his great eſſential pillar. The ſecond, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire, from the beſt light he has offered, page 9th, he ſays, <hi>"Through or by the baptiſmal influences of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, with which he will baptize his believing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and through the melting, humbling effects threof he will cleanſe, purify and fit them for himſelf."</hi> From which quotation, with ſome other words of like import, in his publication, I conceive he holds, as I obſerved in my 3d letter, that thoſe graces of the ſpirit, which have been experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by regenerate ſouls, from Abel's day until now are what the new teſtament means by ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual baptiſm. Now if I can make it appear by expreſs ſcripture texts, that his firſt pillar is groundleſs, and contrary to the ſcriptural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of John's miniſtry, and by a fair compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſundry texts, ſhew that thoſe graces of faith, repentance, love and humility, which have been commonly experienced by ſaints, ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt was named, are not once called baptiſm; and that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power from on high, the gift or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit on the day of Pentecoſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time; enabling unlearned men to ſpeak in the languages of all nations, is diſtinguiſhed by the name of the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt, the gift of the holy ghoſt, &amp;c. And that no other operation of the ſpirit is called by the word bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: Then it will appear the miſtake or blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027695_0008_0FD5E18BB2C734E0"/>
he has endeavoured to throw upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Friends; and what I publiſhed, is a ſcriptural truth. But how ſhall I prove it to a demonſtration? If I can bring a number of texts which expreſsly ſpeak concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of John, and declare he preached the kingdom of God, and that John's miniſtry was the beginning of the goſpel diſpenſation, will that prove friend B. is miſtaken in his opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning John's preceeding law? I truſt it will to every unprejudiced reader, whether it ſatisfies the friends or not. Our bleſſed Lord declares, Luke xvi. 16. the law and the prophets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til John; ſince that time the kingdom of God is preached, &amp;c. Matt. xi. 13. For all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the law propheſied until John, and in the foregoing verſe he ſays, from the days of John the baptiſt until now, &amp;c. Take notice, reader, from the days, not from the ending of the days of John. Which mode of expreſſion, hath reſpect to the days of a man's acting in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic life, and not to days after he is dead. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what friend B. calls the preceeding law of John, St. Mark expreſsly calls the beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God.— Thus it appears manifeſt by the expreſs account given by Jeſus Chriſt, and St. Mark, that John's miniſtry was no law preceeding the goſpel, but was in fact the beginning of the goſpel itſelf, if we credit the inſpired teſtimonies, rather than the friends opinion.</p>
            <p>The abſurdity, of holding John's miniſtry as a middle diſpenſation, is further manifeſt, if we do but conſider. The legal diſpenſation was founded upon the old covenant, and the goſpel
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027695_0009_0FD5E18D6796EEF8"/>
diſpenſation upon the new covenant, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the old and new teſtaments. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture further ſaith not, neither do they ſpeak one word of a middle covenant, between the law and the goſpel diſpenſations, to found a middle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation upon: conſequently there is no more foundation for the friends opinion, than to hold there is a middle teſtament between the old and the new. This great miſtake has led B. as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to pervert the true ſenſe of ſeveral texts, he has quoted, which I ſhall notice in their place.</p>
            <p>It is evident from Paul's teſtimony, in the viiith. and ixth. chapters of Heb. that the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative inſtitutions of the Jewiſh diſpenſation, were to laſt until the goſpel diſpenſation commenced, and no longer. The prophecies of Iſa. Mal. and others, foretold the events, that would introduce the beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.— Hence it is evident, when God began to bring to paſs what the Prophets foretold, then the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſpenſation did ſurely take place; and we have no other way to know, left on the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. It is further evident, the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſeveral particurlar events that would conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a ſpiritual diſpenſation; the fulfilment of ſaid events, began with the miniſtry of John Baptiſt; therefore his miniſtry was a new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment miniſtry. Witneſs, Chriſt's teſtimony of him, Matt. xi. 10. For this is he of whom it is written, refering to Mal. iii. 1. Behold I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, &amp;c. verſe 14th, and if you will receive it, this is Elias which was for to come, &amp;c. Zachariah under the influence of the holy ghoſt, gives in his witneſs, that John
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027695_0010_0FD5E18F8553EC10"/>
Baptiſt's miniſtry, was a new covenant miniſtry, Luke i. 76 and 77. And thou, child, ſhall be called the prophet of the higheſt; for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, &amp;c. To give knowledge of ſalvation unto his people, by the remiſſion of their ſins. Thus it is evident, John's miniſtry, was a miniſtry of repentance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins: and as much connected with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, as the repentance the Apoſtles were ſent to preach in Chriſt's name, among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Luke xxiv. 47. They were both preached for the remiſſion of ſins, being one ſort of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance under one and the ſame goſpel diſpenſation. Further, John's miniſtry was allowed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the miniſtry of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: This is evident by our Lord's preaching, Luke iv. 18, 19. From Iſa. lxi. Proclaiming liberty to captives, &amp;c. and the acceptable year of the Lord. This goſpel day or acceptable year of the Lord, if we believe Chriſt's expoſition, in his preaching concerning what it meant; Chriſt ſays, Luke iv. 21. This day, is this ſcripture fulfilled in your ears; which day B. with ſome Paedobaptiſts, hold, was before the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſo the reader muſt judge for himſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the goſpel was not only preached by Chriſt himſelf, while John's miniſtry continued, but he in the ſame time ſent out his Apoſtles; and they went through the towns preaching the goſpel, &amp;c. Luke ix. It is evident, as words can expreſs it, that Chriſt the King, was perſonally among them, they were told by the heavenly voice, when he came up out of the water of Jordan, to hear him. His diſciples, the ſubjects of his kingdom were with him; and the laws of Chriſt, were taught
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027695_0011_0FD5E1940F73BFE0"/>
them; no Mountain or Temple enjoined where they muſt repair to worſhip God, but the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Jordan or Enon, or elſewhere they might ſpiritually worſhip him, who is the great ſupreme ſpirit. This was the tenor of the doctrine, taught in the time when friend B. and ſome Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts fancied there was a ſort of middle diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or John's diſpenſation. Thus I have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en abundant ſcripture proof, that the miniſtry of John and Chriſt, were each a new teſtament min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, and under the goſpel diſpenſation. Thus it is evident, the ordinance of water baptiſm, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered by John and Chriſt's diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, was a goſpel ordinance. It ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated in the council of God from heaven, and there is not one hint in the ſcripture, of its being any law of John. Hence it appears, by a fair quotation and compariſon of expreſs ſcriptures, that friend Brown's firſt pillar is removed, and his idea of John's being a law giver, and his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry being a law diſpenſation, I conceive is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſcriptural and imaginary. Friend B. calls John's diſpenſation, a baptiſmal diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, page 8. It is evident he means water baptiſm; and where as I have plainly ſhewn by a number of expreſs texts, it was a goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, therefore water baptiſm is a goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Friend Brown's ſecond pillar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, if I underſtand him, in making out that there is no diſtinction between the melting, humbling, cleanſing or purifying effects of the ſpirit, fitting believers for himſelf, and the holy ghoſt baptiſm. Now if I can ſhew by a fair compariſon of ſcriptures, that a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027695_0012_0FD5E195721A3BA0"/>
believers had all he deſcribes long before the miraculous gift of the holy ghoſt (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire) came upon them, then it will evidently appear that the ſcriptures make a real diſtinction between the humbling and cleanſing effects of the holy ſpirit, and that miraculous gift and power from on high, called the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire.</p>
            <p>But ſince I ſo particularly pointed out a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of expreſs texts, in my 3d letter, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſcriptural inſtances, wherein the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the apoſtles have made, is as plain to be diſtinguiſhed in their writings, as a man's eyes that you look on, is to be diſtinguiſhed from his noſe or mouth, or other features of his face, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all belong to one and the ſame head.— I therefore refer the reader to the 3d letter of my firſt publication, and ſhall only notice that it is evident, John xv. 3. Chriſt ſays to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, now ye are clean through the word I have ſpoken unto you; abide in me, and I in you, &amp;c. From which it is evident they then poſſeſſed the cleanſing and purifying effects of the ſpirit of truth, which friend B. calls baptiſm; and it is equally true that notwithſtanding this purifying, cleanſing effect of the ſpirit, they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Luke xxiv. 49. to tarry at Jeruſalem until they were endued with power from on high. What this power means you may ſee, Acts i. 8. But ye ſhall receive power after the holy ghoſt is come upon you, &amp;c. which plainly ſhews they did not poſſeſs that power when Chriſt aſcended out of their ſight; but in Acts ii. 3.4. we have this power of the holy ghoſt deſcribed. And there
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027695_0013_0FD5E196E9ABB980"/>
appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire, and it ſet upon each of them, and they were all filled with the holy ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, &amp;c. This was the fulfilment of what John Baptiſt told the Jews, Mat. iii. 11. and as he was Chriſt's firſt miniſter under the goſpel diſpenſation, ſo he was the firſt that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this divine miraculous gift and power of the holy ghoſt, by its name, baptiſm of the holy ghoſt, &amp;c. And this diſtinction is particularly made in a number of places in the apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. And friend B. I conceive, might as well have ſaid, there is no diſtinction between the operation of the ſpirit, ſpoken of in 1 Cor. xii. that enabled one to work a miracle that could not foretell things to come; and another to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things to come, but could not work a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Paul was inſpired to diſtinguiſh the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent operations, and call them diverſities of gifts, although it was performed by the agency of one and the ſame ſpirit; and the diſtinction of the gift of the holy ghoſt, the power from on high which enabled thoſe poſſeſſed of it to ſpeak with tongues, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire, is as expreſsly and particularly diſtinguiſhed from the other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of the ſpirit, as any account of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the gifts of the ſpirit recorded in the new teſtament. Thus it is evident from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs teſtimony of the Apoſtles, that friend Brown's ſecond pillar has no ſcripture teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>Brown has made, I conceive, an artful cant upon my words, in page 11, and repreſents the matter in ſuch a light, as to ſignify, if I can't prove wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027695_0014_0FD5E198A5AE0AB8"/>
baptiſm from the commiſſion, Mat. xxviii. I ſeem to doubt of my cauſe. See his obſervation page 22, and all he has produced to prove that ſaid commiſſion means ſpiritual baptiſm, is ſuppoſing that upon his aſcenſion he put an end to what he calls figures, and that water is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, nor the Trinity named when the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle baptized with water.</p>
            <p>If we conſult the Apoſtles account concerning their commiſſion, Mat. xxviii. we ſhall find it was only renewed with ſome enlargements, and orders to proclaim and teach all nations, inſtead of being confined to the cities of Iſrael. He hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them the ſame in ſubſtance, ſoon after he had called them, viz. in the time of friend Brown's middle diſpenſation, witneſs Luke vi. 13. He choſe twelve whom alſo he named Apoſtles, ix. 1, 2. then he called his twelve diſciples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diſeaſes. And he ſent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the ſick; verſe 6, and they departed and went through the towns, preaching the goſpel and healing every where. Luke ſpeaking of the ſame commiſſion as Mat. xxviii. ſays xxiv. 47. and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations. Mark deſcribes it exactly xvi. 15. agreeable to the forecited Luke ix. 6. preach the goſpel to every creature; excepting the enlargement of their travel. Hence it is evident as words can well expreſs it, that Chriſt, after his reſurrection, only renewed the Apoſtles commiſſion, and enlarged its extent to all the world, as to baptizing with water although it is not mentioned when the
<pb n="16"
                   facs="unknown:027695_0015_0FD5E19D59E50B28"

commiſſion was firſt given; yet as they did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with water (for the holy ghoſt baptiſm was not yet given to any) read John iii. 22. After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them and baptized, and John alſo was baptizing in Enon, &amp;c. If we compare this aſſertion, with the 1ſt and 2d verſes of the next chapter iv. we ſhall find it was by his diſciples that Jeſus bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. I ſaid in my 3d letter, by his licence which appears a ſelf evident truth; for as they did baptize, unleſs John has given us a falſe account, for how could it be ſaid Jeſus tarried with them, viz. his diſciples and baptized though Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf baptized not, but his diſciples, unleſs the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did it by his command or licence; if he had not licenſed them to baptize, it would be falſe for John to ſay Jeſus baptized; it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably ſure therefore, at Chriſt's command or licenſe, or there doth not appear ſenſe or truth in the texts. Whether Jeſus baptized by his diſciples, more than John, as the Phariſees had heard, is not the point diſputed. John iii. 22. ſays, Jeſus tarried with them, viz, his diſciples and baptized which is proof enough. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Mat. xxviii. although no water is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with the word baptizing; yet as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame original authority, that it did when firſt given, Luke ix. and being directed to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſinners, calling for the ſame ſort of repentance towards God, and ſaith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is evident our Lord refers them in Mat. xxviii. to what he had informed them when he firſt gave them their commiſſion, recorded in Luke ix. when he ſays, Mat. xxviii. 20. Teaching them to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027695_0016_0FD5E19E647918E0"/>
obſerve all things whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you; and lo I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. He doth not ſay whatſoever I now command you, or ſhall command you when you are baptized with the holy ghoſt and fire; but the words are expreſsly, whatſoever I have commanded you. Thus, from the ſeveral expreſs texts I have quoted and compared, which refer to the very point diſputed, it is ſelf-evident, that the goſpel diſpenſation and water baptiſm, to believers, were in being, under the perſonal miniſtry of Chriſt, and were intended to be continued by his order, forecited Mat. xxviii. 20. even to the end of the world. For there is no diſpenſation ſpoken of, to take place after the goſpel diſpenſation began until thoſe who were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, live again, to reign with Chriſt, &amp;c. Neither have we any account in the new teſtament, of any way to plant goſpel churches, until the forecited reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but to enjoin upon all that profeſs their faith in Chriſt, to be baptized in water, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and in breaking of bread, &amp;c. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtles directions and examples, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Friend B. while he is artfully critical to diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of my adding one word as explanatory of the ſenſe of a text, can boldly ſay, this and that is thus and ſo, without giving any proof, but as be takes it to mean ſo; and becauſe the name of the Trinity is mentioned in Mat. xxviii. B. dares to ſay the Apoſtles in baptizing with water, did not go by that commiſſion; which is his ſay ſo but not proved. Becauſe as for naming the
<pb n="18"
                   facs="unknown:027695_0017_0FD5E1A3A23022E0"

Trinity in baptiſm, it doth not appear that Chriſt commanded it as a form of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſpeech, in the adminiſtration of any ſort of baptiſm. If it was, he will be equally ſilenced to ſhew one inſtance of ſuch a form, reſpecting ſpiritual baptiſm, as of water. I conceive, therefore, if any one thinks that Matthew and others were too brief in tneir account of the point diſputed, the ſubſequent practice of the Apoſtles, in their preaching and baptizing, and gathering churches, muſt be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the beſt and only explanation of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's law and commiſſion, Luke ix. Mat. xxviii. and other places. If we compare what they ſaid and practiſed after they received the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their commiſſion, with the account they gave us before it is manifeſt that they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, when they named the Lord Jeſus, for in him dwelt the fulneſs of the Godhead bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. It is evident from the account given of Peter's teaching the 3000, that he kept his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's commiſſion, to teach all nations, firſt, and when they were taught the goſpel, and enquired what they ſhould do, Peter informs them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins: and then promiſed them the gift of the holy ghoſt. And the general account of all the churches planted by the Apoſtles, runs in the ſame line. Who can poſſibly imagine the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles did not underſtand their commiſſion, firſt to teach and then baptize with water, when they ſo univerſally practiſed it, and never left us a hint of its coming to an end until teaching and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the goſpel ſhould come to an end; but
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:027695_0018_0FD5E1A46E693DA8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
poſſitively enjoined upon churches to keep the ordinances as they delivered them, without one hint to ſupport friend Brown's ideas of the matter. For it is evident, that either the Apoſtles were not guided into all truth reſpecting what they ſhould teach, as Chriſt promiſed they ſhould be, or elſe they were not faithful to reveal it to the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their writings; for no man that is not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prejudice, can think, by what the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles have enjoined, in their planting of churches, but that it was duty for believers to be baptized in water, upon their profeſſing their faith in Chriſt; and if their enjoining ſuch a practiſe was a miſtake, as friend B. would have it, it is evident they did not only live and die in the miſtake, but enjoined their miſtakes as a duty, without diſtinction, to be regarded as long as their teſtimony is to be believed and obeyed, which is even to the end of the world. Thus, I conceive I am conſiſtent, in claiming the baptizing in Mat. xxviii. to include water baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I would alſo remark reſpecting the miſtaken ſenſe B. puts upon a ſentence he has extracted out of Paul's writings, 1 Cor. i. where he ſays, <hi>"Paul declares he was not ſent to baptize with water, as the context ſhews; but to preach the goſpel"</hi> He has aſſerted the context ſhews it, but has offered nothing to manifeſt how the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text ſhews it. I ſuppoſe he meant, if others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the context in the light he conceives of it. If I may give my opinion of the forecited text and context, with my reaſons, gathered by comparing it with other parts of Paul's writings, I will convey my ideas in general, by a ſimile, reſpecting the ordinance of marriage. Then by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027695_0019_0FD5E1A7886ABD48"/>
comparing ſeveral parts of Paul's ſame epiſtle, I will endeavour to demonſtrate to every candid reader, that although Paul was primarily ſent to preach the goſpel, he had alſo a right, by virtue of his commiſſion as an Apoſtle, to baptize in water, ſuch as profeſſed to believe the goſpel he preached. Suppoſe a baptiſt ſociety ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the church to which I belong, to ſend me as an ordained Elder, to preach the goſpel among them. Accordingly I am ſent, and while la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring among them, there was many married in that place. A few couples deſired me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ordinance of marriage to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I did. In proceſs of time, a great contention aroſe among them concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of marriage. Some held, if he who made the hearts of men, let any ſingle male and female, fall in love with each other, it was of the virtue and power of the Lord, and their mutual love, and a ſecret agreement, was marriage; deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any outward ceremony or publickly promiſing to prove true to each other, as huſband and wife, before the head of any religious community, church officer, or magiſtrate, and ſaid that viſible marriage was no duty under the goſpel diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; giving this reaſon, viz. that what ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have of the marriage in Cana, John ii. and of our Lord's directions, Luke xiv. how to behave when invited to a wedding, although it evidently implied it was done in a publick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yet it was in the time of John's diſpenſation, but not enjoined by the goſpel, &amp;c. Others held it valid, or not, according as who married them; ſome holding it ſhould be a miniſter, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a juſtice of the peace, &amp;c. They ſeemed to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027695_0020_0FD5E1A78E8C8490"/>
become carnal in their contentions, and I not knowing what length their confuſion might carry them, I wrote an epiſtle to rectify their miſtakes, and fearing thoſe few I had married, might ſay I married them in my own name, and by my own authority, I wrote to them among other things, that I thanked God I had married but a few couples of them; and gave my reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, viz. leſt they ſhould ſay I married them in my own name, and then add for the church ſent me not to marry but to preach the goſpel. Would it hence juſtly follow, that I had no right by my office to marry, becauſe I was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſent to preach the goſpel: no, by no means. I have a right as a church officer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter all new teſtament ordinances to which I am regularly called. St. Paul had a right to adminiſter water baptiſm to believers, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Lord's Supper; which he repeatedly did, and ſaid he received it from the Lord; as I ſhall now proceed to prove. It is evident from the 11 verſe of the context, Paul was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the houſe of Chloe, of the unhappy divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among ſome of the Corinthian brethren, and that Paul was too much dignified by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaying, I am of Paul, &amp;c. And it is equally evident why Paul thanked God he baptized no more of thoſe contending brethren, was, leſt they ſhould ſay he had baptized them in his own name; for the preaching of the goſpel was his main errand, not baptizing, which others admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered that were not Apoſtles. If we read Acts xviii. we ſhall find Paul taught the word of God among thoſe Corinthians one year and ſix months; in which time many believed and were baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027695_0021_0FD5CD34D810CFF8"/>
and a goſpel church planted, a number of which believers Paul baptized himſelf; as the 1ſt of the epiſtle manifeſts. In the xith. of the fame epiſtle, it appears ſome of thoſe brethren had got into errors about eating the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſome walked orderly and praiſe-worthy. Therefore to give each one his portion in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Paul praiſes the orderly walkers; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for what, viz. That ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. He then proceeds to give ſome new directions concerning the conduct of the ſiſters. Then ſharply reproves the diſorderly partaking of the Lord's ſupper among ſome of them; and reinjoins it, as it ſhould be performed, charging them to examine themſelves, and ſo eat it, &amp;c. To aſſert his authority, he ſays, ver. 23d. I have received of the Lord that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I delivered unto you, &amp;c. And gave the ſame account of this ordinance under the goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, that we are told by the Evangeliſts, was given them by our Lord, in the time of Brown's middle diſpenſation. Even the ſame night in which he was betrayed, ſays the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, ſo ſays Paul. If thoſe ordinances of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper were at an end with the miniſtry of John, how could Paul ſay, I received of the Lord what I delivered unto you; unleſs the ordinances he delivered them were to be enjoined to the Gentiles under the goſpel diſpenſation. I conceive it is impoſſible to evade the force of Paul's teſtimony, forecited, and hold him to be a man of truth. Thus it is evident, from the miſtaken ſenſe B. puts upon Paul's words, 1 Cor. i. he is led to ſay, page 6.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027695_0022_0FD5E1AA92589C08"/>
that whatever was of water baptiſm in the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles days, was from John, and not from our Lord. Paul ſays, in the xith of the ſame epiſtle, he received what he enjoined upon them from the Lord. So the reader muſt judge which is miſtaken, Paul or Brown. Thus Shepard ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, upon ſolemn reflection, Paul had directions from the Lord to enjoin outward ordinances to poſterity, to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>I would obſerve that friend B. ſays, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Peter in his 1ſt epiſtle iii. 21 means ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual baptiſm; where he ſays, the like figure whereunto even baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience toward God, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. It put me in mind of his obſervation upon the force of the bias of education, &amp;c. page 4, which is often too true. He thinks I want correction, being too apt to annex the idea of water to the word bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, &amp;c. whether it means ſo or not, as I take it. Whether friend B. is in danger of annexing the idea of ſpirit, or ſpiritual, to the word baptiſm, whether it means ſo or not; and whether he has any prepoſſeſſion that wants correction or not, I muſt ſubmit to the judgment of the candid reader. I underſtand the text refers to the Apoſtolic water baptiſm. Friend B. has offered no proof or reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the judgment of Benjamin Wallin and his own. I offer the following reaſons for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my opinion of the text. It is evident that our Lord Jeſus did not underſtand that the filth of the fleſh, of the hands or face, or other parts of the ſkin, which the Phariſees were ſo careful to keep clean, was in a goſpel, religious
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027695_0023_0FD5E1B15C1E0750"/>
ſenſe, to take away the filth of the fleſh: but it conſiſted in what is taught us, 2 Cor. vii. 1. Having, &amp;c. theſe promiſes, &amp;c. let us cleanſe ourſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh &amp;c. James i. 21. wherefore lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, &amp;c. It is evident that theſe two forementioned texts mean the renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, cleanſing, humbling influences of the word and ſpirit, received in the ſoul by faith, by which the believer crucifies his affections to the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life; all this is effected by the ſpirit of faith; witneſs Peter's teſtimony, Acts xv. 9. And made no difference between us (Jews) and them (Gentiles) purifying their hearts by faith. Theſe operations are what friend B. calls ſpiritual bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and ſays it cleanſes, purifies, &amp;c. What? The ſoul that experiences this faith, from the filthineſs of the fleſh? Peter ſays, of the baptiſm in the forecited text, not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in doing as Peter commanded the 3000, repent and be baptized every one of you, &amp;c. as I underſtand it. And I think it is ſelf evident from friend Brown's definition of ſpiritual bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that it does put away the filth of the fleſh, in a religious ſenſe; and I hold that a true faith, or what the Apoſtle calls the ſpirit of faith, doth put away the filth, and purify the heart of the believer from all his idols. But the ſcriptures do not call the ſpirit of faith, nor the grace of humility or repentance, by the name of baptiſm. Hence it is certain from friend Brown's own account of ſpiritual baptiſm, that Peter muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to water baptiſm; for that doth not put away
<pb n="25"
                   facs="unknown:027695_0024_0FD5E1B43724FD38"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
the filth of the fleſh, that is, as before proved, the pollution of ſin; but a true believer is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and ſenſibly ſaved, by keeping faith, when he is poſſeſſed of it, and a good conſcience, in obeying the commands of the goſpel; a part of which commands, is, that when we believe the apoſtolic doctrine, to repent and be baptized in water, and then remain ſtedfaſt in ſaid doctrine and the fellowſhip of the ſaints, in breaking of bread and prayers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The laſt text friend B. mentions, that I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect he judges much to purpoſe is 1 Cor. xii. 13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit. This text he thinks is ſo much to his purpoſe, that it will determine which is miſtaken the Friends or Shepard. I conceive he meant, if every body underſtands it as he does. This, he ſays, is an expreſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the contrary of Shepard's poſition. If ſo, it is no wonder he ſet conſiderable by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

He ſeems to manifeſt an Ideal triumph, that he has found one text, that he thinks is expreſs to his purpoſe, and ſeems to jeer me for not recollecting the text, and wraps it up with the reſt of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, concluding in his laſt page, my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance deſerves more ſevere treatment, than he has

given it. Perhaps it would not have been amiſs for friend B. to have recollected a caution of wiſe Solomon, Prov. xviii. 17. He that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt; but his neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him. Friend B. it ſeems had no ſooner found a text which he thought would do for a handle, but he fixes a ſcourge to it, and began to whip me, ſtripe upon ſtripe. It puts me in mind how St. Paul was once ſerved, Acts xxii. They ſeverely ſcourged him; and on the morrow held a court upon him to know what he had done. So friend B. having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded I could not anſwer his text had I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it, although he has offerd no parallel text to prove he has got the true ſenſe of it; neither can he find one in the bible, I conceive, to juſtify his ſenſe of it; he has therefore made up the lack as well as he could by quoting a famous baptiſt writer's opinion in his favour; which is no further proof than that there is another man of his opinion. Friend B. further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the text makes it evident that the words, ſpiritual baptiſm, mean ſomething, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that I ſcruple whether it means any thing, and muſt have loſt my firſt love, (if ever I had any) before I could fall into ſuch a blunder. As Paul once thought he ought to do many things, which after he was converted he was convinced was wrong, and had he known better he would not have done; ſo, I conceive friend B. thinks as he ſays, and his reflections do not offend me. If I may be allowed, the day after my ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to anſwer for my ſelf. I would ſay, I hold the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire to be a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027695_0026_0FD5E1BB81F7EBE8"/>
very great ſomething. I view it a great bleſſing to men that God dignified them above all the animal creation, by giving them one language by which they could communicate their thoughts one to another. I view it a judgment for their tranſgreſſion, that their language was confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby the family of our father Adam got divided. I view it one of the greateſt acts of Godlike power, recorded in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God, to prove the certainty of Chriſt being his ſon from heaven, and his word and that of his inſpired apoſtles, being the word of life. After ſaid apoſtles had got all the graces implanted in them, that friend B. calls ſpiritual baptiſm, God endowed them with a miraculous power from on high, called the baptiſm of the holy ghoſt and fire: and by way of eminence, above many other operations of the ſpirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the gift of the Holy Ghoſt &amp;c. By which diſtinguiſhed gift from all other oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the ſpirit the poor ignorant diſciples (as to letter learning) were enabled to preach the glad-tidings of Jeſus, to every nation under heaven; and thoſe nations heard them in their own tongues. Thus God removed the confuſion of languages, at that time, which, I conceive was a great ſomething, and thus I held it in my 3d letter.</p>
            <p>But the words, ſpiritual baptiſm, are not put together in the new-teſtament by any inſpired witneſs: neither are faith, love, repentance, ſanctification or humility, ſeperately, or all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, once called ſpiritual baptiſm. Therefore I ſaid, if the words, ſpiritual baptiſm, mean
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027695_0027_0FD5E1C078C22AA8"/>
any thing, it is the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and fire, and if they do not mean ſo, there is no meaning to them, when put together. The word, ſpirit, means ſomething ſtanding alone, and baptiſm means ſomething alone; and when they are properly put with other words, they mean different things: but put them together without any other words, and if they don't mean what I ſaid, there is no meaning beſide that I know of. Thus I have anſwered, that the reader may underſtand, I hold the baptiſm of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, to be a very great operation, above many other operations ſpoken of in the holy ſcriptures. So great an operation that I never found any chriſtian in my knowledge, however bleſt with faith, holineſs, and humility, with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er graces of the ſpirit, that could prove to me, by any marks given in ſcripture, that he had the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, any more than he poſſeſſed power to raiſe the dead.</p>
            <p>In a word, friend Brown's ideas and mine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer primarily in this. Friend B. holds the ſpirit of faith and the graces of repentance, humility, holineſs, &amp;c. are what the ſcriptures mean by the baptiſm of the ſpirit, as he phraſes it, if I underſtand him. I hold that every ſaint, from righteous Abel to this day, has experienced theſe graces, in their meaſure, or they are not ſaints; but theſe were poſſeſſed by the apoſtles, before ever they were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt; as I have already proved by expreſs ſcripture. Therefore being a true beleiver, and a holy, humble chriſtian, is not hinted in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027695_0028_0FD5E1C32A2DBEA8"/>
any one inſtance; but is an unſcriptural wrong idea, and leads the mind into unſcriptural prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. The friends are thereby led into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of water baptiſm, when they believe, and other outward ordinances; contrary to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the apoſtolic churches. And a number of paedobaptiſts, notwithſtanding the ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency they manifeſt, will ſay when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupport their infant rantiſm, they truſt they are baptized with the ſpirit, and ſhall get to heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, &amp;c. when they mean no more than that they believe in Jeſus Chriſt; which, if true, is the very qualification for goſpel ordinances. Having made theſe remarks to clear up what I meant about the words, ſpiritual baptiſm, not knowing where to bring it in with more brevity, I will return to enquire what appears to be the conſiſtent, ſcriptural meaning of the forecited text, 1 Cor. xii. 13.</p>
            <p>If the reader will take notice of what I have obſerved upon the xith chap. of his ſame Epiſtle, he will find I have expreſsly demonſtrated, by comparing ſeveral parts of the chap. with the xviiith of Acts, that water baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper was adminiſtered by Paul, and that he had enjoined outward ordinances upon this very church, declaring he received it from the Lord; even what he enjoined to them. Now for Paul to declare all this, and in the next chap. xii. of this ſame epiſtle, to flatly deny or contradict all he had ſaid about outward ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the foregoing chapter, is ſo barefaced an inconſiſtency, that no man can believe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concluding Paul did not know what he was
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027695_0029_0FD5E1C4A8226DE8"/>
writing of. I ſay it is ſelf evident thoſe words cannot be underſtood in friend B's ſenſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Paul contradict himſelf, and aſſert that which is inconſiſtent with all the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that ſpeak of the ſame matter throughout the new-teſtament. And if another meaning of his favourite text, can be made to appear conſiſtent with what Paul ſaid in the foregoing chap. and manifeſts a natural and eaſy ſenſe, agreeable to the Apoſtles account of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and planting churches, who can heſitate to embrace it?</p>
            <p>Hence it is evident, we muſt underſtand the word, baptized, in the 13th verſe of the xiith chap. conſiſtent with what Paul ſaid in the xith chapter foregoing. And whereas the Friends, with B. think ſaid text is ſo much to their purpoſe; and a number of other denomations ſeem to be in the dark reſpecting its meaning; I will endeavour to ſhew, agreeably to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that there is a two fold ſenſe that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered conſiſtent with the text and context, and coincides with the foregoing chap. xi, with the whole of the Apoſtolic account of the baptiſm both of water and of the Holy Ghoſt and fire; and exactly agrees with Shepard's poſition. It is evident that Paul, in ſpeaking of the ſpiritual gifts, in his introduction of ſaid xiith chap. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the leaſt common meaſure of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, common to every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that has a muſtard ſeed grain of true ſaith; when he ſays, verſe 3, no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt. If we conſider the Apoſtle in the 13th verſe as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027695_0030_0FD5E1CE1AD66C20"/>
refering to the common meaſures, or gifts of the ſpirit, in calling and confeſſing Jeſus to be Lord, which confeſſion the Apoſtles required of every one they baptized with water; then there is an eaſy and ſcriptural ſenſe, the text may be underſtood to mean, if we do but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures ſpeak of the ſpirit of council, Iſa. xi. 2. of the ſpirit of grace, Zech. xii. 10. of the ſpirit of Faith. 2 Cor. iv. chap. 13. we having the ſame ſpirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: we alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak the ſame ſpirit of faith by which David ſpake, Pſa. cxvi. Paul ſays they ſpake this ſame ſpirit of faith, ſo much ſpoken of from the time that Abel thereby found acceptance with God, to the laſt accounts in the new-teſtament. This ſame ſpirit of faith, by which Enoch walked with God, and Noah was ſaved from the flood; by which Abraham offered up Iſaac, and Moſes forſook Egypt; by which David, Samuel and all the Prophets manifeſted their obedience to the commands of God. All the new-teſtament ſaints ſpoken of, were juſtified from all things they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes. By which the Corinthian Gentiles were turned from their Idolatries, to obey the goſpel preached by Paul; and by which Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, bond and free, that were made partakers of this one ſpirit, of faith, were brought into fellowſhip with the Father, with Jeſus Chriſt, and with one another, and willingly ſubjected themſelves to one and the ſame viſible order of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027695_0031_0FD5E1CE2282A3F8"/>
Chriſt's houſe, as enjoined by the Apoſtles. By this one ſpirit of faith, I underſtand they who were made partakers of it and confeſſed Jeſus to be Lord, were baptized in water into one viſible body, as brethren, and did through the viſible cup that Paul bleſſed, and told the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians was the communion of the blood of Chriſt, drink into one ſpirit of love; for this ſpirit of faith works by love and purifies the heart. I mean as many as ſtood right, for they are the perſons Paul diſcribes. This ſenſe ſtands agreeable to the whole account, given of the firſt planting of the Corinthian church, and ſhews conſiſtency with Paul's praiſing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly brethren, for keeping the ordinances as he delivered them under the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider the 13 verſe to refer to the miraculous gift of the holy Ghoſt baptiſm, ſpeaking with tongues, &amp;c. which Jews and Parthians, Medes and Elamites, bond and free were baptized with, at Jeruſalem, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles at the houſe of Cornelius: with many of the firſt converts in different places, upon the firſt ſpreading of the goſpel; it abundantly proves Shepard's poſition and ſhews Brown's miſtake, in holding it the one baptiſm which remains to the chriſtians, to the end of the world. For we know of no ſuch baptiſm, ſince miracles have ceaſed in the church. Neither can any man upon earth, however holy and humble, ſhew he is poſſeſſed of what the new-teſtament calls the Holy Ghoſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, any more than a man pretending to have the gift of miracles in our day: but cannot
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027695_0032_0FD5E1CFEBFCE510"/>
prove it by working any wonder, in healing the ſick or any thing elſe. This baptiſm with other miraculous gifts of the ſpirit have long ceaſed. But the faith by which we can call Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, with hope and charity abideth with chriſtians, to the end of the world: as Paul informs us in the next chap. xiii. of the ſame Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>But to hold it to be the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and that all true chriſtians experience it, and that the outward ordinances are null and void, as friend B. underſtands it, is ſuch a plain contradiction, and manifeſt inconſiſtency, that I conceive it is impoſſible to reconcile his ſenſe of it, with the foregoing chap. xi. reſpecting the outward ordinances Paul had enjoined upon them by revelation from the Lord, allowing he ſpake the truth. If friend B. can reconcile theſe inconſiſtencies, by a fair compariſon of ſcriptures, let it be made manifeſt for my help and others. Until ſome further light appears from the revealed word of inſpiration, and from the ſpirit of God, opening up the word (for I hold the ſpirit never teacheth contrary to the revealed word) it muſt appear to every unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, underſtanding perſon, by what Paul has declared, that he had it from the Lord to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver outward ordinances to the Gentiles, to whom God ſent him, when he had inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally turned them from darkneſs to light, and they had become obedient to his directions.</p>
            <p>Thus I have offered my opinion, with my ſcriptural reaſons for holding it to be the duty of believers in theſe days, to be baptized in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027695_0033_0FD5E1D16DE63E80"/>
and to remain ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers, according to the directions of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. And I conceive it muſt appear to every reader who is not biaſed with prejudice, that there is a conſiſtent line in the manner of my expounding the ſeveral texts which friend B. underſtands makes againſt me, in reſpect of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. I have, by a number of expreſs texts, proved the unſcriptural abſurdity of holding a middle diſpenſation, or conſidering John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt as a Law giver. I have ſhewn a clear ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſtinction between faith, holineſs, humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, &amp;c. and the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and fire. And I conceive it appears conſiſtent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, that I have ſaid that there is one Lord, viz. Jeſus Chriſt, the great object of faith. There is one faith which I have deſcribed my ideas of, by which, as many as partook of it were made willing to ſubmit to the laws of the new-teſtament, as ſoon as made known to them.— And there is one baptiſm recorded in the new-teſtament, viz. water baptiſm, that the Apoſtles enjoined upon ſuch, and only ſuch as profeſſed to have the one faith, in the one Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The view of the Apoſtles account, as I have conſidered it, runs conſiſtent in their planting of goſpel churches, both at Jeruſalem and among the Gentiles, as far as the new-teſtament gives us a particular account. Therefore as I believe they were endowed with the baptiſm of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the power from on high, to guide them into all the truth neceſſary to teach believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all nations what to believe, and what to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027695_0034_0FD5E1D336645CB8"/>
practice; I find that they, in ſubſtance, taught nothing but what Moſes and the Prophets ſaid ſhould come Therefore I am bound to regard the law and teſtimony, according to the light given me by the ſpirit: and if any man ſpeaks contrary to the plain, conſiſtent line of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired witneſſes, ſo far I muſt hold him in an error; rather than take up with the fineſt miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſoning of any man, ſuppoſing himſelf fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with more ſpiritual light than ſome of the enſpired Apoſtles; and at the ſame time is obliged, in order to eſtabliſh his own opinion concerning new-teſtament ordinances, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſome of the Apoſtles, who were moſt bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in converting ſouls, were in an error in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their converts what to do, &amp;c. As for inſtance, Peter, if friend Brown's ideas are juſt, was in a miſtake in his directions (although he had been preaching the moſt powerful goſpel ſermon, as to its effects, that we ever heard of, and under the influence of the Holy Ghoſt,) when he bid the 3000 repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins. Acts ii. 38. This friend B. holds was an error, if I underſtand him. — Philip, although ſent by the ſpirit to join the Eunuch's chariot, Acts viii. 29. and directed by an Angel how to find him, ver. 26. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Eunuch's converſion, and aſking what hindred his being baptized, Philip told him if he believed with all his heart Jeſus was the Chriſt, he might be baptized in that certain water. This was an error according to friend Brown's opinion; likewiſe his baptizing both men and women who received the word at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027695_0035_0FD5E1DE94FB8948"/>
was another error. Peter, according to B. and his friends' opinion, made a greater blunder, and his error ſeemed to be more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated at the houſe of Cornelius, Acts x. than at Jeruſalem, Acts ii. For after they that heard his word were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt; Peter, doubtleſs, fearing an objection from his Jewiſh brethren that attended him from Joppa, becauſe the new converts were uncircumciſed Gentiles, ſaid, can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commands them to be baptized, &amp;c. by water baptiſm.— This was, in Brown's opinion, another error.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, reader, the great difference between Brown's reaſonings and Peter's. B. ſays the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt baptiſm is the only baptiſm under the goſpel diſpenſation, and that water never was a duty under ſaid diſpenſation. Peter reaſons in perfect contraſt to B. and commanded obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by being baptized in water, for the very reaſon that B. thinks they ought not. So the reader muſt judge which is in the miſtake, the inſpired Apoſtle or friend Brown.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſome of the Apoſtles, who were the moſt bleſſed, and owned by God in converting of ſouls and planting of goſpel churches; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to friend Brown's opinion, went blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering about among the nations directing ſome of their converts to do wrong, viz. in being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in water; and commanding others to do that which friend B. holds was not right to be done under the goſpel diſpenſation. If I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him: ſo the reader muſt judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:027695_0036_0FD5E1E150025F98"/>I would further obſerve, our Lord informs his Apoſtles, that the ſpirit of truth would guide them into all truth, John xvi. In the 1ſt epiſtle of John iv. it is written, we, (viz. the Apoſtles) are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us, &amp;c.— The Apoſtle Paul, ſays, Heb. xiii. 7. Remember them which have the rule over you, &amp;c. viz. your guides the Apoſtles. It is evident from theſe texts, that chriſtians had no rule of faith and worſhip in the Apoſtolic age, beſide that which they received from our Lord and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired witneſſes. Which rule is tranſmitted to us in the writings of the new-teſtament, and is ſufficient now for the regulation of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt; if it was then. If any further light and regulations had been neceſſary, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what to believe, or what to do upon our believing; I conceive, it will follow of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable conſequence; that neither our Lord who gave himſelf for the church, nor the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles who lived and died in the ſervice of it, have fully taken care to inſtruct churches reſpecting duty, but have left their work as it were to the halves, and left others to finiſh and perfect it; or rather that we have no certain rule at all.— To cloſe, in a word, I would have my brethren retaliate friend Brown's kindneſs, in ſending me one of his books. I never ſaw his face in the fleſh, nor is it likely I ever ſhall, but I can heartily ſay, I wiſh him and all my antagoniſts, a part of that eternal ſalvation, which I hope through grace to partake of myſelf.</p>
            <p>When I enter my cloſet and have ſhut my door, I can repeat my requeſt, to him who ſeeth
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027695_0037_0FD5E1E5B3D950C0"/>
in ſecret; that that divine compaſſion, which forgave Job and his friends, (reſpecting their diſpute) may forgive me, and thoſe who have wrote againſt what I have publiſhed, wherein we have not ſpoken the things that are right.— AMEN.</p>
