            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſubordination of events, and of things, for the purpoſe of illuſtrating objects more noble, is acknowledged in the ſeveral branches of ethics and of philoſophy. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of every name, in ancient and in mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times, hath choſen to illuſtrate her myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, through the medium of ſubordinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. That revealed religion ſhould have choſen this mode of communication is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſurpriſe. It needed things viſible and material, through which to communicate, and by which to illuſtrate her hidden myſteries. The unfolding of theſe myſteries hath given honorable employment to the pen of the learned, and poured unction upon the tongue of the eloquent, in every age.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the accomodation of giving em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; the uſe of figures, as ſubordinate expreſſions of immaterial realities, hath been of high moment; affording a mode of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication which, always kept the learner, at a diſtance from the inſtructor. The uſe of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035127_0004_1000C02705A6BF30"/>figures, by men, in early days aroſe from as imitation of the copy, given, in leſſons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtruction.</p>
            <p>BOTH natural and revealed religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their indebtedneſs to figures. The former draws its inſtruction, and maintains its propoſitions by an immediate appeal to viſible objects. It declares from the things that are made, and from the events which revolve, that the inviſible hand is ſeen. This revealed religion doth not deny. Giving, however, the preference to the written word, it points to the works of creation and to the events of Providence, as ſubordinate, yet confirming teſtimonials of the truths, it hath, in the fairer pages of inſpiration, already received. And whilſt this general doctrine is received, the well inſtructed and philoſophic chriſtian, with great delight, diſtributes wiſdom, from the correſpondency he diſcerns, between things ſeen by the natural eye, and things taught in the ſacred page. This correſpondency ſeen and illuſtrated, mightily confirms the duplex operation of the Creators hand. Whilſt he is teaching, to the ſons of men, leſſons of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from a view of things that are made; the believer is delighted to hear of the ſame truths, delivered, with confirming, and all conquering evidence, at the feet of our Goſpel Gamaliel.</p>
            <p>STILL the moſt ſtrenuous, in defence of revealed religion, are by no means deprived of the ſources of inquiry, from which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain employment, and from which to draw
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035127_0005_1000C029EC38ADC0"/>leſſons of inſtruction which figurative objects give. Theſe figures are ſtrowed, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe hand, throughout the ſacred page, as well as through the works of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE writer, from whoſe pen, fell the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage before us, was, at this moment, buſying himſelf with figurative language and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive things. His deſign was to illuſtrate the nature of the Moſaic economy as a figure. He inſiſts on its conſummation; proves its ſubordination to the Goſpel Temple which was now to be ſet up, and before which, this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Moſes was to fade as the morning ſtar withdraws, as the day dawns, and the ſun ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. This ſubordination is argued from the inferiority of Moſes the Builder, to the Son the Proprietor. The fidelity of the greater in the higher order is inſiſted on, and illuſtrated by the faithfulneſs of Moſes, in the figure.— "For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moſes inaſmuch, as he who hath builded the houſe hath more honor than the houſe: For every houſe is builded by ſome man, but he that built all things is GOD."</p>
            <p>THESE general obſervations, on the SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORDINATION of things material, to things immaterial; of things viſible to things inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are deſigned to prepare the mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the wiſdom of GOD, in marking out, and the perſeverence of men in going through with the ſubordinate labor of the MASON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IC BUILDING, thus far</p>
            <p>To a mind, acknowledging GOD in all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035127_0006_1000ADA70C9DCC20"/>parts of Creation's Temple, it is no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to diſcern that the order of FREE and ACCEPTED MASONS, holds a place in conformity to the general plan, than that the economy of Moſes maintained a ſubordinate relation to good things, then to come. All the difficulty of ſuch application will ariſe from the limitation of Providence. The Chriſtian, too confined, in his views, is but too ready to exclude from the parental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, all things which fall not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Chriſtian revelation. He forgets that a mode of revelation is maintained, through all Creation's works by figures, and by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; by relations and correſpondencies, ſo that though to Adam and Eve only, the revelation, primarily be made, the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, of the ſeveral parts, will bring all their poſterity within the limits of the original and all-wiſe deſign.</p>
            <p>To purſue the trackleſs path; to explore the deep things of GOD, in the beautious and majeſtic varieties, in which the proportions of beneficence are meaſured out, on the one part, and with ſolemn and awful ſtep to follow the diverſified courſes of nightly ſhade, through the borders of Iſhmael; calls for ſtrength of mind, and perſeverance in labor, of which the ableſt of the philoſophic chriſtian, or Maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic fraternity might be happy to boaſt.</p>
            <p>WHAT the tabernacle of Moſes was to the Temple of Solomon: and what the Temple of Solomon was to the Goſpel Edifice; the ſame is the MASONIC TEMPLE to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035127_0007_1000C02E767F37B8"/>building of GOD. The former fell, more immediately, within the limits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion; the latter illuſtrates the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of GOD in a viſible figure; inviting chriſtianity to come and reconcile her taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and her book, and her whole ſervice, thro' the blood of the croſs. This maſonry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, in the ſummit of her order, whilſt ſhe extends the myſterious figure of the croſs, and ſhews her ſeal upon the Miditerranean paſs.</p>
            <p>ALL the diverſified edifices of natural, and of revealed religion, in theſe united orders are founded upon one and the ſame plan, and tend to one and the ſame end. I ſpeak of chriſtians and of maſons who underſtand, and in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, perform the duties of their order.—Under this character, the ſubordinate build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in both relations are like the diverſified ſynagogues of Paleſtine; all built upon the plan of the Temple of GOD, at Jeruſalem.—The Supreme Architect, through whoſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, natural religion teacheth us to walk, is the ſame that walks amidſt the Golden Cand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſticks of the chriſtian and maſonic building. And when the naturaliſt ſhall be called to behold, and made to underſtand the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondecy between theſe two buildings, whoſe worſhippers have not heretofore acknowledged each other, he ſhall be made to own the hand of GOD, as well to be ſeen in our temple as in his own; and falling down, ſhall own of a truth that the GOD, whom he hath, ignorantly worſhipped, the ſame declare we unto him.—He ſhall borrow a lamp from our Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, with which to enlighten his own ſoul.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035127_0008_1000C03151706E88"/>to enlighten his faternity, and to illuminate the whole building of GOD.</p>
            <p>LET our ſubject, in your name, even now reach him this lamp! Let it tell him, that whilſt he raiſes his tube; and the philoſophic eye glances at the ſun, and ſays; "ſee yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the PROUD LUMINARY, from whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine effulgence all creation receives its life;" the eloquence of revelation, gently whiſpers, true is the ſtory which phyloſophy teaches, but ſeeſt thou not, by the aid of the glaſs, the ſpots in the face of yonder Sun?—What can this expreſs but the imperfection of the creature, in compariſon with GOD the creator. "The LORD GOD is a Sun!—in him there is Light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all!" Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to ſprinkle thy optics with the pearly drops of Celeſtial dew; and thou ſhalt behold every object to ſhine, with ſevenfold luſtre.</p>
            <p>LOOK at the Moon! She borrows her rays from the fountain of lights, the Sun: thus ſhines our IMMANUEL in the mediatorial fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. He ſheds his milder rays upon the benighted family of mankind; and ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a benign dominion whilſt the Fathers glory is withdrawn.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD, the Stars! aſſiſting reflections, aiding to diſplay in their ſparkling luſtre, the milder influences of redeeming love! To whom are theſe ſubordinate Luminaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, but to him that "walketh in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks, and who holdeth the ſtars in his right hand!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035127_0009_1000C03379CC7688"/>
LOOK at yonder blaizing ſtar, or firey meteor; heated by its late approach to the FOUNTAIN of LIGHT, now ſtretches its way acroſs the firmament, as though deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enliven the frozen regions of the North! What is this but a viſible, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate illuſtration of thoſe miniſters of GOD, who like John the baptiſt, and other burning and ſhining lights, labor to ſtrike "freſh fire into the frozen hearts of the obdurate; or like the ANGEL that "flies through the Heavens, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach," commands the ſons of men, at the down-fall of myſtical Babylon, "to fear GOD, and to give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come!"</p>
            <p>THE air we breathe, is the ſpiritual breath of the living ſoul; the clouds which intercept our ſight; the clouds of darkneſs which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, paſs over, and render obſcure the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the phyloſophic, or ſpiritual mind!—and and the diverſity and impetuoſity of the winds, the inſcrutible operations of GOD, both the natural, intellectual, and moral world!</p>
            <p>THE genial aſpect of a delightful day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the benignity of GOD; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the ſoul walking in the lights of his reconciled countenance.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035127_0010_1000C03630B21C38"/>the Mediator's realms; waiting till the keen reſearch of the philoſophic eye ſhall unfold more perfectly the univerſal volume; it may be preſumed that theſe hints will ſuffice to diſplay to the intelligent, that the volume of creation preſents, in its material pages, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred tranſcript of what, in fairer lines, is written in Revelation's ſacred page.</p>
            <p>THIS point granted; the brethren of the ancient and honorable ſociety of Free and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Maſons will not think it derogating from the rank due to their order, if it be ſaid, that what Melchezideck of old, that king of Salem was, in relation to our goſpel Melchez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ideck; the ſame is the Temple of Solomon, in relation to the Temple in which a greater than Solomon remains to be ſealed. And if Abraham, returning from the ſlaughter of the kings, paid tythes to this man, and received bleſſings from him; will you be backward to lay the implements of your labor at the threſhold of the Heavenly Melchezidick, that you may receive the bleſſings of his hand?—If the tabernacle of Moſes was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, that the Temple of Solomon might be ſet up; and eventually, the Temple of Solomon removed to give place to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, yet imperfect edifice of the preſent goſpel building, may it not be expected, that the unfiniſhed building, in which, now, you labor, may be removed, perhaps perfected in the light of the more perfect edifice of the latter day? If ſo, as of the temple of the believing ſoul, ſo may not ye ſay? "we know that if the earthly houſe of our tabernacle be

The ſucceeding temple will diſplay the GOLDEN AGE of ancient fable: the "new Heavens and the new Earth" of the Revelations of St. John: and the CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESTIAL LODGE which your craft hath long been laboring to find!</p>
            <p>SUCH confidence is placed in your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that it is preſumed little more need be ſaid, to obtain your confidence, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the evidence which the flaſhings of light are capable to afford.</p>
            <p>LET it, then, be underſtood that whilſt in the divine mind, the plan of the Great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect exiſted, and was continually opening itſelf; from the beginning, to the experience of an aſtoinſhed world, it was GOD's good pleaſure to illuſtrate this deſign, and to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify this work, in the viſible and perpetual modification, which, at your hands he hath ordained to be preſerved. Your order hath been, and ſtill exiſts, as a living hiſtory of the inviſible agency of GOD, in mortal things.—You have been long laboring; but have nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as yet, arrived at perfection in your arts; nor have you been able to finiſh the building whoſe foundation was laid nearly ſix thouſand years ago!—nor will the building ever be finiſhed, or the key-ſtone placed, until you ſee that in its preſent ſtage, the building on which you labor is an imperfect thing; and can have its conſummation, only, in the advancing grade of the mighty deſign. One ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>To illuſtrate this doctrine, as far as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of myſtery will admit; be it known, that on board of your ſhip are fragments of the antideluvian, of the patriarchal, of the Moſaic, and the chriſtian world. All theſe you have to empty forth, at the door of the all-perfect economy of the milennial eſtate. The truth of this poſition, as matter of fact is ſeen, whilſt, in the order of your edifice, you glance at the BOW, whoſe pillars reſt in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clouds; denoting the transfer of the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant to ages, then unborn; or the extention of its influence far as the clouds do fly! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an appeal to the altar of ſacrifice of Noah, deſcending, with his charge from the ark—to the rod of Moſes upon the Egypt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian hoſt—and to the reſurrection of him of whom Moſes and the prophets did write; and finally to the ſtation of him who blows the JUBILEE TRUMP: that the ſcriptures may be fulfilled, at the conſummation of your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſaying, throughout the prophetic Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, "now is come ſalvation and glory and honor, and the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his CHRIST.</p>
            <p>WHEN to this ſcene, you ſhall have ſurrend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the ſacred ſymbols committed to your charge; the ſun ſhall be in its full radiance—the moon ſhall wax and wane no more—the

            <p>BESIDES theſe treaſures, peculiar to the volume and ſpirit of revelation; your myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries receive additional grandeur, from the claſs of inſtruction in which the mixed objects of natural and of reveraled religion are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined.

See a demonſtration of this in the mixed character of your brotherhood. At the threſhold of nature's God ſome bow; whilſt, at the door of the chriſtian altar, alone, another will pay his homage!</p>

            <p>THE anſwer muſt be, no where ſir! But
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035127_0027_1000C05556ABB218"/>we underſtand there are Occult lodges; Hidden, Stolen, Runaway, Baſtardized lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in which things have been done, not favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the preſent ſyſtems of religion and of government, in the European world! what then, ſirs!—will you agree to the anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of the chriſtian religion, becauſe popery, with its horns, and the receſſes of monks, Occult lodges, have taken occaſion to ſprout out of it? on ſuch principles, you ought long ago, to have entered your proteſt againſt the worſhip of GOD, in Jeruſalem; becauſe there were Calves, Occult lodges, at Dan and at Bethel! you ought to have ſtruck down the temple of Solomon; becauſe a mongrel race, built a counterfeit one on mount Gerizim!— In a word our goſpel temples, blaſphemed by the proud infidel, long ago, ought to have been taken down, as Occult lodges, becauſe, the the pulpit hath been uſed for other purpoſes, than the propagation of the principles of the peaceful kingdom of the prince of peace!</p>
            <p>THESE complainers, had better ſwell a gentle note, than to claſs the many reſpectable characters which compoſe this honorable ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, into one body of common infidels; to cry out, pointing to them all, or even to any in this country—Infidels!—illuminati!—occult lodges!—&amp;c. &amp;c.—This clamor hath been heard, with patience, thus far; but the noiſe continued, the indignation may burſt forth!</p>
            <p>STILL, in a word, to repel with ſoftneſs, the fire of the ignorant and contemptuous foe; let it be ſaid that the abetting of Infidel,

Let oppoſition fall before the mighty weight of irreſiſtable truth!</p>

Is this temple, intellectual workſhop, raiſing its tubes, increaſing in its numbers, and in its exertions in the proſpect of a brighter day; of a more perfect illumination; ſo, it is with the preſent imperfect economy of the goſpel building.—Greater light, both ſocieties, yea, all creation is looking for, and greater light all ſhall receive.—Towards the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things, the principals, of both our buildings, as well as the order of events teach us to look.

The enſign of the croſs, and the ſeal upon his paſs, ſhall enable him to ſtrike down his foes, and to bar the gates of the impaſſable gulph: for Death and Hell are conquered in his behalf, by the Great Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Houſe!</p>
