            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>"THE Church of England is, in its Conſtitution, Epiſcopal. It is, in ſome Plantations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly the eſtabliſhed Church; in the reſt are many Congregations adhering to it; and through the late Extention of the Britiſh Dominions, and the Influence of other cauſes, it is likely that there will be more. All Members of every Church are, according to the Principles of Liberty, intitled to every Part of what they conceive to be the Benefits of it, entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, ſo far as conſiſts with the Welfare of civil Government; yet the Members of our Church in America do not thus enjoy its Benefits, having no Proteſtant Biſhop within 3000 Miles of them; a Caſe, which never had its Parallel before in the Chriſtian World."</p>

            <p>THE Author of the following <hi>Defence</hi> begs Leave to inform his Readers, that it was his Deſign not to reply to the Writers againſt the <hi>Appeal,</hi> until they ſhould have offered all they had to ſay upon the Subject, as he intended his Defence ſhould be general. With this View he continued long ſilent, waiting patiently for his Turn to be heard, and expecting that a Year's Oppoſition and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe would ſatisfy his moſt zealous Adverſaries. But before the Year was compleated, he was called upon by ſome of his Friends, and told, that many were impatient to ſee the <hi>general Defence</hi> that had been promiſed, and that to wait any longer upon the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig,</hi> who diſcovered no Signs of coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Concluſion, would be conſidered as a Piece of very needleſs Complaiſance—eſpecially as it was pretty well known what he could ſay, from what he had ſaid in near <hi>50</hi> Papers, and as an <hi>Anſwerer</hi> was ready to reply to every Thing worthy of Notice that he ſhould ſay. Upon this Repreſentation the Author proceeded to prepare the following Sheets. He ſoon found that his chief Difficulty would conſiſt, in confining a Reply to ſo many Particulars within a moderate Number of Pages. This Difficulty he counteracted as much as he could, conſiſtently with his Intention of doing Juſtice to himſelf and his Cauſe; but ſtill he is much diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the <hi>Length</hi> of his Performance, which he hopes may be forgiven him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:011203_0004_0F94F93954484A90"/>THE Author conſiders it as his Misfortune that he is brought into ſuch a Diſpute, in this turbulent Seaſon. While the Minds of Men are agitated with Conteſts and Jealouſies about political Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, it is not a Time to enter into Controverſies relating to Matters of Religion. It may be ſaid, who but the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> has introduced the Controverſy about American Biſhops? He confeſſes he has occaſioned it; but he is not convinced that he has given any juſt Cauſe for the Out-Cry that has been made. He meant no Injury to any human Creature, and foreſaw no Oppoſition to what he knew was, in its Nature and Intention, altogether harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive. Moreover, when the <hi>Appeal</hi> was drawn up, the Coloniſts were in high good Humor; and when it was publiſhed, he was not apprehenſive of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diſcontent that ſoon followed. Conſcious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his Innocence in this Reſpect, he doubts not but the ſober and candid will acquit him; and as to the Cenſure or Condemnation of others, although he could wiſh to avoid it, it will not greatly diſtreſs him.</p>
            <p>THE Writers againſt the <hi>Appeal</hi> have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avail themſelves of the preſent Troubles; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting that the Taxation of the Colonies, and the Propoſal of ſending Biſhops to America, are Parts of one general Syſtem; and that the latter is as unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our religious, as the former is to our political, Privileges. But their Succeſs appears to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to their Wiſhes. Very few, it is thought, have been ſo far blinded as not to ſee, that, although theſe Things, in the preſent Controverſy, have been art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blended together, <hi>they have in Reality no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Connection.</hi> And it is well known, that the Diſſenters in general would not anſwer to this Spur, when it was cloſely applied to them, in ſeveral Counties, in the late Elections.</p>

            <head>Introductory Obſervations.</head>
            <p>IT is common for thoſe who are engaged in public Diſputes, to profeſs their Averſion to Controverſy. If this Profeſſion were needful, I could make it with great Truth and Sincerity. For my natural Diſpoſition inclines me to comply with, and conform to, the Sentiments of others, as far as I can conſiſtently, and with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, rather than to oppoſe them. To this Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, however, I find that my preſent Situation is very unfavourable; ſince it obliges me to enter into a publick Debate;—a Debate which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be of long Continuance,—and with a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Opponents at the ſame Time,—eſpecially with <hi>ſuch</hi> Opponents as have hitherto exhibited, in Oppoſition to the <hi>Appeal to the Publick in Behalf of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in</hi> America.</p>
            <p>WHEN this well-meant <hi>Appeal</hi> was made, the Propoſal for an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE as therein explained, appeared to me to be ſo reaſonable, and intirely unexceptionable, that I could <hi>then</hi> as eaſily believe that the Diſſenters in this Country, who of late Years had diſclaimed the Principles of Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nce, would generouſly and publickly declare their Approbation of our Plan, as that they would oppoſe it with Violence. But knowing that I might poſſibly be biaſſed in my Judgment, and that Things might not appear to others in the ſame Light wherein I viewed them myſelf; I intimated (<hi>Page</hi> 2) my Readineſs to attend any Objectors,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011203_0012_0F94F940812428F8"/>
that might ariſe, in a <hi>fair and candid</hi> Debate; and requeſted (<hi>Page</hi> 118) that they would propoſe their Objections,
<q>in ſuch a charitable and Chriſtian Way, that <hi>I</hi> might be the better for them, and <hi>They</hi> not the worſe.</q>
A Debate has been brought on; how 'fair and candid' on the Part of my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, the impartial Reader can judge:—Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been offered; but whether
<q>in ſuch a charitable and Chriſtian Way</q>,
that the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors 'are not the worſe for them', a ſmall Degree of Self-Examination will enable them beſt to judge for themſelves.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I reply to the <hi>Particulars</hi> objected, it may be proper to make a few general <hi>Introductory</hi> Obſervations, relating chiefly to the <hi>Manner</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have been oppoſed; which has been different from what, in my humble Conception, I had a Right to expect, in theſe ſeveral Reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Appeal</hi> was a <hi>ſerious</hi> Performance, and its general Subject confeſſedly of Importance, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Anſwers, if any, ought to have been given it. But it may be ſaid of ſome of my Opponents, that inſtead of giving ſerious Anſwers, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to place the whole Matter in Diſpute in a ludicrous Light, and have condeſcended to act the Part of <hi>Buffoons,</hi> for the Amuſement, rather than of <hi>ſober Reaſoners,</hi> for the Inſtruction, of the good-natured Reader:—That, inſtead of applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fairly to convince the Judgment, they have uſed all their Addreſs to engage the Prejudices, and inflame the Paſſions, of the Populace, againſt the Reſidence of Biſhops in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:011203_0013_0F94F9412B0C8DB8"/>2. In Order thereto, the propoſed Epiſcopate has been groſsly miſrepreſented, the <hi>Appeal</hi> has been perverted, and the Author and his Friends abuſed, with an unſparing Hand. If the Plan for the Settlement of Biſhops in <hi>America,</hi> as publiſhed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> was inconſiſtent with the Rights or Liberties of any Denomination of Chriſtians, its Inconſiſtency ſhould have been fairly pointed out; and if this had been done with Temper and Decency, it would have had ſo much the greater Effect, with all reaſonable and conſiderate Perſons. But every one can ſee that this has not been done; and it is one of the firſt Obſervations that muſt occur to the Reader, that the Epiſcopate of my Opponents, is not the Epiſcopate of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> The Character aſſumed by them requires them to oppoſe the <hi>latter</hi>; whereas they have impoſed upon their Readers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, an Epiſcopate of their own, contrived for the Purpoſe of ſupporting a Clamour. They have loudly and vehemently declaimed, againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of eccleſiaſtical Tyranny in this Land of Liberty againſt depriving Men of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Freedom and worldly Property, and even of their <hi>natural Rights</hi>; as if theſe Evils were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Parts of the Epiſcopate in Queſtion, or at leaſt muſt reſult from it by neceſſary Conſequence. And yet I ſee not how it is poſſible, that they ſhould not know in their own Conſciences, that nothing they have ſaid in this Strain, militates either againſt me, or the Biſhops propoſed. Indeed Paſſages from the <hi>Appeal</hi> have been quoted, to enable them to carry on the Illuſion; but before ſuch Paſſages could anſwer the Purpoſe, it was found neceſſary to put them to the Torture, and to wreſt them from their plain and obvious Meaning. As to any perſonal Abuſes I have received from theſe Writers,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011203_0014_0F94F945290BF710"/>
I truly deſpiſe them, and ſhall ſilently paſs them over with the Contempt they deſerve. They affect not the Merits of the Cauſe in Debate, and are of no Conſequence to any but themſelves. I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected much Fame as an Author; and as to my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or moral Character, I do not conceive, that in the Eſtimation of a ſingle Perſon whoſe Opinion is worthy of Regard, it has really received any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, from the malevolent Impeachments of my literary Adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ESTEEM it no ſmall Proof of the Want of Candour in <hi>ſome</hi> of my Opponents, that they have brought on their Attacks in the <hi>Weekly Papers</hi>; by which Contrivance, any <hi>Defence</hi> that I can make, will have no Chance to be ſeen by many of <hi>their</hi> Readers. But, not contented with a ſingle Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Publications, they have cauſed them to be <hi>reprinted</hi> in ſeveral of the Colonies. No ſooner were the Harangues of the AMERICAN WHIG addreſſed to the Inhabitants of <hi>New-York,</hi> than they were reverberated from the Gazettes of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> and <hi>Boſton.</hi> The falſe Alarm ſounded in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> by the CENTINEL, was alſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately echoed from the Preſſes of other Places. By this Management, all the bitter Things, and all the unfair Things, as well as all the ludicrous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which they have uttered againſt the Church, have been widely circulated amongſt the People; many of whom are ignorant, ſome of them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudiced againſt us, and perhaps not one in a Hundred of them has ever had an Opportunity, of hearing what is ſaid on the other Side. Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is artful, and has a Tendency to raiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a Party; but it can never promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Truth and Condour. I may appeal to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011203_0015_0F94F94700F7AE40"/>
Dr. CHAUNCY whether this is generous and fair; who (<hi>Page</hi> 6) pronounces it to be Matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, when Men are prevented from making a Judgment <hi>upon an impartial hearing of the Caſe,</hi> and are led to give Sentence, upon <hi>hearing one Side only.</hi> Had indeed the Nature of the propoſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate been honeſtly explained, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Favour of it fairly repreſented; in that Caſe, theſe periodical Gentlemen might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and declaimed, and have publiſhed their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Declamations in every Paper upon the Continent, and ſtill their Readers might have been capable of judging of the Matter in Diſpute. But ſuch Impartiality is ſeldom to be found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Controverſy; and I am ſorry to ſay, it has not ſhewn itſelf in the <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Centinels</hi> of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I HAVE another moſt material Obſervation to make, of a different Kind, and I requeſt of every Reader that he will attend to it; namely, that notwithſtanding all the clamorous Oppoſition that has been made to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the grand Point which was therein ſubmitted to the Conſideration of the Public, has been fairly given up by my Opponents. The true State of the Caſe is as follows. After a Plan, for the Introduction of an American Epiſcopate, for the ſole Purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſpiritual Wants of the Church, had been agreed upon by many of the Biſhops at Home—after it had been made known to, and had received the Approbation of, ſeveral Perſons of the higheſt Rank in the Kingdom,—and had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially conſented to, by the American Clergy in the northern Colonies; as the utmoſt Care had been taken to render it unexceptionable to all Manner
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011203_0016_0F94F947268B9590"/>
of Perſons, it was thought, that, in Return for the viſible Abatement of Prejudices againſt the Church in the Minds of Diſſenters, and with a View of removing all poſſible Suſpicions of Evil, it would be received by them as a Mark of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and as a Proof of our candid and generous Diſpoſition towards them, if we ſhould unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly explain this Plan to them before it ſhould be carried into Execution; declaring at the ſame Time our Willingneſs to attend to their Objections, ſhould there be any, againſt it. With this Deſign the <hi>Appeal to the Public</hi> was undertaken; and therein the PROPOSED EPISCOPATE was fairly and fully explained, and frankly ſubmitted to a public Examination and Diſcuſſion. Whoever will be at the Trouble of reading the <hi>Appeal</hi> may ſee that this was the Deſign of it, and that the only Point offered to be debated was, whether it is reaſonable that the American Church ſhould have SUCH AN EPISCOPATE AS IS THEREIN EXPLAINED AND PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSED; and not, whether any Form of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate that was not explained nor propoſed, might be liable to Exceptions. For ſome Months after this Explanation and Propoſal were offered to the Public, there was a dead Silence. Not the leaſt Intimation was given in the public Papers, or, ſo far as I could learn, even in Converſation, that any were diſſatisfied. But at length it was diſcovered, that a Number of Perſons had entered into a Combination to run down the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to oppoſe, at any Rate, the Reſidence of Biſhops in America; and agreeably to the general Plan of Operations that had been ſettled, within the Compaſs of a few Weeks, Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> the <hi>American Whig,</hi> and the <hi>Centinel,</hi> made their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> from whom the chief
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011203_0017_0F94F9485F378420"/>
Execution ſeems to have been expected, brought on what may be called, in ſome Senſe, a regular Attack upon the <hi>Appeal,</hi> openly appearing in his proper Perſon. The <hi>American Whig</hi> and the <hi>Centinel</hi> undertook to make as great a Diverſion as they could, in weekly Skirmiſhes—a Number of Volunteers being invited in the mean Time to aſſiſt them by occaſional Sallies. The Operations were carried on with as much Spirit and Warmth as the Friends of theſe Adventurers could wiſh; but notwithſtanding all their Reſolution, Alertneſs and Caution, they have been obliged to give up the grand Object of the Conteſt, as above explained.</p>
            <p>DR. CHAUNCEY declares for himſelf and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (<hi>Page</hi> 180) in the following Words: <hi>We deſire no other Liberty, than to be left unreſtrained in the Exerciſe of our religious Principles, in ſo far as we are good Members of Society. And we are perfectly willing Epiſcopalians ſhould enjoy this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the full. If they think Biſhops, in their appropriated Senſe, were conſtituted by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, we object not a Word againſt their having as many of them as they pleaſe, if they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have them with Authority altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Chriſt.</hi> The good Doctor here ſpeaks immediately to the Point in Queſtion, and grants us all that we deſire; in Return for which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, I heartily wiſh that he and his Brethren may always continue <hi>to be left unreſtrained in the Exerciſe of their religious Principles, in ſo far as they are good Members of Society</hi>; and I have never heard that the Doctor is a bad one. The ſame liberal Sentiment he again expreſſes, but more <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conically,</hi> in Page 200; <hi>Whoever objected,</hi> ſays he, <hi>againſt this compleat Enjoyment, upon the Footing of a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011203_0018_0F94F9488715D3D8"/>
perfect Equality?</hi> So again in Page 189, <hi>It is not</hi> SIMPLY <hi>the Exerciſe of any of their religious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that would give the leaſt Uneaſineſs, nor yet the Exerciſe of them under as many</hi> PURELY SPIRITUAL <hi>Biſhops as they could wiſh to have; but their having Biſhops under a</hi> STATE ESTABLISHMENT. And he introduces (<hi>Page</hi> 177) the late Dr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> as approaching very far towards the ſame Conceſſion.</p>
            <p>WE are under the like Obligations to the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig,</hi> who ſays (Numb. 1.) in his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Phraſeology, wherein every Man ſhould be allowed to expreſs himſelf:
<q>Tis true, the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet (meaning the <hi>Appeal</hi>) is ſpecious, and appears to aſk nothing but what is highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; and could any Man, above the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of an Idiot really perſuade himſelf, that the Dr. and the Convention would content themſelves with a Biſhop, ſo limited and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed as he is pleaſed to repreſent his future Lordſhip; it were manifeſt Injuſtice to deny them what in their Opinion their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſo greatly depends upon.</q>
He repeats the ſame Conceſſion (Numb. XXI.)
<q>Did they (the Clergy) really deſire, or was there the leaſt Probability of obtaining ſuch an ideal Biſhop as they hold up to public View, in Order to lull us into Security, while themſelves are proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Scheme, for procuring a true modern Prelate, no other Denomination ought in Juſtice to give them any Oppoſition.</q>
And again (Numb. XXII.)
<q>The Coloniſts have not as yet that I know of, made any Objections againſt the Epiſcopalians having primitive Biſhops. Such I believe would give no Umbrage to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of other Denominations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011203_0019_0F94F9494C016CE0"/>THE <hi>Centinel</hi> indeed has not declared himſelf ſo openly and generouſly in our Favour; but yet from ſundry broken Hints and Intimations inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed up and down his Papers, as well as from the whole Tenor of his Writings, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he differs not from his Fellow-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers above quoted, in ſo eſſential a Point.</p>
            <p>NOW from theſe Declarations it is evident, that ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> will give <hi>no Umbrage</hi> to the Diſſenters in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that all the Oppoſition that has been made againſt the Settlement of American Biſhops, has been made on the Suppoſition of their being <hi>different</hi> from what we have <hi>held up to public View.</hi> So far as they ſhall be <hi>the ſame,</hi> we cannot now doubt but the Diſſenters will be ſatisfied. The Subject has been taken into the cloſeſt Examination by the Champions of their Party, without the leaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to make us unreaſonable Conceſſions; and they have declared that <hi>they object not a Word</hi> againſt our having Biſhops, if they are not to be inveſted with temporal Authority,—that <hi>it were manifeſt Injuſtice to oppoſe them</hi>—that <hi>no other Denomination ought in Juſtice to give us Oppoſition,</hi> and the like. So full and authentic a Determination of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in Favour of the Epiſcopate propoſed, it is hoped, will not fail of having its proper Effect on all Sides, both here and at home.</p>
            <p>THE Matter being brought to this Iſſue, I might give up all farther Controverſy; were it not that I am thought bound, in <hi>Juſtice</hi> to my own Character, to make a more particular Defence of the <hi>Appeal</hi>— and in <hi>Duty</hi> to the Church of England, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

her from thoſe injurious Aſperſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, which I have, although very innocently, occaſioned. In Compliance therefore with theſe Obligations, I ſhall go on to conſider the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Things that have been objected to both, by the Writers with whom I am concerned; and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that <hi>Recrimination is generally allowed to be juſt,</hi> I ſhall carefully avoid returning <hi>Railing</hi> for <hi>Railing,</hi> as it is but a poor Expedient at beſt, and as I am not apprehenſive that I ſhall have any Manner of Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>American Whig</hi> made his firſt Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I promiſed in <hi>an Advertiſement to the Public,</hi> that, although Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> would propably be intitled to my principal Attention, yet any other Writers who ſhould think fit to animadvert on the <hi>Appeal,</hi> ſhould have ſuch Notice taken of them, as they ſhould be found to deſerve. From this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is very poſſible that the <hi>American Whig</hi> and the <hi>Centinel</hi> may be diſappointed, in finding they make no greater Figure in the following Defence. But as they have offered very little which has not been as well ſaid by Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> and as they have both received particular Anſwers—the former, in a weekly Paper, intitled, A WHIP <hi>for the American Whig</hi>; and the latter, in another weekly Paper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>The Anatomiſt</hi>—I believe I ſhall not be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others with any criminal Neglect. However, Notice will probably be taken of them on ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Occaſions. As to the Authors of two ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Pamphlets aimed at the <hi>Appeal</hi>; one, in the Form of a <hi>Letter,</hi> addreſſed to <hi>the Ruler of St. John's Church,</hi> and ſigned <hi>an Antiepiſcopalian</hi>; and the other, in the Name of <hi>a Preſbyter in Old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011203_0021_0F94F94ACDD3F678"/>
I know of no Laws of Juſtice, or Honour, or Decency, that require me to take particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. The <hi>Antiepiſcopalian</hi> appears to me to be ſuch a rambling, ignorant, petulant, pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Writer, and his Piece, through the Blunders of the Printer and thoſe of the Author<note n="*" place="bottom">The following cannot be called a <hi>Blunder.</hi> In Page 10, he ſays: <hi>When, where, or by whom, has Jones</hi> on the Heart <hi>been refuted, or anſwer'd, when he has proved at large</hi>
                  <q>That the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> cannot be traced up to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as their Original</q>?
Here the Marks of Quotation are dropped, and he goes on: <hi>Does he not prove that the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of</hi> Auſtin <hi>the Monk, being almoſt entirely extinct,</hi> A. D. 668, <hi>the greater Part were of</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Ordination by</hi> Aidan <hi>and</hi> Finan, <hi>from the</hi> Culdee <hi>Monaſtry of</hi> Columbanus, <hi>who were the ſame with Preſbyters,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Paſſage is tranſcribed from Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi>'s LECTURES (<hi>Page</hi> 501) without giving him the leaſt Credit for ſo important Information. But the Cream of the Jeſt is yet to come. In this very Paſſage, which he has privately tranſcribed, Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> refers to a Note in the Margin, in which Note he ſays, that <hi>Jones on the Heart</hi> has been anſwered by the <hi>Biſhop of St. Aſaph.</hi>
               </note>, is in ſome Parts ſo unintelligible, that I never can conſent to enter into any public Debate with him. And as to <hi>the Preſbyter in Old England,</hi> he ſeems to know too little of the Matters in Debate, to intitle him to a Hearing. By this Time the Reader ſees that my chief Buſineſs is with Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi>; and this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I ſhall now proceed to ſettle.</p>
            <p>BY Way of Contraſt to that <hi>Diffidence</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherewith the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himſelf to the Public; the Doctor comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in <hi>an Advertiſement,</hi> with gigantic <hi>Confidence</hi>; telling his Readers, that the Performance which followed was intirely his own,—that he had not undertaken it <hi>in Virtue of any voted Appointment by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011203_0022_0F94F94B877783A8"/>
a Convention of the Clergy,</hi>—and, that he was not <hi>aſſiſted in it as to Method or Management, by Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſo learned and able a Body of Men.</hi> And, to increaſe the Reputation of his Abilities, his Friends have given out<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>American Whig,</hi> Numb. VIII.</note>, that, although he is <hi>an old Gentleman of Seventy,</hi> yet <hi>he wrote it in leſs than two Months.</hi> Now what are we to infer from theſe high Compliments paid to the Doctor, by himſelf and his Friends? If any Thing farther was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them, than that we ſhould conſider him as an <hi>able</hi> Writer, and a <hi>ready</hi> Writer, it ought to have been explained. His being poſſeſſed of theſe Two literary Accompliſhments, I have no Inclination to diſpute. But I am ſorry, that, at the Age of <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he could find no better Way of diſplaying them, than in abuſing the Church of England, and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to diſgrace the <hi>Appeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN his INTRODUCTION the Doctor complains, that the Arguments made Uſe of in Support <hi>of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> for American Biſhops, had been <hi>kept ſecret,</hi> and ſays, <hi>although an authentic Knowledge of them was deſired, it could not be obtained at firſt, and I know not that it ever has been ſince.</hi> He ſeems here to refer to ſome formal Application that had been made to our Clergy for this Intelligence, which had been unkindly rejected; but I know nothing either of ſuch an Application or Rejection. On the contrary, we have generally been deſirous of explaining the Reaſons for our requeſting Biſhops, to every one, as we have had Opportunity; and have frequently mentioned the Subject to Diſſenters, long before any Petitions for that Purpoſe were tranſmitted or prepared. But the Doctor ſeems
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011203_0023_0F94F94C963E88C8"/>
to think that we ought to have <hi>publiſhed</hi> our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before we ſent our Addreſſes. Others may think it ſufficient that they were made known in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and that all the curious and inquiſitive might ſatisfy themſelves by having Recourſe to the proper Perſons. But the Complaint is altogether groundleſs. For the Plan upon which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Biſhops ſhould be ſent to America, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> afterwards <hi>made Uſe of in Support of our Petitions,</hi> actually were publiſhed, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time before the Petitions were ſent, in <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Dr. Mayhew's Obſervations,</hi> &amp;c. And as many Copies of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> were ſent to Boſton, and Dr. Mayhew <hi>rejoined</hi> to it, and eſpecially as that Controverſy engaged the public Attention, it is very ſurpriſing that Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> ſhould have been ſo great a Stranger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as not to have ſome Knowledge of it. Afterwards, upon obſerving that many Perſons in the Colonies were ſtill unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nature and Deſign of our Application for Biſhops, in which State they were liable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable Suſpicions and Jealouſies, it was voted by our <hi>Convention,</hi> that more particular Information ſhould be publiſhed, and the whole Matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, for the Satisfaction of all Parties; in Conſequence of which, the <hi>Appeal</hi> was drawn up and publiſhed.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor's Method of anſwering the <hi>Appeal,</hi> by <hi>taking into Conſideration the ſeveral Sections one by one</hi> in their Order, I have no Objections to; and therefore will purſue the ſame Method in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But before I proceed, I think it but fair to advertiſe the Reader, that I ſhall be obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert ſome Things which have no more Relation to the propoſed Epiſcopate, than the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

which was <hi>marked out,</hi> with a View of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the Reader to judge the better of the Situation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> from a general Acquaintance with her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the Grounds that ſupport them. But although it was not thought to be improper, nor altogether foreign from the general Deſign of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> to give a ſummary View of the Evidence in Favour of Epiſcopacy; yet, as was obſerved, we maintain that the Validity of our Plea for <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Biſhops depends not upon the abſolute Truth, but upon our Belief of the Truth, of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The Plea of Diſſenters for a Toleration in <hi>England,</hi> was never founded, I preſume, on the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Truth and Certainty of their reſpective Tenets; at leaſt, it was never admitted, on that Footing, by thoſe in Authority. It is ſufficient that Men <hi>believe</hi> the religious Syſtems they have adopted to be true, and that they hold no Doctrines that are inconſiſtent with the Safety of the State, to intitle them to a Toleration from the civil Government: And a Toleration implies, in the very Notion of the Word, a Liberty for Men to enjoy the free,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011203_0026_0F94F94F43EA4DD8"/>
open and undiſturbed Uſe of ſuch Methods of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, and ſuch Forms of eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as belong to their religious Syſtems. If therefore the Church of England in the American Colonies has a Right to be tolerated, <hi>i. e.</hi> unleſs ſhe has forfeited the common Rights of Chriſtians, ſhe has a Right to an Epiſcopate; it being, as was ſhewed in ſome of the firſt Sections of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> an eſſential Part of her Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>AT my Entrance upon the Subject, I made the following Obſervation,
<q>That the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is epiſcopal, and conſequently holds the Neceſſity of Biſhops to govern the Church, and to confer eccleſiaſtical Powers;</q>
and for Proof of it, refered to 'her public Offices,' and to
<q>the whole Syſtem of her Conduct with Regard to her Clergy.</q>
The Truth of the Obſervation Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> is pleaſed in one Senſe to allow, and in another to deny. But if it be true in any Senſe, it is ſufficient for my Purpoſe. If it be, according to the Doctor's Notion, by Virtue only of the <hi>Jus humanum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, that Biſhops are neceſſary; ſtill the Ends for which they are neceſſary cannot be obtained without them, ſo long as we are ſubject to the Authority that requires them. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Hardſhip of being obliged to go 3000 Miles for Ordination, with great Hazard and Expence: Will ſaying that the Obligation of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in the Church of England, is founded only on the national Authority, relieve us, while we look upon ourſelves to be bound in Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey that Authority? Or, will it prove that we ought not to be relieved? If it will do neither, we are ſtill in the ſame Condition, and have the ſame Reaſons for Complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011203_0027_0F94F951DDBABF90"/>BUT I humbly conceive the Doctor is greatly miſtaken in his Opinion of the Matter, and that, in the long Account he has undertaken to give of the Principles of our Reformers, if he will be ſo good as for <hi>once</hi> to lend me his favourite Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>he does not ſpeak the Truth of Fact.</hi> As the Subſtance of this Account has been copied from the <hi>Irenicum</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The following juſt Account of the <hi>Irenicum</hi> has been given by one of our periodical Writers.
<q>I do not ſcruple to declare, that I look upon the <hi>Irenicum</hi> to have been a haſty, indigeſted and partial Account of Principles and Facts. And in this the good Biſhop would not have blamed me; for when he had examined Matters more thoroughly, he looked upon it in the ſame Light himſelf. His Deſign in writing it appears to have been a good One; which was, in general, to aſſiſt in compoſing the religious Differences that then tore the Nation in Pieces, and particularly, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, to demoliſh the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Preſbytery. But his Zeal carried him, as it often carries others, into an Extreme. It repreſented Things to him through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Prejudice; but it was not long, before he was able to correct his Miſtakes, and to form a very different Opinion, both of Principles and Perſons. He wrote his <hi>Irenicum</hi> at the Age of 24, and did not ſcruple to condemn it himſelf afterwards, declaring <hi>that there are many Things in it, which if he were to write again, he would not ſay; ſome, which ſhew his Youth, and Want of due Conſideration; others, which he yielded too far, in Hopes of gaining the Diſſenting Parties to the Church of England.</hi>

The Subject, I fear, may be unentertaining to ſome of my Readers; on
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011203_0028_0F94F95326BD7EE8"/>
which Account, their Indulgence will be eſteemed a peculiar Favour.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor excepts againſt the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Book of <hi>Ordination,</hi> as a Proof that the Church of England is <hi>epiſcopal,</hi> in the common Senſe of the Word; becauſe, as Profeſſor <hi>Wiggleſworth</hi> had obſerved, there is Reaſon to conclude the Compilers of it were of Opinion, that <hi>Prieſts and Biſhops are by God's Law one and the ſame. This was certainly,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Chauncey, the Doctrine of the Church of England in the Beginning of the Reformation, and of the Generality of its pious and learned Divines for a very conſiderable Time afterwards.</hi> (Page 8.) He refers to a Book publiſhed in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, entitled, "The INSTRUCTION of a Chriſtian Man", afterwards altered and reprinted with a ſomewhat different Title.</p>
               <p>LET us firſt ſee what the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Offices, ſays. The Words are theſe:
<q>It is evident to all Men diligently reading Holy Scripture, and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles Time, there have been theſe Orders of Miniſters in Chriſt's Church; Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons. Which Offices were evermore had in ſuch reverend Eſtimation, that no Man might preſume to execute any of them, except he were firſt called, tried, examined, and known to have ſuch Qualities as are requiſite for the ſame; and alſo by publick Prayer, with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands, were approved and admitted thereunto by lawful Authority. And therefore, to the Intent that theſe Orders may be continued, and reverently uſed and eſteemed, in the Church of England; no Man ſhall be accounted or
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011203_0029_0F94F95516466098"/>
taken to be a lawful Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon, in the Church of England, or ſuffered to execute any of the ſaid Functions, except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Form hereafter following, or hath had formerly epiſcopal Conſecration, or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF the Reader now will carefully conſider this Paſſage, let him ſay, whether it is eaſy to <hi>conceive</hi> a more direct, poſitive and compleat Teſtimony in Favour of Epiſcopacy, than is here given by the Compilers of the <hi>Ordinal.</hi> The <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of the three Orders, of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, is in this <hi>Preface</hi> fully aſſerted;—the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Diſtinction is deduced
<q>from the Apoſtles Time;</q>
—the <hi>Evidence</hi> in Favour of it is ſaid to be contained in "holy Scripture and ancient Authors," —and the <hi>Clearneſs</hi> of this Evidence is ſuch, that it muſt appear
<q>to <hi>all Men</hi> diligently reading holy Scripture, &amp;c.</q>
In Conſequence of this Doctrine,
<q>no Man is to be accounted a lawful Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, in the Church of England, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to execute any of the ſaid Functions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be admitted thereunto, according to the Form</q>
then eſtabliſhed; with a farther Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Favour of thoſe only, who had received "formerly epiſcopal Conſecration, or Ordination." If the Doctor can diſcover no more in theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations concerning Epiſcopacy, than that they <hi>may ſeem to have an Aſpect this Way</hi>; ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice will go far towards accounting for the many Miſrepreſentations he has made, in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Appeal.</hi> But to enable him to make a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judgment of the Matter, I beg of him to try an eaſy Experiment, which is no other than
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011203_0030_0F94F9556154A378"/>
this; whether, with all the Explanations and ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Interpretations that the Words will admit of, he is able himſelf, honeſtly and conſiſtently, to ſubſcribe to this Declaration of our firſt Reformers. If he cannot, he muſt allow them to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained other Sentiments of Epiſcopacy, than he has repreſented them to have had—unleſs he can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be guilty of the groſſeſt Deceit and Prevarication.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſays the Doctor,
<q>that Prieſts and Biſhops were the ſame,</q>
CERTAINLY <hi>was the Doctrine of the Church of England in the Beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>; (Ibid.) meaning when the Ordination Offices were compoſed; or it is impertinent to his Argument. But the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> concerning Epiſcopacy, is <hi>certainly</hi> to be learnt from her public Offices and Acts, rather than from the ſuppoſed Sentiments of Individuals. For how incredible is it, that different Offices ſhould have been compoſed for the Ordination of Biſhops and Prieſts, if they were both conſidered as being in Reality but one Order? If every Prieſt was believed to be already a Biſhop, would Men, who had any Conſciences, conſent to act the ſolemn Farce of ordaining ſuch an one to the epiſcopal Office, with Prayer and the Impoſition of Hands? Would they ſolemnly invoke the Almighty for his Bleſſing upon them in communicating thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Powers, which they had no Intention to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, as the Perſon was believed to be fully inveſted with them already? How injurious to the Characters of our excellent Reformers, is the moſt diſtant Inſinuation of ſuch Duplicity of Conduct!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011203_0031_0F94F95626FADDD8"/>BUT ſtill the Doctor, it ſeems, is clear in the Matter; The firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformers <hi>certainly</hi> were not Epiſcopalians. If poſitive Aſſertions are to be admitted as Evidence in this Diſpute, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, from the moſt reſpectable Authors, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Witneſſes on the other Side. Biſhop <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> as moderate a Man, as candid a Writer, and as well acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, as Doctor <hi>Chauncey,</hi> ſays, that
<q>the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Biſhops is one of the Two <hi>diſtinguiſhing Principles</hi> of our Reformation,</q>
the
<q>Supremacy of Kings</q>

               <p>BUT let us proceed to Evidence of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Book intitled
<q>The godly and pious INSTITUTION of a Chriſtian Man,</q>
was publiſhed 1537, in the early <hi>Infancy,</hi> or rather ſoon after the firſt <hi>Conception,</hi> of the Reformation. It was drawn up by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others, agreed to by both Houſes of Convocation, publiſhed with the King's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and intended as a Standard of Doctrine for the Biſhops and Clergy. The Book itſelf I have never ſeen; but <hi>Collier</hi> has given an <hi>Abſtract</hi> of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011203_0032_0F94F956CFF455D8"/>
moſt material Parts of it. In this Abſtract there is nothing like what the Doctor would prove from it; but there is ſomething extremely <hi>unlike</hi> it in the following Paſſage: "They proceed (ſays <hi>Collier,</hi> ſpeaking of the Authors of that Book)
<q>to a more particular Explanation of the Authority of the Clergy, and divide it into two Branches, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas Ordinis, et Poteſtas Juriſdictionis.</hi> Concerning the Firſt, <hi>not being conteſted,</hi> they ſay nothing; the Latter, touching Juriſdiction committed by God to the Hierarchy, they throw it into three Subdiviſions. By the Firſt, they are impowered to reprove Immorality and Miſbelief, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Obſtinate and incorrigible.—By the ſecond Branch of Juriſdiction, BISHOPS <hi>are authoriſed by our Saviour to</hi> CONTINUE the SUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSION <hi>and</hi> PERPETUATE <hi>the Hierarchy.</hi> They are the Judges of the Qualifications for Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and may admit or refuſe as they think fit.— A third Branch of Juriſdiction belonging to Biſhops and Prieſts, comprehends the Power of making Canons for the Diſcipline and Service of the Church.</q>
The Hiſtorian, at the Concluſion of his Abſtract, gives the Liſt of Subſcribers, and takes Leave, with the following Remark:
<q>This Book, in the Sacrament of <hi>Orders,</hi> declares the Clergy have their Commiſſion from God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by Conſequence, that their Authority is no Grant of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A FEW Years afterwards was publiſhed,
<q>a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Doctrine and ERUDITION of a Chriſtian Man,</q>
to which the King himſelf wrote a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. It was for Subſtance much the ſame with the INSTITUTION, but enlarged and altered in ſeveral Particulars: From whence it is evident that at this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011203_0033_0F94F9578B36B270"/>
Period, the religious Principles of the Nation were in an unſettled, fluctuating State. In the Account given of the ERUDITION by the ſame Hiſtorian, there is ſomething indeed to the Doctor's Purpoſe; for therein we are told, that
<q>after mention made of the Appointment of Deacons</q>
in this Book,
<q>it is ſubjoined, that the Scripture ſpeaks expreſsly of no more than the two Orders of Prieſts and Deacons.</q>
Were we to ſtop here, we ſhould infer that the Reformers at this Time, were not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Epiſcopalians, but Preſbyterians. But in another Paſſage under the ſame Head, they have the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, not of Preſbyterians, but of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians. Take the Words of my Author:
<q>The ERUDITION makes <hi>Orders</hi> one of the ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and defines it a Gift of Grace for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in the Church; that it is conveyed by Conſecration and Impoſition of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Hands; that in the Beginning of Chriſtianity, this Character was given by the Apoſtles. The Proof is drawn from the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </q>
How to reconcile theſe two Paſſages, may be difficult; and until this be done, they can prove but little on either Side. <hi>Collier</hi> ſays, that
<q>under thoſe called Prieſts or Preſbyters, this Book ſuppoſes the epiſcopal Character was meant; for, that theſe two Orders were diſtinct and ſubordinate, <hi>is plain from this</hi> ERUDITION.</q>
He concludes with obſerving, that
<q>this laſt Book does not ſtand upon ſo ſtrong an Authority as the former. The INSTITUTION was the Act of the whole Clergy, and ſubſcribed by both Houſes of Convocation.</q>
But the "neceſſary ERUDITION," was drawn up only by a Committee of
<q>the King's Nomination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:011203_0034_0F94F958A738BDB0"/>BUT the true State of the Caſe appears to me to have been this: At the Time of the ERUDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Aſſociates were generally agreed in theſe two main Points; that the national Religion was groſsly corrupted, and that a public Reformation was neceſſary. But how <hi>far</hi> either was the Caſe, was the Work of Time to determine. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had made great Progreſs in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and ſome Places adjacent; but they differed conſiderably in their Syſtems; neither of which could ſafely be adopted, without a careful Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Beſides, in the Heat of their Conteſt, they were ſuppoſed to have run into ſome Extremes, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines judged it prudent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void. Our Reformers therefore were reſolved to proceed with the utmoſt Caution. And the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they appear to have purſued was, to conſider one Doctrine after another with the cloſeſt Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until the whole Syſtem ſhould be examined, and placed on the ſure Baſis of Scripture Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. While this ſlow and important Work was going on, the INSTITUTION and ERUDITION were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for <hi>temporary</hi> Uſe. Some of the Doctrines in Diſpute between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Reformers, had been fully canvaſſed and determined by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Friends. Others were not yet thoroughly diſcuſſed; among which muſt be reckoned that of eccleſiaſtical Government. This may fairly be concluded from the <hi>Queſtions</hi> propoſed to <hi>an Aſſembly of</hi> SELECT <hi>Divines,</hi> as the Doctor properly calls them p. 9; <hi>to which Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they gave in ſeverally their Reſolutions in Papers, all whoſe Judgments were accurately ſummed up, and ſet down by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury himſelf.</hi> For it was at this Time, and not ten Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, as Doctor
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011203_0035_0F94F95917C07990"/>
                  <hi>Chauncey,</hi> following his blind Guide the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> aſſerts, that thoſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> were given out for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, as is plain from Biſhop <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT this Stage of the Reformation therefore it is no Wonder, that we meet with ſome crude Expeſſions, relating to Epiſcopacy; as well as to many other Matters of the higheſt Importance. The Prepoſſeſſions of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Education ſtill ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Minds of theſe honeſt Searchers for Truth; and it was owing perhaps more to the Force of theſe Prepoſſeſſions, than to any other Cauſe, that ſome of them have uſed Expreſſions, which have ſince been conſtrued to imply their having ſome Doubts concerning the Superiority of Biſhops over Preſbyters. The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Schoolmen and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts had been for ſome Ages endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Diſtinction between the two Orders; of which Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> gives a particular Account<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Ref. Vol. I. p. 366.</note>, concluding it in theſe Words:
<q>On this I have inſiſted the more, that it may appear how little they have conſidered Things, who are ſo far car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with their Zeal againſt the eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, as to make Uſe of ſome Paſſages of the Schoolmen and Canoniſts that deny them to be diſtinct Orders; for theſe are <hi>the very Dregs of Popery,</hi> the one raiſing the Prieſts higher for the Sake of Tranſubſtantiation, the other pulling the Biſhops lower for the Sake of the Pope's Supremacy, and by ſuch Means bringing them almoſt to an Equality.</q>
The like Obſervation was before made by an eminent Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who ſays:
<q>We may juſtly aſcribe the reviving of the <hi>Aërian</hi> Hereſy in theſe latter Days, to the Diſpenſations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who licenſed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011203_0036_0F94F959C68FA060"/>
ordinary Prieſts to <hi>ordain,</hi> and <hi>confirm,</hi> and do the moſt eſſential Offices of Biſhops. So their Schools do teach us, <hi>a Prieſt may be the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſter of Prieſthood, and inferior Orders by the Delegation of the Pope.</hi> Again, <hi>The Pope may confer the Power of Confirmation upon a ſimple Prieſt.</hi> By ſuch exhorbitant Practices as theſe, they chalked out a Way to Innovators. And yet they are not able to produce a Precedent of ſuch Diſpenſation throughout the primitive Times<note n="*" place="bottom">Bramhall's Works, p. 431.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT to come to the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> Extracts from which make ſo great a Figure in the <hi>Irenicum:</hi> The Manuſcript is publiſhed at large by <hi>Burnet</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. Re<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Vol. I. Collection, p. 201.</note>, excepting an Omiſſion to be mentioned preſently. Therein we find <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Anſwer to the 10th Queſtion, in the Words quoted by the Doctor; but the Reader will not forget the <hi>Time</hi> of his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Anſwer, which was about <hi>ten</hi> Years before our preſent Offices for Ordination were compoſed. However ſtrange <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Opinion may appear to have been at this Time, there is ſtrong Proof that he altered it immediately. For in the ſame Copy of Queſtions and Reſolutions, Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 11th Queſton is:
<q>I ſuppoſe that a Biſhop hath Authority of God, as his Miniſter, by Scripture to make a Prieſt; but he ought not to admit any Man to be a Prieſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate him, or to appoint him to any Miniſtry in the Church, without the Prince's Licence and Conſent. And that any other Man hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make a Prieſt by Scripture, I have not read, nor any Example therof.</q>
To the 12th Queſtion <hi>Leighton</hi> anſwers:
<q>I ſuppoſe that there
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011203_0037_0F94F95CF39BCAC0"/>
is a Conſecration required, as by Impoſition of Hands; for ſo we be taught in the Enſample of the Apoſtles.</q>
Now <hi>Durell</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae</hi> ſays, that having had an Opportunity of examining the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Manuſcript, he found that <hi>Cranmer gave his Conſent to theſe two Opinions of Leighton,</hi> ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each <hi>Th: Cantuarienſis</hi>; which very material Information is omited by Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lowth, on the Subject of Church-Power, p. 484.</note>. Why <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> left out this Paſſage is plain; it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the Deſign of his <hi>Irenicum:</hi> But why <hi>Burnet</hi> omited it is doubtful. For that he had no Intention to tranſmit <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Character to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> is evident from his Remark in the Body of his Hiſtory.
<q>In <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Paper, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſome ſingular Opinions of his about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of eccleſiaſtical Offices will be found; but as they are delivered by him with all poſſible Modeſty, ſo they are not eſtabliſhed as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church, but laid aſide as particular Conceits of his own, and it ſeems that <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he changed his Opinion.</hi> For he ſubſcribed the Book that was ſoon after ſet out, which is <hi>directly contrary</hi> to thoſe Opinions ſet down in theſe Papers.</q>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 289.</note>
               </p>
               <p>DR. <hi>Chauncey</hi> proceeds: <hi>The Biſhop of St. Aſaph, Dr. Thirleby, Dr. Redmayn and Cox, were all of the ſame Opinion with the Archbiſhop, viz. that</hi>
                  <q>Biſhops and Prieſts were at one Time, and were not two Things, but one Office in the Beginning of Chriſt's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</q>
I ſee no great Heterodoxy in this Opinion, if properly explained. It is now generally agreed by the Advocates for Epiſcopacy, that <hi>in the Beginning of Chriſt's Religion,</hi> Biſhops, and Prieſts or Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were ſynonymous Terms: Conſequently, they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011203_0038_0F94F95EDCD8FAB0"/>
                  <hi>were at one Time,</hi> and <hi>not two Things.</hi> But the Word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the 11th Queſtion, ſeems to have been underſtood in its <hi>appropriated</hi> Senſe. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether a Biſhop hath Authority to make a Prieſt by the Scripture, or no? And whether any other but only a Biſhop may make a Prieſt?</hi> To this Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> anſwers:
<q>Biſhops have Authority, as is aforeſaid, of the Apoſtles, in the 10th Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make Prieſts, except in Caſes of great Neceſſity.</q>
In his Anſwer to the 10th Queſtion, to which he refers, he had made this Diſtinction, <hi>Biſhops as they be</hi> NOW, <hi>i. e.</hi> as ſuperior to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; in which Senſe therefore he aſſerts in this Place, that they <hi>have Authority to make Prieſts.</hi> Dr. <hi>Redmayn</hi> anſwers the Queſtion thus:
<q>To the firſt Part, I anſwer, YEA; for ſo it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. with other Places of Scripture. But whether any other but only a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may make a Prieſt, I have not read, but by ſingular Privilege of God.—As for <hi>making,</hi> that is to ſay, ordaining and conſecrating of Prieſts, I think it ſpecially belongeth to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Biſhop, as far as can be ſhewn by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any Example, as I ſuppoſe from the Beginning;</q>
and with him agree <hi>Thirleby, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Robertſon, Leighton</hi> and others. In ſhort, they generally agree in anſwering <hi>affirmatively</hi> to the firſt Part, and <hi>negatively</hi> to the ſecond Part, of the Queſtion; an Exception being made by ſome of them for Caſes of great Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>BUT let us return to Dr. <hi>Chauncey: In this ſame Reign</hi> (of <hi>Edward</hi> VI.) <hi>in a public Declaration, ſubſcribed by the Archbiſhops of Canterbury and York, eleven Biſhops, and many other Doctors and Civilians, it is expreſsly aſſerted, that</hi>
                  <q>in the New-Teſtament
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011203_0039_0F94F9603840D930"/>
no mention is made of any Degrees, or Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Orders, but only of Deacons or Miniſters, and of Prieſts or Biſhops;</q>
for which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Burnet</hi> and <hi>Neal.</hi> I ſhall not trouble my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or my Reader with <hi>Neal,</hi> who generally follows the <hi>Irenicum</hi> in theſe Matters. As to <hi>Burnet,</hi> upon conſulting him I find the <hi>Declaration</hi> here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, copied-from a Manuſcript in the <hi>Cotton</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. Addenda, p. 321.</note>. It is entitled, <hi>A Declaration made of the Functions and divine Inſtitution of Biſhops and Prieſts.</hi> But how the Doctor could aſcribe it to the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, after examining Biſhop <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> on the Subject, is inconceivable. It has evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent internal Marks of its being of a more ancient Date; and the Biſhop puts it as far back in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, as 1538 at leaſt, and <hi>proves</hi> that it could not have been made later than the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the Year he aſſigns. For it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Edward Fox,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who died in <hi>May</hi> 1538. This Declaration therefore will not be admitted as an Evidence, that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <hi>in the Reign of Edward</hi> VI, believed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from what they expreſſed in the public Offices.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries have often boaſted of late, that our great Reformer <hi>Cranmer</hi> was altogether in their Sentiments, concerning the Origin and Nature of Epiſcopacy. But I truſt ſufficient has been ſaid to prove, that they have no juſt Reaſons for Triumph, on this Account. Time was when <hi>Cranmer</hi> was a Papiſt, and believed the Doctrine of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. This, with the other diſtinguiſhing Doctrines of Popery, he renounced by Degrees; in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an honeſt and faithful Examination of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011203_0040_0F94F9615570E440"/>
them in Succeſſion, one after another. Is it then fair, or can it be reconciled with that common Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which is due to him as a Man, to ſay nothing of his eminent Character, to alledge againſt him in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, after he had firmly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf upon proteſtant Principles, any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions he entertained <hi>before</hi> he was a Proteſtant? At the Time indeed when he expreſſed himſelf, in the Manner that has been mentioned, on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Epiſcopacy, he was not a Papiſt; but it may be ſaid with equal Truth and Propriety, that he was not <hi>yet</hi> a compleat Proteſtant. In Regard to ſome Points, he was ſtill under the Influence of old Prejudices, and of the Impreſſions he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Schoolmen and Canoniſts; from which however it was not long before he perfectly diſengaged himſelf. After the Time of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Opinions concerning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, I find in him no Fluctuation of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but many Proofs appear of his ſettled and ſteady Belief that Biſhops are ſuperior to Preſbyters, by apoſtolical Inſtitution. In 1548, he compiled a <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or
<q>large Inſtruction of young Perſons in the Grounds of the Chriſtian Religion;</q>
in which, if we may believe Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi>
                  <q>he <hi>fully</hi> owns the <hi>divine</hi> Inſtitution of Biſhops and Prieſts.</q>
In this Book the Archbiſhop alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Sermon, <hi>of the Authority of the Keys,</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> x.13, 14, 15. in which Sermon his Notions of Epiſcopacy and Church-Government are ſo high, that even the <hi>high-flying</hi> Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> as ſome have called him, reprinted it at large, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to <hi>The divine Right of Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</hi> Now let it be remembred, that this Sermon was publiſhed in 1548—that the <hi>Ordinal</hi> was compiled in 1550—and that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was the principal Perſon
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011203_0041_0F94F96357B4F458"/>
concerned in that Work; and then let it be judged, whether, according to my <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>who were the Compilers of that Work,</hi> will in the leaſt contribute to overthrow my Poſition,
<q>that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is epiſcopal, and conſequently holds the Neceſſity of Biſhops to govern the Church, and to confer eccleſiaſtical Powers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Cranmer,</hi> I might go on to vindicate the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of the other Compilers of the <hi>Ordinal,</hi> from the ſame injurious Impeachment; but I have already exceeded the Limits I propoſed for this Subject, and I imagine what has been offered is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy all <hi>reaſonable</hi> Perſons—and it is vain to attempt the Conviction of others.</p>
               <p>FROM the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, the Doctor carries us to <hi>the Days of Queen Elizabeth,</hi> p. 11; when according to him, <hi>it was only determined, in</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>the Articles of Religion agreed upon,</hi> to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's Word;</q>
which ſeems to be all that he can diſcover in Favour of Epiſcopacy. But does <hi>he</hi> not ſpeak, in this very Paſſage, of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's Re-eſtabliſhment of Church Government?</hi> Now what Form of Church-Government did She <hi>re-eſtabliſh,</hi> but that Form which had been before eſtabliſhed by <hi>Edward</hi> VI? And has not this been ſhewn to be truly epiſcopal? Is not then the <hi>Re-eſtabliſhment</hi> of Epiſcopacy ſomewhat more than a bare <hi>Determination,</hi> mentioned in <hi>the Articles of Religion agreed upon</hi>; altho' it is there only ſaid to be "agreeable to God's Word?" Neither is this, as the Author of the <hi>Irenicum</hi> thought it, <hi>a low and diminutive Expreſſion,</hi> when advanced in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who denied it to be
<q>agreeable to God's
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011203_0042_0F94F963929E0590"/>
Word.</q>
For if Epiſcopacy be <hi>agreeable</hi> to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo far as any Form of Church-Government is directly <hi>oppoſite</hi> to Epiſcopacy, it is <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture. If this were ſaid of that particular Form for which the Doctor is an Advocate, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>diminutive</hi> he might eſteem it, I fancy he would not conſider it as a <hi>low</hi> Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>BUT we need not have been detained with the foregoing Particulars; for we are more roundly told, p. 12, that <hi>this Notion of the Right of Biſhops to govern and ordain, as being Officers in the Church, ſuperior to Preſbyters by divine Appointment, was, as the excellent Mr.</hi> J. Owen <hi>ſays,</hi>
                  <q>FIRST promoted in the Church of England, by Archbiſhop <hi>Laud.</hi>

This, Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> calls <hi>the plain Truth,</hi> and would doubtleſs have us receive it as the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth. But of all <hi>plain</hi> Truths, this is the moſt <hi>myſterious.</hi> There may indeed be ſome ſecret Meaning in the Word <hi>promoted,</hi> which I do not comprehend; but until it be unfolded, I muſt take the Liberty to believe that the national Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of this Doctrine, again and again, and making it a fundamental Principle of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was doing ſomething to <hi>promote</hi> it. If the Meaning be, that none before Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> contended for the Superiority of Biſhops over Preſbyters by <hi>divine Appointment,</hi> in their Writings or publick Diſputations; ſtill I muſt deny it, as I am able to produce abundant Evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Among the firſt Set of Engliſh Reformers, the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy was not diſputed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in the Way of friendly Enquiry, which ſoon ended in a general Conſent to the Doctrine. Soon after the Acceſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was received and eſtabliſhed as a Doctrine fairly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011203_0043_0F94F9645DE2C1C0"/>
ſettled by the venerable Reformers of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, without a particular Re-examination. When the Engliſh Exiles returned, amongſt the foreign Prejudices imported from <hi>Frankfort</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> we find no fixed Diſaffection towards epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For even <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf had no Objections to a moderate Epiſcopacy, ſuch as that of the Church of England. Some of theſe Perſons ſcrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wearing the Habits, objected to the Terms of Conformity, and caviled about ſome Parts of the Liturgy. For ſeveral Years theſe were the only Subjects of Debate between the Church and the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as they were now called; and it is not to be expected that, during this Period, we ſhould find any elaborate Defences of epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But afterwards, when the Hierarchy came to be formally attacked by <hi>Cartwright, Udal, Penry,</hi> and the other <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Centinels</hi> of that Reign, it was vigorouſly defended upon the Footing of a <hi>divine Appointment.</hi> Even Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> allows, that the Validity of Ordination by Preſbyters began to be diſputed and denied, towards the Middle of this Reign.
<q>
                     <hi>Whitgift,</hi> ſays he, was the firſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Hierarchy, from the Practice of the third, fourth, and fifth Centuries, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire became Chriſtian; but <hi>Bancroft</hi> divided off the Biſhops from the Prieſthood, and advanced them into a ſuperior Order by <hi>divine Right,</hi> with the ſole Power of Ordination, and the Keys of Diſcipline; ſo that from his Time there were reckoned Three Orders of Clergy in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy, viz. Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</q>
He alſo ſays,
<q>the Queen and the later Biſhops would not part with a Pin out of the Hierarchy <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Puritans, Vol. I. p. 467, <hi>Dublin</hi> Edit.</note>.</q>
From whence it is evident,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011203_0044_0F94F96506062510"/>
that whatever <hi>the excellent Mr.</hi> J. Owen may have thought, or Dr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> may now think, it was not the Opinion of their great puritanical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy by <hi>divine Appointment,</hi> was FIRST <hi>promoted in the Church of England by Archbiſhop Laud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt regular Attack upon the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was made by the Puritans in 1572, in their <hi>Admonition to the Parliament</hi>; the Deſign of which, among other Things, was to ſubvert the eccleſiaſtical Government by Biſhops. Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then Vice-Chancellor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was thought to be a proper Perſon to give "an Anſwer" to it. Upon this Service he was put by Archbiſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> and he performed it with great Approbation and Applauſe. <hi>Strype</hi> ſays of his Anſwer, that it was an
<q>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Book, containing a very learned and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Uſages thereof, and eſpecially of the Government of it by Biſhops<note n="‡" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 33.</note>.</q>
We alſo learn from the ſame Hiſtorian, that
<q>as Archbiſhop <hi>Parker</hi> was the chief Perſon that ſet <hi>Whitgift</hi> about this Work, ſo he gave him conſiderable Aſſiſtance therein, and the ſeveral Parts of the Copy, as it was finiſhed, were ſent to him from Time to Time, to review: And <hi>Cooper,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> another of our learnedeſt Biſhops, together with other Biſhops and learned Men, were conſulted withal.—So that this Book may be juſtly eſteemed and applied to, as one of the public Books of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her Profeſſion and Principles; being of the like Authority, in Reſpect to its Worſhip
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011203_0045_0F94F965C768D1F0"/>
and Government, in Oppoſition to the Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians, as Biſhop <hi>Jewel's Apology</hi> and Defence, in Reſpect to the Reformation and Doctrine of it, in Oppoſition to the Papiſts<note n="‖" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 42.</note>.</q>
Upon what Principle he defended the Government of the Church by Biſhops, we may learn from Sir <hi>F. Knoliys,</hi> a great Patron of the Puritans; who ſome Years afterwards, ſpeaking of Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s Writings in this Controverſy, complains that he
<q>had claimed, in the Right of all Biſhops, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority belonging to them, over all the inferior Clergy from God's own Ordinance<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. 342.</note>.</q>
In 1583 Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi> was promoted from the See of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> to that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in which he continued for many Years, giving frequent Proofs of his ſteady Adherence to the ſame Principles with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Epiſcopacy. I will content myſelf with laying before the Reader, the following remarkable Inſtance. In 1593, he wrote a long Letter to <hi>Beza,</hi> expoſtulating with him for intermedling, in the Manner he had done, in the Diſputes between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Puritans; in which Letter is a Paſſage, which I will take the Freedom to recommend to the ſerious Attention of Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> as it will tend to rectify ſome of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Epiſcopacy.
<q>We make no Doubt,</q>
ſays the Archbiſhop to that eminent Proteſtant,
<q>but that the epiſcopal Degree, which we bear, is an Inſtitution apoſtolical and divine; and ſo always hath been held by a continual Courſe of Times from the Apoſtles to this very Age of ours. For as for what you ſeem to hint out of <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi>; as though Cuſtom only, and that but latter, prefered Biſhops to Preſbyters; it is a Wonder to me, that you ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011203_0046_0F94F966875F7F38"/>
wreſt their Sayings to that Purpoſe; and that you ſhould not ſee by other of their Books, what they, as well as other Fathers, thought of this. And why you bring in the mention of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> I do not ſufficiently apprehend. For neither what <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith of the firſt Preſbyter ſucceeding the Biſhop deceaſing, nor what of the Elders that were wont before thoſe Times to be admitted unto the Councils, can by any Pretence look this Way. You may remember, learned Sir, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of that Epiſcopacy, which you make to be only of human Inſtitution, are refered by the Fathers, with one Mouth, to the Apoſtles, as the Authors thereof; and that the Biſhops were appointed as Succeſſors of the Apoſtles; eſpecially in certain Points of their Functions. And what <hi>Aaron</hi> was to his Sons and to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> this the Biſhops were to the Prieſts and Deacons; and ſo eſteemed of the Fathers to be by divine Inſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 460.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AMONGST thoſe who ſignalized themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy, was Dr. <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Whitgift</hi> in the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi> But I need no more than to mention this Inſtance, ſince it is ſo plain that even the <hi>Centinel</hi> found himſelf obliged to contradict the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of Mr. <hi>J. Owen</hi> and Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> and to confeſs that <hi>Dr. Bancroft in</hi> 1588 <hi>preached up</hi> (by a ſmall Miſtake he ſays, <hi>firſt</hi> preached up) <hi>in the Church of England, after the Reformation, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were of divine Right, an Order ſuperior to Preſbyters</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Centinel,</hi> Numb. XII. in a Note.</note>. As to what he tells us immediately
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011203_0047_0F94F967568C1070"/>
after, that <hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift ſaid, he rather wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than believed it to be true</hi>; this is incredible in itſelf, and ſeems to reſt altogether on <hi>Neal</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This Hiſtorian, in his Account of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi>'s Sermon, refers to no other Evidence than <hi>Strype</hi>'s Life of <hi>Whitgift</hi>; and in that Book the Ancedote is not to be met with. But near this very Time, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1589, the Archbiſhop in Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the Calumnies of <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> ſays,
<q>that he was perſuaded, that there ought to be by the Word of God, a Superiority, among the Miniſters of the Church; and that it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved in his Book againſt <hi>Cartwright:</hi> And that he was at all Times ready to juſtify it by the holy Scriptures, and by the Teſtimony of all Antiquity<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 304.</note>.</q>
This clearly ſhews, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Neal</hi> and the <hi>Centinel,</hi> that the Archbiſhop did not <hi>wiſh,</hi> but <hi>believe</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s Doctrine to be true.</p>
               <p>THE Controverſy concerning Epiſcopacy having been excited and vigorouſly urged againſt the Church, by <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Aſſociates, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Object of public Attention. On this Occaſion, the Queen's two great Counſellors, the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> and Secretary <hi>Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> thought fit, in the Year laſt mentioned, to have a Conference on the Subject with Dr. <hi>Hutton,</hi> at that Time Biſhop of <hi>Durham.</hi> The Biſhop wrote a particular Account of the Conference to the Archbiſhop, in a Letter, dated <hi>October</hi> 10th, 1589, which is preſerved in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>the Life of Whitgift</hi>; and therein it appears that he very earneſtly endeavoured to <hi>promote,</hi> with all his Abilities, <hi>the Notion of the Right of Biſhops to govern,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011203_0048_0F94F96C19FE3490"/>
&amp;c. And as he was known to expreſs the Opinion of the other Biſhops, <hi>Strype</hi> obſerves, that in the Doctrine and Arguments he advanced,
<q>we may ſee and underſtand, what were the Judgments of the Biſhops of the Realm, and the learnedeſt Divines in thoſe Times, neareſt the Reformation of this Church, and ſo beſt knew the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ABOUT this Time Dr. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> wrote his Book, entitled,
<q>The perpetual Government of Chriſt's Church,</q>
which was publiſhed in 1593. The firſt Edition of this Book is now before me; and from the Author's own Account of it in his <hi>Preface,</hi> I will preſent the Reader with the following Extracts.
<q>In the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, I obſerve, ſays he, four things needful for the firſt founding and erecting of the Church, tho' not ſo for the preſerving and maintaining thereof; and four other Points that muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual in the Church of Chriſt. The four extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Privileges of the apoſtolic Function were, their <hi>Vocation</hi> immediate from Chriſt, not from Men, nor by Men; their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending over all the Earth, not limitted to any Place; their <hi>Direction</hi> infallible, the Holy Ghoſt guiding them, whether they wrote or ſpake; and their <hi>Operation</hi> wonderful, as well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and confirm Believers, as to chaſtiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge Diſobeyers. Without theſe Things the Church could not begin, as is eaſily perceived; but it may well continue without them.—The other four Points of the apoſtolic Delegation, which muſt have their Permanence and Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the Church of Chriſt, are the diſpenſing of the Word; adminiſtring the Sacraments; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011203_0049_0F94F96FCD7FAC58"/>
of Hands; and guiding the Keys to open or ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven. The firſt Two, by Reaſon they be ordinary Means and Inſtruments by which the Spirit of God worketh each Man's Salvation, muſt be general to all Paſtors and Preſbyters of Chriſt's Church; the other Two, by which meet Men are called to the Miniſtry of the word, &amp;c. there is no Cauſe they ſhould be committed to every Preſbyter, as the Word and Sacraments are. For as there can be no Order, but Confuſion in a Common-Wealth where every Man ruleth, ſo would there be no Peace, but a peſtilent Perturbation of all Things in the Church of Chriſt, if every Preſbyter might impoſe Hands, and uſe the Keys at his Pleaſure.</q>
Again:
<q>Who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, whether all Preſbyters equally, or certain chief and choſen Men, one in every Church and City, truſted with the Government both of the People and Preſbyters, I have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debated, and made it plain, as well by the Scriptures as by other ancient Writers paſt all Exception, that from the Apoſtles to the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and ſo all along to this our Age, there have always been ſelected ſome of greater Gifts than the Reſidue, to ſucceed in the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Places, to whom it belonged, both to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the Preſbyters of each Church, and to take the ſpecial Charge of Impoſition of Hands; and this their Singularity in ſucceeding, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in ordaining, have been obſerved from the Apoſtles Times, as the peculiar and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Marks of epiſcopal Power and Calling.</q>
I have been the larger in theſe Extracts, becauſe of the judicious Diſtinctions contained in them, as well as on Account of the Scarceneſs of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011203_0050_0F94F9711EA81178"/>
Book of which the Authors of the <hi>Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Dictionary</hi> gives this Character, that
<q>it is eſteemed one of the beſt Books in Favour of Epiſcopacy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IN the next Year, viz. 1594, <hi>Hooker</hi> began to publiſh his immortal Work, the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> wherein the whole Syſtem of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is examined from its firſt Principles, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> particularly its Hierarchy, is defended with ſuch Force of Argument and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of Method, as are an Honour even to the Age in which he wrote. But this Book is ſo well known, that I need not be particular. All that I ſhall ſay is, that the Author was ſo perfectly ſatisfied of the Goodneſs of his Cauſe, and the Strength of his Defence, that after he had finiſhed it he called upon his Adverſaries in theſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Words:
<q>We require you to find out but <hi>one</hi> Church upon the Face of the whole Earth, that hath been ordered by your Diſcipline, or hath not been ordered by ours, that is to ſay, by epiſcopal Regiment, ſince the Time that the bleſſed Apoſtles were here converſant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BY this Time a Number of the ableſt Pens in the Kingdom were employed in defending the Church, againſt the Arguments, and Cavils, and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with which it was fiercely aſſaulted by its Adverſaries. Amongſt others that engaged in its Defence, was the learned Dr. <hi>Saravia,</hi> formerly a Miniſter of the Dutch reformed Church, and then a Prebendary of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who alſo in the ſame Year publiſhed his Book in anſwer to <hi>Beza, de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis Miniſtrorum in Eccleſia Gradibus</hi>; wherein he more particularly pleads the Cauſe of the Engliſh
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011203_0051_0F94F971D6FAFEE0"/>
Hierarchy. He dedicates his Book to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and ſays in his Dedication,
<q>that in this Diſpute he had defended the epiſcopal Authority to be of divine Inſtitution, and apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that it was taught as well by the Word of God, as by the univerſal Conſent of all the Churches<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 422.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I MIGHT eaſily proceed to other Inſtances of the like Nature; but thoſe which I have produced are abundantly ſufficient for my Purpoſe, as every ſingle one in this Collection is of itſelf, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, a full and clear Confutation of Dr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s poſitive and unlimited Aſſertion, that the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy, upon the Footing of a <hi>divine Appointment,</hi> was FIRST <hi>promoted in the Church of England by Archbiſhop Laud.</hi> For none of theſe Inſtances are later than 1594; and it was not until Ten Years afterwards, in 1604, that <hi>Laud</hi> made his firſt Efforts to <hi>promote</hi> this Doctrine, in his Diſputation at the Time of taking his Degree of Bachelor of Divinity<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cyprianus Anglicus, p. 54.</note>.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I take my Leave of this Subject, it may be proper to remark, that what I have proved to have been the Doctrine of the Biſhops and Clergy in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> muſt have been agreeable to the Queen, and to the principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about her Court. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> the Leader in this Controverſy, on the Side of the Church, was made Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury—Bancroft</hi> was ſoon promoted to the See of <hi>Worceſter</hi>—and <hi>Bilſon,</hi> in a ſhort Time, was advanced to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> Theſe Promotions were doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011203_0052_0F94F97293703A10"/>
in ſome Meaſure, by the Queen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for their Services in the Defence of the Church, and are manifeſt Indications that She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Principles for which thoſe Writers contended.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſhewn that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was properly <hi>epiſcopal</hi> from the Beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; it is Time to conſider another general Aſſertion, which is advanced with a View of ſtrengthening the former. <hi>The Point of Re-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the Doctor tells us, p. 13, <hi>did not begin to be urged, until the Days of Archbiſhop of Laud.</hi> I do not undetrake to contradict him in this Point, but I will endeavour to place it in a proper Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>UNTIL the Days of Archbiſhop Laud,</hi> there were but very few Caſes, if any, wherein it was needful to conſider <hi>the Point of Re-Ordination.</hi> It was not until 1572, that the Puritans ventured to withdraw from the Church, and to ſet up ſeparate Aſſemblies; and then, for many Years, their Congregations were ſupplied with Miniſters who had received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from the Biſhops in <hi>England.</hi> Afterwards, when this Reſource was inſufficient to anſwer their Occaſions, they were at the Trouble and Expence of ſending over for Ordination, ſuch Perſons as were wanted, to <hi>Antwerp</hi> and other Places upon the Continent; ſtill <hi>ſcrupling</hi> to ſet up an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own, in Oppoſition to the Biſhops. As this was the Caſe, there were but few Miniſters in the Kingdom, before the Days of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> that had not received epiſcopal Ordination; and of thoſe few, I do not recollect a ſingle Perſon, that regularly conformed to the Church, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for Preferment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:011203_0053_0F94F97366DA0B80"/>THE foreign Divines mentioned by the Doctor, <hi>viz. P. Martyr, M. Bucer,</hi> and <hi>P. Fagius,</hi> who were admitted, without Re-Ordination, not to <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Preferments in the eſtabliſhed Church,</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> who had been <hi>epiſcopally</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and was made at laſt Canon of Chriſt's-Church) but to academical Preferments in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities; came over upon the Invitation of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and were ſettled in their reſpective Places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ordinal</hi> was compiled and eſtabliſhed. As to <hi>Whittingham</hi> and <hi>Travers,</hi> the two other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances pointed out by the Doctor; the former was prefered in the early Part of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, by the Intereſt of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Puritans. Upon the Acceſſion of that Princeſs, ſhe found the Affairs of Religion in a confuſed, precarious State; and the great Object of her Attention was, firſt, to bring about <hi>quietly,</hi> if poſſible, the Re-Eſtabliſhment of the proteſtant Religion, as it had been reformed in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>; and then, to ſecure it againſt the Attempts of the Papiſts. All her political Addreſs was requiſite for conducting this important Work, as it was foreſeen that innumerable Dangers would attend it. In this Condition of Things, it was found neceſſary to encourage and employ all Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately,who were known to be diſaffected to Popery, and were thought able by writing or preaching to combat ſucceſsfully its diſtinguiſhing Principles. <hi>Wittingham</hi> was a Perſon of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and although not lawfully ordained, yet by the Connivance of ſome, and the Intereſt of others, he obtained the Deanry of <hi>Durham. Travers,</hi> a noted Puritan, and a popular Preacher, one of thoſe who went over to <hi>Antwerp</hi> for Ordination, finding the Maſterſhip of the Temple vacant, made
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011203_0054_0F94F977478B4E10"/>
Uſe of all his Intereſt to obtain it; and he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far, that he engaged even the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> to recommend him for the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Archbiſhop oppoſed it, alledging his irregular Behaviour, and the Inſufficiency of his Ordination. The Event was, that <hi>Travers</hi> was ſet aſide, and the Place given to his Competitor, the celebrated <hi>Hooker.</hi> His Friends however made a Shift to keep him in as the Preacher of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon Lecture.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſhewn in what Manner <hi>Whittingham</hi> and <hi>Travers</hi> got their Preferments, I ſhall go on to obſerve, that there were in the former Part of this Reign many Inſtances of <hi>meer Laymen,</hi> without any <hi>Kind</hi> of Ordination, who had the Addreſs to poſſeſs themſelves of Livings in the Church.

If then the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch Men as <hi>Whittingham</hi> and <hi>Travers</hi> are a Proof, that in this Reign the Ordination of Preſbyters was allowed to be valid; thoſe Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011203_0055_0F94F9777054AE40"/>
which were held by the Laity are alſo a Proof, that no Ordination at all was thought to be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>BUT neither of theſe Concluſions ought to be admitted; ſince we know upon the ſtrongeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it was the Doctrine of the Church throughout the whole of the Reign we are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that Ordination was of divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that epiſcopal Ordination was of apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Inſtitution; and that it was an eſtabliſhed Law from the very Beginning of it, that
<q>no Man ſhould be accounted or taken to be a lawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Prieſt or Deacon in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or ſuffered to execute any of the ſaid Functions,</q>
without epiſcopal Ordination. Yet notwithſtanding, it was impoſſible to prevent Tranſgreſſions of it in ſome Inſtances; and ſuch Inſtances ſhew, not what was approved of, but what was overlooked or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, through the Neceſſity of the Times. Theſe Irregularities however were corrected by Degrees, and in a Courſe of Years they were entirely remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In 1586, the Archbiſhop took Cognizance of the Caſe of <hi>Travers,</hi> objecting to
<q>his Ordination at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and his denying to receive the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Miniſtry according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book of Ordination.</q>
                  <hi>Travers</hi> drew up the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his Conduct, and preſented them to the Lord Treaſurer, who ſent them to the Archbiſhop. The Archbiſhop returned them with ſhort margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Animadverſions, ſome of which I will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, for the Uſe of Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> and his Friends.
<q>As to that Aſſertion, that Miniſters lawfully made in any Church of ſound Profeſſion in the Faith, were acknowledged ſuch in any other; and this to be the univerſal and perpetual Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011203_0056_0F94F977D640E640"/>
the Archbiſhop made this only Exception; <hi>always excepting ſuch Churches as allowed of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and executed it.</hi> Then as to his Examples, this was the Archbiſhop's Animadverſion—that he knew no ſuch foreign Miniſters executing their Miniſtry here; but if there were, their Cauſe was far differing from his—That Mr. <hi>Whitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> had he lived, had been deprived, without ſpecial Grace and Diſpenſation; although his Cauſe and Mr. <hi>Travers</hi>'s were nothing like.— That the Laws of this Realm required, that ſuch as were to be allowed as Miniſters in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be ordained by a Biſhop, and ſubſcribe to the Articles before him. Laſtly, whereas <hi>Travers</hi> had ſaid, that the laſt Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was acquainted with his Manner of calling to the Miniſtry; and ſo was the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and were contented he ſhould preach at the Temple (as he had done now almoſt ſix Years) and that the preſent Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop himſelf had not taken any Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; our Archbiſhop ſaid, that this was to abuſe their Patience, and that he never allowed of his Kind of calling, neither could he allow of it<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 252.</note>.</q>

               <p>I MUST now return back to p. 10, to examine the Doctor's other <hi>capital</hi> Aſſertion. <hi>It is in Fact true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that both in King Henry the Eighth's Time, and in Edward the Sixth's, the Biſhops took out Commiſſions from the Crown like other</hi> STATE-OFFICERS, <hi>for the exerciſing their ſpiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; in which they acknowledge, that</hi> ALL SORTS <hi>of Juriſdiction, eccleſiaſtical as well as civil, flow</hi> ORIGINALLY <hi>from the regal Power, as from a</hi> SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME HEAD.—<hi>Among the Particulars of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power given them by this Commiſſion, is that of</hi> ORDAINING <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> Now what the Doctor means by this and more to the ſame Purpoſe, may be gathered from p. 57, where he affirms, without Ambiguity, that <hi>as to Authority purely Eccleſiaſtical, there is no ſuch Thing in the Church of England.</hi> And he intimates p. 11, that ſuch Authority was never claimed by the Church, <hi>until the</hi> aforeſaid

And thus the Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is made to be altogether a PARLIAMENTARY RELIGION.</p>
               <p>THIS Gentleman muſt be ſuppoſed not to be ignorant to whom he is indebted for the Weapons of his literary Warfare; but it may not be amiſs to obſerve to others, that this general Charge againſt our Reformers was firſt drawn up by <hi>Bellarmine, Saunders, Doleman, Harding,</hi> and other Papiſts, in Revenge for their rejecting the Pope's Supremacy; and that the Enemies of <hi>revealed Religion</hi> have all along endeavoured to ſupport them in the Charge.</p>
               <p>THE Point has been ſtrenuouſly laboured by <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> the moſt inveterate of the <hi>deiſtical</hi> Tribe; and ſome of our late Adverſaries have not been aſhamed to follow him as their Leader.

Now, that theſe two Bands, the Papiſts and Deiſts, ſhould be re-inforced by ſome of the hot-headed extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Writers on the Side of the Diſſenters, is not to be wondered at; but that a Man of the Doctor's Coolneſs and Prudence ſhould be ſeen to
<q>go down</q>
to theſe
<q>Philiſtines to ſharpen <hi>his</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock,</q>
is a little ſurprizing. But without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſo obvious a Reflection, I will proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Doctrine of the King's Supremacy, as maintained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

whether it is fairly repreſented in the above-quoted Paſſages.</p>
               <p>I HAVE already proved that the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> has conſtantly aſſerted an <hi>Authority purely Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> derived from Chriſt as its proper Source and Author; and conſequently not from the Crown, or the civil Conſtitution. Thus, for Inſtance, the Power of Ordination, and Authority to adminiſter the Word and Sacraments, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been exerciſed upon the Footing of a <hi>divine Appointment.</hi> The Church alſo claims a farther
<q>Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Controverſies of Faith,</q>
as belonging to her by Virtue of this Appointment; which Claim has been acknowledged and ſupported, by all our Kings and Queens ſince the Reformation<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Authority and Authenticity of the <hi>firſt</hi> Clauſe of <hi>Art.</hi> XX, clearly proved and defended in <hi>A Vindication of the Church of England,</hi> &amp;c. in Anſwer to <hi>Prieſtcraft in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> See alſo <hi>Bennet's Hiſtory of the Articles,</hi> and <hi>Collier's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </note>. Unleſs therefore the Church is inconſiſtent with herſelf, and believes an Authority to be derived from Chriſt, which She believes <hi>not</hi> to be derived from him, but from another Fountain; She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold that the regal Power and Supremacy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Matters of this Nature, any farther than to controul and regulate the external Exerciſe of ſuch ſpiritual Authority.</p>
               <p>IN what Senſe ſhe maintains the Doctrine of the King's Supremacy, is expreſſed with great Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Preciſion in her 37th Article.
<q>The Queen's Majeſty hath the chief Power in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and other her Dominions,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011203_0060_0F94F97B102AAFE8"/>
unto whom the chief Government of all Eſtates of this Realm, whether they be eccleſiaſtical or civil, in all Cauſes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be ſubject to any foreign Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereas we attribute to the Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the chief Government, by which Titles we underſtand the Minds of ſome <hi>ſlanderous</hi> Folks to be offended; we give not to our Princes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which Thing the Injunctions alſo lately ſet forth by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Queen do moſt plainly teſtify: But that only Prerogative which we ſee to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scripture by God himſelf, that is, that they ſhould rule all Eſtates and Degrees committed to their Charge by God, whether they be Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical or Temporal, and reſtrain with the civil Sword the ſtubborn and evil Doers.</q>
More Power than this, we give not to our Princes; and leſs, I believe, is not claimed by the ſupreme civil Governors of any Kingdom or Republic upon Earth. In the INJUNCTIONS to which the Article refers, the Queen ſays:
<q>Her Majeſty neither doth, nor ever will challenge any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, other than that was challenged and lately uſed by the ſaid noble Kings of famous Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, and King <hi>Edward</hi> VI, which is and was of ancient Time due to the imperial Crown of this Realm: That is, under God to have the Sovereignty and Rule over all Manner of Perſons born within theſe her Realms, Dominions and Countries, of what Eſtate, either Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, ſoever they be; ſo as no other foreign Power ſhall or ought to have any Superiority over them.</q>

                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:011203_0061_0F94F980705039A0"/>SUCH Power as is attributed to the Crown in the <hi>Article,</hi> and explained in the <hi>Injunctions,</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve the Independency of every State and Kingdom at all Times; and the vigorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of ſuch Power was found to be peculiarly neceſſary to carry on the Reformation, wherever it was attempted. JOHN, Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> reſolving to reſcue himſelf and his Dominions from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontif, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> aſſumed to himſelf that Supremacy in eccleſiaſtical Matters, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> allows to be the Right of all ſovereign Princes. In Order to ſecure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this new Eſtabliſhment, he ordered a Body of eccleſiaſtical Laws to be drawn up by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and to be proclaimed by Heralds throughout his Dominions. This was in 1527, while our King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, was in Subjection to the papal Yoke, and not long after he had drawn his Pen to defend the Pope's Cauſe againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Luther.</hi> The next Care of the Elector was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place all ſuch of the Clergy as were either vicious or illiterate, and to ſupply the Churches with ſuch as were moſt eminent for their Piety and Abilities. By theſe wiſe and ſpirited Meaſures, the proteſtant Religion was firmly eſtabliſhed in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came able to ſupport itſelf againſt all the Force and Arts of its Adverſaries. The illuſtrious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this Elector was ſoon followed by other Princes and States in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the like Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs attended their Proceedings<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Moſheim</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory Vol. II. p. 37.</note>. The ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was alſo followed in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as the Reſolution was taken to reform the eſtabliſhed Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:011203_0062_0F94F98097E64D28"/>IF we examine our 37th Article, it is evident that the main Deſign of it is to guard againſt the Juriſdiction of the Pope, and to ſecure to our Princes that Supremacy in eccleſiaſtical Matters, which the reformed <hi>German</hi> Princes and States had ſo ſucceſsfully exerted, and which, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, is one of the moſt ancient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Rights of the Crown. At the ſame Time it is farther evident, both from the <hi>Article</hi> and the Queen's <hi>Injunctions,</hi> that the Church was believed to have certain Powers of a ſpiritual Nature, which this Supremacy does not include, and which our Princes are ſo far from pretending to convey, that all Manner of Right to exerciſe them in their own Perſons is therein formally and expreſsly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. If Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had believed that all eccleſiaſtical Authority flow'd from the Crown, contrary to her own ſolemn Declarations; there was a Time wherein She could have hardly avoided to betray theſe Sentiments: I mean, after the Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhops, when ſhe undertook to ſupply the vacant Sees with Men of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. It was with great Difficulty that She was able to procure proper Perſons to perform the firſt Conſecration; and had She been of Opinion that She had the Power in herſelf, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that, in thoſe Circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She would have immediately and directly inveſted Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> with the archiepiſcopal Office. But to ſuch a Power She had no Pretenſions herſelf; and She believed, that neither <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, nor <hi>Edward</hi> VI, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to more, than
<q>under God to have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Rule over all Manner of Perſons,</q>
whether Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:011203_0063_0F94F980C563BAF0"/>But Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> ſays, that in both thoſe Reigns <hi>the Biſhops took out Commiſſions from the Crown like other State-Officers.</hi> The moſt exceptionable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this Nature, in either Reign, was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Bonner,</hi> in 1539. The Commiſſion at large is in <hi>Burnet's Collection,</hi> and the Subſtance of it, as tranſlated and abridged by him, is as follows:
<q>That ſince all Juriſdiction both eccleſiaſtical and civil flowed from the King as ſupreme Head, and he was the Foundation of all Power; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thoſe who exerciſed it only at the King's Courteſy, gratefully to acknowledge, that they had it only of his Bounty; and to declare that they would deliver it up again, when it ſhould pleaſe him to call for it<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Ref. Vol. I. p. 267.</note>.</q>
This, I believe, muſt be the Commiſſion which the Doctor alludes to. He is pleaſed to ſay that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> (in the Plural) took out ſuch a Commiſſion, and affirms that <hi>it is in Fact true</hi>; but Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> after all his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſays,
<q>whether the other Biſhops took out ſuch a Commiſſion from this King, I find not.</q>
The Language of this Commiſſion, as has been acknowledged, appears to be exceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but its Meaning may notwithſtanding be harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. What was intended by it muſt be learnt from the public Declarations of thoſe Times relating to the Subject. And <hi>it is in Fact true,</hi> that it was then the Doctrine of the King, of the Biſhops, of the Nation, that Authority to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and to perform other ſpiritual Offices, is derived, not from the Crown, but from Chriſt. This Doctrine was clearly and fully maintained in the "Inſtitution of a Chriſtian Man," as has been ſhewn from <hi>Collier.</hi> In the <hi>Cabala</hi> or <hi>Scrinia Sacra,</hi> is publiſhed a Letter of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, to the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011203_0064_0F94F985145D2A50"/>
of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> explaining the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; but in Language which may appear ſomewhat uncouth at this Day. Herein ſays the King;
<q>If you take <hi>ſpiritualibus</hi> for ſpiritual Men, that is to ſay, Prieſts, their good Acts, and Deeds <hi>worldly</hi>; in all this, both we, and all Princes, be, at this Day, Chief and Head; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe Ordinance, either in general or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, they be ordered and governed. In all thoſe Articles concerning the Perſons of Prieſts, their Laws, their Acts (whoſe Perſons and Laws he here alſo, as in the Statute-Book, calls <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>) and Order of living, foraſmuch as they be indeed all temporal, and concerning this preſent Life only; in thoſe we be (as we be called) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in this Realm, <hi>Caput</hi>; and becauſe there is no Man above us here, we be indeed <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Caput:</hi> As to ſpiritual Things, meaning by them the Sacraments, (including Orders) being by God ordained, as Inſtruments of Efficacy and Strength, whereby Grace is, of his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs confered upon his People; foraſmuch as they be no <hi>worldly</hi> nor <hi>temporal</hi> Things, they have no worldly nor temporal Head; but only Chriſt did inſtitute them, by whoſe Ordinance they be miniſtred here by mortal Men, elect, choſen, and ordered, as God hath willed, for that Purpoſe, who be the Clergy; who for the Time they do that, and in that Reſpect, <hi>tanquam Miniſtri verſantur in his, quae Hominum Poteſtati non ſubjciuntur; in quibus, ſi malè verſantur ſine Scandalo, Deum Ultorem habent; ſi cum Scandalo, Hominum Cognitionis et Vindictae eſt.</hi>—Such Things, as although they be amongſt Men, yet they be indeed <hi>divina, quoniam ſupra nos, ſunt ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil

                     </note>.</q>
It is therefore evident, that what was meant to be given by the King, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Biſhops, was no more than a Liberty, a <hi>legal</hi> Authority, to exerciſe their ſpiritual Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and a Juriſdiction, relating to Matters teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, matrimonial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is called ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, becauſe it is committed to ſpiritual Perſons. And ſuch Juriſdiction as this, undoubtedly flows from the Crown, and it becomes thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it, to acknowledge that they hold it of the King's Bounty, and to deliver it up when he calls for it, if they have received it on that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For an Illuſtration of this Matter, let it be conſidered, that every Man is, in ſome Senſe, a King in his own Houſe and Family; and no Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman has a Right to come into it to perform any eccleſiaſtical Offices, to adminiſter Baptiſm for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, without his Leave and Conſent. Upon him it altogether depends, whether the Clergyman ſhall have a proper and <hi>lawful</hi> Authority to perform this Office in his Family. But is it not evident, that the giving him that Authority, is a very different Thing from inveſting him with the general Power to adminiſter the Sacraments? In like Manner, as a Kingdom may be conſidered as a large Family, the King is the political Father of this Family, and as ſuch is ſupreme over all Perſons belonging to it, whether ſpiritual or temporal. And without his Conſent or Authority, no Biſhop or eccleſiaſtical Perſon can lawfully officiate within his Dominions. But the giving this Authority by Commiſſion, or in any other Way, does not convey to any Man his ſacred Character, but always ſuppoſes him to have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011203_0066_0F94F986EDBA2958"/>
been previouſly inveſted with it, by Virtue of a Commiſſion from CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THE above Explanation of the eccleſiaſtical Power claimed by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, as belonging to the regal Supremacy, the Words will fairly admit of; and in this Senſe they are eaſily reconciled with other Declarations that were made, about the ſame Time, in Acts of Parliament, and in public Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of different Kinds. Nay, the above Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is neceſſary, in Order to make this very Commiſſion to <hi>Bonner</hi> conſiſtent with itſelf. For beſides the Juriſdiction conveyed by it, from the Crown, it acknowledges another Sort of Power to have been committed to him by <hi>divine Authority,</hi> and that this was evident from <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> The Words are: <hi>Praeter et ultra ea quae tibi ex ſacris Literis</hi> DIVINITUS <hi>commiſſa eſſe dignoſcuntur.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, from 1548 to 1553, Biſhops were commonly conſtituted by the King's <hi>Letters Patent.</hi>
                  <q>By theſe Letters Patents, it is clear, ſays Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> that the epiſcopal Function was acknowledged to be of <hi>divine Appointment,</hi> and that the Perſon was no other Way named by the King, than as Lay-Patrons preſent to Livings; only the Biſhop was <hi>legally</hi> authorized, in ſuch a Part of the King's Dominions, to execute that Function which was to be derived to him by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands. Therefore here was no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for denying that ſuch Perſons were true Biſhops, and for ſaying as ſome have done, that they were not from Chriſt, but from the King<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt.

                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:011203_0067_0F94F987940E3760"/>BUT notwithſtanding, Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> has thought fit to ſay, that <hi>among the Particulars of eccleſiaſtical Power given them by this Commiſſion, is that of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Preſbyters.</hi> Now this Aſſertion he borrows from the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman</hi> borrows it from <hi>Tindal,</hi> Author of <hi>the Rights</hi>; and <hi>Tindal,</hi> producing no explicit Form of Words whereby this Power was ever conveyed from the Crown, only <hi>infers</hi> it from the Language of the King's Commiſſion, which has been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered already. The Words of <hi>Tindal</hi> are theſe:
<q>The Juriſdiction any Biſhop has, and his Right to have a Share in the making of eccleſiaſtical Canons, and the Power of <hi>conſtituting inferior Miniſters,</hi> muſt be derived mediately from the Parliament, but immediately from the King, as having the ſupreme executive Power</q>.
The Reader here ſees, that what <hi>Tindal,</hi> by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, had made to be <hi>a Power of conſtituting inferior Miniſters,</hi> the Doctor by a farther Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from his Inference, makes to be <hi>a Power of ordaining Preſbyters</hi>; and thus his Propoſition is eſtabliſhed. It would have been much more to the Purpoſe, if he, or the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> or the Author of <hi>the Rights,</hi> had pointed out to us a ſingle Inſtance of a Preſbyter ordained by Virtue of the King's Commiſſion <hi>only,</hi> by Perſons who had no other Kind of Authority. For if the Commiſſion was given for that Purpoſe, it is ſtrange that it ſhould not have produced the intended Effect in one Inſtance; and if there were any Inſtances of it, it is ſtrange that the Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſuch Writers ſhould not be able to diſcover them.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now ſhewn from our Articles, and the public Declarations of ſuch of our Princes as were more immediately concerned in bringing about the Reformation, that the Supremacy claimed by our
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011203_0068_0F94F988470729F0"/>
Kings, and given to them by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> does by no Means exclude a purely ſpiritual Authority—an Authority which is derived only from Chriſt—which has diſtinct Acts and Offices of its own—and which is incommunicable by the civil Magiſtrate. This Account might be confirmed by Teſtimonies from a continued Succeſſion of the greateſt and beſt Writers, which our Nation has ever afforded. I might alſo produce the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our ſucceeding Princes, down to our own Times; but a full Treatiſe upon the Subject is not my Intention, and I fear the Reader has already been too long detained with it. And yet I muſt beg Leave to exhibit the Teſtimony of James Iſt, ſince the Doctor, from the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> has introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him as ſpeaking the Language, which ſeems to favour his Side of the Queſtion now in Debate. This Prince, among other Things, declared,
<q>that he <hi>always</hi> believed, in Oppoſition to the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Bellarmine,</hi> who denied that Biſhops received their Juriſdiction immediately from God, that Biſhops ought to be in the Church, as being of <hi>apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>divine Ordination</hi>

               <p>SHOULD it now be aſked, what is all this to the Purpoſe of an American Epiſcopate? My Anſwer is, I know not, but—perhaps Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> does. Should it be aſked again, is it any Defence of the <hi>Appeal?</hi> To this I muſt anſwer, I can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is. I ſaid nothing obout the Opinion of our Reformers, upon the Points of Epiſcopacy and the King's Supremacy; and therefore my Vindication of them, can properly be no Vindication
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011203_0069_0F94F98912BEF340"/>
of any Thing I had advanced. It is however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to vindicate the Engliſh Reformation, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Charge of <hi>Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi>; which the late Attacks, occaſioned by the <hi>Appeal,</hi> have made neceſſary in itſelf, and a Duty peculiarly incumbent upon me. But although what has been ſaid, is not properly a Defence of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> yet it is in ſome Degree neceſſary in Order to prepare the Way for defending it, againſt ſuch a Kind of Oppoſition as has been made to it.</p>
               <p>THE Way being thus prepared, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an immediate Defence of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> ſo far as I find it ought to be defended; but with a Mind open to Conviction, and with a Reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, if, upon this Re-examination of the Subject, I ſhall find, by the Aſſiſtance of my Opponents, or by any other Means, that I had fallen into any Miſtakes of Conſequence.</p>
               <p>I BEGAN with obſerving, that
<q>it is an eſſential Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that none have Authority in the Chriſtian Church, but thoſe who derive it from Chriſt, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately.</hi>
                  </q>
To which the Doctor replies: <hi>This is not a Doctrine peculiar to the Engliſh Church. Every other Chriſtian Church, of whatever Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, holds the ſame. The Churches in the Colonies, are certainly of this Opinion.</hi> So far then, it ſeems, we agree; but then he cannot think that an <hi>uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion</hi> is neceſſary to a <hi>mediate</hi> Conveyance of this Authority; ſo that while he owns the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he rejects its unavoidable and inſeparable Conſequence. For when a Thing is to be conveyed from one Perſon to another, not immediately, but by a ſucceſſive Communication through a Number of intermediate Hands; if any one in the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011203_0070_0F94F989DC55BD08"/>
fails of making the Conveyance, the Thing evidently ſtops, and paſſes not on to the Perſon for whom it is intended. Thus for Example; ſhould any Thing be ſent from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and yet be carried no farther than to <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and periſh there, it could never arrive at the Place of its Deſtination. Again: Should I claim a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to any ancient Eſtate, and it ſhould appear, upon Inquiry, that the Chain of Conveyances has been broken before it reached me; my Title will be pronounced to be invalid. Nothing but this uninterrupted Chain of Conveyances is wanting, to intitle me to the beſt Eſtate in the Kingdom. Once more: If a Man is to receive a Commiſſion medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the King; unleſs the Perſon who confers it has been authorized to do ſo, it is evidently not the King's Commiſſion that he receives, but one that is ſpurious. Theſe Caſes are plain, and will hardly be diſputed.</p>
               <p>LET us ſee then, whether an uninterrupted Succeſſion is not as neceſſary to a mediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Authority from Chriſt, as from the King or any other Perſon. If Authority can be conveyed from Chriſt mediately, by a Succeſſion that is interrupted, there muſt be ſomewhere in the Succeſſion a Perſon who can give that which he has not. If the Authority firſt given to A, is to paſs on ſucceſſively to B, to C, to D, and to E; ſhould the Conveyance ſtop or be interrupted at C, ſo that it paſſes not on to D; in that Caſe D does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and therefore cannot convey it to E, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs D is able to give what it has not. Suppoſing the Authority, when it comes down to C, to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated or to ceaſe; unleſs it be renewed, E can never be inveſted with it. The Queſtion then is,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011203_0071_0F94F98A8C55D258"/>
who ſhall renew it? Now all Authority from Chriſt, muſt flow from Chriſt; if it begins, and has its Source ſhort of him, it is not HIS Authority. If he pleaſes to renew it, he may give it immediately to E, or he may give it to D, by him to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to E; and in either Way E may be inveſted with Chriſt's Authority. But now let us ſuppoſe that any Number of 'Men upon Earth,' or that
<q>all the Angels in Heaven</q>
ſhould attempt to renew the Authority of Chriſt, once interrupted and loſt; unleſs a Stream can have a higher Derivation than its Source—unleſs theſe Men or theſe Angels can give what they have not, the Thing is impoſſible. They may give what they have—they may give their own Authority; but Chriſt's Authority they cannot give, unleſs they have received it. And if they have received it, it is not they that renew the Authority, but Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor cries out, <hi>is this the Doctrine of the Church of England?</hi> Whether it be ſo or not, he in Effect tells us that <hi>every other Chriſtian Church, of whatever Denomination, holds</hi> it — that <hi>the Churches in the Colonies, are certainly of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; i. e.</hi> they believe a <hi>mediate</hi> Conveyance of Authority from Chriſt, which neceſſarily implies an unbroken Succeſſion of Conveyers. He appears therefore to have acted inconſiſtently, in treating the general Doctrine of a mediate Conveyance, or, in other Words, an uninterrupted Succeſſion, as if it were ſingular, unſcriptural, abſurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. He may ſay that he meant to explode ſuch a Succeſſion <hi>in the Line of Biſhops</hi> only; but this is not clearly expreſſed. His Words, in ſome Places lead us to believe, and the Arguments of ſome of our Adverſaries force us to conclude, that the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011203_0072_0F94F98B4E95DF18"/>
Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succeſſion in general, without any Limitation, is conſidered by them as abſurd and ridiculous. Whether in particular the Conveyance of Chriſt's Authority, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles down to the preſent Day, has been made only in the Line of Biſhops, is a different Queſtion; and which Way ſoever it may be decided, it affects not the common Principle of an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. And whether it has been made in the Line of Biſhops, depends upon the Deciſion of another Queſtion, which is, whether the Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was originally given to Biſhops only, as an Order ſuperior to Preſbyters. That the Affirmative of this Queſtion is maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have abundantly proved.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor in p. 15, ſays of the Succeſſion for which we contend, that <hi>it is not capable of any good Proof, nor is there any Probability, that ſo long a Chain, runing through ſo many Ages of Ignorance, Violence, and all Kinds of Impoſture, has never once been broke.</hi> But this Aſſertion militates as forcibly againſt the Succeſſion which <hi>the Churches in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies certainly</hi> believe, as againſt the Epiſcopal. As to the Succeſſion in the Line of Biſhops, I am ſtill of Opinion, that
<q>it is incumbent on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors to prove that it has been interrupted<note n="*" place="bottom">One of our weekly Adverſaries ſays, that
<q>in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between Dr. <hi>Hoadly,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and the <hi>Nonjurors,</hi> the Dr. with great Succeſs, refuted this Whim, <hi>viz.</hi> of the uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops.</q>
(<hi>Cent.</hi> Numb. XII.) I am ſo far from being of this Writer's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it appears to me, that Biſhop <hi>Hoadly</hi>'s Notions relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Subject were confuted, by ſome of his Antagoniſts, even to a Demonſtration. Thoſe who attacked the Biſhop, in what is called the <hi>Bangorian</hi> Controverſy, are here indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of as <hi>Nonjurers</hi>; whereas they were, in general, as well affected to the Government, and gave as good Proofs of it, as any Men in the Kingdom; and I can recollect no more than one Nonjuror that appeared in the Controverſy. What does the <hi>Centinel</hi> think of Archbiſhop <hi>Potter,</hi> of the Biſhops <hi>Hare</hi> and <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and of the Doctors <hi>Snape, Rogers</hi> and <hi>Stebbing,</hi> who diſtinguiſhed themſelves on the Occaſion; to ſay nothing of the Body of the national Clergy repreſented in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, by their very learned Committee, complained of Biſhop <hi>Hoadly,</hi> among other Things, for
<q>the Contempt thrown <hi>by him</hi> upon a regular Succeſſion of the Miniſtry, and of the epiſcopal Order in particular?</q>
Were theſe all Nonjurors and Jacobites? Such Nonjurors and Jacobites are the American Clergy; among whom I know not one, who is not firmly attached to his Majeſty King GEORGE'S Perſon, Family and Government, or who, notwithſtanding ſome ſly Hints to the contrary, looks upon himſelf to have any more Concern with the Deſcendants of <hi>James</hi> II, if there be any, than with the Deſcendants of <hi>Harold</hi> or <hi>Edgar Atheling.</hi>

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:011203_0073_0F94F9A5D098FA48"/>
For we know, by the beſt hiſtorical Evidence, that it has been the univerſal Practice of the Church, from the Time of the Apoſtles to the preſent Hour, to acknowledge none for Biſhops, who were not ordained by other Biſhops. We know, from the very Nature of the Office, as well as from Hiſtory, that the Conſecration of Biſhops was always a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſolemn Act, of which there were many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes—that every ſuch Conſecration was eſteemed to be a Matter of ſuch Importance, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it was immediately propagated and carried even to diſtant Places—and that, in diſputed Caſes, it was eaſy to diſcover, whether the Perſon was, in Reality, a Biſhop or not; or, ſuppoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that no one would receive epiſcopal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration from ſuch Hands. We know alſo from Scripture, that if ſuch a Succeſſion is as neceſſary, as, upon a ſpeculative Examination, it appears to be, Chriſt has promiſed to preſerve and continue it "to the End of the World." With theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011203_0074_0F94F9A95730FB30"/>
Kinds of Evidence we are abundantly ſatisfied; and until the Objectors are able to bring <hi>poſitive Proofs</hi> that the Succeſſion has been interrupted, we ſhall not recede from the Claim.</p>
               <p>THE only Proof of this Nature attempted by the Doctor is in a Note, where he gives this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: <hi>Mr. Petoy the Hiſtorian, ſays, that the Church of England, as well as the Scotch Church, was at firſt planted and governed, without Biſhops until Biſhops were ſent from Rome. And there cannot be any good Evidence produced, that there were any Biſhops in England, until Auſtin the Monk was ſent from Rome.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Burn,</hi> a much better Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſays,
<q>The ancient <hi>Britons</hi> are believed to have had at leaſt one <hi>Archiepiſcopal</hi> See before the Times of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk, viz.</hi> at <hi>Caerleon,</hi> or (as ſome will have it) at <hi>Landaff</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtical Law, Tit. BISHOPS.</note>.</q>
And Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> to whom more Attention may be paid by ſome People for the Sake of his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> having carefully ſtudied <hi>the Antiquities of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Churches,</hi> in his large Work on that Subject, ſays in p. 77.
<q>I ſee no Reaſon to queſtion a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Biſhops here from the firſt founding of a Chriſtian Church.—Although, by the Loſs of Records of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, we cannot draw down the Succeſſion of Biſhops from the Apoſtles Time, yet we have great Reaſon to preſume ſuch a Succeſſion, when upon the firſt ſummoning a Council by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> three <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Biſhops appeared; one out of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; as they did in other Parts.</q>
Again, to the ſame Purpoſe in p. 83.
<q>Although we cannot deduce a lineal Succeſſion of Biſhops, as they could in other Churches, where Writings were
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011203_0075_0F94F9A9841808E0"/>
preſerved, yet as ſoon as through the Church's Peace they came to have Intercourſe with foreign Churches (as in the Council of <hi>Arles</hi>) they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with a proportionable Number of Biſhops with thoſe of other Provinces; and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was not in the leaſt diſputed among them, they ſubſcribing to the Sentence and Canons as others did.</q>
But after all, ſuppoſing the Caſe to have been as is repreſented by Mr. <hi>Petoy</hi>; it affects not the Authority of our preſent Biſhops. If they derive their Succeſſion from the Biſhops that were ſent over in the ſixth Century, their not having received it from Biſhops of the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches is no better Proof of its Invalidity, than their not having received it from the ancient <hi>Druids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FARTHER Objection is made to the uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Succeſſion claimed for our Biſhops, on Account of its <hi>expoſing the Church and Religion of Jeſus Chriſt to open Ridicule,</hi> p. 16. Now I am unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the general Doctrine can appear ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to any that underſtand it; but ſhould it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I cannot help it. To ſome Perſons, many other Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion appear to be ridiculous; but will this be thought a ſufficient Reaſon for Chriſtians to explode them? Will the Doctor be willing to regulate the Syſtem of his own Belief, by this Standard? Do <hi>the Churches in the Colonies</hi> eſtabliſh Ridicule for the Teſt of Truth? That the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not, I am very certain. But ſtill, that the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succeſſion in the Line of Biſhops ſhould be more ridiculous, than of ſuch a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Line of Preſbyters, is to me utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:011203_0076_0F94F9AD22C3A880"/>I COME now to conſider the great popular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that this Doctrine unchurches all the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Proteſtants who are without epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the Preſbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and our own Diſſenters; on which Account the Doctor ſays of it, that <hi>inſtead of deſerving a ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, it may reaſonably excite the Contempt of all.</hi> I ſuſpect he found it much eaſier to treat it with Contempt, than to give it a ſerious Confutation; and yet as it ſtood ſo much in his Way, it might have been well worth his while to have removed it, if he could, although at the Expence of a <hi>ſerious Confutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEFORE I anſwer directly to the Objection, I beg Leave to remind him of Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Poſition, that
<q>the ill Conſequences drawn from Opinions are not to be charged on all that hold them, unleſs they do likewiſe own thoſe Conſequences.</q>
Now, if it be a Conſequence of the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succeſſion in the Line of Biſhops, that many of the foreign Proteſtants are unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet it is a Conſequence that has ſeldom been owned by the Advocates for the Doctrine. Is it then candid in the Doctor to charge us with this Conſequence? Would he be willing to be treated in this Manner himſelf? He is generally <hi>thought</hi> to be calviniſtic in his Principles, and to hold the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation in the Senſe of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s Catechiſm. Now he need not be informed, that there are many Perſons who believe, the unavoidable Conſequences of thoſe Doctrines to be, that <hi>Man is no moral Agent,</hi> and of Courſe <hi>no accountable Creature</hi>—that <hi>the Supreme Being is the Author of all Sin,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Conſequences, I dare ſay, he diſowns, and looks upon the Imputation of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011203_0077_0F94F9AF1A0919A0"/>
them as injurious. Why then will he impute to us a Conſequence, which we neither acknowledge nor believe to be included in our Principle, in the Senſe of our Opponents?</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed immediately to the Objection: If there is ſuch a Thing in the Church as Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Chriſt, not immediately confered, but mediately derived down to the preſent Age; the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers is as clear, as that the whole is greater than its Parts. That the Power of Ordination was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally given to Biſhops only, as an Order of Men ſuperior to that of Preſbyters, is a Doctrine which we believe upon the Evidence of Scripture. And that for many Ages this Power was exerciſed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and was not exerciſed or claimed by any other Perſons, and conſequently had no Exiſtence but in the Line of Biſhops, is as certain, as the Concurrence of civil and eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory can make it. Whatever therefore may be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Doctrine, with Regard to ourſelves or others, our Belief of it appears to us to be founded upon invincible Evidence. And whenever any Doctrine appears to us to be evidently <hi>true,</hi> we think we ought to believe it, whether it be <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> (if Charity may be predicated of Doctrines) or not.</p>
               <p>AS to thoſe proteſtant Churches which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biſhops; while this continues to be their Caſe, they muſt be manifeſtly without that Authority which Chriſt has appropriated to Biſhops. But then ſuch is our <hi>Charity</hi> towards them, that we <hi>believe,</hi> upon the Evidence of their frequent and ſolemn Declarations, that this is rather their Misfortune
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011203_0078_0F94F9AF52EF59E0"/>
than their Fault; and therefore we <hi>hope</hi> (to uſe the Words of <hi>Bogerman,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> upon the ſame Subject) <hi>that God will be merciful to them.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> has always treated all the foreign proteſtant Churches with a kind and ſiſterly Affection. She indeed
<q>holds the Neceſſity of Biſhops,</q>
but not that Biſhops are neceſſary to ſuch Churches as are unable to obtain them. In like Manner, She holds the Neceſſity of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not that they are neceſſary to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. She eſteems the Sacraments to be no more than "<hi>generally</hi> neceſſary to Salvation," and not <hi>univerſally</hi> ſo; or, as She expreſſes it in ſpeaking of Baptiſm, She maintains
<q>the great Neceſſity of that Sacrament <hi>where it may be had.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus, the Neceſſity of Biſhops is no more than a <hi>general</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; or, in other Words, Biſhops, according to the Belief of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary only <hi>where they may be had.</hi> And if they are an Inſtitution of Chriſt, intended for the ſtanding Uſe of the Church, leſs than this cannot be believed, unleſs in a ſingle Caſe hereafter to be excepted. The Inſtitutions of Chriſt we are bound to obſerve, in Proportion to our Abilities and Opportunities, and he has promiſed his Bleſſing to us in the Uſe of them; but where theſe are wanting, our Deſire of obeying him will undoubtedly be accepted, inſtead of Obedience. Where Chriſt has directed us in what Manner to act, his Direction is the Rule of our Duty; but it is no Rule to himſelf, and, whenever he pleaſes, he may accompliſh to us the Ends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our having made Uſe of the Means or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>WHETHER any of the foreign Churches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deſirous of Biſhops, are in Reality unable
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011203_0079_0F94F9B00FC3E380"/>
to obtain them, is beſt known to themſelves. It might appear otherwiſe to us, but they have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be true; and certainly it is more <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to believe, than to diſbelieve, them. To prove the Sincerity of their Declarations, it is hoped, that whenever the Providence of God ſhall give them an Opportunity of obtaining a proteſtant Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, they will readily and thankfully embrace it, as one of thoſe Churches has already done, ſetting before them an Example worthy of all Imitation.
<q>The Proteſtants of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that Ordinations in which Preſbyters, and not a Biſhop, ſhould create another Preſbyter, would not be lawful; and were in Doubt how they ſhould be able to maintain ſuch an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to others when they oppoſed, or to their own People, when they queſtioned it;— ſent Deputies to the Remains of the ancient <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by whoſe Biſhops theſe Deputies were conſecrated to the epiſpocal office, which they have ever ſince tranſmitted to their Succeſſors<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>BUT if any of the foreign Churches have at length formed an Opinion that Biſhops are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and are in a Diſpoſition to refuſe an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate if they had it in their Power, which is the Caſe of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; although we cannot but condemn ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and unſcriptural Conduct, yet we mean not to exclude them from our Charity, nor do we deſire to degrade them from the Rank of Chriſtians. For beſides the Caſes of Inability already mentioned, we believe that the Goodneſs of God may be alſo
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011203_0080_0F94F9B0CD9372D8"/>
extended to Caſes of honeſt and involuntary Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Where Men, through the Force of Prejudice or of any imperceptible Bias, miſtake the Matter of their Duty, while they are earneſtly deſirous of knowing and performing it, we hope that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their Hearts will be allowed, in a great Meaſure, to atone for the Errors of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. If a Perſon, duly qualified for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Office, ſhould endeavour to obtain the King's Commiſſion, but through a Miſtake ſhould receive a fictitious one in its Stead; although ſuch a Commiſſion is not the King's, and all his public Acts in Conſequence of it are ſtrictly <hi>illegal,</hi> yet a good King would be diſpoſed to overlook it, and to ratify thoſe Proceedings which were invalid in themſelves. In the ſame Manner, although we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Preſbyterian Ordination does not convey Chriſt's Commiſſion, which he was pleaſed to lodge in other Hands; yet as ſome Perſons honeſtly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch Authority as is conveyed by it for his Commiſſion, and by Virtue thereof endeavour to execute his Laws and Purpoſes relating to his Church, we hope the Irregularity of the Conduct will be forgiven them.</p>
               <p>INDEED Perſons of the ſame Spirit with that which governs ſome of our <hi>American</hi> Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, would probably ſay of it, in the Doctor's Language, that <hi>it is a vile Affront and Abomination to Chriſt,</hi> as it undoubtedly is when wilful and preſumptous; but I cannot believe that, in any Inſtance, Chriſt will receive what is ſincerely intended to be an Act of Obedience, as an Affront and an Abomination. It concerns us to inquire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and with the greateſt Care, after the Will of our bleſſed Maſter, and if poſſible not to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011203_0081_0F94F9B260A5E518"/>
it; but after all, if we ſhould unfortunately ſtill miſtake it, we have the Happineſs to know, that he is not extreme to mark what has been done amiſs, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially through Ignorance. We believe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have been inſtituted by Chriſt, as Means "generally neceſſary to Salvation;" but becauſe the People called Quakers, through a miſtaken Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are without the Sacraments, are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all the worthy and pious Perſons of that religious Denomination, ſhall fail of Salvation? And yet if our Opponents believe in the Manner that they argue, they muſt look upon the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Quakers upon Earth, as incapable of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The Truth is, whoever believes in Chriſt, and endeavours to obey him, however miſtaken he may have been in ſome Inſtances of his Obedience, we truſt will be accepted. Whoever makes it the Buſineſs of his Life to fulfil the Conditions of the Goſpel-Covenant, notwithſtanding any apparent or unknown Defects in the Performance of his Duty, may expect the Bleſſings of that Covenant, through the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. There are undoubtedly many ſuch Perſons, among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of every Denomination.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding, Mens Sincerity in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of erroneous Principles and in Practices formed thereupon, can never be equal to Sincerity in right Practices eſtabliſhed upon juſt Principles. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Heathen or Mahometan is by no Means to be conſidered as upon a Level with a ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and among Chriſtians, we muſt give the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thoſe that come neareſt to what we believe to be the true Standard of Faith and Practice, on Suppoſition that their Sincerity is equal. A Man who imagines he has the King's Commiſſion, but
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011203_0082_0F94F9BE81C95DF0"/>
has it not in Reality, may endeavour to execute the King's Pleaſure, and otherwiſe act the Part of a good Subject, and as ſuch he may be treated by his Sovereign; but ſtill, an authentic Commiſſion is a better Thing than one that is ſpurious. And it greatly concerns every Man bearing a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Authenticity and Legality of which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are made, to examine carefully in what Manner, and from what Authority, he has receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>THUS I have ventured, perhaps more freely than prudently, to expreſs my own Sentiments on this delicate Subject, and the Subſtance of them may be reduced to the following Propoſitions: The Commiſſion to ordain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, can be derived only from Chriſt—this Commiſſion was originally given excluſively to Biſhops—it has been brought down to the preſent Age by a regular uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops—thoſe who are without Biſhops are conſequently without this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion—notwithſtanding, where the Want of this Commiſſion has been fairly owing to the Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability of obtaining it, it will not be imputed as criminal—and farther, where there is an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obtaining it, and Men neglect it, through a miſtaken, but honeſt, Belief, that they are already in Poſſeſſion of it, it is hoped that the Goodneſs of God will overlook the Defect.</p>
               <p>SHOULD I now be charged with wanting Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I muſt try to bear it as well as I can. I am conſcious that what I have ſaid, has been offered with a Diſpoſition that is friendly to the whole human Race, by no Means excluſively of thoſe, upon whom it bears hardeſt; and I hope it is not inconſiſtent
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011203_0083_0F94F9BEA7CA5720"/>
with the Charity of a Chriſtian, which does not require us to believe contrary to Evidence, but only to put the moſt favourable Conſtruction upon Men's Actions, which they will fairly admit of. It would be well for the World, if we all cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated this divine Temper more than we do. We ſhould then take a Pleaſure in thinking, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and writing of each other, as well as we can; and we ſhould be careful not to carry on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, when they ſhould happen to ariſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe wherein Religion is concerned, with the Malignity and Ferocity of Barbarians. If we were all under the Influence of that genuine Charity, which the Goſpel ſo clearly explains, and injoins, and inſpires, we ſhould not admire a Writer for ſaying the bittereſt and ſevereſt Things of thoſe that differ from us, however materially; and I much queſtion, whether a large, ill-natured, abuſive Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, written profeſſedly with the Deſign of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to believe, that
<q>the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Church of Jeſus Chriſt, are Conſtitutions of a <hi>quite</hi> different Nature,</q>
would have run through ſo many Re-Impreſſions in this Country, and the Author have been ſo frequently mentioned with ſingular Marks of Reſpect and Approbation.</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed: The Doctor objects, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Line of Biſhops, <hi>if the popiſh Biſhops, at the Reformation, had ſtuck to their own Principles, and diſcontinued the Succeſſion of the Miniſtry by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to conſecrate, or ordain any but thoſe of their own Communion,</hi> it would have been the Duty of Proteſtants to have contented themſelves, without public Worſhip and the Ordinances of Religion. I believe the popiſh Biſhops always ſtuck to their
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011203_0084_0F94F9BFEBF31940"/>
own Principles ſo far, as not to conſecrate or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain any but thoſe of their own Communion. The Doctor's Suppoſition therefore will not anſwer the Purpoſe without another to ſecond it, namely, that none of the popiſh Biſhops, ordained at the Time of the Reformation, had turned Proteſtants after their Ordination; for if they had, the Succeſſion might have been continued to us by ſuch reformed Biſhops, notwithſtanding the Refuſal of the popiſh Biſhops to ordain any but thoſe of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And while we are ſuppoſing, we may put the Caſe, upon other Principles, that all the popiſh <hi>Preſbyters</hi> had refuſed to ordain any but Perſons of their own Communion; and it will equally prove, that it would have been the Duty of Proteſtants, not to have formed themſelves into religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. There is no guarding any Cauſe or any Argument, againſt ſuch Suppoſitions as theſe. But why muſt we have been without a Succeſſion, if we had not received it from that Quarter? Might we not have applied to the <hi>Creek Church,</hi> or to the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and have received it from them, as the <hi>Bohemians</hi> afterwards did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT the worſt of the Doctrine of an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Succeſſion is ſtill behind; for it is derived through the Biſhops of Rome, who for a hundred Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were, as Baronius confeſſes,</hi>
                  <q>Monſters for Ignorance, Luſt, Pride and Luxury.</q>
Now I cannot conceive that Chriſt's Authority is more contaminated by a Derivation through the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than it would have been, had it been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived through the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe moral Characters were as infamous as thoſe of the Biſhops. But it is a ſtrange Conceit, that the perſonal Defects of the Miniſters of Religion, ſhould invalidate their
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011203_0085_0F94F9C0913F15B8"/>
Adminiſtrations. It is utterly inconceiveable that either the Ignorance, or the Pride, or the Luſt, or the Luxury of the popiſh Biſhops, or all of them together, could render the Commiſſion of Chriſt in their Hands ineffectual; provided we mean by it any. Thing different from their moral Integrity. This Matter is put in a proper Light by Bp. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
                  <q>Though we have ſeparated from many Errors and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in particular have thrown out many ſuperſtitious Rites out of the Forms of Ordination, that we might reduce theſe to a primitive Simplicity; yet as we acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds ſtill the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion; ſo we confeſs She retains the Eſſentials of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—Therefore we do not annul their Orders, but receive ſuch as come from that Church, and look upon them as true Prieſts by the Ordination they got among them, and ſuch were our firſt Reformers, from whom we have derived our Ordination <note n="†" place="bottom">Vindication of the Ordinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 61.</note>
                  </q>.</p>
               <p>I KNEW very well what the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> whom the Doctor calls <hi>one of the beſt Writers upon the Subject in Controverſy,</hi> ſaid, about our calling the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in our Homilies, <hi>a Harlot, an old withered Harlot,</hi> &amp;c. without the Aſſiſtance of his long Extract: and I know very well what Mr. <hi>White</hi> ſaid in Anſwer to it. But to my great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the Doctor appears to be intirely unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. <hi>White's Defences</hi> of his <hi>Three Letters,</hi> againſt the Attacks of that <hi>Gentleman.</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give him, by Way of Specimen, Part of his Reply to the Paſſage under Conſideration.
<q>We indeed, ſays Mr. <hi>White,</hi> for our Parts are
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011203_0086_0F94F9C16EE98198"/>
not ſo nice, as to decline calling her (the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) by her proper Name <hi>a Harlot,</hi> when there is reaſonable Occaſion for it. But here, it is only a ſcolding Word, and brought in without any Reaſon, as contributing nothing towards putting an End to the Controverſy between us. For <hi>Harlot</hi> as She is, She may bring forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as an honeſt and virtuous Matron, and ſometimes Children far better than their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And if I muſt derive my ſpiritual Pedigree from <hi>a Harlot,</hi> I had rather it ſhould be <hi>an old whithered one,</hi> of an ancient and honourable Line, than a <hi>young Strumpet,</hi> of no Name and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and who came into the World but Yeſterday<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Second Defence,</hi> p. 52.</note>.</q>
In a Word, I ſee no Reaſon why <hi>Orders</hi> derived from the Papiſts ſhould, on that Account, be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, any more than that <hi>Arguments</hi> derived from the Papiſts ſhould be ſo: And this very Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Ordinations, appears to have had a popiſh Origin. For a very reputable Author, who perhaps was as well acquainted with the Arts and Schemes of the Papiſts as any Man of his Time, informs us, that
<q>the Jeſuits, popiſh Prieſts and Fryars condemned our Miniſters, becauſe they derived not their Ordination from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, ſays he, they turn the Scales, and affirm them to be no lawful Miniſters, but antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and popiſh upon this falſe Pretext, that <hi>they derive their Ordination and Miniſtry from the Pope and Church of Rome</hi>

               </p>
               <p>WE now come to the Doctor's Objections to the Arguments in Favour of Epiſcopacy, which were ſketched out in the <hi>Appeal</hi>; but I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011203_0087_0F94F9C20A963868"/>
been detained ſo long in ſettling Preliminaries, that I preſume the Reader will freely conſent to my paſſing over, for the preſent, this Part of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. At the Time of writing the <hi>Appeal,</hi> it was imagined that giving a Summary of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Support of the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy, and an Explanation of the ſeveral Branches of the epiſcopal Office, would contribute to place the Plea for an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate in a fuller and fairer View, than could otherwiſe be had; but I am now convinced, that what was ſaid on the general Subject, however juſt in itſelf, or proper in Theory, had been better omited. Our Adverſaries have eagerly laid hold of a Subject, which has been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated for almoſt 200 Years, and will probably be debated for 200 Years to come; and by this Means have kept the principal Object of this Controverſy, which is an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate, at a Diſtance, and as much as poſſible out of Sight. The Doctor ſeems to have acted upon this Plan, exerting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Subject of Epiſcopacy, as if it was his chief Buſineſs in anſwering the <hi>Appeal</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Curioſity of the Public called him to purſue another Object—an Object, from which therefore I propoſe to be no longer diverted, by an endleſs Diſpute concerning Epiſcopacy. Whether we are right or wrong in our Notions of Epiſcopacy, yet that we <hi>believe</hi> Biſhops to have been of apoſtolical Inſtitution, and that they are an eſſential Part in the Conſtitution of our Church, is ſufficient to intitle us to an Epiſcopate; unleſs Reaſon can be ſhewn, which it is the grand Buſineſs of our Opponents to ſhew, why the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſhould not be ſuffered to enjoy its own religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtitutions, while every other Denomination of Chriſtians is compleatly tolerated. I propoſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011203_0088_0F94F9C32F42E468"/>
therefore, as has been intimated, to paſs over all that has been ſaid on the general Subject of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, ſo far as it relates to the Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the primitive Church. Nor let the Doctor complain that I decline this Debate; for I mean only to defer it to a more convenient Time. When we ſhall have ſettled the Point of an <hi>American</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate, I will endeavour to hold myſelf in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to anſwer his farther Demands.</p>
               <p>AN Extract from <hi>Chillingworth's Demonſtration of Epiſcopacy</hi> concluded the firſt Section of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> This the Doctor does not attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute; but he diſcovers half a Mind to get rid of it another Way, by ſerving it as he before had ſerved St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix to the <hi>Dudleian Lecture.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, p. 30, <hi>ſtrange —that be ſhould write in the Manner he is here</hi> REPRESENTED <hi>to have done in Relation to Epiſcopacy.</hi> Does he then demur to the Authenticity of the <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> and ſuſpect that <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was not the Author of it! If he can make this appear, he will not be obliged to encounter with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſo great a Name, which is the only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be expected from it; but the <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> will ſtill remain, and the Argument in Favour of Epiſcopacy will be as concluſive, whoever may have been the Author of it. He confronts the Extract I had given with a Paſſage from the great Work, <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants a ſafe Way to Salvation</hi>; in which Paſſage the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor declares, that
<q>the BIBLE only is the Religion of Proteſtants;</q>
but this is not inconſiſtent with any Thing advanced in the <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> Where he allows us to appeal to "the Bible ONLY," he is ſpeaking of the Rule of Faith in its ſtricteſt Senſe;
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011203_0089_0F94F9C3921C2778"/>
and he uſes no more than the common Language of Proteſtants, of Epiſcopalians, as well as others. But with Regard to Matters of a different Nature, we find him allowing proper Weight to the Teſtimony of Antiquity. Thus in Chap. v.82. ſpeaking of the various Sects of Proteſtants, he ſays,
<q>They did <hi>beſt</hi> that followed Scripture <hi>interpreted by catholic written Tradition</hi>; which Rule the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> propoſed to themſelves to follow.</q>
I might produce from him many other Expreſſions to the ſame Purpoſe. And although he mentions
<q>Popes againſt Popes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils againſt Councils, ſome Fathers againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</q>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he is not there ſpeaking of the pure and primitive Ages of the Church, but of thoſe ſucceeding ones which had groſsly departed from the original Standard.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding the Pretence that <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> is on his Side, the Doctor, upon the whole, not liking his Sentiments, appeals from him to <hi>much greater Men in the Knowledge of Antiquity,</hi> and particularly to <hi>that great Antiquary, the learned Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Uſher,</hi> who, it ſeems, <hi>in a Letter to Dr. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> ſays,
<q>I have ever declared my Opinion to be, that Biſhop and Preſbyter differ only in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, not in Order.</q>
The Letter goes on in theſe Words, omited by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>—
<q>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that in Places where Biſhops cannot be had, the Ordination by Preſbyters ſtandeth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; yet on the other Side holding as I do, that a Biſhop hath Superiority in Degree above a Preſbyter, you may eaſily judge that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation made by ſuch Preſbyters, as have ſevered themſelves from thoſe Biſhops, unto whom they had ſworn canonical Obedience, cannot poſſibly
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011203_0090_0F94F9C448E0ACB0"/>
                     <hi>by me</hi> be excuſed from being <hi>ſchiſmatical</hi>; And howſoever, I muſt needs think that the Churches, which have no Biſhops, are thereby become <hi>very much defective in their Government,</hi> and that the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> who living under a popiſh Power, cannot do what they would, are more excuſable in this Defect, than the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that live under a free State</q>
—and then come the other Words cited by the Doctor, with which the Archbiſhop concludes his Letter.</p>
               <p>THE Reader can hardly avoid remarking here, that, in the Opinion of <hi>that learned Antiquary,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Ordination by Preſbyters in Caſes of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity may be valid, yet Ordination by Preſbyters in other Circumſtances is not to be
<q>excuſed from being ſchiſmatical</q>
—that all Churches without Biſhops are "very much defective in their Government"—
<q>and that the Churches in <hi>France</hi> are in this Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>more excuſable</hi> than thoſe in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</q>
becauſe they are leſs able to remedy this Defect. As ſo full an Explanation immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Declaration of his Opinion,
<q>that Biſhops and Preſbyters differ only in Degree,</q>
we may ſafely conclude that the Primate was rather ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his Mode of Expreſſion, than in his real Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with Regard to Epiſcopacy. There is a Paſſage in <hi>the Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> CONSTANCE<note n="*" place="bottom">By L'Enfant, Vol. II. p. 27.</note>, which will, in ſome Meaſure, account for this Peculiarity of Expreſſion. The Hiſtorian, giving an Abſtract of <hi>Gerſon</hi>'s Book <hi>concerning eccleſiaſtical Power,</hi> informs us, that
<q>Gerſon <hi>obſerves there is ſome Difference between the Sentiments of the Lawyers and Divines concerning Epiſcopacy.</hi> The Lawyers, <hi>ſays he,</hi> call Epiſcopacy an Order,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011203_0091_0F94F9C605B4A5C8"/>
becauſe 'tis above the Prieſthood. Though the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines agree, that Epiſcopacy is a hierarchical Power above the Prieſthood, yet they do not ſay that it is an Order, becauſe it adds nothing to the Power of the Prieſt over the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore it is not a new Order, but a new Power.</q>
From this Account it appears that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation although it was the general O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that
<q>Epiſcopacy is a hierarchical Power above the Prieſthood,</q>
or "a new Power" added to that of Preſbyters, which Power was known al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have been communicated by a new Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet in the Language of the Divines, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to that of the Lawyers, it was not called a diſtinct <hi>Order.</hi> Now it is natural enough to ſuppoſe that an <hi>Antiquary,</hi> one that is converſant in the Writings of thoſe Divines that lived Ages before him in the Times of Popery, although a ſound Proteſtant as the Primate was, may have fallen into ſome Part of their Phraſeology, and conſequently that he may have uſed the particular Words, <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> in a Senſe ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that wherein they were uſed by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries. A <hi>real Difference</hi> between Biſhops and Preſbyters he certainly admitted, and perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Difference to be as great as is contended for; and in that Caſe it matters not whether it be expreſſed by the Word <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Degree.</hi> It may aſſiſt us in forming a Judgment of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Opinion concerning this Point, to bear in our Minds that he fully believed the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> to be genuine; for it is impoſſible for any Man, with this Belief, to doubt, whether in the Beginning of the <hi>ſecond Century,</hi> the Church was governed by Biſhops, as diſtinct from, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to, Preſbyters.</p>

In Order to prevent any Miſinterpretations of the Archbiſhop's Opinion concerning Epiſcopacy, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Letter, Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays:
<q>For that Superiority <hi>only in Degree</hi> which he (the Primate) ſaith a Biſhop hath above a Preſbyter, it is not to be underſtood as an arbitrary Matter, at the Pleaſure of Men, but that he held it to be of <hi>apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> and no more a Diminution of the Preheminency and Authority of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, than the Denomination of <hi>Lights</hi> given in common by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to all of them in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, detracts from the Sun and Moon, whom he calls the <hi>greater,</hi> and were aſſigned of God to have the Rule of the reſt; though the Difference between them be only <hi>gradual,</hi> yet there is a <hi>derivative Subordination,</hi> as the Preheminency of the Firſt-born was but <hi>gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> they were all Brethren, but to him was given of God the Excellency, or Supremacy of <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power,</hi> to him they muſt <hi>bow,</hi> or <hi>be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and he muſt have <hi>the Rule over them:</hi> And that this <hi>Gradus</hi> is both derived from the Pattern preſcribed by God in the Old Teſtament, and from the Imitation thereof brought in by the Apoſtles, and confirmed by Chriſt in the Time of the New, the Primate hath ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in that learned Tractate of his, <hi>of the Original of Biſhops,</hi> which <hi>he hath deduced from the apoſtolical Times,</hi> that I know not what can be added<note n="*" place="bottom">The Judgment of the late Archbiſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 127.</note>.</q>

If <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> when he wrote his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and before he was 24 Years of Age, <hi>was,</hi> as the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, <hi>as well verſed in the Fathers as any Man</hi>; how much ſuperior to <hi>any Man,</hi> in this Reſpect, muſt he have been 20 or 30 Years afterwards, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the almoſt uninterrupted Application of his great Abilities to Studies of this Nature? Now at, and long before, that Period of his Age and Inquiries, this celebrated Writer condemned the whole Syſtem of his <hi>Irenicum</hi>; as indeed he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed from it within two or three Years of its firſt Publication. The Doctor may be <hi>inclined</hi> to pay more Deference to <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Rector of <hi>Sutton,</hi> than to <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, or Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>; but others, I believe, will conſider ſuch Partiality as abſurd and prepoſterous.</p>
               <p>I HAVE arrived, at length, to the End of this Section. And upon reviewing what has paſſed between us, I can honeſtly declare, that I am now <hi>more</hi> eſtabliſhed in my Adherence to <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Concluſions <hi>in direct Contradiction</hi> to thoſe of the Doctor, than at the Time of writing the <hi>Appeal; more</hi> firmly believing that
<q>epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</q>
having
<q>been univerſally received in the Church preſently after the Apoſtles Times,</q>
there could be "no ſuch Alteration as is pretended" by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> and others; and that
<q>therefore Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</q>
is not only "ancient and catholic," but truly "apoſtolic."</p>

                  <note place="margin">SECT. II.</note>THE Objections that have been made to the ſecond Section of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> wherein
<q>the Powers peculiar to the epiſcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are ſhewn;</q>
as they relate chiefly to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture explained by the Practice of the primitive Church, ſo far ſhall be paſſed over, they coming not within the Intention of the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But a few Things of another Nature have been interſperſed with theſe Objections, of which it may be proper to take Notice.</p>
               <p>THAT the Reader might conceive juſtly of the true Nature of the epiſcopal Office, I had thought proper to make a Diſtinction between
<q>the ſeveral Things that had been added as Appendages</q>
thereunto, and thoſe
<q>which originally and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially belong</q>
to it. The Doctor ſeems to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to oppoſe to this Diſtinction; but yet to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the Appearance of differing from me in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he takes Occaſion from it to object, in p. 33, that it is <hi>highly unreaſonable to add ſuch Appendages to the Office, and as much ſo to expect, if they are added, that Chriſtian Profeſſors</hi> (Profeſſors of what?) <hi>Should not complain of it as an intolerable Grievance.</hi> Whether the Addition of ſuch Appendages be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or unreaſonable, is nothing to me; and, which is more, it is nothing to the Caſe of ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for <hi>America.</hi> I had ſaid nothing, nor was it my Buſineſs to ſay any Thing, of its being reaſonable that theſe Appendages ſhould
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011203_0095_0F94F9CBC9BD83D8"/>
be added; nor is it his Buſineſs as an Anſwerer to me, to ſay any Thing of its being <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> Much leſs was it his Buſineſs to object Appendages of this Kind to an Epiſcopate, which it certainly is, and ever was, intended, ſhall exiſt without them. And yet both the Doctor and our weekly Adverſaries, have expended a great deal of Time and Paper in very impertinent Declamation upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>I HAD Occaſion to obſerve, that
<q>he who has a ſmall Dioceſs, has the ſame epiſcopal Powers, as he that has a large one; and it Matters not, as to the Validity of the Act, whether it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</q>
by one or the other. The Doctor anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, that <hi>it certainly does as to his Capacity to ſerve the great Ends of his Office</hi>—and that there <hi>is, in Proportion, the ſame Incongruity</hi> in placing Biſhops <hi>at the Head of large Dioceſſes,</hi> as in having <hi>an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal One.</hi> This, conſidered likewiſe as an Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to me, and in no other Light are we authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider it, amounts to no more than this; that although what I ſaid is allowed to be true, yet Something that I did <hi>not</hi> ſay is certainly falſe. The Thing which I did <hi>not</hi> ſay is, that a Biſhop is as able <hi>to ſerve the great Ends of his Office</hi> in a large Dioceſs, as in a ſmall one. And yet if I had ſaid this, unleſs the large Dioceſs is ſuppoſed to be lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the largeſt in any proteſtant Country, or in the primitive Church, to which only I had Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and the ſmall one, ſmaller than the ſmalleſt, it would not have been ſo very exceptionable. The larger Dioceſſes in <hi>England</hi> have commonly been as well taken Care of, as the ſmaller ones; and ſhould any of them hereafter, by an Increaſe of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, be found to be too large for the Dioceſans,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011203_0096_0F94F9CC882864E8"/>
Proviſion is made that they may be aſſiſted by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans, in Proportion as they are wanted. The Doctor ſeems to judge of the epiſcopal Charge, upon congregational Principles, confounding the Office of a Biſhop with that of a Pariſh Miniſter; which is like confounding the Duty of a Lord Lieutenant of a County, with that of a Mayor of a Corporation.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now paſs on to his Exceptions in p. 42, to what I had ſaid of <hi>Aërius</hi> and <hi>Colluthus</hi>; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were
<q>the firſt Contrivers of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</q>
by Preſbyters. Concerning the former, the Doctor endeavours to conſole himſelf with theſe Reflections, that <hi>Epiphanius was the firſt that found Fault with Aërius,</hi> and that <hi>Aërius</hi> was <hi>condemned not only and meerly for his Opinion concerning the Parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters.</hi> But as to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>'s being the firſt Perſon that <hi>found Fault</hi> with <hi>Aërius,</hi> why might not he have been the firſt, as well as any other Perſon? The Doctor, I hope, knows, that <hi>Aërius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> were Cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries; the former broached his Hereſy under <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> who was inveſted with the Empire, in 364, and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Salamis,</hi> in 366, according to <hi>Du Pin.</hi> If an Intimation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the <hi>only</hi> Perſon that, at firſt, conſidered the Doctrine of <hi>Aërius</hi> as excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, or, in other Words, that <hi>the Parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters</hi> was generally admitted in the <hi>fourth Century,</hi> the Suggeſtion is groundleſs. The united Voice of Antiquity, and even the Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our moſt conſiderable Adverſaries, prove the contrary with invincible Evidence. If the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the firſt that <hi>wrote</hi> againſt <hi>Aërias</hi>; the Chronology of the Facts ought
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011203_0097_0F94F9CD48A6C478"/>
to be more exactly aſcertained, before any Thing material can be collected from this Circumſtance. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> began to write his Book <hi>of Hereſies,</hi> according to <hi>Du Pin</hi>'s Account, in 374, but when <hi>Aërius</hi> firſt made himſelf obnoxious, except in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that it was in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> extending from 364 to 375, I do not find. Perhaps it may have been but a ſhort Time before <hi>Epiphanius</hi> wrote againſt him:—Or, ſuppoſing it otherwiſe, perhaps <hi>Aërius</hi> himſelf, and the Progreſs of his Doctrine, were at firſt too inconſiderable to deſerve Notice:—and perhaps there may be Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Caſe, which, at this Diſtance, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account for. If the Doctor thinks this laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition can be of any Service to him, he is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome to it.</p>
               <p>IF <hi>Aërius</hi> was not condemned <hi>only and merely,</hi> it is ſufficient for my Purpoſe that he was condemned <hi>chiefly, for his Opinion concerning the Parity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters.</hi> And that this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of his Condemnation, appears from all the Accounts I have met with. The learned <hi>Moſheim</hi> gives this brief Account of the Matter:
<q>About this Time, <hi>Aërius,</hi> a Preſbyter, Monk and Semi-Arian, erected a <hi>new</hi> Sect, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diviſions throughout <hi>Armenia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> by propagating Opinions different from thoſe that were <hi>commonly received.</hi> One of his <hi>principal</hi> Tenets was, that Biſhops were not diſtinguiſhed from Preſbyters by any divine Right; but that, according to the Inſtitution of the New-Teſtament, their Offices and Authority were abſolutely the ſame. How far <hi>Aërius</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued this Opinion, through its natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, is not certainly known<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Vol. I. p. 202.</note>.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:011203_0098_0F94F9CE776A89E8"/>THE Doctor thinks I had <hi>no Need, nor any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to join Colluthus with Aërius; for he did not act in the Capacity of, what Epiſcopalians would call, a meer Preſbyter, in the Buſineſs of ordaining; but as a Biſhop.</hi> But I thought it a very ſufficient Reaſon for joining him with <hi>Aërius,</hi> that he acted in that <hi>Capacity,</hi> when he was, in Reality, no more than <hi>what Epiſcopalians would call,</hi> and the Orthodox of that Age did call, <hi>a meer Preſbyter.</hi> The true State of the Caſe of <hi>Colluthus</hi> may be gathered, from the ſynodical Epiſtle of the Biſhops of <hi>Egypt, Thebais, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi>—and from a joint Letter of the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Mareotis,</hi> both preſerved in the Works of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> The ſynodical Epiſtle of thoſe <hi>African</hi> Biſhops, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Caſe of one <hi>Iſchyras,</hi> whom <hi>Colluthus</hi> ordained, obſerves:
<q>This is the famous <hi>Iſchyras,</hi> who was neither ordained by the Church, nor reckoned among the Preſbyters, ordained by <hi>Meletius,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> received. How then came <hi>Iſchyras</hi> to be a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and by whom was he ordained? Was it by <hi>Colluthus?</hi> For that remains to be ſaid. But <hi>Colluthus</hi> died a Preſbyter, ſo that all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his Hands were invalid and null; and all thoſe, whom he ordained in his Schiſm, are well known to have been reduced to the Laity.</q>
The Clergy of <hi>Mareotis</hi> give the like Repreſentation of the Matter.
<q>
                     <hi>Iſchyras</hi> who calls himſelf a Preſbyter, is not a Preſbyter, ſince he was ordained by <hi>Colluthus,</hi> who aſſumed an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Epiſcopacy, and was afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Hoſius,</hi> and other Biſhops ſynodically aſſembled, to return to the Order of Preſbyters, whereto he was ordained. And conſequently all thoſe, whom <hi>Colluthus</hi> ordained, returned to their

I leave it now with the Reader to judge whether <hi>Colluthus acted in the Capacity of a meer Preſbyter, in the Buſineſs of ordaining,</hi> or <hi>as a Biſhop</hi>; and whether it was improper to join him with <hi>Aërius,</hi> or not. If after all, the Doctor chooſes to give up the Example of <hi>Colluthus,</hi> as not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Cauſe of Ordination by Preſbyters, I certainly can have no Objection.</p>
               <p>IT was ſaid in the <hi>Appeal,</hi>
                  <q>that there is not an Inſtance of Ordination by Preſbyters to be found in the Church for ſeveral Ages.</q>
Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> in his Reply, after remarking that theſe Words imply that there are <hi>numerous</hi> Examples of epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination within the ſame Period, calls upon me in p. 44, very emphatically to produe ONE <hi>Inſtance, within the long Period of</hi> 150 <hi>Years from Chriſt, of an Ordination by any Biſhop, in any Part of the Chriſtian World; meaning by a Biſhop an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Church of a ſuperior Order to that of Preſbyters.</hi> So far all is very fair. But behold, Reader, a Curioſity. This very ſame Challenge he made in his <hi>Dudleian Lecture,</hi> p. 70; to which a formal and direct Anſwer has been given by Mr. <hi>Leaming.</hi> His Words are as follow:
<q>I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his (Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s) Demand; and I hope he will allow the Authority of my Author. I might produce many, but for Brevity's Sake, ſhall mention but one Inſtance: And that is the Ordination of <hi>Titus</hi> by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> That <hi>Titus</hi> had an epiſcopal Ordination, appears from the Charge St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave him, Tit. i.5. <hi>For this Cauſe left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in Order the Things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011203_0100_0F94F9D59C320C50"/>
every City as</hi> I HAD APPOINTED THEE. St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged him alſo to <hi>rebuke with all Authority</hi>; and again, <hi>a Man that is an Heretic, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, reject.</hi> Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> commits to <hi>Titus</hi> the whole Power of ordaining Elders in <hi>Crete,</hi> and of governing <hi>them</hi> and all the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in that Iſland. This Authority is clearly expreſſed, and the Bounds, in which he was to exerciſe it, diſtinctly marked out. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that this was an <hi>epiſcopal Ordination</hi> in our Senſe of the Matter. Our Biſhops claim nothing but the very ſame Power, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Titus</hi> over the Iſland of <hi>Crete</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Defence of the Epiſcopal Government, p. 61.</note>.</q>
Is not this a fair and full Anſwer to the Doctor's Demand? Ought he then to be unſatisfied, when all that he aſks has been given him? Is it not very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that he ſhould ſo roundly repeat the Demand, without the leaſt Notice of Mr. <hi>Leaming</hi>'s Anſwer? I have ſometimes met with Perſons who would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Arguments of <hi>others</hi> that had been anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, and the Objections of <hi>others</hi> that had been confuted, without taking Notice of the ſaid Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and Confutations; but Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> is the firſt Man I have found in any of the Regions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, that could, without any Symptoms of Perturbation, deal thus with <hi>his own</hi> Arguments and Objections, after they had been formally anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered and confuted. As this and ſome other Things are againſt him, it is a Pity he "undertook" the "Work" of anſwering the <hi>Appeal,</hi> without conſulting his Brethren; and "that he was" not "aſſiſted in it, as—to the Management" of ſome particular Parts of it,
<q>by Direction from ſo learned and able a Body of Men.</q>
Had he
<q>been favoured with ſuch diſtinguiſhing Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</q>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:011203_0101_0F94F9D64B8328A8"/>
the few Blemiſhes upon the Face of his Compoſition might have been avoided.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor, in p. 45, pronounces me to have been <hi>egregiouſly miſtaken, in ſaying, that from the fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, until the Beginning of the Reformation in the ſixteenth,</hi>
                  <q>no Inſtances worthy of Notice occur, to favour Ordination by Preſbyters:</q>
And to convince me of my egregious Miſtake, he points out, by the Aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Walter,</hi> the Example of the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> But upon Examination it will be found, that thoſe two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen happened to be <hi>egregiouſly miſtaken</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We have already ſeen, that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had Biſhops conſecrated by the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>; which ſhews that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> then really were, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were known to be, Epiſcopalians. They were moreover ſuch <hi>High-Flyers,</hi> that they claimed an uninterrupted Succeſſion in the Line of Biſhops, as ſuperior to Preſbyters. The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Church, in their Preface to the Book called, <hi>Ratio Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, Ordiniſque eccleſiaſtici in Unitate Fratrum Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum,</hi> ſay:
<q>And whereas the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> did affirm that they had lawful Biſhops, and a lawful UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION FROM THE APOSTLES unto this Day; they created Three of our Miniſters ſolemnly Biſhops, and confered upon them Power to ordain Miniſters.<note n="*" place="bottom">For this Account I am obliged to the Author of <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of the diſſenting Miniſtry,</hi> in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>; and he farther informs us, that by a <hi>Brief</hi> read in the Churches throughout <hi>England,</hi> for obtaining for the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſiſtance, not long before his writing, which was in 1717, it clearly appeared, that they were epiſcopal Churches, like the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which they always pray in their Liturgy.</note>
                  </q>
One of the moſt celebrated modern eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011203_0102_0F94F9D708961EC0"/>
who is far from being partial to the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy, giving an Account of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in the <hi>twelfth</hi> Century, ſays of them: "The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church was committed by the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> to Biſhops, Preſbyters and Deacons;
<q>for they acknowledged that theſe three eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Orders were inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf <note n="‖" place="bottom">Moſheim's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Vol. I. p. 617.</note>.</q>
But of all Authors, Dr. <hi>Allix</hi> appears to have made the moſt effectual Examination into the Hiſtory of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and to have underſtood it the moſt perfectly. This very eminent Writer in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the ancient Churches of Piedmont,</hi> has abundantly proved, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, under all their Perſecutions and Diſperſions, the ſame Form of Church-Government, from the Time of their Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Century; and that they diſtinguiſhed their Clergy into three Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons. He proves this even from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of thoſe Enemies, who endeavoured to fix upon them the Reproach of allowing the Laity to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments. He proves it more fully from their own Writers, and even from the Example of that very <hi>Leger,</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> following Mr. <hi>Walter,</hi> has introduced to give Evidence to the contrary. For <hi>Leger</hi> himſelf was a <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Biſhop for twelve Years before his Death, exerciſing all the Powers that belong to the epiſcopal Office. Thus having examined all that has been offered on the other Side, I find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more firmly eſtabliſhed, by the Doctor's Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in my Belief of the Propoſition advanced in the <hi>Appeal,</hi>
                  <q>that the uniform Practice of the Church for 1500 Years, may be added to the

Evidence of Scripture, in Support of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of epiſcopal Ordination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WE now come to the Subject of Confirmation. The Doctor paſſes over what I had ſaid of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Uſefulneſs; the Reaſon for which, is left to the Reader's Sagacity to diſcover. But he favours me, in p. 47, with ſome critical Remarks upon the Paragraph, wherein I had made an Obſervation, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares of Confirmation,
<q>that it hath been a ſolemn, ancient and laudable Cuſtom, continued <hi>from the Apoſtles Time</hi>;</q>
and wherein I endeavoured to ſhew the Meaning of that Expreſſion. My reaſoning upon this Head he ſtyles <hi>eminently curious,</hi> and cries out, <hi>demonſtrably argued! Is Infallibility the</hi> PECULIAR <hi>Privilege of the Church?</hi> But had he attended to the Paragraph, he might have ſeen that my Deſign therein was, to prove what the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes concerning the Antiquity and Origin of Confirmation; and not to <hi>aſcertain the Truth of a diſputed Fact,</hi> by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Aſſertion. However the Doctor has gained this Advantage by his Miſtake; he has ſhewn that he is able occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionlly to enliven and embelliſh his Style with rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Decorations. By his interrogating whether Infallibity is the <hi>peculiar</hi> Privilege of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> one would be apt to imagine, that he claimed the Privilege of Infallibility for other Churches, and particularly for thoſe <hi>of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>; but I hope this was not intended, and that there is in Reality nothing more in it than a ſmall Slip of his Pen.</p>
               <p>IN p. 49, I am accuſed of unfairly quoting a Text of Scripture; a Crime which I hold in Abhorrence.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011203_0104_0F94F9DC080B3FF8"/>
Deſignedly to miſrepreſent any common Author, is a Species of Injuſtice which no honeſt Man will ever conſent to practice; but to treat the inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of holy Scripture in this Manner, is impious and abominable. I am ſorry Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> could think me capable of committing ſuch a flagrant Act of Impiety, knowingly and wilfully; and yet from ſome of his Expreſſions, I conclude that he thought me, or, at leaſt, that he intended his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould think me, capable of doing ſo. The Text which I am charged with miſquoting, is <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 6, which he has heedleſsly marked <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. The whole Verſe is thus:
<q>And when <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his Hands upon them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them; and they ſpake with Tongues and propheſied.</q>
I am charged with ſuppreſſing the latter Part of the Text, becauſe if I had given the whole Verſe, <hi>it would have been, at once, viſible to the Reader, that it would have been nothing to</hi> my <hi>Purpoſe.</hi> Would not any one from hence conclude, that I looked upon the latter Part of the Verſe, as overthrowing the Doctrine which I was aiming to eſtabliſh by the former Part of it? Would he not infer, that I had carefully concealed from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Words which made againſt my Deſign? Whereas, in Truth, I neither looked upon the Words at firſt omited, as <hi>really</hi> unfavourable to my Argument; nor did I mean to conceal them, for that or any other Reaſon; nor did I, in Fact, conceal them, but ſoon after produced them in the Form of an Objection, and gave them all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I thought neceſſary.</p>
               <p>TO ſet this Matter in a proper Light, I muſt obſerve, that the former Part of the Verſe in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in p. 21, of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> is introduced as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011203_0105_0F94F9DDD088A2B0"/>
exactly parallel with another Text quoted in the preceding Page. Without going on to the End of the Verſe, but only to the End of the Parallel, I made a Stop (the Doctor ſays I <hi>ſhamefully</hi> ſtopped ſhort) to point out, how exactly the one Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwered to the other, and to ſhew that they both manifeſtly related to the ſame Office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. I then went on to anſwer the Objections that might be ſuppoſed to ariſe, againſt my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; and amongſt theſe Objections, I placed before the Reader thoſe very Words, which I am accuſed of having <hi>kept out of Sight.</hi> Whoever will be kind enough to turn to p. 23, of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> will find that I acted fairly with the Objection, and endeavoured to do it Juſtice. From whence it is evident, that I could have had no Deſign to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or conceal the Words in Diſpute; or elſe that I failed of my Deſign, ſince I actually did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or conceal them. I might indeed have quoted them in cloſe Connection with the preceding Part of the Verſe; but I thought it ſufficient to quote them, when I ſhould come to conſider them. When I conſidered them, I ſuppoſed no Perſon would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, who did not know their Connection as uſed by the ſacred Hiſtorian; the Knowledge of which I had no Deſire to conceal from any one. By this Time I hope the Reader is ſatisfied, that I am free from the Guilt imputed to me; and that the Doctor has, I will not ſay, <hi>ſhamefully,</hi> but however not much to his Honor, miſrepreſented the whole Matter.</p>
               <p>HE concludes what he has to ſay on the Subject of Confirmation, with a long Extract from the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman</hi>'s Anſwer to Mr. <hi>White</hi>; the Deſign of which is to ſhew, that the Biſhop has no <hi>Warrant to pronounce,</hi> in the Adminiſtration of that
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011203_0106_0F94F9DF26FB2040"/>
Office, <hi>a Man's Sins all forgiven, and himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In Anſwer to this Harangue, it will be ſufficient to give the Words of Mr. <hi>White.</hi>
                  <q>I have now, <hi>ſays he,</hi> only to clear up one or two Paſſages in the Office for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and to reſcue them from the perverſe Interpretation of this Writer. The firſt is that, wherein the Biſhop declares, concerning thoſe that come to Confirmation, that <hi>God has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to regenerate thoſe his Servants by Water and the Holy Ghoſt, and given them the Forgiveneſs of all their Sins.</hi> This he is pleaſed to underſtand as a Declaration concerning their preſent State, and an Aſſurance that they are, <hi>all,</hi> though ſome of them may be abſolute <hi>Strangers to the renewing Influences of God's Spirit, and faſt bound in their Sins,</hi> in a State of Grace and Acceptance, and need not doubt of their Salvation. Whereas, it is very plain, from the mention of Water, and their being regenerated thereby, that it is only declarative of the State they were put into by Baptiſm, they having received therein, or being thereby intitled to the Holy Spirit, and the Forgiveneſs of all Sin.—But though the State which they were put into when they received their Baptiſm, was, doubtleſs, the State which is here meant, yet, for Argument's Sake, I will admit what this Gentleman <hi>begs</hi> me to admit (for he offers no Proof of it) that the Biſhop means the State they are ſuppoſed, <hi>at preſent,</hi> to be in. And now we will ſee, if this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Biſhop, even in <hi>this</hi> View, be really ſuch an unwarrantable and preſumptuous one as our Author repreſents it to be, and is not fairly defenſible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:011203_0107_0F94F9DF528FC908"/>
                  <q>LET it then be obſerved, that this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, not ſeparately to each Individual, but to the whole Aſſembly, the whole Multitude of thoſe who preſent themſelves for Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as the far greater Part of theſe are very young Perſons, whom the Biſhop may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, or in the Judgment of Charity, believe not to be yet defiled with <hi>the Pollutions that are in the World through Luſt,</hi> and moſt of the Reſt, who are of advanced Years, Men ſeemingly ſerious, and having a Diſpoſition to real Holineſs, and he does not know for certain, there are <hi>any</hi> amongſt them, but can only preſume, that, in ſo great a Number, there may probably be ſome of another Character, I do not ſee but the Biſhop is ſufficiently warranted to make ſuch a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning them, as he does here. Nor can I apprehend there is the leaſt Danger that a few Individuals, who are yet unholy, and in their Sins, getting in amongſt them, will take Encouragement, and conceive falſe Hopes of the Safety of their Condition, from any ſuch Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which they cannot but be ſenſible was never meant to be applied to themſelves, or ſuch Kind of Perſons, as they muſt needs know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>MR. <hi>White</hi> then goes on to ſhew, in the Words of Dr. <hi>Doddridge,</hi> that the ſame Form of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is blamed in our Office for Confirmation, was commonly uſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.
<q>Our Lord, ſays Dr. <hi>Doddridge,</hi> tho' he knew the Wickedneſs of <hi>Judas,</hi> often addreſſes himſelf to the whole Body of his Apoſtles, as if they were <hi>all</hi> his faithful Servants, and makes gracious Declarations and Promiſes to <hi>the whole Society,</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:011203_0108_0F94F9E00CCCEAA0"/>
which could by no Means be applicable to this corrupt and wretched Member of it.</q>
Other Quotations to the ſame Purpoſe, from the ſame Author, are given us by Mr. <hi>White.</hi> He then remarks:
<q>If this be admitted (as I fancy it will) by my Anſwerer; if he grants that Gentleman (Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi>) that our Lord, on divers Occaſions did ſpeak to the <hi>Twelve</hi> in ſuch Terms as were, and, which is more, he <hi>knew,</hi> were no Way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Traitor—how can he think it wrong, and ſuch an unwarrantable Thing, as he pretends to do, in the Biſhops, at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, to declare, before the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offering themſelves to be confirmed, that <hi>God had vouchſafed to regenerate thoſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by Water and the Holy Ghoſt, and to give them the Forgiveneſs of all their Sins,</hi> &amp;c. If indeed he (the Biſhop) was to declare to each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon, <hi>by himſelf,</hi> that God had regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>him</hi> in particular, with the Holy Ghoſt, and forgiven <hi>him</hi> all <hi>his</hi> Sins, it would be a different Caſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT might have been not amiſs, if the Doctor, who ſo often flouriſhes away with Extracts from the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peirce,</hi> had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to Mr. <hi>White's Defences</hi> againſt the Objections of the former, and to Dr. <hi>Grey's</hi> Anſwer to the latter; in which Caſe, I cannot but think that ſome of his Quotations from thoſe Authors would have been ſpared.</p>

            <div n="3" type="section">

               <head>SECTION III.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of the next Section of the <hi>Appeal</hi> was to ſhew,<note place="margin">SECT. III.</note> by a particular Application of the general Doctrine of Epiſcopacy,
<q>that the Church in <hi>America,</hi> without an Epiſcopate, is neceſſarily deſtitute of a regular Government, and cannot enjoy the Benefits of Ordination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</q>
This is a natural Conſequence of our Principles; and one would think that no Perſon would venture to diſpute it. But yet Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> who ſeems to have proceeded upon the Plan of diſputing every Thing that is advanced in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> has ſhewn that he is able to offer Objections even to this.</p>
               <p>I <hi>paſſed over</hi> the ſubject of Confirmation <hi>without Enlargement,</hi> deſignedly; becauſe I ſuppoſed, that, with ſome of my Readers, the Importance of that ſacred Rite would not be acknowledged—or, in the Doctor's Phraſcology, that the Subject was <hi>not ſuited to the Colony-Taſte.</hi> It is not a Matter of Wonder to me, that an Inſtance of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to the Reader, ſhould be diſagreeable to ſuch an <hi>Anſwerer</hi> as the Doctor; who hints his Diſlike that the more important Points of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ordination are, as he ſays,
<q>immediately <hi>proceeded</hi> to,</q>
making a Participle paſſive from "a Verb neuter—Liberties of which Kind, I find him frequently taking without Ceremony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:011203_0110_0F94F9E2C4160D10"/>BEFORE he enters upon the proper Buſineſs of this Section, he thinks fit to make Two Remarks. The firſt, in p. 56, and running on to p. 59, was occaſioned by my ſaying, that
<q>none but Biſhops have a Right to govern the Church:</q>
Whereupon he repreſents the Church of England as having no Authority that is <hi>purely ſpiritual,</hi> every Thing of that Kind being conſidered by him as abſorbed in the King's Supremacy. But this Matter has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been placed in ſo full and clear a Light, that to enlarge upon it here would be paying but an ill Compliment to the Reader's Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>HIS other Remark in p. 59, which he confeſſes to be not <hi>eſſentially important,</hi> relates to the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Complaint as made at the Head of this Section,</hi> and its Appearance in the Explanation that follows. <hi>The Ground of the Complaint,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as there ſpecified, is this, the Church of England in America, being without Biſhops, muſt for that Reaſon</hi> 'be without Government and Ordination:' <hi>Whereas the Juſtification of this Complaint does not proceed upon the ſuppoſition either that they have</hi> 'no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,' <hi>or can have</hi> 'no Ordination;' <hi>but that their Government without Biſhops is incomplete and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and that Ordination cannot be had without Difficulty, Danger and Expence,</hi> p. 60. By <hi>the Head if the Section,</hi> I ſhould underſtand the <hi>Title</hi> of the Section, or at leaſt its firſt Paragraph. But <hi>the Complaint as ſpecified</hi> in the Title of the Section is, that without an Epiſcopate the Church in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica 'is deſtitute of a <hi>regular</hi> Government;' implying that it might be under a Government that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and irregular. If therefore, as the Doctor ſays, <hi>the Juſtification of the Complaint proceeds upon the Suppoſition, that without Biſhops the Government
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:011203_0111_0F94F9E3585A1D98"/>
of the Church is incomplete and inſufficient,</hi> it exactly anſwers to the Title of the Section. Indeed in p. 27, I had ſaid that
<q>the American Church, while without Biſhops, muſt be without Government.</q>
If he had this general Expreſſion in his View, he did wrong in ſaying it was at the <hi>Head</hi> of the Section; for few of his Readers, I believe, would ever think of looking for the Head of a Thing, in the <hi>Middle</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>I TOOK Notice that this general Propoſition,
<q>that without Biſhops the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> is without Government,</q>
is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a qualified Senſe: But ſurely there can be no Inconſiſtency in this. It is very common, and agreeable to ſtrict Method, firſt to lay down a general Propoſition, and then to mark out the Exceptions and Limitations with which it is to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>AS to <hi>Ordination,</hi> the general Propoſition is true without any Exception. For without Biſhops, upon the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 2there cannot be Ordination in a ſingle Inſtance. The Doctor here diſtinguiſhes; <hi>no Ordination, and Ordination with Inconvenience and Charge, are quite different Things.</hi> But he ſeems to labour under a great Confuſion of Ideas, whenever he talks upon the Subject of Ordination. The Poſition which he controverts is this, that there can be no Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>America</hi> without Biſhops in <hi>America</hi>; in Oppoſition to which he argues, that we may have Ordinations in <hi>America, with Inconvenience and Charge.</hi> But how can we, without Biſhops, have Ordinations in <hi>America?</hi> Why, ſays my very logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opponent, by having them <hi>in England.</hi> Yet
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011203_0112_0F94F9E413A77E80"/>
he unluckily acknowledges in p. 56, <hi>as to Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that we <hi>muſt be in Want of it without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, becauſe they only can perform this Piece of Service.</hi> If ſo, one would be apt to think, in like Manner, as to <hi>Ordination,</hi> that we muſt be in Want of it without Biſhops, becauſe they only can perform this Piece of Service. But no: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, it ſeems, may be had ſtill, <hi>with Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and Charge</hi>; and ſo ſay I, may Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Truth is, neither of them can be had in <hi>America,</hi> otherwiſe than by having them in <hi>Europe.</hi> Let us ſuppoſe, for an Illuſtration, that the civil Authority ſhould put a Stop to every Printing-Preſs in <hi>England</hi>; and that ſome Perſon ſhould complain of the Hardſhip of this, that ſo conſtitutional a Right as the Liberty of the Preſs ſhould be refuſed to Engliſhmen: Would not an Objector appear in a ridiculous Light, that ſhould affirm the Liberty of the Preſs was not refuſed, but only attended <hi>with Inconvenience and Charge</hi>; and explain himſelf by ſaying that a Man might go to <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and there find a Preſs that would ſerve him? And yet I cannot conceive that it makes any material Difference, whether the Subject of ſuch reaſoning be Ordination, or the Liberty of the Preſs.</p>
               <p>UNDER the Head of <hi>Government,</hi> I attempted to ſhew, that although Preſbyters may have a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Authority, yet unalienable epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was moreover neceſſary to anſwer the Ends of Government in an epiſcopal Church —and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies greatly ſuffers for Want of this Authority. The Doctor's Remark is, that if Preſbyters may have a ſubordinate Authority, <hi>the Church is ſtill in
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011203_0113_0F94F9E4A317CB90"/>
a leſs deplorable State than was repreſented by the Complaint, as at firſt worded.</hi> How the Complaint was <hi>at firſt worded,</hi> has been ſhewn; but if the State of the Church here is not ſo deplorably bad, with Reſpect to its Government, as if Preſbyters could have no ſubordinate Authority at all; yet that is no Reaſon why we ſhould not endeavour to make it better than it is, nor is it any Reaſon why others ſhould oppoſe the Attempt.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor affects to think the Matter would not be much mended, by the Reſidence of Biſhops. <hi>The Church at Home,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is in this Reſpect, in as lamentable a State as the Church in</hi> America. <hi>The Liturgy itſelf ſuppoſes their Diſcipline to be in a wretched Condition,</hi> p. 62—alluding, I imagine, to the Commination-Office. That the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is defective in ſome Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and below the primitive Standard, She has the Candor to confeſs: If others, whoſe Diſcipline is by no Means more perfect, would confeſs the ſame, it would be much for their Credit. But the Want of primitive Diſcipline in the Church at Home, is no Proof that the Want of it is not ſtill greater in the Colonies, nor that the Want cannot in ſome Degree be remedied by the propoſed Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate. We think that a ſtrict Diſcipline, with Regard to the American Clergy, might be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under an Epiſcopate. This is certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; it is an important Part of our Plan; and that American Biſhops would diſappoint us in this Reſpect, none have a Right to declare, until the Experiment ſhall have been made.</p>
               <p>TO ſhew that theſe Expectations are vain, <hi>the learned Dr. Whitby</hi> is quoted for theſe Words: "the Church of <hi>England</hi> obſerves no Diſcipline."
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011203_0114_0F94F9E9AF3CD988"/>
But if it be true, that the Church obſerves no Diſcipline at Home, it will not follow, that, in very different Circumſtances, She will not exerciſe the Diſcipline here which is propoſed and expected, when Biſhops ſhall be appointed to reſide in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> But is the Doctor certain, that the learned Commentator ſays what he aſcribes to him? I aſk the Queſtion, not only becauſe <hi>Whitby</hi> mentions not "the Church of <hi>England</hi>" in the Paſſage refered to, but becauſe it appears to me, that what is there ſaid of a Church without Diſcipline, the Commentator ſays not in his own Perſon, but in the Character of a Diſſenter, who is introduced as aſſigning it for a Reaſon of his Separation from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Whether I am right in this Opinion, let the Reader judge. After men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Caſe of a Jew, who was governed by an erroneous Conſcience, Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> obſerves:
<q>this is ſo far from being an unparallel Caſe, that it is the very Caſe of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> uſing ſtill the anointing of the ſick—of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> dipping them that are baptized—of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> refuſing to eat Things ſtrangled and Blood, out of a Reverence to the apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction—of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> uſing Prayer by the Spirit, or conceived Prayer, out of Reverence to the Command, <hi>to pray in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and abſtaining from Communion with <hi>that Church which obſerves no Church Diſcipline,</hi> out of Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Command, to purge the evil from among us; for all this is done by them out of a <hi>miſtaken</hi> Reverence to a divine Authority, which they conceive obliging to them<note n="†" place="bottom">Note on <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV.6.</note>.</q>
Now what is here probably, at leaſt very poſſibly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:011203_0115_0F94F9F25764CCD0"/>
only to expreſs a Conceit of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Doctor, by a Stretch of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, after making the neceſſary Corrections and Amendments, forms into a poſitive Aſſertion, and puts it into the Mouth of Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> giving it all the Marks of a literal Quotation. Yet after all, ſuppoſing <hi>Whitby</hi> had taken it into his Head to aſſert, what the Doctor, or rather Mr. <hi>Peirce,</hi> from whom the Quotation appears to have been taken, makes him to aſſert; it will only follow, that he aſſerted of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> what is not true of that, or any other Church in the Univerſe. For there is no Church but has ſome Canons and Laws to regulate the Behaviour of its Members, and ſometimes, at leaſt, puts them in Execution; and in ſo doing, obſerves and exerciſes Diſcipline. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs therefore it can be proved, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has no Laws, or that none of her Laws are ever inforced, it cannot juſtly be aſſerted that She obſerves <hi>no</hi> Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>IN explaining the Nature of eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I had advanced this Propoſition,
<q>the Power of the Church is of a ſpiritual Nature.</q>
The Truth of this is admited by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>; but then he immediately rouſes himſelf and his Readers with the following Exclamation. <hi>It is really aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, that he</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Appeal) ſhould make ſpiritual Cenſures the utmoſt Effect of the Power of the Church of England!</hi> And it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> to me, that he ſhould not ſee, that, in the Place refered to, I was conſidering the Church in its original State, before it was taken under the Protection of the civil Power. I was not ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its preſent Situation, ſupported and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011203_0116_0F94F9F28C2004E8"/>
nor of any other Church, in ſimilar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. All Churches, whether Epiſcopalian or Preſbyterian, which enjoy the Benefit of a civil Eſtabliſhment, have their Decrees ſeconded and inforced, in ſome Inſtances, by the ſecular Arm. And if the Church of <hi>England</hi> rejects not the friendly Aſſiſtance of temporal Authority; neither does the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor any other, to whom it is offered. This Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I beg Leave to illuſtrate and confirm by an Example from <hi>Geneva,</hi> which was produced in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>
                  <q>One <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> a rich Widow in <hi>Geneva,</hi> had a <hi>Ball</hi> in her Houſe. This Diverſion is a great Crime by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Diſcipline. It happened that a <hi>Syndick,</hi> one of the Four chief Magiſtrates, and one <hi>Henrick</hi> an <hi>Elder,</hi> were Two of thoſe that danced. When <hi>Calvin</hi> underſtood what was done, he convented them before a Conſiſtory; and tho' they were delated by no Body, the Oath <hi>ex Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> was put to them to extort Matter of Fact.— In ſhort, <hi>Henrick</hi> the Elder—was turned out of his Office, and <hi>impriſoned</hi> for three Days. The <hi>Syndick</hi> was likewiſe ſuſpended from the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Office, 'till he had given ſome Proofs of his Repentance for being at the Ball. This Man reſigned to the Conſiſtory, did Penance upon their Admonition, and ſo prevented his Commitment. There were ſeveral others, who being examined by <hi>Calvin</hi> upon their Oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed they were at this dancing Entertainment, upon which they were all ſent to Priſon<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Collier</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Vol. II. p. 602.</note>.</q>
We ſee here that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſcrupled not to make Uſe of that temporal Power granted him by the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, but would <hi>depoſe</hi> and <hi>impriſon</hi> Men, as he
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011203_0117_0F94F9F4B3900AF0"/>
thought it would beſt anſwer the Purpoſes of his Diſcipline. And now, before I return from <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> I will only obſerve, that the temporal Effects of Excommunication there, are as dreadful, as the Doctor, in the Words of the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> has repreſented them to be in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN ſpeaking of Excommunication and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Cenſures, I had obſerved, that in this Age they have loſt much of their Weight; which is owing to certain Cauſes that were briefly intimated. The Doctor briſkly replies, <hi>it is readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Diſcipline of the Church is held in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by Multitudes.</hi> But ſurely he muſt know, that Men may deſpiſe Things that are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contemptible, and that they may <hi>affect</hi> to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe Things, at the ſame Time that they really look upon them to be venerable. I have met with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who appeared to hold the Diſcipline exerciſed by <hi>the Churches in the Colonies</hi> in as great Contempt, as the Doctor, or any of his Party, can hold that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If <hi>Infidels and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines laugh to ſee how it is exerciſed</hi>; we may, in a great Meaſure, thank thoſe, who have taken ſo much ungenerous Pains to repreſent it in a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT would be a Shame,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>for a Man to ſpeak in its Defence.</hi> We acknowledge the Diſcipline of the Church to be defective, and ſo far we undertake not to defend it:—I wiſh ſome others had the ſame Ingenuity. But although we pretend not to <hi>defend</hi> it in every Reſpect, yet much may be ſaid, and has been often ſaid, to <hi>excuſe</hi> it. The Doctor takes for granted that no <hi>Attempt for Redreſs</hi> has been ever made. But in this he aſſumes
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011203_0118_0F94F9F50937A650"/>
more, than we chooſe to allow him. He muſt be a Stranger to our Hiſtory, who knows not that ſome Attempts have been made with this View; and there may have been ſome ſecret ones, of which Hiſtory does not inform us. Does he think that nothing can be attempted, without public Noiſe and Clamour? Or, is it reaſonable to be noiſy and clamorous, when it is known that it can anſwer no valuable Purpoſe? May not an indiſcreet Zeal, in this, as well as in other Caſes, do more Miſchief than Service? We are not aſhamed to confeſs, that we wiſh for the farther Improvement of every Thing belonging to the Church; of our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of our common Tranſlation of the Bible, of our Liturgy and public Offices; which we hope in due Time to obtain, in a regular and peaceable Way; until which Time we ſhall continue to Uſe them in their preſent State:—Looking upon the Diſcipline of the Church, defective as it is, to be equal with that of our Neighbours—conſidering our Tranſlation of the Bible, however erroneous in in ſome particular Paſſages, as tolerable upon the whole—and eſteeming our Liturgy, although ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſtill farther Improvement, to be the beſt upon Earth.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor ſpends ſome Pages more, in diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Qualities and Condition of a Thing, which he profeſſes to believe has no Exiſtence, <hi>i. e.</hi> Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; but as they conſiſt chiefly of <hi>Extracts</hi> from the <hi>Diſſenting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> I muſt refer thoſe, who are deſirous of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular anſwers to thoſe Extracts, to Mr. <hi>White.</hi> I ſhall take Leave of this Subject with obſerving, that in this Part of his Performance, the Doctor ſuffers his unbridled Imagination to
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:011203_0119_0F94F9F5D2F8E730"/>
run away with his Reaſon; and that his whole Repreſentation is manifeſtly ſo uncandid, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, ſo hyperbolical, ſo ranting, and, I may add, ſo impertinent to his proper Buſineſs, that it merits a Rebuke, rather than a Refutation. If he ſhould ever again undertake to give the Character of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of her Clergy; I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to him ſeriouſly to attend to the Apoſtle's Direction:
<q>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all Malice<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> iv.31.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IN p. 69, I am charged with Inconſiſtency, and the Charge is thus ſupported. I had ſaid;
<q>In this State of Things, the Reſtoration of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Diſcipline ſeems to be a Matter rather to be wiſhed for and deſired, than to be <hi>rationally attempted</hi> by thoſe in Authority.</q>
                  <hi>And yet,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>it is propoſed, that this very Thing which cannot</hi> RATIONALLY BE ATTEMPTED, <hi>ſhould not only be attempted, but carried into Effect.</hi> The Thing that in our Opinion, cannot rationally be attempted, is the Reſtoration of the <hi>primitive</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; the Thing therefore <hi>propoſed,</hi> according to this Repreſentation, is not only to <hi>attempt,</hi> but to <hi>carry into Effect</hi> (as indeed moſt Attempts are propoſed with a View of carrying Something into Effect) the Reſtoration of the <hi>primitive</hi> Diſcipline. And yet, notwithſtanding that we are allowed to have propoſed this, we are in the very ſame Page blamed for <hi>not</hi> propoſing it—for forming a Plan not adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>the Goſpel-Inſtitution of Diſcipline,</hi> which we all know was the <hi>primitive</hi> Standard. The Taſk, I own, is ſomewhat difficult, to juſtify ourſelves for propoſing and not propoſing, for attempting
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011203_0120_0F94F9F6901D4E20"/>
and not attempting, the ſame Thing; and it is rather unkindly impoſed upon us. But if we might be allowed to proceed in our own Way, we believe we could ſatisfy all reaſonable Perſons. Our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that in the preſent State of Things, the Reſtoration of the primitive Diſcipline cannot be attempted, with any Proſpect of Succeſs. If the Doctor thinks otherwiſe, let him try the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment with his own Congregation, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be not more than commonly intractable; and when the <hi>Attempt</hi> is fairly <hi>carried into Effect,</hi> if he will publiſh a Narrative of his Proceſs, ſo ſucceſsful an Example may animate and direct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and then, if they refuſe to follow it, he may blame them with a better Grace. We are farther of Opinion, that although it is proper and adviſeable, for many Reaſons, to leave the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>American</hi> Church, ſo far as it relates to the Laity, in its preſent State; yet, that it is neceſſary, and at the ſame Time very practicable, with the Advantage of an Epiſcopate, to eſtabliſh a ſtrict Diſcipline over the Clergy; and therefore it is intended that
<q>the Biſhop's Power over them ſhall be as full and compleat, as the Laws and Canons of the Church direct.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT, <hi>is not godly Diſcipline as needful for the Laity as the Clergy?</hi> Some godly Diſcipline for the Laity we already have; we can repel from the Communion thoſe whom we diſcover to come with an unworthy Diſpoſition; and, in this Country in particular, we DARE to repel, any <hi>Blaſphemer the three Kingdoms afford,</hi> even <hi>when he comes to demand it as a Qualification for an Office in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or Fleet.</hi> Other Acts of Diſcipline we are able to exerciſe over the Laity; and, conſidering the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011203_0121_0F94F9F7677F57E8"/>
Proviſion made by our Laws for the Puniſhment of many of thoſe Crimes, which in the primitive Ages had no other Reſtraint than the Diſcipline of the Church, any farther Exertion of eccleſiaſtical Authority over the Laity, is perhaps rendered leſs neceſſary. Theſe Sentiments are not contradicted in the <hi>Appeal</hi>; for therein I did not <hi>make it one main Article of my Complaint, that</hi>
                  <q>the People, being ſenſible of the Clergy's Want of Power, find themſelves free from all Reſtraints of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority;</q>
I only repreſented this as being in Reality the Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BISHOPS</hi> undoubtedly, <hi>as Succeſſors to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, are as much veſted with Authority to govern the Laity as the Clergy</hi>; but, after the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they may think themſelves not obliged to exerciſe it with Severity, ſince it is given them "to Edification, and not to Deſtruction<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii.10.</note>." If therefore they ſhould judge any Plan, for a greater Extenſion, or a more vigorous Exertion, of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Power over the <hi>American</hi> Laity, would tend more to <hi>Deſtruction</hi> than to <hi>Edification,</hi> they are warranted to reject it; and if they have a Right to reject it, they may give Aſſurances of ſuch a Rejection. But does not this Diſtinction imply that <hi>the Church-Clergy are much worſe than the Laity?</hi> All that I can conceive to be implied in it is, that greater Advantages are expected from increaſing the Reſtraints of the Clergy, than of the Laity; or, at leaſt, that in the Caſe of the Clergy, it is more practicable.</p>
               <p>The long Extract from Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning p. 70, ſhews that the Biſhop, at the Time
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011203_0122_0F94F9F805BF2930"/>
of writing it, thought there were many Things in the Church that wanted Amendment; and if he had undertaken, with the ſame Freedom, to give his Opinion of the Diſſenters, he would probably have preſented us with a no leſs dark and gloomy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. The Quotation from Mr. <hi>Peirce,</hi> about the Right of Patronage, is as foreign from the Doctor's Buſineſs, as an Argument would be about the Colour of <hi>Aaron's Linen Ephod.</hi> Therefore paſſing over this, and, for the ſame Reaſon the Quotation from Dr. <hi>Croft</hi>'s <note n="§" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Crofts</hi> was anſwered by Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in

               <p>WHETHER we are right or wrong in that Part of our Plan which relates to the <hi>Laity,</hi> it might be expected that a Propoſal for bringing the <hi>Clergy</hi> under a ſtrict Diſcipline, would meet with no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections from thoſe, who frequently reproach us with the Want of it. For certainly it is better that ſome Part of any Society ſhould be duly governed, than that no Part ſhould. But we are ſo unlucky as to be oppoſed, as well in our Scheme for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Diſcipline over the Clergy, as for not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing it with more Severity over the Laity.</p>
               <p>IN p. 75 and 77, the Doctor thinks to incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us with this Objection, that our Plan for the Government of the Clergy cannot be executed in the Manner we propoſe, <hi>unleſs the eſtabliſhed Mode
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011203_0123_0F94F9FD90A43930"/>
of Diſcipline ſhould be ſo changed, as to be quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what it is in England.</hi> I am glad to ſee it granted that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has an eſtabliſhed Mode of Diſcipline, ſo ſoon after a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial that She has any Diſcipline at all. It ſhews that the Doctor is not incapable of ſeeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting his Errors. But as to the <hi>Mode</hi> of our Diſcipline, he need not give himſelf any Concern on that Account. It has always been intended, that the Mode of it here, under an Epiſcopate, ſhall be different from what it is in <hi>England.</hi> The Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials will be the ſame, but the Manner of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration will differ, in many Reſpects. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Authority here, will be purely Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; but at Home, temporal Power, a Non-Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, is joined with it. <hi>There,</hi> many tedious Forms muſt be attended to and obſerved; but <hi>here,</hi> every Thing may be done in a more ſummary Way, and no farther Delay will be neceſſary, than what will be required for a due Information, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Facts upon which Camplaints ſhall be founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT,</hi> ſays the Doctor, p. 77, <hi>if an Alteration is to be made,</hi> in the <hi>Mode</hi> of exerciſing Diſcipline, <hi>it is infinitely reaſonable, it ſhould firſt take Place at Home, where it is moſt needed. When it is effected there, it will be Time enough to deſire it here.</hi> All Changes of ancient and eſtabliſhed Uſages in any Country, are found to be extremely difficult; and the Doctor ſeems not to be aware, how many Laws muſt be repealed before ſuch a Plan of Diſcipline, as may be eaſily <hi>carried into Effect</hi> here, can be executed in <hi>England</hi>—nor how nearly, ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration may be thought to affect the State. The whole Syſtem of eccleſiaſtical Laws muſt be new-modeled,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011203_0124_0F94F9FED5058BC8"/>
and one half of the national Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt undergo a very conſiderable Change, in Order to which, not only the Biſhops and Clergy, but all the Branches of the Legiſlature, muſt be convinced of the Utility and SAFETY of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—before this Propoſal can take Place in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But at the firſt Settlement of an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in the Colonies, the propoſed Alteration of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Mode</hi> may be introduced, without any ſuch Difficulties, and even with as much Eaſe as the Mode that is practiſed at Home can be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. There is therefore no Reaſon at all for waiting to ſee it effected <hi>there,</hi> before we <hi>deſire it here</hi>; much leſs is it <hi>infinitely reaſonable</hi> to do ſo. If the propoſed Mode is eligible in itſelf, and may eaſily be obtained by us, why ſhould we wait for thoſe who cannot eaſily obtain it, to ſet us the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</p>
               <p>IN ſpeaking of the Clergy under the Diſtinction of the Virtuous and the Vicious, it was obſerved in the <hi>Appeal</hi> p. 32, that
<q>the Want of Biſhops to ſuperintend and govern them, is obvious at firſt View. If one Sort have no need of a Biſhop to keep them to their Duty, yet ſome Caſes will ariſe in the Diſcharge of it, in which his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be uſeful—and many Caſes, wherein his Support and Encouragement will be needful— and in all Caſes, his Friendſhip and Patronage will give Life and Spirit to them in undergoing the Difficulties, and performing the Duties of their Stations.</q>
Upon this Paſſage Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> makes the following Animadverſion. <hi>But what is all this to the Affair of Diſcipline, the grand Point in View? The Doctor's Buſineſs here was, to ſhew it to be neceſſary that ſtrict Diſcipline ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011203_0125_0F94F9FF866B2870"/>
with Reſpect to the Clergy; and he begins his Argument with a Caſe, wherein it is not needed at all,</hi> p. 76. I have no Objections to being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of my proper <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> when I happen to forget, or miſtake it; nor to being called to Order, when I wander from <hi>the grand Point in View.</hi> I can take ſuch Interpoſitions kindly, even from Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> although he has forfeited all Right to interpoſe in this Manner, by his own frequent Aberrations from the <hi>Point in View.</hi> I would only reſerve to myſelf the Privilege of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my Error, before I retract it; which in the preſent Caſe I am not. If a Perſon were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Neceſſity and Advantages of <hi>civil</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; it would be natural for him, and not <hi>impertinent,</hi> to make ſuch Obſervations as theſe: That Subjects may be diſtinguiſhed into the Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Vicious—that, although Government is more immediately neceſſary to reſtrain the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will alſo have a good Effect upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer—not indeed in the ſame Way, but by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Encouragement and Direction they will, in general, receive from their Superiors; and by this means Benefit will redound to all with whom they are connected. Now as Diſcipline in the Church anſwers to Government in the State, I ſee not why the ſame Method of Illuſtration may not be equally proper in both Caſes; nor why the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence here quoted from the <hi>Appeal,</hi> may not be <hi>pertinent to the propoſed Subject in Debate.</hi> If the Word <hi>Diſcipline</hi> indeed included only the Idea of Puniſhment, the Animadverſion would be juſt; but ſince, upon the Authority of the beſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it may be extended to Government in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in which large Senſe I manifeſtly uſed it, it is hyper-critical.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:011203_0126_0F94FA0048F44450"/>BUT, it ſeems, the Advantages expected from an Epiſcopate are chiefly <hi>imaginary.</hi> For <hi>was there now a Biſhop in whatever Part of America he would chooſe, the Clergy would notwithſtanding be variouſly diſtant from him ſome Hundreds of Miles; inſomuch that but few of them could reap much Benefit either by his Direction, Encouragement or Patronage.</hi> I am glad to find it allowed that ſome <hi>few of them</hi> may be near him, and <hi>reap</hi> the Advantages propoſed. I hope alſo that <hi>ſome Hundreds of Miles</hi> will be found, upon the Trial, not to be equal to ſome <hi>Thouſands.</hi> If <hi>all</hi> the Clergy were to be kept at the Diſtance of ſome Hundreds of Miles, and were to have no Intercourſe or Correſpendence with the Biſhop, the Advantages expected would be truly chimerical; but according to our Plan, there will not be a Clergyman within his Juriſdiction, but muſt be perſonally acquainted and maintain an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, with him, in a greater or leſs Degree.</p>
               <p>AS to the Effects of the propoſed Diſcipline upon vicious Clergymen, it is argued in p. 77, that they are not to be expected here, becauſe it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that <hi>Multitudes</hi> of Clergymen eſcape Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at Home. The Doctor's <hi>Multitudes</hi> may perhaps, with more Propriety, be called <hi>ſome</hi>; and that ſome ſhould eſcape, that deſerve, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the Number of Clergymen amounts to twelve Thouſand, is not to be wondered at. Are there not ſome Inſtances of this Kind, under the Preſbyterian Diſcipline? Have there not been ſome, even in <hi>New-England?</hi> But ſuppoſing the Number to be greater in Proportion in <hi>England,</hi> than in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>New-England</hi>; it may be owing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes, than the comparative Inſufficiency of epiſcopal Government, or the Inattention of the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011203_0127_0F94FA015F0807E0"/>
Biſhops. There are in <hi>England</hi> ſome Places that are exempted from the Biſhop's Juriſdiction; and it is greatly owing to the Refuge and Protection which thoſe Places afford, that ſome vicious Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen eſcape Puniſhment. But the Caſe of the Clergy here, will always be different from what it is in <hi>England</hi> in ſo many Reſpects, that it can never be juſtly argued that the Biſhop's Power over them will be ineffectual here, from any Failure of it there. It is poſſible that we may be too ſanguine in our Expectations; but if an Epiſcopate will produce one half of the good Effects which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from it, it muſt be very deſirable; and we cannot but look upon every Attempt to defeat the Meaſures taken to obtain it, as ungenerous and unchriſtian.</p>
               <p>AS to all the Purpoſes of Government, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thinks they might be as well anſwered by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries</hi>; but both Reaſon and Experience teach the contrary. Some Branches of the epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority cannot be communicated to Commiſſaries; and where it is otherwiſe, Power in the Hands of a Delegate of an inferior Rank, has never that Weight and good Effect, as when exerciſed by the Principal. For theſe and other Reaſons, when Trial was formerly made of <hi>American</hi> Commiſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they were found by no Means to anſwer the Purpoſes of their Appointment.</p>
               <p>THE Public has been aſſured, from Time to Time, that none of thoſe <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> againſt which there is ſo general a Prejudice, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate. Some have pretended to ſuſpect, that our real Intentions are different from our Profeſſions; and Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:011203_0128_0F94FA07F526A0E0"/>
thinks he has at laſt detected us. For he has ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaciouſly diſcovered, that if an immoral Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to be <hi>tried</hi> and condemned, there muſt be <hi>Courts</hi> for his Trial and Condemnation. <hi>Where,</hi> ſays he p. 78, <hi>is the Caſe to be tried? Can it be tried any where, conformably to the Mode of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church, but in a</hi> SPIRITUAL COURT? We are under no peculiar Attachment to the <hi>Mode</hi> of Practice in the eccleſiaſtical Courts at Home, nor will <hi>American</hi> Biſhops be obliged to follow it. And as to ſuch Courts as may be erected in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the Trial of the epiſcopal Clergy ONLY, the Doctor, I again ſay, need give himſelf no Concern about them, unleſs he expects to become an epiſcopal Clergyman himſelf. For none have Reaſon to object againſt Things, but upon the Suppoſition that they are to be, in ſome Manner, affected by them. The <hi>popular</hi> Objection againſt <hi>ſpiritual Courts,</hi> is altogether founded on the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their being injurious, not to the Clergy, but to the <hi>Laity</hi>; but where ſpiritual Courts take no Cognizance at all of the Actions of the Laity, as it is intended that they never ſhall in <hi>America,</hi> this Objection vaniſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT is obſerved,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>that</hi>
                  <q>the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's being under the Eye of their Biſhop will naturally tend to make them, in general, more regular and diligent in the Diſcharge of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their office.</q>
And what Objection can he make to this? Why, <hi>if their being under the Eye of the omnipreſent, omniſcient God, will not make them regular and diligent, it is a vain Thing to expect that their being under</hi> 'the Eye of the Biſhop' <hi>ſhould do it.</hi> And with equal Truth and Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety he might have ſaid, of all but Atheiſts, that
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011203_0129_0F94FA082329C908"/>
                  <hi>if their being under the Eye of the omnipreſent, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient God,</hi> will not reſtrain Men from the Crimes of Fraud and Injuſtice, <hi>it is a vain Thing to expect that their being under the Eye</hi> of the civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate <hi>ſhould do it.</hi> That the perpetual Preſence and Inſpection of the Supreme Being <hi>ought</hi> to have a greater Effect upon Men, than the Preſence of any earthly Superior, I freely allow; but that it does not actually produce this Effect, in innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtances, is a melancholy Truth, and upon one Moment's Recollection, the Doctor muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it. What then is to be done? Muſt Men be left to do "what is right in their own Eyes," becauſe they will not conſider themſelves as <hi>under the Eye of the omnipreſent, omniſcient God?</hi> Ought Criminals to go unpuniſhed, becauſe they will not govern themſelves by the great Motives of Religion? Or where theſe are ineffectual, is it impoſſible that Men ſhould be governed by Motives of a temporal Nature; or can it conſiſt with public Wiſdom and the Safety of Society, that ſuch Perſons ſhould not be reſtrained by human Laws? According to this Scheme of Politicks, it is unreaſonable to expect any Benefit, either from Diſcipline in the Church, or from Government in the State.</p>
               <p>FARTHER Exception is taken at the Expreſſion, that the <hi>American</hi> Clergy will be <hi>under the Eye</hi> of their future Biſhop, as highly figurative. But fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative as it is, it may be juſtified by common Uſage. To ſay of a Clergyman who is even in the immediate Preſence of his Biſhop, that he is under his Eye, is a figurative Expreſſion; and is never, I believe, underſtood in a ſtrict literal Senſe. To be under the Eye of a Superior, in common Language ſignifies, to be within the Compaſs of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:011203_0130_0F94FA09567995F8"/>
his Obſervation and Notice. And this will, in ſome Degree, be the Caſe of every <hi>American</hi> Clergyman, under the propoſed Epiſcopate. Allowing that a Number of them will be <hi>fixed in Cures, ſome Fifty, ſome a Hundred, and ſome two or three Hundred Miles</hi> from the Place of the Biſhop's Reſidence; yet by Means of Viſitations, and a free Correſpondence, nothing very material can ariſe in a Clergyman's Situation or Conduct, without the Biſhop's having early Notice of it:—Very early, in Compariſon with what it would be, if he were at the Diſtance of a Thouſand Leagues.</p>
               <p>WHAT follows upon the Subject of Diſcipline, is either of no Conſequence, or has been anſwered already: I ſhall therefore now attend upon the Doctor, in his Objections to what was advanced, under the Head of <hi>Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AMONG the Diſadvantages, to which the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> is ſubject, for Want of Ordination, the Danger of croſſing the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> for the Purpoſe of obtaining Holy Orders, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as worthy of Attention. For an Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Point, the following Fact was related.
<q>The exact Number of thoſe that have gone Home for Ordination, from theſe northern Colonies, is Fifty-two. Of theſe Forty-two have returned ſafely, and Ten have miſcarried; the Voyage or Sickneſs <hi>occaſioned by it,</hi> having proved fatal to near a fifth Part of them.</q>
The Doctor replies; <hi>I have never heard of more than Two to whom the Sea proved fatal. If Eight more loſt their Lives by Sickneſs, it is no more than they might have done if they had tarried at Home,</hi> p. 81. If he knows but of Two, to whom the Sea proved fatal, I can tell
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011203_0131_0F94FA0A0AEC2480"/>
him of ſeveral. Within a Year of the Time of writing the <hi>Appeal,</hi> Two periſhed in one Ship upon the Coaſt of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> almoſt in Sight of their Port; one of whom left a Wife and Family of ſmall Children in <hi>New-York,</hi> without any other Means of Support, than the charitable Aſſiſtance of their Chriſtian Neighbours. As to thoſe that loſt their Lives by Sickneſs, it is true, <hi>they might have</hi> died <hi>if they had tarried at Home</hi>; as thoſe who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at Sea might have been <hi>drowned</hi> at Home in freſh Water. But the Aſſertion is, not that they died abroad; but that they died of
<q>Sickneſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Voyage,</q>
—<hi>i. e.</hi> of Sickneſs, to which, in all Probability, they would not have been expoſed, were it not for the Voyage. And this is ſtrictly true of them in every Inſtance. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Doctor may not think much of our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates dying of contagious Diſorders, ſince ſuch are no more than what are called natural Deaths, and all muſt die ſooner or later. If he can be of this Opinion after recollecting, that ſuch Perſons have been taken off in the <hi>Prime</hi> of Life—juſt as they were entring into public Stations, in which they flattered themſelves that they ſhould be uſeful to the World—that they died in a foreign Land, at a Diſtance from their deareſt Friends and Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—I will not diſpute it with him. But what does he think, of our Candidates being carried into Captivity—thrown into noiſome Priſons in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Country—and there languiſhing, for many Months, under the moſt hideous Forms of Diſtreſs and Wretchedneſs? Even this has happened in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances, and may happen again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT be the Danger great or ſmall, ſays he, there is good Reaſon to believe, the going to England for
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011203_0132_0F94FA0AC9B64848"/>
Ordination is rather an Advantage, than Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Church in Regard to its being ſupplied with Miniſters.</hi> If going to <hi>England</hi> for Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding the Danger and Expence that attend it, <hi>is an Advantage</hi> to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; why would not going thither for Ordination, be alſo an Advantage to all <hi>the Churches of the Colonies?</hi> And why is not this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage generally purſued? For although their Candidates may be ordained here, there is no Doubt but, if they ſhould be found qualified, they might be ordained in <hi>England,</hi> as well as ours. The Doctor declares that HE <hi>ſhould eſteem it a happy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in this Caſe, was he inclined to take Orders,</hi> that he muſt go to <hi>England</hi> for that Purpoſe. If he was always of this Way of thinking, why did he not go to <hi>England</hi> to receive ſuch Ordination as he has? It is no ſufficient Anſwer to ſay that he could be ordained here; for if he was at Liberty to go to <hi>England,</hi> and if his going was conſidered by him as a Thing deſirable on the whole, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in him not to go. Nay, if he is of ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or adventurous Turn, why does he not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it by a Voyage now, although he is not <hi>inclined to take Orders?</hi> For, as I underſtand him, he ſpeaks in the preſent Tenſe. If a Man deſires to go to <hi>England</hi> for a Thing which he might as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without going; he muſt be equally deſirous of going thither, if that Thing were intirely out of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>BUT all Men have not the ſame Diſpoſition with the Doctor; and if <hi>many,</hi> to whom he has menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Matter, <hi>have declared themſelves to be of the ſame Mind,</hi> there are certainly many others, I imagine a great Majority, who have different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011203_0133_0F94FA0B8C7F2478"/>
When Dr. <hi>Cutler,</hi> Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> declared their Conformity to the Church, and went Home from <hi>Connecticut</hi> for Ordination; it is well known, that an Apprehenſion of the Dangers of the Voyage, was what prevented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Diſſenting Miniſters of that Colony, whoſe Names I could mention, all Men of the like excellent Character with thoſe Gentlemen, from declaring alſo their Conformity, and going with them. This is a Fact which Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to have heard of, and he can hardly have forgoten it. There have been frequent Inſtances of the like Nature, of which probably he has not heard. Now with Regard to all ſuch Perſons, it is a great Hardſhip upon them, that they cannot obtain what they are deſirous of having; as it is a Hardſhip upon the Church, to be precluded from the Benefit of their Services, while they are ſo greatly wanted.</p>
               <p>AGAINST the Complaint of the <hi>Expenſiveneſs</hi> of a Voyage to <hi>England</hi> for Ordination, the Doctor advances an Objection, which carries with it the moſt tremendous <hi>Appearance.</hi> As this Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me has afforded ſome Speculation to the Curious, I will ſtate and explain it with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Care.</p>
               <p>IT was ſaid in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 34, that
<q>the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of this Voyage cannot be reckoned at leſs, upon an Average, than a hundred Pounds Sterling, to each Perſon</q>
—and that it
<q>muſt generally fall upon ſuch, as having already expended the greateſt Part of their Pittance in their Education, will find it extremely hard to raiſe a Sum ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Purpoſe.</q>
In Anſwer to this, the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011203_0134_0F94FA0FB6395130"/>
Doctor very <hi>candidly ſuppoſes I had never ſeen, or, if I had, did not remember at the Time of writing, the Account of the Society publiſhed in</hi> 1706, <hi>in which they ſay,</hi>
                  <q>all young Students in thoſe Parts (<hi>the Colonies</hi>) who deſire epiſcopal Ordination, are invited into <hi>England</hi>; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be defrayed by the Society,</q>
p. 82. Again, he repeats this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in p. 90; <hi>the Society,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has publickly invited into England all young Students in theſe Parts, who deſire holy Orders; declaring</hi> THAT THEIR EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENCE IN COMING AND RETURNING IS TO BE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FRAYED BY THE SOCIETY. <hi>This is the Fact truly ſtated.</hi> The Complaint made in the <hi>Appeal</hi> is, that the Voyage is expenſive; the Anſwer by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> is manifeſtly contrived to excite the Idea, that it is not expenſive. The Complaint ſays, the Expence upon an Average, is a hundred Pounds Sterling, to each Perſon; the Anſwer leads the Reader to believe, that it is not a Farthing. But this is not the worſt of it; the Anſwer appears to me to be <hi>artfully</hi> calculated to lead the Reader alſo to believe Something farther—namely, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a plain Matter of Fact, with Regard to which it is impoſſible that any Miſſionary can be miſtaken, I have publiſhed to the World an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, wilful Falſhood; a Falſhood, which I knew might be eaſily detected by any of our Adverſaries; a Falſhood, which was known to be ſuch, not only by every Miſſionary on the Continent, but by every Member of the Society both here and at Home, and by every Biſhop in the Kingdom. So that I fear the Doctor really intended to lead his Readers to believe me to have been in this Matter, both a notorious Liar, and abominably ſtupid. I have freely mentioned what I ſtrongly ſuſpect, and what
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011203_0135_0F94FA100604F460"/>
I know to be ſuſpected by many others. If he can exculpate himſelf, I think it greatly concerns him to do it: Or if any of his Friends can clear him, it is in their Power to do him a moſt material Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author of a <hi>fictitions</hi> Letter from <hi>a Member of the Society,</hi> which has been publiſhed in one of the <hi>New-York</hi> Papers, has endeavoured to vindicate Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> from the Charges of Falſhood and Inſincerity, which had been brought againſt him on Account of his Conduct in this Affair. But unleſs he ſhould have the good Luck to meet with an abler and fairer Advocate, his Reputation muſt ſuffer, wherever the Caſe ſhall be known. The Doctor has received and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the formal <hi>Thanks</hi> of his Brethren, for his <hi>Anſwer to the Appeal</hi>; it is hoped that they had no particular Reference to this Part of his Performance, when they paid him the Compliment.</note>. Nothing leſs, in my Opinion, can excuſe him to the World and to his own Conſcience, than proper Evidence that he himſelf believes, and has Reaſon for believing, that I have actually been guilty of ſuch baſe and abſurd Conduct, as his Inſinuations manifeſly imply. But that he believes any ſuch Thing himſelf, he does not ſay: He only ſays, that <hi>the Society</hi> HAS, meaning upwards of 60 Years ago, <hi>publickly invited</hi> over young Students, promiſing to defray their Expences. This, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its Appearance, is not in Reality any Contradiction to my Aſſertion, which evidently related to the preſent State of the Church, and not to the State of it in the Beginning of this Century.</p>
               <p>THAT the Society publiſhed ſuch an Invitation in 1706, I believe to be true; but it appears that the Invitation was only occaſional, and that none complied with it. It was not until ſeveral Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the firſt Candidates from this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try went Home for holy Orders, before which
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011203_0136_0F94FA10E3F4A2B8"/>
Time the Invitation was recalled, or rather had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; and neither they, nor any of their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, ſo far as I can learn, received Benefit from it. If the Doctor knew this, he muſt have known that this antiquated Invitation of the Society, which never took Effect, was no more an Anſwer to the Complaint againſt which he alledged it, than if he had quoted one of the ancient Engliſh Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lollards.</hi> If he knew it not, he ought to have ſuſpected his own Ignorance, and to have inquired into the Matter, when he found that it was ſo publickly and boldly aſſerted.</p>
               <p>IN a Word; <hi>the Truth of Fact</hi> is, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety are under no Engagements to defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of Candidates in going home for Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do not defray them, and, I believe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have, ſo much as in one Inſtance, defrayed them, either wholly or in Part. In a few Caſes they have made Donations to Candidates, in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome extraordinary Loſſes or Diſtreſſes ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Voyage, but never more that I know of, than a Compenſation for ſuch extraordinary Loſſes; and they make it a Rule to advance half a Year's Salary to their Miſſionaries, before their Embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for <hi>America,</hi> to enable them the better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray their own Expences. As this Matter is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explained in a late well-received Pamphlet, written in <hi>Vindication</hi> of a Sermon of the Lord Biſhop of LANDAFF, I need not enlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>THE next Thing the Doctor controverts with me, is the following Obſervation.
<q>Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have contributed to this general Want of Clergymen in <hi>America,</hi> but it has always been <hi>principally</hi> owing to the great Difficulty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011203_0137_0F94FA1704BE4390"/>
Ordination.</q>
This Opinion might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſupported both by Authorities and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; but it is ſufficient to conſider what is objected againſt it. The Doctor, after telling us that the <hi>New-England</hi> Miſſions are generally filled, aſks, upon my View of the Caſe, <hi>why ſhould the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be ſo great in other Provinces, and none at all in the New-England ones, or ſo inconſiderable, as to be eaſily got over? If it was in itſelf a real and great Difficulty, its Operation would be as powerful in theſe Colonies as the other,</hi> p. 83. I never before heard, that the Difficulty of ſupplying the <hi>New-England</hi> Miſſions with Clergymen, <hi>is none at all, or ſo inconſiderable as to be</hi> EASILY <hi>got over.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Miſſionaries themſelves, and the People of their reſpective Miſſions, will agree in telling a very different Story. I will point out to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor one Caſe, which of itſelf is more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to confute all that he has ſaid, or can ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of ſupplying the <hi>New-England</hi> Miſſions. The Members of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> at <hi>Hebron,</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> exerted themſelves for near twenty Years, and were at great Expence in ſending home four Candidates ſucceſſively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had the Satisfaction of enjoying a reſident Miſſionary. They firſt ſent home Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> in 1745, who was admitted to Holy Orders, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Society their Miſſionary for <hi>Hebron</hi>; but in returning to his Miſſion, and to a Wife and ſeveral ſmall Children who depended upon him for their daily Support, he is ſuppoſed to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at Sea, neither the Ship nor any Perſon on board having been ever heard of. The next, was Mr. <hi>Colton</hi>; who in 1752, died on his Paſſage from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>New-England,</hi> and was buried in the Ocean. The third Candidate ſent Home by
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011203_0138_0F94FA18D4B08628"/>
this unfortunate People, was Mr. <hi>Uſher</hi>; who, in his Way to <hi>England,</hi> in 1757, was taken by the <hi>French,</hi> thrown into Priſon, and at laſt died in the Caſtle of <hi>Bayonne.</hi> The fourth was Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>; who in 1759, not long after his Arrival in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> was taken with the Small-Pox, from which he had the good Fortune to recover—and at length, to the great Joy of the People, he arrived at <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> where he is at preſent the Society's worthy Miſſionary <note n="†" place="bottom">See the <hi>Abſtract</hi> for 1759.</note>. If any Preſbyterian or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Society in the Colonies had ſuffered in this Manner; much more, if all of them were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered liable to ſuffer in this Manner, through the Want of ſuch a full Toleration as was allowed to all other religious Denominations; I am much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, if the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions would not reſound with, at leaſt, Lamentations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. And if the Legiſlature ſhould not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpoſe for the Relief of ſuch Sufferers, theſe very Writers, who can conſider the Matter as a meer Trifle in the Caſe of the Church, would, if I know any Thing of their Genius and Diſpoſition, be found to make endleſs Outcries of Injuſtice and Cruelty. But ſuch is the Blindneſs of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial Bigots, that on one Side they miſtake Mountains for Mole-Hills, and on the other Side, Mole-Hills for Mountains!</p>
               <p>AFTER all, ſhould I allow that, according to the Doctor's Repreſentation, there is no Difficulty, or rather that notwithſtanding the Difficulty, the <hi>New-England</hi> Miſſions are commonly ſupplied; it will by no Means follow, that Difficulties which are ſurmounted by the People of <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:011203_0139_0F94FA1A47B4ABE8"/>
would not intimidate and deter others, in the ſouthern Colonies.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor, not liking the Reaſon aſſigned in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> for the great Want of American Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen, proceeds to aſſign Reaſons of his own. One is, that the Society neglect the ſouthern Colonies, that they may be more able to <hi>epiſcopize</hi> thoſe of <hi>New-England.</hi> But this is ſtale common-place Abuſe, and the Charge has been confuted over and over. It has been moſt thoroughly confuted in a very full and compleat <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s
<q>Obſervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society.</q>
A Sentence indeed is quoted from the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff's Sermon,</hi> to prove that this is the grand Object of <hi>the Society</hi>; but the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to that Purpoſe is a manifeſt Perverſion. The Biſhop ſays:
<q>This Point (the propoſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate) obtained, the <hi>American</hi> Church will go out of its infant State; be able to ſtand upon its own Legs; and without foreign Help to ſupport and ſpread itſelf. THEN the Buſineſs of this Society will have been brought to the happy Iſſue intended.</q>
This laſt Sentence is what the Doctor alledges, as a Proof of the Society's Intentions. But let any impartial Perſon view its Connection with what preceded, and he will find it impoſſible not to ſee, that the Biſhop ſays no ſuch Thing as he is made to ſay. His Lordſhip men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Time, wherein
<q>the Buſineſs of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety will be brought to the happy Iſſue intended;</q>
but <hi>when</hi> does he ſay this Time will be? No other Anſwer can fairly be given to the Queſtion than this: He ſays
<q>the Buſineſs of the Society will have been brought to the happy Iſſue intended,</q>
when "the <hi>American</hi> Church" ſhall
<q>be able to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011203_0140_0F94FA1A8438D368"/>
ſtand upon its own Legs, and without foreign Help to ſupport and ſpread itſelf.</q>
But how does Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> anſwer the above Queſtion? Let us take it in his own Words: <hi>The View indeed of the Society,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has been to epiſcopize theſe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and this they have made their great Buſineſs: Inſomuch that ſhould it be accompliſhed,</hi>
                  <q>it will THEN have been brought to the happy Iſſue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>as we are told, in plain Words, by the Biſhop of Landaff.</hi>
                  </q>
Does then the Biſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff</hi> tell us in <hi>plain Words,</hi> that
<q>the happy Iſſue intended</q>
by the Society is, according to the quaint Phraſeology lately introduced, the <hi>Epiſcopization</hi> of the <hi>New-England</hi> Colonies? Does he ſay any Thing that implies it? Cannot the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in <hi>America</hi> ſtand upon its own Legs and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port itſelf, until the Preſbyterians and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſts of <hi>New-England</hi> ſhall be made Proſelytes to it? Do not the congregational Churches at this Day ſtand upon their own Legs and ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Colonies without <hi>unepiſcopizing</hi> the Members of the Church? In Order therefore to maintain his Charge againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> even after an Abatement of what is ſaid about <hi>plain Words,</hi> will not the Doctor be obliged to have Recourſe to <hi>Lord Peter</hi>'s Invention, of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out <hi>totidem Literis,</hi> ſince he muſt fail in the Method of attempting it <hi>totidem Verbis,</hi> and even <hi>totidem Syllabis?</hi> But enough of this.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Reaſon given by the Doctor for the Want of <hi>American</hi> Clergymen, is the Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Church People to educate their Sons for this Service. But if their Backwardneſs is much owing to the great Difficulty of obtaining Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I am perſuaded it is, although the Doctor

ſuppoſes otherwiſe, it contradicts not, but coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides with, the general Reaſon aſſigned in the <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS laſt Reaſon is, <hi>the Inſufficiency of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in moſt Caſes, to influence Candidates</hi> of other Denominations to conform to the Church. <hi>They have,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>a better Proſpect in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, than they would have ſhould they change Sides, and become Epiſcopalians.</hi> This, I believe, is, and hitherto has been, the Caſe; and now that it is confeſſed on the Part of our Adverſaries, I hope we ſhall no longer be reproached with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Church from mercenary Motives. Thoſe Candidates who have given up the <hi>better Proſpect in continuing with them,</hi> certainly ought not to be conſidered as Men of no Conſciences, however miſtaken they may be thought to have been with Regard to their Principles. Many ſuch we have already had; others are coming over to us daily; and had we Biſhops in this Country, I ſhould not doubt of a full Supply for all the Churches in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was obſerved in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 36, that a very
<q>glaring Diſadvantage, to which the Church in <hi>America</hi> is manifeſtly ſubject, ariſes from the Impoſſibility that a Biſhop reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be ſufficiently acquainted with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of thoſe who go home from this Country for Holy Orders. To this it is owing, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination has been ſometimes fraudulently and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiouſly obtained by ſuch Wretches, as are not only a Scandal to the Church, but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to human Nature.</q>
Upon this, and more to the ſame Purpoſe ſaid of ſuch Perſons, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011203_0142_0F94FA1C0BC79448"/>
with his uſual Sagacity, obſerves, in p. 85: <hi>Had ſuch a Charge been publickly exhibited againſt the Society's Miſſionaries, by thoſe of the Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Congregational Perſuaſion, it would have been diſregarded at home, and eſteemed by Epiſcopalians here a ſure Argument of inveterate Enmity againſt the Church.</hi> The Doctor is right here; it would undoubtedly, and very juſtly, be ſo diſregarded and ſo eſteemed. But will he venture to affirm, or does he mean to inſinuate, that I had <hi>exhibited ſuch a Charge againſt the Society's Miſſionaries,</hi> or againſt the Body of the <hi>American</hi> Clergy? Did I ſo much as mention the Miſſionaries? In ſhort, did I utter a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Word that implies, or carries the leaſt Intimation, that I entertained an unfavourable Opinion of the <hi>American</hi> Clergy? On the other Hand, did I not declare my Belief to be, that their
<q>general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is truly reſpectable</q>
—that
<q>they are ſound and ſteady in their Principles, and regular in their Behaviour?</q>
But what I ſaid was, that Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been SOMETIMES, or, as it was expreſſed in another Place, IN SOME INSTANCES, fraudulently obtained by Wretches, who, in my Opinion, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered the Deſcription there given of them. When this was ſaid, it was with Reference chiefly to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that never were admitted into the Society's Service. Indeed there was one Inſtance among the Miſſionaries that could not be overlooked; an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which was the Subject of common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation at the Time of my writing, of a Perſon then lately ordained and appointed to a Miſſion in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>—ſaid to have been ordained upon Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonials from this Country, which Teſtimonials it was commonly thought muſt have been <hi>forged,</hi> as his Character here was ſo notoriouſly infamous. But before this Perſon embarked for his Miſſion,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011203_0143_0F94FA1CC949A3C8"/>
his true Character was diſcovered, and the Society immediately diſcarded him. Now of ſuch Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as theſe, who <hi>ſometimes</hi> creep into the Church, <hi>thoſe of the Preſbyterian or Congregational Perſuaſion,</hi> may ſpeak as reproachfully as they pleaſe, and no <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> either <hi>here</hi> or <hi>at home,</hi> will <hi>eſteem</hi> it <hi>an Argument of inveterate Enmity to the Church.</hi> We think no Deſcription too bad for ſuch Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; we never ſpare them ourſelves; we blame not the Diſſenters for any Severity of Language to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. But what we blame them for, is, their indiſcriminate Invectives againſt the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy in general—againſt the whole Body of the Miſſionaries—and, which has been very frequent of late, againſt all thoſe that have met together in <hi>voluntary Convention.</hi> The Doctor has not run the Length of ſome others; but I could mention cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain periodical Writers, who have ſignalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the moſt undiſtinguiſhing and illiberal Abuſe of the Clergy, of the Biſhops, and indeed of every Thing that relates to the Church; and if ſome of their Accounts might be taken, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion would naturally be made, that there is not a Clergyman in the Colonies who is of a tolerable Character, any more than a Biſhop in the Kingdom who is not a ſpiritual Tyrant, a lordly Oppreſſor, a Friend of Perſecution, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>AS to the Matter of Teſtimonials, the Doctor ſuppoſes <hi>the Caſe would be the ſame was there</hi> A <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in America,</hi> as it is at preſent; ſince he could not be particularly acquainted with the Characters of the Candidates. <hi>One</hi> Biſhop only is not thought ſufficient for all the Colonies in America; but had we Biſhops, they might be perſonally acquainted, if not with all the Candidates, yet with all thoſe
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011203_0144_0F94FA1DC9CC29D8"/>
from whom Teſtimonials muſt come; and ſuch an Acquaintance would enable them to make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Diſtinctions, and to give to each Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation the Weight reſpectively due to it. One Clergyman's Recommendation is equal to another's, if they are both conſidered only as Clergymen; but if they are conſidered under their diſtinguiſhing Characters, the one being perhaps a Perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Penetration and inflexible Integrity, the other but of an ordinary Capacity, and eaſily bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed and deceived, their different Teſtimonies will have a very unequal Force, with the Biſhop who knows them. But as what might properly be ſaid here, has been anticipated already; I beg Leave to refer the Reader to it, rather than to repeat it. Upon the Whole, had we Biſhops in this Country, I am firmly perſuaded, that with proper Care, and due Regulations, it would be next to impoſſible for a Man of an exceptionable Character to obtain Ordination. One general Regulation, if I might take the Liberty, I would humbly propoſe, viz. That, when the propoſed Epiſcopate ſhall be ſettled, the Plan marked out in the Directions of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Wake to the Biſhops of his Province in 1716, ſo far as it relates to the Subject of Teſtimonials, with a few Alterations, ſhould be an eſtabliſhed Rule for the American Biſhops <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Directions at large in Burn's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Law,</hi> Title ORDINATION.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT is certain,</hi> ſays the Doctor, in p. 87, <hi>many notoriouſly wicked Perſons in England, vaſtly more in Proportion than in America, have found Ways—to get into Orders</hi>; and he endeavours in many Places to eſtabliſh a Belief, that the Clergy at home, under the immediate Government of Biſhops, are worſe,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011203_0145_0F94FA220543AFD0"/>
than they are here without an Epiſcopate. And he leaves his Readers to draw for themſelves this natural Inference, that American Biſhops will be more likely to corrupt, than to reform the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. But what he calls <hi>certain,</hi> is a Matter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which others may poſſibly think that he cannot obtain <hi>Certainty.</hi> But allowing it to be true, that there are in Proportion more immoral Clergymen there than in America; unleſs he can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that more Perſons, in Proportion, of bad Characters <hi>at the Time of their Ordination,</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited from a common Dioceſs in England, than from America, the Obſervation will not anſwer his Purpoſe. The Point under Conſideration, is the Caſe of bad Men's obtaining Teſtimonials, and impoſing upon the Biſhop; but if a Man, of a fair Reputation, at the Time of his being ordained, afterwards relapſes and becomes Profligate, he is not within the Compaſs of the preſent Argument. But ſhould we grant all that the Doctor contends for; it has been already ſhewn, that the Caſe of the Church here, under an Epiſcopate, will be ſo very different from what it is in England, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Biſhop's Superintendency, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference intended will not follow.</p>
               <p>DR. <hi>Chauncy</hi> cloſes his third Section with this Obſervation: <hi>Should the whole of what the Dr. has offered be allowed its full Force,</hi> (which, by the Way, is an Acknowledgment that hitherto he had not allowed its full Force to what I had offered) <hi>without the leaſt Abatement,</hi> (and why ſhould there be any Abatement of the <hi>real</hi> Force of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Obſervation?) <hi>There is no other Hardſhip, or Difficulty, in the Caſe, than what naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from profeſſed Principles, and muſt unavoidably
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011203_0146_0F94FA23E4AD1578"/>
follow upon them, unleſs an Eſtabliſhment is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made in their Favor,</hi> p. 88. I am not clear that I underſtand the Meaning of this Sentence. What an Eſtabliſhment has to do with the Subject in Debate, I know not. This has never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted—It is no Part of our Plan—nor is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Execution of it; Ordination by a Biſhop no more ſuppoſing, or implying, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon, or being connected with, a civil Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, than the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm by a Preſbyter. As to the other Part of the Sentence, there is ſomething in it that looks extremely ill-favoured. <hi>There is no other Hardſhip, or Difficulty, in the Caſe, than what naturally ariſes from profeſſed Principles!</hi> This looks as if, in the Doctor's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Men were not to be pitied, when their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings reſult from their Principles. The moſt dreadful Perſecutions are no more than Sufferings inflicted upon Men for, and conſequently, in ſome Senſe reſulting from, <hi>their profeſſed Principles.</hi> But does the Doctor mean that we ſhould be left to ſuffer, becauſe it is on Account of our Principles? Or that Men, of whoſe Principles HE does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, ought to be perſecuted? From arguing upon the Matter <hi>a priori,</hi> I cannot believe that he means this; from arguing <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> I know not what to believe.</p>

               <p>THE Deſign of the fourth Section of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SECT. IV.</note> was to ſhew the unparalleled Hardſhip of the preſent Caſe of the Church of England in the American Colonies. That for Want of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate, the American Church of England is really in a ſuffering State, the Members of it feel, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Inſtances; and by this Time it muſt be ſo evident to others, that a formal Proof of it is needleſs. That the particular Species or Mode of this Suffering is <hi>unparalleled,</hi> is as evident as that we ſuffer at all. It is in this Reſpect, and not on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Degree</hi> of Suffering, that the Word <hi>unparalleled</hi> was uſed. This was ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the <hi>Appeal</hi> by the Word <hi>unprecedented,</hi> and it is inconceivable that any can miſtake it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they miſtake wilfully.</p>
               <p>AGAINST what was ſaid of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's being in a moſt wretched and deplorable Condition in the Colonies, Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> objects: <hi>It may, on the contrary, be affirmed, as a moſt unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Truth, that the Epiſcopal Churches in moſt of the Colonies, are favored and diſtinguiſhed far beyond any other Churches of whatever Denomination on the Continent,</hi> p. 92. The Reaſon which ſupports this Aſſertion immediately follows: They <hi>are preſerved in being by a vaſtly extenſive Charity.</hi> By the Way, it is no Evidence that a Church is not in a deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it owes the Preſervation of its very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011203_0148_0F94FA25E075E7F0"/>
to Charity. The Charity here meant, is that of the Venerable <hi>Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> of the Greatneſs of which, we are as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as the Doctor. The Charity of this Society is as unprecedented in Degree, as the Sufferings of the American Church are in Kind; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we conſider it, it prevents, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our <hi>ſighing out Groans</hi> (or groaning out Sighs) as it preſents to us <hi>abundant Reaſon for the moſt grateful Acknowledgments.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Care the Society has taken to provide proper Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen for deſtitute Congregations, and the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it has been at in ſupporting them; without an Epiſcopate, the Church wants an eſſential Part of her Conſtitution, ſome of her moſt important Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices cannot be performed at all, and her common ones are frequently not performed ſo well, as might be expected under the Superintendency of reſident Biſhops. This, I will venture to ſay again, is a deplorable Condition for any Church to be in, whether ſhe has Revenues of her own, or ſubſiſts upon Charity; and none can be more ſenſible of it, than the Society itſelf.</p>
               <p>THIS State, which is deplorable in itſelf, is alſo unprecedented and unparalleled. That other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have not been as <hi>great</hi> Sufferers as the Church of England in the Colonies, was never pretended. Perhaps all <hi>really</hi> perſecuted Churches have, upon the whole, ſuffered as much, and many certainly have ſuffered infinitely more; while the Members of ſome, have made loud Complaints of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have not had ſo juſt Reaſon to complain, as we have. But if the Suffering of the American Church of England is not uncommon as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, yet all muſt allow that it is of a very
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011203_0149_0F94FA2688FAF728"/>
extraordinary Nature. In what Age, in what Part of the World, can a like Inſtance be found, either among Chriſtians or Pagans? Where, and when, did any Nation ſuffer its own Religion, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which it had freely choſen and eſtabliſhed at Home, to be upon a worſe Footing, than all other Religions, in its Colonies? In Colonies conſiſting, not of conquered Enemies, but of Children that had iſſued from its own Loins? If an Example can be found, let it be pointed out. We will then confeſs that our Caſe is not <hi>unprecedented</hi>; but ſtill, that it is not <hi>very hard,</hi> we will never confeſs.</p>
               <p>BUT ſays the Doctor, <hi>it is unaccountably ſtrange that he</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Appeal) ſhould mention it as</hi> 'an unprecedented Caſe,' <hi>and deſcribe the Church as</hi> 'ſingled out for the firſt Example of it'. We ſay, and believe, it is the firſt; if he knows of another, let him produce it. Why, ſays the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>did he never hear of the infinitely more diſtreſſed Condition of the great Numbers that were deprived, fined, impriſoned, and, in other Ways, moſt cruelly dealt with, in the Days of thoſe hard-hearted Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Parker, Bancroft, Whitgift, and Laud?</hi> Yes, I have heard of theſe Things; and I aſſure him, that whatever I think of Deprivations in ſome Caſes, I am no Friend to Fines and Impriſonments on a religious Account. But I never heard before, that the Caſe here mentioned, was parallel with the preſent Caſe of the Church of England in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, or that it was a Precedent of the like Nature; which it is here his only Buſineſs to ſhew. I have heard alſo of the Babyloniſh Captivity; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be a Precedent as much to the Purpoſe, as the Inſtance he has mentioned. But whether the Inſtance was pertinent or not, ſeems to have
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:011203_0150_0F95324516F814C8"/>
been thought no Matter of Conſequence; it was ſufficient for his Purpoſe, that it afforded an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of introducing a Number of Archbiſhops, in order to blacken their Characters.</p>
               <p>AS to the Archbiſhops Parker and Whitgift, they ſuperintended and conducted the Affairs of the Church, during the greateſt Part of Queen Elizabeth's Reign. As they were Men of Firmneſs and Reſolution, ſo they appear to have been not wanting in Temper and Moderation at the ſame Time. The Doctor repreſents them under the Idea of Perſecutors: But we meet but with few Acts of undue Severity, and many of exemplary Mildneſs and Gentleneſs, in the Courſe of their Proceedings, In the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Life of the former <note n="*" place="bottom">Book II. Numb. XXIV.</note>, Strype has given us a Letter from the Queen to him, in which ſhe blames <hi>him</hi> and the other Biſhops, for their Backwardneſs in urging Conformity.</p>
               <p>AS to Whitgift, even Wilſon, who was more than half a Puritan himſelf, ſays of him, that
<q>he ſtrove to prevail on the Puritans with <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gentleneſs</hi>; and died—leaving a Name, like a ſweet Perfume behind him</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Three Letters</hi> to the Author of the <hi>Confeſſional; Let.</hi> I. p. 31.</note>. We learn from Strype, that his natural Temper was mild, and that he treated even his great Antagoniſt, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, when he had him in his Power, ſo courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and kindly, that the Earl of Leiceſter, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the latter, thanked the Archbiſhop for his remarkable Civility to him. One of his worſt and moſt implacable Enemies was the fiery Udal, a Leader of the Puritans: When this Perſon was
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011203_0151_0F9532437019C820"/>
under Sentence of Death for Felony, the Archbiſhop made Intereſt in his Favor, and actually obtained his Pardon, according to the ſame Hiſtorian. But I need not be particular, as the general Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Puritans under the Reign of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and therein the Behaviour of the Archbiſhops was fully vindicated by Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> who was as good a Judge of it as any Man in the Kingdom, and being always inclined to favor the Puritans, he cannot be ſuſpected of Partiality againſt them <note n="‡" place="bottom">In his Letter to Monſieur Critoy, in Burnet's Hiſt. Ref. Vol. II.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BANCROFT</hi> was more rigorous in his Meaſures than his immediate Predeceſſor, and the Times required it. Laud was ſtill more ſevere than Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft, and his Provocations were greater. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not to juſtify all their Proceedings; for I abhor every Appearance of Intolerance and Cruelty, even in an Archbiſhop. Theſe Appearances are the greateſt Blemiſhes of their Characters; and they are the general Reproach of the Age in which they acted. There was not a Puritan in the Kingdom at that Time, nor had there been from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who did not give inconteſtible Evidence, that if he had been armed with the like Power, he would have preſſed Conformity to his own Syſtem, with as unrelenting Zeal, as either of thoſe Prelates. Not long afterwards, the Puritans became poſſeſſed of Power; Conformity then was urged with a Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the Collection of Sermons preached before the <hi>long Parliament,</hi> Toleration is profeſſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Burgeſs, Caſe, Calamy, Baxter, Newco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many others, as one of the greateſt Evils.</p>
               <p>BUT to return to the Two Archbiſhops: If we conceive of them under the Idea only of rigorous
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011203_0152_0F9532442F3338B0"/>
Exacters of Conformity, we do them Injuſtice. It ought to be remembered that they were Men of eminent Abilities, of invincible Integrity, of undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Piety, and zealous Advocates for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.
<q>Bancroft, ſays Fuller, was a moſt ſtout Champion to aſſert Church Diſcipline.</q>
But to ſhew that there was ſomething amiable in his Diſpoſition, and that he could mingle Kindneſs with his Severity towards ſuch as appeared to be truly conſcientious, he gives the following Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
<q>An honeſt and able Miniſter privately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to him, that it went againſt his Conſcience to conform, being then ready to be deprived: <hi>Which Way,</hi> ſaith the Archbiſhop, <hi>will you live, if put out of your Benefice?</hi> The other anſwered, <hi>he had no Way but to go a begging, and put himſelf on Divine Providence. That,</hi> ſaith the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <hi>you ſhall not need to do, but come to me, and I will take Order for your</hi> Maintenance.</q>

               </p>
               <p>WHAT I conceive to be the true Character of Laud, I will give in the Words of a maſterly and candid Writer, in Anſwer to the <hi>Confeſſional.</hi>
                  <q>Here, Sir, give me Leave to pay a Debt due to Truth, and to the Memory of Archbiſhop Laud, whom <hi>You</hi> treat in a Manner very unbecoming his Character and your own. He was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much too vehement in his natural Temper; and the general Diſpoſition of the Times on both Sides increaſed his Heat. He was alſo too fond of Externals in Religion. But ſome Regard ought to be paid to his Learning, his Liberality, his excellent Book againſt Popery, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Pains which he ſo kindly took to recover Chillingworth back from it. His very candid
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011203_0153_0F95324727331C48"/>
Treatment likewiſe of the famous John Hales, and the Eſteem of that great Man for him, who mourned for his Death in a moſt remarkable Manner, and wiſhed he had died in his ſtead, prove him to have had, together with his very blameable Rigors, no ſmall Merit of the good-natured Kind; to which, Perſons in after Times, who could not know him ſo well, have by no Means done ſufficient Juſtice</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Let. I. p. 46.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor goes on: <hi>Did he never hear of any barbarous Acts paſſed in the Reign of King Charles</hi> II. <hi>ſubjecting Multitudes of Clergymen and others to Hardſhips and Sufferings, not to be thought of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horror?</hi> This Queſtion I muſt alſo anſwer in the affirmative. I have <hi>heard</hi> of all thoſe Acts which are here called barbarous; and I have <hi>ſeen</hi> the Reaſons aſſigned for framing and paſſing them— which Reaſons, if not altogether ſufficient to juſtify, will go very far towards excuſing, them.</p>
               <p>WE are told in a Note, that <hi>by one of thoſe Acts</hi> (meaning the Act of Uniformity) <hi>no leſs than</hi> Two THOUSAND <hi>Miniſters, many of them Men of ſhining Accompliſhments, and</hi> ALL <hi>of them well ſpoken of for their Piety, were turned out of their Livings in one black Day, whereby both they and their Families, became liable to ſtarve for Want of the Neceſſaries of Life.</hi> The Character of the ejected Miniſters as given by Walker, who made the moſt indefatigable Examination into the perſonal Hiſtory of thoſe Times, is very different from what the Doctor here publiſhes, after Calamy and others. His Account is too long to be inſerted; but the Subſtance of it, as extracted by Grey, and given in his Anſwer to

<q>But to conſider the Number and Characters of the Perſons a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we learn from an Hiſtorian of good Credit, that thoſe who gave up their Livings to the <hi>right Owners,</hi> which had been <hi>uſurped</hi> from them, and which in Right and Juſtice were to be reſtored, and the Curates who were <hi>prevented</hi> having any Preferments, without Conformity, made up above half of the Number; and amongſt them there were <hi>not a few Mechanicks,</hi> and Fellows bred to the meaneſt Occupations; many more who had ſeen neither of the Univerſities; ſeveral <hi>Troopers</hi> and others who had ſerved in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Armies; beſides, ſome had run in with, and vented many of the diſtinguiſhed Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms, Errors, Hereſies, and other monſtrous Opinions, not to ſay Blaſphemies of the Times; many had no Orders at all, nor were there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt theſe, ſuch as had been ſo far from pretending to any, that they utterly exclaimed againſt them; ſome had a Thouſand Times <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Lives</hi> to the Law, by having their Tongues and Hands ſtained in Treaſon and Blood, as well of their Prince himſelf, as Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects. Nay, the ſame Author informs us, that to the beſt of his Remembrance, he had not met with an Inſtance of more than one ſingle Perſon, who had any other Title antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the urgent Neceſſity of the Act of 1660, to the Places from which they were removed, than what Sequeſtration, Plunder, Uſurpation and Rebellion had given them. So that the Caſe is not ſo lamentable, as this Gentleman and his Brother Calamy would have it; and when they pretend that the Sufferings of theſe Men will ſcarce admit of a Parallel in any Age or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> who lived in thoſe Times, gives a ſimilar Repreſentation.
<q>Let Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſays he, ſum up into one Catalogue, all the Nonconformiſts throughout the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ever ſince the Beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have been caſt aſide or driven away at any Time, becauſe they durſt not uſe the old Ceremonies or the new, or rather becauſe they found it advantageous to them to diſuſe them. I dare abate him all the reſt of the Kingdom, and only exhibit the Martyrologies of <hi>London</hi> and the two Univerſities, or a Liſt of thoſe who in theſe late inteſtine Wars, have been haled away to Priſons, or chaſed away into Baniſhment by his own Party, in theſe three Places alone, or left to the mercileſs World to beg their Bread, for no other Crime than Loyalty, and becauſe they ſtood affected to the ancient Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and they ſhall double them for Number, and for Learning, Piety, Induſtry and the Love of Peace, exceed them incomparably. So as his Party which he glorieth ſo much in, will ſcarely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be named the ſame Day. And if he compare their Perſecutions; the Sufferings of his ſuppoſed Confeſſors will appear to be but Flea-Bitings in Compariſon of theirs. But after all this, the greateſt Diſparity remaineth yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011203_0156_0F953248ADC2AD08"/>
that is, in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The one ſuffered for <hi>Faith,</hi> and the other for <hi>Faction</hi>

Theſe Things, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, have but little Connection with the Subject. They ought alſo, if poſſible, for the Honour of the national Character, and the proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be buried in eternal Oblivion. But I have been forced to mention them; and thoſe who have obliged me to it ought not to blame me; while others who ſee the Provocation, I truſt, will at leaſt think me excuſeable.</p>
               <p>AS to the <hi>Teſt-Act,</hi> the Doctor need not be told the only Deſign of it, was to prevent the Enemies of the Church from geting Power to deſtroy Her. This Security it was thought neceſſary to provide; and <hi>Rapin,</hi> who was a Preſbyterian himſelf, has in Effect juſtified the general Policy of that Act. For he makes no Scruple to declare, in his <hi>Diſſertation on the Whigs and Tories,</hi> not that there is a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, for he knew it to be more than probable— but, that
<q>
                     <hi>'tis certain,</hi> if the Preſbyterians can ever act without Controul, they will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied till the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> be <hi>intirely demoliſhed.</hi>
                  </q>
That ſuch Perſons therefore ſhould be ſo far controuled, as they are by this Act, will not, I believe, be pronounced to be unjuſt or improper by any, but thoſe who find themſelves diſappointed by its Operation. But I will not inlarge upon this Subject, ſince writing in Favour of the Teſt-Act, or ſome other <hi>equivalent</hi> Security, is as needleſs, as writing againſt it will be uſeleſs, after what has been ſaid in <hi>Vindication</hi> of it by the late Biſhops <hi>Sherlock</hi> and <hi>Ellys.</hi>

               <p>THE Doctor concludes this Affair of <hi>Precedents</hi> in a Strain truly conſiſtent with his whole Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. This double Decimation of our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates, or the Loſs of ſo great a Proportion of their Lives, is no more in his Eſtimation, than one of the <hi>few comparatively ſmall Inconveniencies,</hi> to which the <hi>American</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſubject, p. 94. And as to the Expence of croſſing the <hi>Atlantic</hi> for Ordination, <hi>what is a Hundred Pounds Sterling,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for Fifty-two Clergymen each, in the Courſe of Sixty Years, in Compariſon with the Hundred Thouſand Pounds Sterling, many Times told, that Diſſenters have paid, towards the Support of the epiſcopal Clergy, beſides maintaining their own?</hi>

p. 95. That what <hi>the Diſſenters have paid,</hi> in the Way of TITHES, <hi>towards the Support of the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Clergy,</hi> ought not to be included in this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, has been proved in the <hi>Tenth Section</hi> of the Appeal, which the Doctor, for a certain Reaſon, has thought fit not to controvert. After this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, he will find it difficult to make all his <hi>Items</hi> amount to the Sum of <hi>a Hundred Thouſand Pounds Sterling, many Times told,</hi> within <hi>the Courſe of Sixty Years,</hi> unleſs he takes into his Computation the Poſts of <hi>Profit in the Kingdom</hi> of SOUTH-BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN, from which Diſſenters may have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. As he ſeems to look upon theſe as their <hi>natural Rights,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that, in this View of the Matter, there is no Impropriety in conſidering all that might have been gained by ſuch Poſts, under the Notion of Loſs, and paſſing it to the <hi>Credit</hi> of the Diſſenters Account. But this will not be admitted as <hi>fair,</hi> by the World in general, which has a different Idea of <hi>natural Rights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NATURAL Rights, when the Expreſſion is uſed properly, can ſignify nothing leſs than ſuch Rights as Men are born to—ſuch as they are intitled to upon the common Footing of Humanity, without any Diſtinction of Chriſtian or Pagan, Proteſtant or Papiſt. Whatever therefore is the natural Right of one Man, is the natural Right of another; and if Diſſenters may juſtly complain of being deprived of a natural Right, in the Caſe before us, ſo may Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Jews and Mahometans; their natural Rights being the very ſame with thoſe of the Diſſenters, and, I may add, of the Members of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church. This is ſo evident, that all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have either aſſerted or admitted it, a few
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011203_0159_0F95324AEEDC6620"/>
Inſtances only excepted. The <hi>American Whig</hi> is obliged to confeſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. XVI.</note>, that <hi>if by natural Right be meant any Right in Contradiſtinction to municipal or political Rights,</hi> i. e. to ſuch as are not natural Rights, <hi>it may with equal Propriety be predicated of Epiſcopalians, and of all Men. For no Man has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right to a political Privilege.</hi> What the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters municipal or political Rights are in <hi>England,</hi> and how far they intitle them to thoſe Preferments, from which they are excluded by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not my Buſineſs to inquire.</p>
               <p>I AM next led to review a Paſſage in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> which uncommon Pains has been taken to pervert, with a Deſign of making me appear to have been an Impeacher of the LOYALTY of the Diſſenters in <hi>America.</hi> The obnoxious Paſſage is this:
<q>We <hi>i. e.</hi> the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are conſcious of no Crimes, with Regard to the State. On the other Hand, we claim a Right to be conſidered as equal with the Foremoſt</q>
(the <hi>American Whig,</hi> to anſwer a Purpoſe of his own, quotes it, the MOST Foremoſt)
<q>in every due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Fidelity and Loyalty. We eſteem our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound, not only by preſent Intereſt and Inclination, but by the more ſacred Ties of our religious Principles and Chriſtian Duty, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to the utmoſt, the national civil Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. Accordingly no Trumpet of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ever heard to ſound from our Pulpits— no Seeds of Diſaffection have been ſuffered more privately to be ſown in our Houſes. As our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teaches us, in the firſt Place, and above all Things, to <hi>fear God</hi>; ſo, while we can preſerve it, it will be a full Security to the Government
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:011203_0160_0F95324BAE106390"/>
for our <hi>honouring the King,</hi> and <hi>not meddling with them that are given to Change,</hi>
                  </q>
p. 41. In this Paſſage it is evident, that the Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Colonies, is ſtrongly aſſerted; which Loyalty our Enemies have never pretended to diſpute. The <hi>American Whig</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. II.</note> is ſo juſt as to take Notice of the Author of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>'s "profeſſed Loyalty," and of
<q>that Zeal for the Conſtitution and Government at Home, to which he and his Brethren avow a warm At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment.</q>
Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> allows the Loyalty of Epiſcopalians to be <hi>equal</hi> with that of <hi>other Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Men in this Country.</hi> Now no more than this is directly aſſerted in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> But the former inſiſts<note n="†" place="bottom">In Numb. IX.</note> that the Author, in the above Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<q>
                     <hi>plainly</hi> intended to inſinuate, that ſome other Denominations among us are <hi>conſcious of Crimes with Reſpect to the State.</hi>
                  </q>
The Doctor is not <hi>poſitive</hi> as to this Matter, but cautiouſly ſays, <hi>ſome are</hi> DISPOSED <hi>to think he</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Appeal) would not have expreſſed himſelf in this Manner, unleſs he had intended an Inſinuation, that ſomething of this Nature had been done by others.</hi> p. 96. The Reader can examine the Paſſage for himſelf, and judge, whether the Interpretation of it, concerning which the <hi>American Whig</hi> is poſitive, and the Doctor doubtful, is not forced and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. For ſurely, to ſay that our Loyalty is equal with that of others, implies not that it is ſuperior, or that the Loyalty of others is defective, unleſs Words are perverted from their natural Meaning: It rather implies, on the contrary, that the Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others is not inferior to ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:011203_0161_0F95324C71569998"/>THIS ſeems to be admitted by the periodical Writer laſt mentioned. But then he interrogates, <hi>why</hi> I was not <hi>ſatisfied with ſimply avering that</hi> my <hi>Brethren were as loyal Subjects as others?</hi> I doubt not but the candid and impartial have been able to ſee the following Reaſon for it, and that it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Accounts for the Mode of Expreſſion. The Paragraph is introduced with this Obſervation, that notwithſtanding the ſuffering Condition of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Church, we, who are Members of it,
<q>are not apprehenſive that it can be owing to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of our Superiors.</q>
Why not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of their Diſpleaſure? Becauſe we are conſcious of no Crimes that have deſerved it.
<q>No Trumpet of Sedition was ever heard to ſound from our Pulpits—no Seeds of Diſaffection have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more privately to be ſown in our Houſes.</q>
Theſe Crimes, or the Suſpicions of them, are the common Cauſes of the Diſpleaſure of Government, againſt particular Claſſes or Denominations of Men, in all Countries. But we are intirely innocent, and ſuch Crimes have never been ſo much as imputed to us. On the other Hand, our Intereſt and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conſpire with our religious Principles, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Loyalty. We conſider it as a Matter of ſtrict Duty and of religious Obligation to
<q>honor the King,</q>
and
<q>not to meddle with them that are given to Change,</q>
as really and eſſentially as to "fear God." This appears to me to be the natural Conſtruction of the Paragraph; and it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds exactly with my View in writing it, which was only to maintain, by a ſhort Induction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that we are free from thoſe Crimes and Imputations, which are commonly aſſigned as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Frowns of Government; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:011203_0162_0F95324D2F751410"/>
that we have no Cauſe to ſuſpect the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at Home is diſpleaſed with us.</p>
               <p>IN tranſcribing for the Preſs, I ſaw what Uſe might be made of the Paſſage by ill-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore, not thinking it neceſſary to alter the Structure of the Paragraph, added this <hi>Note,</hi> to ſecure it againſt Miſinterpretation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.
<q>This Declaration is not intended to imply any Accuſation of others; who are able, it is hoped, to make their own Defence, whenever the Occaſion ſhall require it. His Majeſty's <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Subjects, of all Denominations, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the old Colonies, have always profeſſed Sentiments of Loyalty; and the Author believes they have generally been <hi>ſincere</hi> in thoſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q>
I then proceeded to account for ſome late undutiful Appearances, in a Manner conſiſtent with the Loyalty profeſſed. Now, does this look like an Impeachment of <hi>American</hi> Loyalty? Is it not in Reality, a Defence of it? How unfair and unrighteous then is it, to endeavour to raiſe a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Clamour againſt me, on the ſole Evidence of this very Paſſage; a Paſſage, which proves that I have acted the Part of a true Friend, where I am abuſed for having acted as an Enemy! Upon the whole: If the Words in the Text naturally carried an Inſinuation againſt the Loyalty of ſome <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> which Inſinuation was not intended; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation in the Note intirely removes it, and places the Matter in the moſt favourable Light. Nothing worſe is ſaid of Americans, including the various religious Denominations, than that they have always profeſſed Sentiments of Loyalty<note n="*" place="bottom">Had <hi>Numb.</hi> V. of the <hi>American Whig</hi> been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould perhaps have excepted the Author, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, of that Performance, as Perſons whoſe Loyalty is, at leaſt, very queſtionable.</note>, and that the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011203_0163_0F95324DED5DDC70"/>
Author believed them to have been generally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in thoſe Profeſſions.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor will not allow, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Colonies is
<q>diſtinguiſhed and ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized by a Want of thoſe religious Privileges which are granted to all other Denominations.</q>
His Objection is this: <hi>The Truth is,</hi> Epiſcopalians <hi>are allowed the ſame Liberty with all other Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and do, with as much Freedom from Moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, worſhip God in the preciſe Way they themſelves are pleaſed to chuſe,</hi> p. 97. But can he be ſerious when he ſays this? Or does he mean to inſult us? Is it <hi>the Truth,</hi> that we <hi>have the ſame Liberty with all other Perſuſions</hi>? Do they not all enjoy their own religious Syſtems compleatly, and in every Part? But can this be predicated of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> We complain that we are deſtitute of the Power of Ordination, and are not allowed to enjoy ſeveral of the Inſtitutions of our Church, which we hold in great Eſteem and Veneration: The Doctor anſwers that we worſhip God in our own Way without Moleſtation. But does this Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer come up to the Complaint? Did we ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the Privilege of worſhiping God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was refuſed us? Does our Enjoyment of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege prove, that we are not under thoſe peculiar Diſadvantages which the Complaint ſpecifies? And if we are under Diſadvantages which are peculiar to ourſelves, and from which all other Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are free, having all of them the full Uſe of their reſpective Forms of eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011203_0164_0F95324EAEF08678"/>
and Government, have we not Reaſon to complain that we ONLY are not permitted the Uſe of ours? Why ſhould there be this glaring Diſtinction? Where our Claims are, at leaſt, equal with thoſe of our Neighbours, why ſhould a Difference be made in their Favour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALL the Difference,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>is, our Principles do not hamper us with thoſe objected Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, their's expoſe them to.</hi> With equal Candour and Propriety it might have been ſaid, by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the eſtabliſhed Church, <hi>in the Days of thoſe hard-hearted Archbiſhops Parker, Bancroft, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift and Laud:</hi> Why do theſe Puritants complain? Are they not treated upon the ſame Footing with ourſelves? <hi>We know of nothing that has been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> us or <hi>others, but what is equally granted to them: All the Difference is, our Principles do not hamper us with thoſe objected Difficulties, their's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to.</hi> And this the greateſt Perſecutors that ever exiſted may have as pertinently ſaid, of thoſe whom they harraſſed and put to the Torture— they are only <hi>hampered</hi> by their own Principles, and they may thank themſelves.</p>
               <p>I MEET with nothing farther that is worthy of Notice, untill we come to the concluding Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of this <hi>Section,</hi> in p. 100, where I am charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with having been ungrateful and undutiful. My <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> it ſeems, conſiſts in uttering Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<q>in Behalf of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi>
                  </q>
after <hi>Thirty Thouſand Pounds Sterling,</hi> have been expended in <hi>England to promote its Growth.</hi> But by whom has this Sum been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended? Not by the Nation, but by a particular Society. I know not that the Nation has ever been at any conſiderable Expence, to promote
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011203_0165_0F9532508FF0EAD8"/>
the Growth of the Church in the Colonies; and as this was not expected, ſo their not doing it has never been mentioned as Matter of Complaint. But what we complain of is, that the national Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Colonies has not been made the Object of greater national Attention, in ſome other Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and particularly, that ſuch Relief has not been given it, as it was known greatly to ſuffer for the Want of and as might have eaſily been granted, without any public Expence. So much, we think, we had Reaſon to expect; and I can ſee nothing unbecoming or improper in the Complaint. If I had complained of <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> the Doctor then might juſtly have branded me with Ingratitude. Our great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors are the worthy Members of that Society; it is they who have expended the large Sums for the Support and Promotion of the Church here, which the Doctor has ſeen fit to transfer from their, to the national Account. But we ſhall always remember that it is to them, that our Gratitude is immediately due; and if the leaſt Symptom of Ingratitude to that venerable Body can be diſcovered in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> I hereby promiſe, that I will never attempt any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Defence</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>AS to the other Charge of <hi>Undutifulneſs,</hi> it is made out in this Manner. <hi>It lies with the King,</hi> whether we ſhall have Biſhops or not; therefore to complain of the Want of Biſhops, is to reflect upon the King; and to reflect upon the King is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful. The Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Want of Biſhops: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Appeal</hi> has been undutiful to the King. <hi>I could wiſh,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>he had expreſſed more dutiful Reverence towards his Sovereign, than
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011203_0166_0F953250F0850158"/>
to charge him as he does</hi> VIRTUALLY <hi>and in Reality of Conſtruction, with treating the Church here with unparalleled Hardſhip,</hi> &amp;c. I aſſure the Doctor, it gives me the utmoſt Pleaſure to find him ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for maintaining a <hi>dutiful Reverence towards</hi> our moſt gracious <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and ſo ready to bear Teſtimony againſt every Thing that appears, <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and in Reality of Conſtruction,</hi> to reflect upon his ſacred Perſon. Let me tell him however, that he is probably ſomewhat miſtaken, with Regard to the Matter before us. It has been all along ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and believed, that the Want of an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate has not been owing to any Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Kings to grant it, but to the Neglect of others, whoſe Duty it was to prepare the Way for ſuch an Appointment. The Complaint can be a Reflection on thoſe only, who have neglected their Duty; but as our Kings appear not to have been negligent of theirs, it is no Reflection upon them: —Much leſs, upon our preſent moſt excellent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who has condeſcended to expreſs himſelf on the Subject, in the moſt obliging Terms, and in whoſe favourable Diſpoſition we have an intire Confidence.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the King <hi>can,</hi> as the Doctor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, by Virtue of that Supremacy which the Conſtitution allows him, grant an <hi>American</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate at any Time; yet a wiſe King will not chooſe, and his real Friends will not deſire him, to exert this Prerogative, until the Way is duly prepared, and there is a rational Proſpect of its anſwering the Purpoſe. In Order to this, it has been thought requiſite, even by our CONVENTION, as zealous as it has been, ſtill is, and I truſt will be, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this Plan, that the Nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Epiſcopate ſhould be fully underſtood, and
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011203_0167_0F953251AE472718"/>
                  <hi>generally</hi> approved of, by the various Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of People in <hi>America.</hi> And it is one good Effect of the preſent Controverſy, for which I now return Thanks to my Opponents, that our Plan has been more attentively conſidered, and more fully underſtood: Another is, that it has produced ſuch Teſtimonies of Approbation as were wanted. It was indeed always believed the Diſſenters would not object to our having ſuch Biſhops as are propoſed for <hi>America</hi>; but we had no public Declarations that thoſe of the Preſbyterian or Congregational Perſuaſion approved of our Plan, until Dr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and the <hi>American Whig,</hi> who have appeared in their Behalf on the Occaſion, were pleaſed to make them. Theſe Writers, it is true, ſtill object, in their Names, againſt an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate, ſuppoſing it may be different from what has been pretended and explained to the Public. But as to the Epiſcopate really intended, concerning which alone their Opinion was deſired, they have clearly expreſſed themſelves, and ſaid as much in Favour of it as could be reaſonably expected. So that now, whatever may be the Fate of particular Parts or Paſſages of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the great and immediate Deſign of it has ſucceeded, and the Author has no Reaſon to repent of his having undertaken it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">SECT. V.</note>THE Buſineſs of the <hi>fifth</hi> Section of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> is to aſſign Reaſons why the Church in <hi>America</hi> has been ſo long neglected. The Doctor confeſſes he has <hi>no Concern with the immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it:</hi> However, there are ſome <hi>Matters of Intelligence,</hi> it ſeems, intermixed with the Reaſons aſſigned, which he thinks worthy of his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Paſſage that diſturbs him is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
<q>The Colonies were generally ſettled by private Adventurers; and ſome of them by thoſe who had an Averſion to epiſcopal Government. The Propriety of not ſending a Biſhop to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of the latter Sort, will be diſputed by none</q>
(<hi>Appeal</hi> p. 47.) He does not attempt to ſhew that this Obſervation is unjuſt, or improper, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; but yet he ſpeaks of it as no more than <hi>a Rattle to pleaſe Children with,</hi> and then aſks a Number of Queſtions relating to <hi>New-England,</hi> which are not at all to the Purpoſe, but upon the Suppoſition that there are, at this Day, no Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians in thoſe Colonies. For what I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced was this, that the Propriety of not ſending Biſhops to thoſe who had an Averſion to epiſcopal Government, is indiſputable. Let us try notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whether any Thing can be made of his Queſtions and Remarks, however foreign or out of Place. <hi>Queſt. If a Biſhop is ſent, will he have
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:011203_0169_0F9532532D6D1AC8"/>
nothing to do in theſe</hi> the <hi>New-England Colonies? Anſ.</hi> Nothing at all, but with ſuch Perſons as ſhall be deſirous of his Adminiſtrations. <hi>Queſt. Will they not be Part of his Dioceſs? Anſ.</hi> Not in ſuch a Senſe, as to bring the Diſſenters under his Juriſdiction. <hi>Queſt. Will not the epiſcopal Churches in them, at leaſt their Clergy, be under his Inſpection and Government? Anſ.</hi> They moſt certainly will; but this can do no Harm to him, or any others of the <hi>Congregational or Preſbyterian Perſuaſion. He will then,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>be as compleatly ſettled at the Head of the epiſcopal Clergy, within theſe Bounds, as in the other Colonies, and will have the ſame Right of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending and governing them.</hi> Very true; but why ſhould not the epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be ſuperintended and governed, as well as thoſe of the other Colonies? They do not deſire to be exempted themſelves, and it never has been propoſed by others. But attend then to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: <hi>If his</hi> (the Biſhop's) <hi>Place of Reſidence ſhould not be here,</hi> ſays he, <hi>his Power will: And it will be the ſame in all its Exerciſes, as in any other of the Provinces.</hi> But if the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>his Power</hi> are to be confined to the epiſcopal Clergy, other People, as has been obſerved, need not be anxious, whether even <hi>the Place of his Reſidence</hi> ſhould be in <hi>New-England,</hi> or not. It is really ſurprizing to find a Man of Senſe and Reputation caviling at this Rate—reſolved to be ſatisfied with nothing—at one Time blaming us, becauſe, under the propoſed Epiſcopate, no peculiar Power is to be exerciſed over the Laity—at another, finding Fault that it is to be exerciſed over the epiſcopal Clergy—and then peeviſhly declaring that a Biſhop, as odious and deteſtable as he is, may as well reſide in <hi>New-England</hi> altogether, as ſuperintend and govern the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:011203_0170_0F953253EF0A8E88"/>
Clergy belonging to the Church. Such invincible Prejudice is hardly to be met with in the preſent Age. It reminds me of an Inſtance in ancient Hiſtory:

                     <hi>John</hi> came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſay, he hath a Devil. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they ſay, behold a Man gluttonous and a Wine-Bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners</q>

               <p>THE next Piece of <hi>Intelligence</hi> the Doctor takes in Hand, relates to the Endeavours of <hi>the Society</hi> to obtain an Epiſcopate for the Church in <hi>America.</hi> But I find not that he is able to ſay much againſt it, or to infer much from it. I ſat down to write this <hi>Defence,</hi> with a determined Reſolution to treat Doctor <hi>Chauncy</hi> with all poſſible Reſpect. Hitherto I have adhered to it with great Firmneſs and Punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, and have taken Notice of many Things, which I ſhould have paſſed over as unworthy of Obſervation, in many other Writers. But as I think it high Time to ſhew ſome Reſpect alſo to the Reader, the good Doctor will excuſe me, if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he ſhould not find me ſo minutely attentive to him, as I have been. Every Thing however in the ſucceeding Parts of his Performance, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to have either of the two Qualities, Weight or Plauſibility, ſhall be duly noticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE laſt Article of Intelligence,</hi> ſays he, <hi>relates to the external Circumſtances of the Biſhop that is deſired to be ſent to</hi> America. <hi>A Seat has been purchaſed for his Reſidence, at</hi> Six Hundred Pounds, <hi>Sterling, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in a convenient Manſion-Houſe and Lands, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate at</hi> Burlington, <hi>in the</hi> Jerſies; and large Legacies have been left for the Support of an <hi>American</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:011203_0171_0F953254AF81C610"/>
Epiſcopate, p. 104. This is the Subſtance of the Intelligence. Let us now attend to the Uſe that is made of it. <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>unqueſtionable, if a Biſhop is ſent to</hi> America, <hi>that ſuch Proviſion muſt be made for his Support, as will enable him to appear in all the Grandeur of a Biſhop in</hi> England. <hi>The Place of his Reſidence</hi> (does he mean the City of <hi>Burlington?) and Manner of living, muſt exceed a common Clergyman's in Proportion to his more exalted Station in the Church,</hi> p. 105. If £. 600 Sterling laid out in the Purchaſe of a <hi>Manſion-Houſe and Lands,</hi> for an <hi>American</hi> Biſhop, excites in the Doctor the Idea of Grandeur and Magnificence, it will probably have a contrary Effect in the Minds of other Perſons. There are ſeveral Inſtances in <hi>America</hi> of <hi>Manſion-Houſes and Lands,</hi> or, in other Words, of Parſonage Houſes and Glebes, which could not be purchaſed for twice the Sum; and I believe that there are but few <hi>epiſcopal Palaces</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> even excluſive of their <hi>Regalia</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>American Whig,</hi> Numb. I.</note>, the Coſt of which has not exceeded it. So that it does not follow from the above <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> that with Reſpect to the Article of his <hi>Manſion-Houſe,</hi> the <hi>American</hi> Biſhop is likely <hi>to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all the Grandeur of a Biſhop in England,</hi> or vaſtly to exceed in Appearance ſome <hi>common Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen.</hi> Perhaps the intended Grandeur of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Biſhops is infered, from the large Sums that have been given for their Support. But until it be known how many Biſhops are to be thereby ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and how much each is to receive, the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not concluſive.</p>
               <p>AFTER all, why ſhould not a Biſhop be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>in Proportion to his more exalted Station in the Church?</hi> Is it not agreeable to the common
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:011203_0172_0F9532556E416A58"/>
Senſe of Mankind, and to the Fitneſs of Things, that Men in eminent Stations ſhould be enabled to make a greater external Appearance, than others of an inferior Degree? Ought not every Office to be reſpected, according to its Dignity and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? And is not the general Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mankind ſuch, that Reſpect will be paid to an Office, in ſome Degree of Proportion to its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Figure and Appendages? And is not this in Reality the Caſe, with Reſpect to eccleſiaſtical Offices, as well as to any other? It ought farther to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the neceſſary Expences of a Biſhop greatly exceed thoſe of a common Clergyman. A Biſhop ought, in a peculiar Manner, to be
<q>given to Hoſpitality.</q>
He ought eminently to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf by Works of Charity. Theſe Things will certainly be expected from him; and how can ſuch Expectations be anſwered, unleſs a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Proviſion be made for him, than is requiſite for common Clergymen?</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>ſuch Biſhops were unknown in the Chriſtian World, in its firſt Days of Purity.</hi> This is not diſputed, with Regard to their external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and the ſame may be ſaid of the Clergy in general. In thoſe Days there was perhaps not an Inſtance, of a Clergyman ſo comfortably ſituated and ſo well accommodated, as I ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> to be in <hi>Boſton.</hi> Now what are we to infer from this? That the Doctor's Pariſhioners have done wrong, in providing for him ſuch <hi>un-primitive</hi> Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations? Or, that he does wrong in accepting, and making Uſe of them? Can it be thought the Duty of Biſhops and Clergymen, at this Day, to court "Stripes and Impriſonments," becauſe they were inflicted on the Apoſtles and firſt Miniſters of the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:011203_0173_0F9532562E4039A8"/>
Chriſtian Religion? Or is it the Duty only of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and not of the common Clergy and private Chriſtians, to be in theſe <hi>primitive</hi> Circumſtances? One would be apt to infer this, from ſome Men's Reaſonings; ſo glaring is their Partiality againſt the epiſcopal Order. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, as was obſerved to the ſame Purpoſe by Archbiſhop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> in Excuſe for ſome of the Arts he had uſed to undermine and deſtroy Chriſtianity,
<q>ſaid in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, he did that which was moſt meet and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Chriſtians, viz. That they being made poor, might ſooner come to the Kingdom of Heaven: Seeing the Goſpel promiſeth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to thoſe that be poor, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, that none can be his Diſcples, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they forſake all, and follow him<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Strype</hi>'s Life of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 215.</note>.</q>
I do not accuſe the Doctor, of having the ſame inveterate Enmity againſt our Biſhops, that <hi>Julian</hi> had againſt Chriſtians in general; but in ſome Appearances there is a ſtriking Reſemblance. And in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Example, it may not be amiſs in him to examine, whether what he has offered in the like Strain, be not the Dictate of Prejudice or ſome evil Paſſion, rather than of real and impartial Judgment.</p>
               <p>I KNOW very well that the Goſpel requires of Biſhops, and it as indiſpenſably requires of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not to hold Houſes, or Lands, or any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments when they come into Competition with a good Conſcience: And every Biſhop who does not chooſe to part with them, rather than to deny, or forſake, or diſobey Chriſt, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the venerable Character. But the Goſpel requires not of its Diſciples, not even of Biſhops, to renounce the temperate Enjoyment of theſe
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011203_0174_0F953256ED1DF128"/>
Things, excepting when particular Reaſons make it neceſſary. It allows us to poſſeſs
<q>this World's Goods,</q>
when they can be obtained honeſtly; it teaches us to conſider them as the Gifts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to be thankful for them on that Account, cautioning us only ſo to <hi>uſe,</hi> as not to <hi>abuſe,</hi> them. And what it makes a Rule for any, it injoins upon all Men, without any Diſtinction of Perſons or Characters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOR do we read of ſuch Biſhops,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>until Chriſtians had groſsly departed from that Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of living, which was their primitive Glory.</hi> In a State of Perſecution, nothing more than what is here called <hi>Simplicity of living,</hi> can be expected; and where it is ſubmitted to for the Sake of a good Conſcience, as it was by the primitive Chriſtians, it is undoubtedly Men's <hi>Glory.</hi> That Chriſtians, in general, in this Age, have too far departed from a decent Simplicity of Manners, and are too apt to indulge themſelves in exceſſive Luxury, is not to be denied, and ought to be lamented. All Orders of Men ſeem to be infected with this epidemical Evil, and it is to be feared, even that the Biſhops and Clergy have not altogether eſcaped the Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they, in particular, ought to make it their Study to recover themſelves, and all whom they can perſuade. But that Nations now ought ſtrictly to regulate their Manners and Mode of living, by the Cuſtoms of any former Age, I do not believe; and if Individuals ſhould attempt it, it would anſwer no good End, and they would appear ridiculous. The primitive Chriſtians, for Inſtance, had no Glaſs-Windows in their Houſes; and we are under as ſtrong Obligations to adopt their <hi>Simplicity of Living</hi> in this Reſpect, as in many
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011203_0175_0F953258E3E00D30"/>
others. The Biſhops in the primitive Church were very differently ſituated, from what Biſhops now are in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that, in Caſe the civil Powers had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to beſtow upon them the like Favours, with thoſe which are enjoyed by <hi>our</hi> Biſhops, that they would have been unwilling to accept them. On the other Hand, it does appear, from repeated Trials, that many of our Biſhops have been as ready to give up, and ſacrifice, all their worldly Advantages, when their Duty required it, as any Biſhops in the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AT ſo great a Diſtance from apoſtolic Times,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>as the third Century, tho' Corruption had then crept into the Church,</hi> Paul <hi>of</hi> Samoſata, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Antioch, <hi>was depoſed, among other Things for this,</hi>
                  <q>that having been poor before he was a Biſhop, he had after that grown very rich, born ſecular Dignities, paſſed the Streets with a Train of Attendants, and erected to himſelf a magnificent Seat in the Church.</q>
—For which <hi>Euſebius</hi> is quoted, p. 105. The Epiſtle of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> partly given by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the Place refered to, does not ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> was depoſed, among other Things, for having been <hi>very rich</hi>; but it charges him with having amaſſed incredible Wealth <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> by Oppreſſion and Sacrilege. For want of Greek Types, I muſt produce to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Latin Tranſlation by <hi>Valeſius,</hi>
                  <q>

et Pietatem Quaeſtum eſſe exiſtimans.</hi>
                  </q>
The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint goes on ſpecifying, not barely that he had <hi>born ſecular Dignities,</hi> but that he had born them with unbounded Pride and Inſolence:
<q>Neque quod Faſtu et Arrogantia ſupra Modum elatus ſaeculares gerit Dignitates</q>
—not ſimply that he had <hi>paſſed the Streets with a Train of Attendants,</hi> but that in thus paſſing the Streets, he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unſufferable Arrogance and Diſdain, to the Diſgrace of the Chriſtian Religion:—
<q>Stipatuſque maxima Hominum Multitudine, partim praeeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, partim ſubſequentium; adeo ut illius Faſtu et Arrogantia incredibilis Invidia odiumque multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum adverſus Fidem noſtram conflatum ſit.</q>
In ſhort, he is here repreſented by the Council, to have been the greateſt Monſter for Wickedneſs, that ever diſgraced the Chriſtian Church; and I am very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a Biſhop of his Character in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at this Day, would not be puniſhed with leſs Severity, than this Biſhop was in the <hi>Third</hi> Century. Nor do I believe that the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Thing in his Character or Conduct, but what would be as loudly condemned in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is evident therefore, upon the whole, that this Inſtance will not anſwer the Purpoſe for which it is quoted.</p>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds: <hi>A good while after this, though the Church had grown ſtill more corrupt, the Fourth Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>decreed,</hi>
                  <q>That the Biſhop ſhall have a little Dwelling-Houſe near the Church; that he ſhall have coarſe houſe-hold Stuff and Diet, and ſeek his Reputation only by ſound Doctrine, and a good Life; that he ſhall not ſpend his Time in caring for his Family, but be employed wholly in reading, praying and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011203_0177_0F953259EE56A008"/>
preaching the Word of God,</q>
p. 106. Some Part of what is here decreed, is very commendable. A Biſhop ought undoubtedly to apply himſelf <hi>chiefly</hi> to the proper Duties of his Function. He ought to avoid every Appearance of a vain Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, and of an undue Attachment to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the Honours, and Intereſts of the World. But that he ſhould literally be confined to mean Diet, coarſe Furniture, and a ſmall Houſe, if Piety or Generoſity have provided for him better, no unbiaſſed Perſon can think neceſſary. And ſo again, if he is to have no Regard at all to the Welfare and Intereſts of his Family, he muſt act an unnatural Part, and become, according to the Apoſtle's Eſtimation, "worſe than an Infidel." Nor is it neceſſary, that he ſhould never concern himſelf in publick Affairs, as, of late, we have ſeen it frequently aſſerted.
<q>Muſt a Perſon who knows well the Intereſt of his Country, and is capable of ſerving it, be ſilent only becauſe he is a Miniſter (<hi>or a Biſhop?</hi>) Is he nothing elſe? Is he not a Subject of his Prince, and a Member of the Common-wealth?—Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was full of the Sentiments of the Rev. Doctors <hi>Increaſe</hi> and <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> his Paſtors and Predeceſſors, on this Head—viz. That Opportunities to do good not only legitimate the Application of our Capacities to do it, but alſo oblige and require us to do it. That upon publick and preſſing Emergencies, Miniſters may apply their ſuperior Talents to ſome Things of ſecular Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The great <hi>Selden</hi> is quoted by them in Vindication of ſuch a Practice.—'Tis a fooliſh Thing (ſays he) to ſay, a Miniſter muſt not meddle with ſecular Matters becauſe his own Profeſſion will take up his whole Man. The

For
<q>in the 4th Council of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, there are three Canons immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another to this Purpoſe, that they (the inferior Clergy) ſhould provide themſelves with Food and Raiment at ſome honeſt Trade or Husbandry, without hindering the Duties of their Office in the Church; and ſuch of them as were able to labour, ſhould be taught ſome Trade and Letters together. And the Laws of the State were ſo far from hindering this, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ſuch of the Clergy to follow an honeſt Calling, by granting them a ſpecial Immunity from the <hi>Chryſargyrum,</hi> or luſtral Tax, which was exacted of all other Tradeſmen.<note n="†" place="bottom">Bingham's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Antiquities,</hi> Book VI.

                  </q>
It is evident from hence, that this Council had run far into an Extreme with Regard to the Clergy in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as well as to Biſhops; ſo that no Example or Inſtruction taken from thence, can be of much Weight in any modern Controverſy. If the Canons of this Council relating to Biſhops ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, why not as well thoſe that relate to the inferior Clergy? If theſe are to be a Rule for the Clergy of this Day, why does not the Doctor become a Mechanick, and practice ſome Trade himſelf?

Or, if his Age exempts him from the Duty of bodily Labor, why does he not exhort thoſe of his Brethren who are in full Vigor and Strength, and eſpecially all young Candidates for the Miniſtry, reſpectively to regulate and qualify themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>African</hi> Standard?</p>
               <p>THE Extracts from <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> with which we are next preſented, if properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, are not inconſiſtent with any Thing for which we contend. Paſſages of this Kind are not to be interpreted rigorouſly, but according to the known Sentiments of the Authors: And it is well known that thoſe great Reformers objected not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops being ſupported, agreeably to their Rank and Dignity in the Church. <hi>Men are too ready,</hi> as the Doctor obſerves, <hi>if they are much raiſed above others in worldly Circumſtances, to grow big in their own Apprehenſions, to be haughty and imperious; treating thoſe below them with Inſolence and Contempt,</hi> p. 108. This general Propoſition is unqueſtionably true, but what Inference are we to make from it? Not, that all Men ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſame Level, but that thoſe Perſons who are thus ſituated ſhould be ſenſible of this Danger, and guard againſt it. Affluence and Power, if they fall into the Hands of ill-diſpoſed Perſons, are dangerous Things—dangerous to the Poſſeſſors, and dangerous to Society; but they are in both Reſpects uſeful, when they meet with a Diſpoſition to employ them for the Benefit of Mankind. As I hope and believe the <hi>Majority</hi> of proteſtant Biſhops and Clergymen, of every Denomination, have ſuch a Diſpoſition; <hi>I am free to declare it my hearty Wiſh,</hi> (and why may not I wiſh, as well as the Doctor?) to ſee in general, eſpecially the worthy
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:011203_0180_0F95325C2E602D58"/>
Part of them, well ſupported, <hi>i. e.</hi> much better ſupported than they commonly are in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>I wiſh this, not only in Regard of the epiſcopal Clergy, but the Clergy of every Denomination on the Continent; yea, the whole Chriſtian World.</hi> And in particular with Reſpect to every <hi>American</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that ſhall be hereafter appointed, although I think it unneceſſary that he ſhould <hi>appear in all the Grandeur of a Biſhop in England.</hi> I am ready to confeſs, that I ſhould not be ſorry to ſee <hi>his Place of Reſidence and Manner of Living, exceed a common Clergyman's, in</hi> ſome due <hi>Proportion to his much more exalted Station in the Church.</hi>

               <head>SECTION VI.</head>
               <p>WHEN the <hi>Appeal to the Public</hi> was drawn up,<note place="margin">SECT. VI.</note> it was apprehended that the Time was peculiarly favourable to an Application for an <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Epiſcopate; the Reaſons for which Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion were aſſigned and explained in SECT. VI, and are as follow:
<q>The Tumults of War have ceaſed, and the public Tranquility is reſtored, without any reaſonable ſuſpicions of a ſpeedy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption—the greateſt Harmony ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Mother-Country and moſt of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies—the Plan of an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate has been previouſly ſettled and adjuſted in ſuch a Manner, that the religious Privileges of none can be violated or endangered—and, which we ſhould ever acknowledge with all Thankfulneſs, we are, at this Time, ſo happy as to have a Prince on the Throne, from whoſe moſt unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Diſpoſition to promote the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Virtue and Religion, from whoſe ſincere Affection for the Church, and from whoſe moſt gracious Declarations on the Subject before us, we cannot poſſibly doubt of the Royal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Concurrence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is the Buſineſs of an <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to ſhew, that theſe Circumſtances of the Public were not <hi>then</hi> real, but imaginary; or that they were not, in Reaſon, to be looked upon as favorable to ſuch an Application, or elſe candidly to confeſs the Force and Propriety of the Repreſentation. Dr.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:011203_0182_0F95325DADD8B990"/>
                  <hi>Chauncy</hi> thinks fit to diſpute the <hi>Reality</hi> of thoſe favourable Appearances, in the Senſe wherein it is maintained in the APPEAL. He does not indeed deny that the Tumults of War were then ceaſed, but ſhrewdly aſks, <hi>was this never the Caſe before?</hi> This Queſtion alludes to the introductory Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<q>that the favourable Opportunity—was ſuch, in <hi>ſeveral</hi> Reſpects, as the Circumſtances of the Nation had never, until then, afforded.</q>
But it was not pretended that the Temple of the <hi>Britiſh Janus</hi> had never been before ſhut, nor that the favourable Opportunity was, in every Reſpect, without a Precedent. He goes on: <hi>Are there no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Suſpicions of a ſpeedy Interruption of the preſent Tranquility?</hi> The Queſtion, ought not to have been put in the <hi>preſent Tenſe.</hi> The <hi>Appeal</hi> was drawn up in <hi>February</hi> 1767, and the Doctor wrote in the Beginning of 1768, it being about a Year afterwards; within which Time the Appearance of public Affairs was greatly changed. And I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that, whatever Alarms of a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War had reached him and impreſſed his Imagination at the Time of <hi>anſwering,</hi> I neither ſaw nor heard of any Appearances of ſuch a Thing at the Time of <hi>writing.</hi> With Regard to the
<q>Harmony ſubſiſting between our Mother-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and moſt of the Colonies,</q>
the Doctor ſays: <hi>It is true the Diſpute relative to the</hi> STAMP-ACT, <hi>has been happily terminated. But has nothing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened ſince, that has diſturbed the Harmony?</hi> If he will be pleaſed to review the Chronology of <hi>the doings at Home</hi> which relate to the Colonies, he will find that in the Beginning of 1767, we knew here of nothing that had intervened, after the happy Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the great Diſpute about the STAMP-ACT, which had the leaſt Tendency to diſturb our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011203_0183_0F95325E6CC63FF0"/>
Indeed before the <hi>Appeal</hi> was printed, it was found that the Mother-Country had expreſſed her Reſentment of the Proceedings of one of our provincial Aſſemblies; and this occaſioned a ſmall Alteration to be made in the Copy, <hi>moſt of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi> being inſerted, inſtead of, <hi>the Colonies.</hi> The Doctor has ſome Declamation under this Queſtion, which as it is founded on a Miſtake, I can readily excuſe.</p>
               <p>AS to the Plan for <hi>American</hi> Biſhops, according to which the religious Privileges of all Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be left untouched, the Doctor has the Curioſity to inquire: <hi>By whom has this Plan been ſettled and adjuſted?</hi> And then adds, <hi>we have no good Reaſon to think that it has been done by thoſe who have any conſtitutional Right to meddle, of their own meer Motion, with Matters of this Nature.</hi> This Subject will come more properly under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration afterwards; in the mean while, I will give him this general Information, that the Plan for ſuch an Epiſcopate as is explained in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> was ſettled by thoſe who were warranted by a Royal Commiſſion conſtitutionally iſſued.</p>
               <p>AS to the King's favorable Diſpoſition, from which we have ſuch Expectations of Relief, the Doctor thinks it will do us no Service. <hi>We can,</hi> ſays he, <hi>chearfully rely on the impartial Juſtice and Goodneſs of the Britiſh Sovereign, not in the leaſt doubting his equal paternal Regard to all his loyal Coloniſts of whatever Claſs.</hi> And may not the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> rely upon him, as well as others? Will <hi>impartial Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> be partial againſt the Church? Will not the <hi>equal Regard</hi> of our Sovereign, at length raiſe us
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011203_0184_0F95326120295A48"/>
to that Equality with our Fellow-Coloniſts, which alone we requeſt? Will not a <hi>paternal Regard to loyal Coloniſts</hi> raiſe thoſe Coloniſts, whoſe Loyalty has been unimpeached, and which it is hoped will be able to ſtand every Trial, from the Condition of Aliens into that of Sons? How unkind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous is it to tell us of our <hi>Equality,</hi> when the World ſees that our Condition is cruelly <hi>unequal!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS the Concurrence of many peculiar Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances was apprehended to be favorable to the Scheme of an Epiſcopate in the Colonies, ſo it was obſerved in the <hi>Appeal,</hi>
                  <q>that the Arguments for ſending Biſhops to <hi>America,</hi> were never ſo ſtrong and forcible as they are at preſent.</q>
Under this Head, the Number of thoſe who belong to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> and who will receive Benefit from this Appointment, was particularly inſiſted on. This Number was intimated to be NEAR A MILLION. The Writers againſt the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> particularly Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> and the <hi>Centinel,</hi> have exerted themſelves to prove, that the Account is aggravated beyond the Bounds of Truth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; and, in my private Opinion, the moſt plauſible Things that have been written againſt any Part of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> have been offered on this Subject. It may therefore be proper to lay before the Reader the Evidence upon which the Expreſſion was grounded.</p>
               <p>IF any one will take the Trouble to turn to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 55, he will find, that any exact Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the Number of Church-Men in <hi>America</hi> was not pretended to; ſo far from it, that it was expreſsly acknowledged,
<q>that in a Country ſo widely extended and unequally peopled,</q>
it was not to be expected. However, as it had been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011203_0185_0F9532617403FAA0"/>
ſaid by our moſt ſenſible Writers, and was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been aſſumed as Fact in the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that the King's proper Subjects in <hi>America</hi> amounted to THREE MILLIONS; it was thought that the Aſſertion,
<q>that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> contains now <hi>near a Million</hi> of Members,</q>
might be juſtified on the Ground of that general Aſſumption. At the Time of writing, I had Reaſon to believe, and am ſtill of Opinion, that thoſe who profeſs themſelves to belong to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>American</hi> Colonies and Iſlands, are not leſs than a <hi>third</hi> Part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, <hi>excluſively</hi> of the <hi>Blacks</hi>; and I had Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic enough to know, that a third Part of what was aſſigned as the whole Number, was <hi>one Million.</hi> But as I ſuſpected that the general Number was exaggerated, an Abatement was made on the Side of the Church, and it was intimated that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it amounted, not to a full Million, but to <hi>near a Million.</hi> Now this, I imagine, might be ſaid, not improperly, after a Deduction of 500,000, from the Sum total as currently received, a third Part of which would be upwards of 833,000: And this was actually the very Number that I had in View. And wherever the Expreſſion of <hi>near a Million</hi> has been applied to the Number of <hi>American</hi> Church-Men, by the Clergy of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, it has been upon the ſame View and Principle.</p>
               <p>MY continuing to uſe the Expreſſion, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen the Account of an actual Survey ſaid to have been made in 1762, which was mentioned in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 56, remains to be accounted for. The Number of Inhabitants expreſſed in that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of which I knew no more than that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:011203_0186_0F9532622E4B7C78"/>
of Credit told me it had been carefully taken, fell ſhort of my Expectations, it making the Members of the Church, not including the Blacks, to be no more at the Time of the Survey, than between Four and Five Hundred Thouſand. But then it was conſidered, that the <hi>Americans</hi> are found to double their Numbers in 25 Years in the Courſe of natural Generation—that five Years had elapſed ſince the Survey was ſaid to have been made, and conſequently that a fifth Part of the whole was to be added to the Number, that the Account included not the Colonies lately ceded, in which there are probably ſome Thouſands of Church-Men—that a farther yearly Addition had been made by the coming over of <hi>Europeans,</hi> and, as ſome think, by Proſelytes from the Diſſenters —and that of the Blacks, not leſs than 600,000 muſt be the Property of Epiſcopalians, of which Number it was conjectured that about a fourth Part might be ſaid properly to belong to the Church: I ſay, the above Particulars being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I was of Opinion that the Expreſſion of <hi>near a Million,</hi> might ſtill be retained, conſiſtently with the Account of the actual Survey.</p>
               <p>SOME of my Opponents have affected to be witty upon what was ſaid of the Blacks, ridiculing the Notion of their being Members of the Church. But, with Regard to the Admiſſion of Members, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> like the Goſpel of Chriſt, makes no Diſtinction of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> Bond or Free, Black or White; and we are not aſhamed to confeſs, that many of thoſe who are doomed to Slavery, and upon whoſe Necks we have faſtened the Yoke of Bondage, are Members of the ſame religious Society with ourſelves. Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> ſays
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011203_0187_0F953262F2AA0050"/>
of me, in a <hi>Note,</hi> p. 112, <hi>the Dr. for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf, did not chuſe to ſay, in plain Words, that</hi> NEGROES, <hi>knowing nothing of Religion, make a very large Part of his Million of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of England. But it is evident he has theſe in Reſerve to ſave the Truth of his Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> As I did not ſay <hi>in plain Words,</hi> neither did I give the leaſt Intimation, <hi>that Negroes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of Religion,</hi> conſtituted any Part of the ſuppoſed Number of <hi>American</hi> Church-Men. If I had intended to include ſuch, I ſhould not have ſpoken of <hi>near a Million,</hi> but of <hi>many more than a Million,</hi> belonging to the Church. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had obſerved, in p. 57, of the Slaves in general, that
<q>they may be ſaid in an <hi>imperfect</hi> Senſe, to belong to the reſpective religious Claſſes of their Owners;</q>
yet I meant not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the Account of <hi>near a Million,</hi> more of them than were ſuppoſed to have been actually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or were deſirous of being admitted, to be Members of the Church by Baptiſm: And ſuch, it was hoped, might amount to the fourth Part of the whole Number.</p>
               <p>THUS I have accounted for our having ſaid, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> contains near a Million of Members. After all, I am not poſitive but we may have ſpoken improperly; for which Reaſon, for my own Part, I ſhall be contented hereafter to change the Mode of Expreſſion, and inſtead of ſaying, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> contains <hi>near a Million</hi> of Members, to ſay it contains <hi>a third Part of all the Inhabitants of the Britiſh Iſlands and Colonies in America,</hi> without including the Blacks; which Expreſſion, I believe, can be fairly defended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:011203_0188_0F953263AF044CF8"/>THE Doctor, in Order to confute the Account given in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> is pleaſed to ſpend four or five Pages in Exhibitions of his own <hi>political Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi>; but he appears not to be, any more than the Author of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> a BREREWOOD or a PETTY. I could eaſily point out many Miſtakes in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; but I find it neceſſary to ſpare the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Patience wherever I can. The Effect of his Operations is, in his own Opinion of the Matter, that <hi>it is queſtionable, whether the Amount of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Profeſſors, in all theſe Colonies will be more than</hi> about 270,000, p. 115. This Computation, I am perſuaded, would be found greatly defective upon a ſtrict Examination; but even allowing it to be juſt, the Number is not contemptibly ſmall. For 270,000 Members of the national Church in the <hi>American</hi> Colonies, are too many to be neglected. If any other Denomination of Proteſtants in this Country, conſiſting of but a tenth Part of that Number, were to be refuſed the Enjoyment of its own Form of eccleſiaſtical Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, I doubt not but it would occaſion a general Clamor throughout the Colonies, and perhaps throughout the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>THE deplorable State of the <hi>American</hi> Slaves was mentioned in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that probably the propoſed Epiſcopate would have a good Effect upon that wretched Claſs of our Fellow-Creatures, for whoſe ſpiritual Intereſts we are under peculiar Obligations to be ſollicitous. The Doctor replies: <hi>Could he have hit upon nothing but an Epiſcopate for their Relief? This, at beſt, is a far-fetched, round-about Expedient,</hi> p. 116. I could undoubtedly <hi>have hit</hi> upon ſome other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients; but as the Caſe of an Epiſcopate was
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011203_0189_0F9532647070E8D0"/>
under Conſideration when theſe Blacks were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it was then moſt natural to <hi>hit</hi> upon that. And although he ſeems to think the Expedient <hi>far-fetched</hi> and <hi>round-about,</hi> yet any one may ſee that I did not go far, nor much out of my Way, to meet with it. What he proceeds to ſay upon the Subject of Slavery, as it is not offered in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any Thing advanced in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may deſerve the Conſideration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, is no particular Concern of mine, and therefore I ſhall paſs it over.</p>
               <p>IT was repreſented in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 58, that
<q>another Argument for granting an <hi>American</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate, ariſes from the Obligations of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; a national Senſe of which, ought, at this Time, to have a peculiar Efficacy in Favor of Religion in the <hi>American</hi> Plantations.</q>
It is no <hi>round-about,</hi> but a direct Courſe, that leads to this Inference. 'For the divine Goodneſs having been moſt eminently diſplayed in <hi>America,</hi> where can it be ſo proper to erect ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gratitude for this Goodneſs, as in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca?</hi> What Method of doing this is ſo natural, as farther to ſecure and extend that Religion, whereby the Honor of God is believed to be beſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? This muſt be the Religion, which in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Nation, is the beſt and moſt perfect; or, in other Words, the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But what does he State of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> require to be done, for its Welfare and Happineſs? Why, this Church is, in a Manner periſhing for Want of common Neceſſaries. She has long been imploring Relief, under ſuch Diſeaſes as muſt prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected. She therefore earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:011203_0190_0F9532652F9C85B8"/>
and She only requeſts, that proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be provided for her preſent Sufferings. This Requeſt is made with full Confidence of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, as She wiſhes for nothing that ſhall be thought inconſiſtent with the Rights and Safety of others. She aſks for nothing but what has been granted to others, without any ill Conſequences; and She cannot but rely on the common Affection and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Nation to raiſe her to this Equality.' This is the Subſtance of the Argument as it ſtands in the <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor pretends that he cannot eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any <hi>ſpecial Connection the victorious Succeſs of the Britiſh Arms in America has, with the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Epiſcopate here.</hi> But this Connection has been clearly pointed out; and it is ſufficient for my Purpoſe, if it is viſible to others. <hi>Is the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Church of England,</hi> ſays he, p. 119, <hi>the only true Religion on the American Continent?</hi> I ſhall not now enter into a Diſquiſition about the <hi>Number</hi> of true Religions, nor how far any Thing that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Truth may be true itſelf, but anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Queſtion: The Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is evidently the pureſt and beſt <hi>in the national Opinion,</hi> or it would never have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as ſuch, and eſtabliſhed at Home. But <hi>is Religion, in none of the other Forms, to be regarded?</hi> In my Judgment of the Matter, Religion under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Form ought to be regarded, in a greater or leſs Degree, as perhaps the worſt Form of it is better than none at all; and under all Forms it ought to be tolerated, as far as is conſiſtent with the public Safety. But as no Man, nor Society of Men, can be under Obligations to promote or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate any Religion, which is believed by him or
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011203_0191_0F953265F11AB590"/>
them to be falſe; ſo all Men are obliged to promote the Intereſts of what they believe to be the true Religion, and more eſpecially after any ſignal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions of divine Providence in their Favor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE do not eſteem it a Duty,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>much leſs an indiſpenſible one, in Conſequence of theſe Conqueſts, to provide for the Security or Support of the Religion of Epiſcopalians, any more than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of other Denominations of Chriſtians in the Colonies.</hi> But he, and thoſe of his Perſuaſion, ought to eſteem it a Duty to provide for the Security of their own Religion, MORE than for that of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians, or of any other Denominations of Chriſtians in the Colonies. The Caſe is the ſame, with Regard to the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; it is their Duty, in the firſt Place, and more eſpecially, to provide for the Welfare and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their own Religion. A proper Senſe of this general Obligation in the Members of the Church, is all that we require; we claim no Rights for ourſelves, but what we allow to all others. Both they and we ought undoubtedly to endeavor to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and promote our reſpective Religions; but we ſhould all remember, what we are generally too apt to forget, that it is our Duty to attempt this, only in a fair and honorable Way, on either Side, and ſo as not to interfere with the religious Privileges of thoſe who differ from us. This is putting the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a fair and equitable Footing, and is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, as we would have them do to us. And upon no worſe a Footing than this, did the Argument of the <hi>Appeal</hi> proceed. It was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the late Diſplay of the divine Goodneſs in <hi>America,</hi> was any Reaſon why the Diſſenters ſhould ſupport and propagate the Religion of the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011203_0192_0F953266B0689400"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; but it was, and ſtill is, inſiſted, that it is a good Reaſon why the Members of the Church ſhould: And as thoſe who have the Direction of our public Affairs, are chiefly Perſons belonging to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is a good Reaſon for <hi>them</hi> to engage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in Behalf of this Church in <hi>America,</hi> and even to provide for it an Epiſcopate, ſince it is a Proviſion ſo manifeſtly neceſſary for its Welfare and Proſperity.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor goes on for ſome Pages, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to deſtroy the Force of the preceding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; but what he has ſaid with this View, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be the weakeſt of all the weak Things he has offered in his Performance. In p. 121, he conceits that I was <hi>under the Influence of an undue Warmth of Spirit,</hi> when I urged the Conſideration which is now in Queſtion. I confeſs, I can hardly write upon, or conſider, the "maimed State" in which the <hi>American</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſtill ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue, without ſome <hi>Warmth of Spirit</hi>; but that I have been influenced by <hi>an undue Warmth,</hi> I am not conſcious, nor do I believe. A Zeal for its Intereſts, ſo far as they interfere not with the juſt Right of others, I profeſs; but no farther. But until it can be proved that my Zeal has led me to propoſe unwarrantable Meaſures for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Church, or that I have not ſhewn a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Regard for the Principles of religious Liberty; I ſhall not be convinced that I have diſcovered any <hi>undue Warmth of Spirit.</hi> But if there can be ſuch a Thing in Nature, it moſt glaringly and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhews itſelf in the Writers <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Appeal</hi>; and if it appears, in any Degree, in the Author of it, <hi>they</hi> certainly, of all Perſons, have the leaſt

               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor proceeds: <hi>I ſcarce know how to ſpeak upon the Matter ſeriouſly, it is placed in ſo ludicrous a Light.</hi> He ſhould rather have honeſtly confeſſed, that he ſcarce knew how to <hi>reaſon</hi> upon the Matter <hi>juſtly,</hi> or to make any plauſible Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Argument, it was placed in ſo <hi>convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a Light. Whether there was any Thing <hi>ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous</hi> in my Repreſentation, is freely ſubmitted to the Reader's Judgment. In what Manner it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on the Doctor's <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> and how far he could have been in a <hi>gay</hi> or <hi>comic</hi> Humor when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the Weight of the Argument, may be eaſily conjectured. That in this Situation he knew not how to <hi>reaſon</hi> upon the Matter <hi>juſtly,</hi> appears from the very next Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOTWITHSTANDING the</hi>
                  <q>diſeaſed periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</q>
                  <hi>State of the American Church, have not Praiſes and Adorations, according to the</hi>
                  <q>pureſt and beſt</q>
                  <hi>Forms of Devotion, been offered up to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in all the epiſcopal Aſſemblies on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, for the marvellous Interpoſitions of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in our Behalf, in the late War?</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Import of which Sentence I take to be this: <hi>The epiſcopal Aſſemblies on the Continent have offered up Praiſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore the American Church is not in a diſeaſed periſhing State, as is pretended.</hi> But whether this was really meant, I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Perhaps the leading Sentiment was, that the public Thankſgivings at the Concluſion of the War, were a ſuitable Monument of Gratitude for
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:011203_0194_0F95326831805530"/>
the Succeſſes that attended it; and therefore that there is no Need of an Epiſcopate, conſidered as a Monument of Gratitude. If this was the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was improperly expreſſed; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reaſoning is as obnoxious as the Manner of expreſſing it. A Monument is always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be Something that is permanent, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the World; it muſt neceſſarily be a WORK, and not an ENERGY, or tranſient Act. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral public Thankſgiving was a ſuitable <hi>Tribute</hi> of Gratitude, but it could be no <hi>Monument.</hi> But even if it was, it might have been our Duty to raiſe other Monuments of Gratitude, and that of an Epiſcopate among the reſt. The Doctor mentions <hi>grateful Hearts and well-ordered Converſations</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſuitable Monuments</hi> on that Occaſion. I intirely agree with him in this; and I believe the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to erect them, was not in the leaſt ſuperſeded by the Monument, if we are ſo to call it, of a public Thankſgiving. The Truth is, as I conceive, all poſſible Honor ought to be paid to the ſupreme Ruler of Events, and EVERY proper Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be raiſed, whenever his Providence calls us to proclaim, and perpetuate, to the World, our Senſe of his great and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Goodneſs.</p>

               <head>SECTION VII.</head>
               <p>THE next Section of the <hi>Appeal</hi> treats of the Obligations we are under as Chriſtians,<note place="margin">SECT. VII.</note> to propagate the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>American</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and of the Advantages that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from an Epiſcopate, in the Conduct and Execution of that good Work, whenever it ſhall be undertaken upon that extenſive Plan, which many worthy Members of the Society propoſe. As to what was ſaid concerning our Obligations to this Duty, I am ſo happy as to find Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> moſtly agreeing with me in Sentiments; but with Regard to the proper Methods of performing it, and the Uſefulneſs of an Epiſcopate to that End, we differ, as is uſual.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Thing he controverts in this Section, is the Propriety of <hi>civilizing</hi> Savages in Order to their Converſion. I had aſſigned ſome Reaſons, and produced ſome Authorities, to ſupport what appears to have become the general Opinion; namely, that Humanity, or Civility of Manners, is, in ſome Degree, previouſly neceſſary, that Chriſtianity may have its proper Effect upon the <hi>American</hi> Heathens. Againſt what was offered to this Purpoſe, the Doctor oppoſes the Experience of <hi>New-England,</hi> telling us, p. 125, that <hi>many Tribes of them</hi> (the Indians) <hi>in the</hi> Maſſachuſett'<hi>s Province, have, by this Means,</hi> viz. <hi>The Engliſh Way of Living, been ſo depopulated, that there are now
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:011203_0196_0F95326AF731D648"/>
ſcarce any Remains of them to be ſeen.</hi> From whence he ſeems to be poſitive in this Concluſion, that there is not <hi>any Need of what is called civilizing them, in Order to their embracing Chriſtianity. Their being Savages,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and living in a Way different from what we do, is no Reaſon why their Converſion may not be expected, if ſuitable Means were uſed with them,</hi> p. 126.</p>
               <p>AS to the Depopulation of ſome Tribes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians within the Bounds, or on the Borders of <hi>New-England,</hi> it may have been greatly owing to ſome Vices, which their Intercourſe with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> furniſhed them with an Opportunity to indulge. But there is no natural Connection, I hope, between Civility of Manners, and the Practice of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Vices. I cannot learn that the Indians thus deſtroyed were greatly civilized. Barely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in a while amongſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants, diſpoſing of their Peltry, and purchaſing ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as they commonly received in Exchange, could not much improve the Manners of Savages. They muſt know ſomething of Letters, reſide in fixed Habitations, practice Huſbandry and the neceſſary mechanic Arts, before they can be ſaid to have come out of their ſavage State. Now it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable that either of theſe Particulars, or all of them, can have a Tendency to deſtroy any Part of the human Species. If any of the <hi>Tribes in the Maſſachuſetts-Province,</hi> which were ſo far civilized, <hi>have been depopulated</hi>; it cannot have been owing to their <hi>Engliſh Way of living,</hi> but to other Cauſes, perhaps to ſuch as were accidental or local. I have met with ſeveral <hi>New-England</hi> Writers who differ widely from the Doctor; aſcribing the Depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many Indian Tribes, not to the Cauſe
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:011203_0197_0F95326B2EE31CE0"/>
aſſigned by him, but to the immediate Hand of God, who thought fit to cut off thoſe idolatrous Nations, to make Room for the Settlement of his choſen People. Be this as it may, the Nature and Diſpoſition of Savages, of all Ages, of all Countries and Complexions, are ſo nearly the ſame; that all the Trials which have been made with any of them, as well as what has happened in <hi>New-England,</hi> will afford Light to the preſent general Subject.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANITY, as was obſerved from Dr. <hi>Bray,</hi> flouriſhed or declined in the early Ages of the Church, in almoſt an exact Proportion to Men's Improvement in Letters and civilized Manners. In modern Ages, the moſt judicious and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Miſſionaries, have judged that the Goſpel can have but little Effect with Barbarians and Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It was a Maxim with Father <hi>Labat,</hi> who had been a celebrated Miſſionary in the American I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands,
<q>that in Order to make the Americans CHRISTIANS, it was previouſly neceſſary to make them MEN<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Moſheim</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Vol II. p. 307.</note>.</q>
                  <hi>Hans Egede,</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Miſſionary, who had reſided 25 Years in <hi>Greenland,</hi> was of the ſame Opinion.
<q>It is a Matter that cannot be queſtioned, ſays he, that if you will make a Man a Chriſtian out of a mere Savage and wild Man, you muſt firſt make him a reaſonable Man.—It would contribute a great Deal to forward their Converſion, if they could, by Degrees, be brought into a ſettled Way of Life<note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>the Divine Legation,</hi> &amp;c. Vol. II. p. 71.</note>.</q>
Father <hi>Hennepin,</hi> for many Years a Miſſionary in <hi>Canada</hi> and the interior Parts of America, among the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles in the Way of converting the American In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:011203_0198_0F95326BEE172DD8"/>
mentions their ſavage Manner of Life.
<q>They are not fixed in a Place, tarrying no longer in their Villages, than till Harveſt is over, which is but a ſmall Time; all the reſt of the Year they paſs in Wars and hunting: Then they carry all their Families with them, and are abſent eight or nine Months; their Children then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all, and return to their former Manner of Living<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Miller</hi>'s Propagation of Chriſtianity, Vol. II. p. 262.</note>.</q>
Theſe are the Sentiments of ſome of the moſt famous Miſſionaries of theſe latter Ages, in different Parts of the World. The moſt celebrated Writers, both at home and abroad, have joined in the ſame Opinion. The very learned <hi>Moſheim</hi> ſays:
<q>As to thoſe Indians, who live more remote from the <hi>European</hi> Settlements, and wander about in the Woods without any fixed Habitation, they are abſolutely incapable either of receiving or retaining any adequate Notions of the Chriſtian Doctrine, unleſs they be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reclaimed from that vagarant Manner of Life, and civilized by an Intercourſe with Perſons, whoſe humane and inſinuating Manners are adapted to attract their Love and excite their Imitation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Vol. II. p. 306.</note>.</q>
The more learned Author of the DIVINE LEGATION <hi>of Moſes,</hi> ſays:
<q>Chriſtianity, plain and ſimple as it is, and fitted in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for what it was deſigned by its Author, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an Intellect above that of a mere Savage to underſtand. Something then muſt be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it. And what is that Something but CIVIL SOCIETY<note n="†" place="bottom">Divine Legation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Vol. II. p. 70.</note>.</q>
Again, he complains that ſome Men, "having taken it into their Heads" (like Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>)
<q>that the Vices of improved
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:011203_0199_0F95326CAD9A29F0"/>
Life would more <hi>indiſpoſe</hi> the Indians to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Goſpel, than their preſent Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality <hi>incapacitates</hi> them from comprehending the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of it, have concluded it beſt, upon the whole, to keep their Eyes ſhut to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of civil Life<note n="*" place="bottom">Divine Legation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Vol. II. p. 70.</note>.</q>
I might eaſily produce the Authority of many other great Names, to the ſame Purpoſe; but the above, I apprehend, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to counter-ballance the Weight of Dr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s, who barely gives his Opinion, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reaſons.</p>
               <p>THE next Thing he controverts, is my Account of the Society's Plan for a more general and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attempt to convert the <hi>American</hi> Heathens. Not that the Fact is denied, or the Propriety of the Reſolution diſputed; but it is pretended, that this Account contradicts what had been before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, namely,
<q>that the Support and Propagation of the Goſpel among our own People in <hi>America,</hi> was the immediate and princpial Deſign of their Incorporation.</q>
Whether the Converſion of the Heathens was, or was not, the Object primarily and more immediately in View, when the Society was incorporated, may be eaſily ſeen. The Charter of Incorporation, and an authentic Hiſtory of the Riſe and Progreſs of that charitable Inſtitution for near thirty Years, are extant, and Copies of them are in many Hands. It would be very extraordinary indeed, if the Charter ſhould have miſtaken its own immediate and primary Object; and equally extraordinary, if the original Members, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for it, ſhould not have known their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. The Charter mentions the great End in View to be no other, than
<q>to promote the Glory
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:011203_0200_0F95326D6FAC5C68"/>
of God, by the Inſtruction of OUR PEOPLE in the Chriſtian Religion.</q>
In the Preamble it ſpeaks no leſs than <hi>thrice</hi> of the King's LOVING SUBJECTS, as the great and immediate Object of the intended Charity; and ſays not a Word of the <hi>American</hi> Heathens. And it appears from the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Society, from their yearly Abſtracts, and anniverſary Sermons, that the Members of that venerable Body, never underſtood, or imagined, that the Converſion of Heathens was to be their principal and more immediate Work. The Caſe is ſo uncommonly plain, that even Dr. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew,</hi> was compelled by the Force of Evidence, contrary to his own Inclination and the Scope of his Argument, to confeſs, that
<q>it appears that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, &amp;c. were really the <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> more <hi>immediate</hi> Object of this Inſtitution, or the King's SUBJECTS<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations, &amp;c. p. 18.</note>.</q>
But at the ſame Time it is farther evident, although not from the Charter as Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> pretended, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>American</hi> Heathens was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding an Object more remotely in View, with many of the original and principal Members, and very probably with the Royal Founder himſelf. And, from the Beginning to this Day, the Society have always underſtood that they have a diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Power of employing ſuch a Part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations intruſted with them, as their more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Duty to the King's <hi>American Subjects</hi> would admit of, for the Propagation of the Goſpel amongſt the Indians bordering upon our Settlements. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<q>they have always employed ſome Perſons in this Service; and I believe it may be truly ſaid, that they have never neglected any fair Opening to introduce the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>American</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="unknown:011203_0201_0F95326E3136C528"/>
Heathens, eſpecially if proper Perſons could be found, to engage in ſuch a Miſſion.</q>
Where now is the Inconſiſtency in all this? May not the Converſion of the Indians be properly an Object conſtantly aimed at by this worthy Society, although not its primary and immediate Object? Is not <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> a relative Term, ſuppoſing Something that is <hi>ſecondary,</hi> or to follow it? Has it ever been ſaid on the Side of the Church, that the Society, ſo far as they have engaged in propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel amongſt the Savages, have acted improperly? Or, that they undertook what was not <hi>their proper Work?</hi> And, <hi>now an Epiſcopate is in View,</hi> is it ſaid or inſinuated, that it is their <hi>primary</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object? Where then is the Contradiction that is pretended? And how utterly groundleſs is the following Reflection? <hi>The Writers on the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian Side, have the Advantage beyond all others. They can make Uſe of the ſame Argument, with a good Grace, to contrary Purpoſes,</hi> p. 127.</p>
               <p>AS to the Advantage here mentioned, if it had been really claimed or made Uſe of by <hi>the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the epiſcopalian Side,</hi> it cannot juſtly be ſaid that they claim, or <hi>make Uſe of it,</hi> BEYOND <hi>all others.</hi> I can point out an Example that is <hi>equal</hi> to it, which has been Matter of common Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Doctor well knows that <hi>the Writers on the anti-epiſcopalian Side,</hi> for ſeveral Years before the Publication of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> had aſſerted and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly contended, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has no general Eſtabliſhment in the <hi>American</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. But, <hi>now an Epiſcopate is in View,</hi> they can tell us a different Story,—arguing, that the propoſed Epiſcopate muſt operate here in the ſame Manner that epiſcopal Government operates in
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:011203_0202_0F95326EEEFEB360"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> becauſe of its general Eſtabliſhment. They do not indeed commonly go ſo far as to ſay, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in plain Words, that the Church is thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Colonies; but their Way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſtly implies it. So that, we ſee, the Writers againſt the Church <hi>have</hi> alſo <hi>the Advantage</hi> of making <hi>Uſe of the ſame Argument, to contrary Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,</hi> or rather, of oppoſite Principles to the ſame Purpoſe; but I cannot ſay that they do this <hi>with a good Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>INSTEAD of the Advantages expected from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Attempts to proſelyte the <hi>American</hi> Heathens, under the Direction of a reſident Biſhop, the Doctor ſays, <hi>this ſuperintending Buſineſs might, to better Purpoſe, be put into other Hands,</hi> p. 128. He then introduces <hi>the Society in Scotland, for the Propagation of Chriſtian Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Company for the Propagation of the Goſpel in New-England,</hi> who <hi>manage their Affairs</hi> by <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>the Laity as well as Clergy,</hi> as Inſtances to prove, that the Superintendency of a Biſhop would be no Advantage to <hi>our</hi> Society, with Regard to the Converſion of the Indians. It might as well be proved, from the Example of <hi>the Churches in the Colonies,</hi> that a Biſhop is not neceſſary for the Purpoſe of <hi>Ordination,</hi> ſince, with them, that End is alſo obtained without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But it ſhould have been remembered, that although a Biſhop in neither Caſe is neceſſary on <hi>their</hi> Principles, yet in both Caſes he may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary on <hi>ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Example of thoſe two Societies can be expected to have but little Effect upon the World, until their Conduct ſhall be better known to the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:011203_0203_0F95326FAF06A688"/>
Public. An Account of their Conſtitution, of the Condition and Management of their Funds, of the Perſons employed in their Service, and the Places and State of their particular Miſſions, is a <hi>Deſideratum</hi> which has been long looked for; and until it is obtained, many Perſons will entertain unfavorable Suſpicions. The Doctor tells us, in general, that <hi>they have, at this Day, within the Maſſachuſetts-Province—Sixteen Clergymen, Engliſh and Indian, ſtatedly labouring, either as Paſtors of ſo many Indian Churches, or as Preachers to Aſſemblies of Indians that meet together for divine Worſhip; Nine Engliſh Lecturers, and Seven ſtated School-Maſters, beſides occaſional ones,</hi> p. 129. But this general Intelligence is by no Means ſatisfactory; it rather raiſes our Curioſity to know <hi>how</hi> Twenty-five Paſtors, Preachers and Lecturers are employed, as well as <hi>where,</hi> to <hi>what Numbers,</hi> and to <hi>what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> they are reſpectively ſent. For according to Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s Account<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Maſſ. Vol. I. p. 169, in a Note.</note>, the Indians in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Plymouth,</hi> are ſo greatly waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that they amount to no more than about 80 Families at <hi>Maſhapee,</hi> the ſame Number at <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> 70 Families at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and 15 at <hi>Nantucket,</hi> beſides a few ſcattered Families in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of the Province. But how Twenty-five Paſtors, Preachers and Lecturers can be <hi>properly</hi> employed, only in the four Places of <hi>Maſhapee, Martha's-Vineyard, Stockbridge</hi> and <hi>Nantucket,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about 245 Families of Indians, requires ſome Explanation. It might be not improper alſo to inform the Public, what the Difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their <hi>Preachers to Aſſemblies of Indians,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Lecturers</hi> employed in the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Work of miniſtering to the Indians; for at
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:011203_0204_0F9532706E4DC668"/>
preſent it is unintelligible to many People. In ſaying this Information is wanted, and has been long expected, I do not mean to condemn the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe two Societies. From the reſpectable Characters of ſome who are ſaid to be Members of them, I cannot believe them to be guilty of any ſiniſter Intentions. But why is the Light of a good Example concealed from the World? Why do they not <hi>publiſh</hi> an Account of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that all injurious Suſpicions may be obviated or removed?</p>
               <p>AS to <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> the Doctor fears <hi>whether, in what is propoſed to be done by them, a Regard to the Church, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in England, may not be too much mingled with the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity.</hi> A <hi>friendly</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Nature would undoubtedly be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as all Chriſtians are more or leſs liable to <hi>mingle</hi> the Intereſts of Party <hi>with the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity.</hi> But this Society is as irreproachable in this Reſpect, as any Society that can be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without Exception. Its Members hitherto appear to have acted as diſintereſtedly, and to have mingled Conſiderations of a private Nature with their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Proceedings as little, as can be expected from the beſt of <hi>Men.</hi> They are diſpoſed to be upon friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Terms with all Denominations of Chriſtians in the Colonies; and if there is any Danger of their acting contrary to ſuch a Diſpoſition, it muſt ariſe, not from themſelves, but from thoſe who make it in ſome Degree neceſſary, by an unreaſonable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all their Meaſures. It is natural for Men to defend themſelves; and ſo far as Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhall oblige them to regard the <hi>peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:011203_0205_0F95327132A64B18"/>
to be cautious. But I dare riſque all my Intereſt and Reputation upon it, that they will never be backward to cultivate, on their Part, a friendly Correſpondence with every Denomination of Proteſtants, whether here or elſewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As <hi>America</hi> is the Region wherein the divine Goodneſs has been more remarkably diſplayed in Favor of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation,</q>
the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that <hi>Americans are the proper Perſons to erect</hi> 'ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gratitude,' <hi>on that Account,</hi> p. 130. But if that Goodneſs was not diſplayed in Favor of <hi>Americans, Americans</hi> are under no Obligations of Gratitude on Account of it. If it was
<q>diſplayed in Favor of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation,</q>
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation is under Obligations to erect
<q>ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gratitude.</q>
The Truth of the Caſe is, as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation in general, and the <hi>Americans</hi> in particular, were remarkably favored by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the late War, the Duty is incumbent upon both; and ſaying that the <hi>Americans</hi> are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, is not proving that the Nation is not obliged, to perform it. The Doctor ſeems to allow of my Poſition, that
<q>
                     <hi>America</hi> is the very Ground, on which ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ought to be erected;</q>
and he differs not greatly from me, when he ſays, <hi>what more ſuitable one, than a viſible perpetually ſtanding Teſtimony of their pious Concern, and earneſt Care, to ſpread the Knowledge of their only Lord who has done ſuch great Things for them?</hi> The chief Difference between us is, that he ſeems, in this Paſſage, to make that to be the whole of the <hi>Teſtimony of their pious Concern</hi> and 'religious Gratitude,' which I would have to be but a Part of it.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:011203_0206_0F953271ED137D60"/>HE goes on to complain, that the Endeavors of <hi>the non-epiſcopal Clergy and Laity in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Province,</hi> to do ſomething in this Way, <hi>upon the Concluſion of the late War,</hi> were defeated at Home. For he tells us, that after a large Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was made in <hi>Boſton</hi> for a Fund to ſupport Miſſionaries in the <hi>Mohawk Country,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Upon Condition that there might be an incorporated Society among ourſelves</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for the conducting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this important Affair: An incorporating Act was prepared, and paſſed by the ſeveral Branches of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, and ſent Home for the Royal Sanction, without which it could not continue in Force. But it ſoon met with a Negative, by which Means this whole Money was loſt.</hi> And he intimates that the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was occaſioned by EPISCOPAL <hi>Influence.</hi> What he means here by <hi>epiſcopal Influence,</hi> in his RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARKS <hi>on the Biſhop of Landaff's Sermon,</hi> he muſt be ſuppoſed to explain in the following Words: <hi>It is hoped,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Accounts we have had are not true, that the Negative upon this Act, was principally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Influence of ſome of the moſt important Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel.</hi> Now to the Accuſation evidently implied in theſe Words, the very ſenſible Author of <hi>A</hi> VINDICATION of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of LANDAFF's SERMON, has thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
<q>The Doctor may be aſſured that his Hope is well founded, and <hi>the Accounts he had,</hi> not true. Beſides the utter Improbability that a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eminently pious Men who have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Savages much at Heart, would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a Meaſure for that Purpoſe; I will here ſubjoin an Extract of a Letter from one of the <hi>moſt important</hi> Members of the Society to his Friend in this Country, dated <hi>Oct.</hi> 1762, and which confutes that Calumny. Speaking
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011203_0207_0F953273D1490898"/>
of this Affair, he ſays—<hi>The Plan as preſented, was liable to ſeveral Objections; particularly that the Members were to be accountable only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. However the Society made</hi> NO OPPOSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION TO IT<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vindicat.</hi> p. 74.</note>.</q>
The Letter here quoted I have ſeen, and from an Acquaintance with the Hand-Writing, know it to be <hi>genuine.</hi> The Author of it was no leſs a Perſon, a no leſs <hi>important Member of the Society,</hi> than their PRESIDENT at that Time; whoſe eminent Integrity, Abilities, and Attention to the Affairs of the Society, leave no Poſſibility of ſuſpecting that he could either miſrepreſent, or miſtake, the Matter. And from his ſhort Account, theſe Things appear, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plan was not ſo properly rejected, as the Draught that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented—that the Draught was rejected, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Deſign of it was diſliked, but becauſe it was improperly framed—and, that the Rejection, whether juſtifiable or not, was not owing, in any Degree, to the Society. Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> another Member of the Society, after inquiring upon the Spot, goes farther, and ſays:
<q>I can affirm, on very good Authority, that neither the Society nor any Epiſcopalians, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> oppoſed the Act of the <hi>Boſton</hi> Aſſembly for the Purpoſe here mentioned. It was rejected merely on political and commercial Reaſons, which aroſe from the Manner of drawing it up, and were repreſented by the Board of Trade to the Privy-Council, who <hi>unanimouſly</hi> diſapproved it, when there was <hi>not one Biſhop preſent</hi>; as appears from the Council-Books<note n="§" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Review</hi> of Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s Remarks, p. 39.</note>.</q>
Now that Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> ſhould take no Notice at all of ſo clear and full an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Society's Innocence, with Regard to
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:011203_0208_0F9532744EFD4F90"/>
an Accuſation that bore ſo hard upon the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that moſt reſpectable Body—an Evidence, that carries double Conviction to thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s excellent and amiable Character, to which the Doctor can be no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but that notwithſtanding, he ſhould ſtill go on, from Pamphlet to Pamphlet, intimating black Suſpicions of Guilt, and throwing out Reproaches, founded at beſt upon diſtant hear-ſay, as if the Ballance of Proof were againſt the Society; is one of thoſe ſtrange, modern <hi>American Phoenomena</hi> which admit not of an eaſy Solution. The moſt natural and <hi>favorable</hi> Way of accounting for it perhaps, is to ſuppoſe that the Doctor wrote in ſuch a Hurry, both againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and the <hi>Appeal,</hi> as not to give himſelf Time to recollect many Things which materially concern his Subject. But I forbear.</p>

               <p>THE next Section of the <hi>Appeal</hi> contains
<q>the Plan on which alone <hi>American</hi> Biſhops have been requeſted, <hi>fairly</hi> ſtated,<note place="margin">SECT. VIII.</note> with Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on the Reaſonableneſs thereof.</q>
Dr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it, begins with taking Notice of what he calls, <hi>a Copy of the Petition that was ſent, by a Number of the epiſcopal Clergy, to the Univerſity of Cambridge,</hi> which had lately appeared in one of the <hi>public Papers</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi>; in which Copy there are ſeveral Expreſſions which he looks on as highly exceptionable. This Copy I have ſeen; its Editor and Annotator pretended that it was the Tranſcript of an Addreſs drawn up and ſent, by a Convention of the epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> But the Doctor muſt have ſince heard that the Convention diſclaims it; and I can and do aſſure him that it is fictitious and falſe, and that the Convention ſent home no ſuch Addreſs, nor any that contained ſimilar Expreſſions with thoſe which he cenſures.</p>
               <p>HE informs us, in p. 135, that <hi>ſome of the moſt reſpectable Epiſcopalians</hi> in New-England—<hi>have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be their Opinion, that Biſhops would be of no Service here, and that they did not deſire they ſhould be ſent.</hi> Whether he has any Thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in his Idea of <hi>reſpectable Epiſcopalians,</hi> and of <hi>a ſteady Attachment to the Intereſt of the Church of England,</hi> which he makes to be part of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:011203_0210_0F9532768EA04728"/>
and what we are to underſtand by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Word <hi>ſome,</hi> whether Two or Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, is impoſſible for me to ſay. He may have met with, or heard of, <hi>ſome, i. e.</hi> Two or more <hi>reſpectable Epiſcopalians,</hi> who were not deſirous of having Biſhops in <hi>America,</hi> meaning Biſhops with ſuch temporal Powers as they exerciſe in <hi>England:</hi> But I much queſtion whether there is an Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian upon the Continent, either of a more or leſs reſpectable Character, including in it ſome Degree of <hi>Attachment to the Intereſt of the Church,</hi> that has objected againſt an Epiſcopate upon the Plan of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> If there be any ſuch, I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that they have acted a very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, inconſiſtent Part. For how abſurd is it for a Man, who is attached to the Intereſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> not to wiſh it Soundneſs and Health? But how can it be ſound and healthy, while its Conſtitution is broken, and deprived of that which is eſſential to its Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Where can be the Harm of having epiſcopal Ordination adminiſtred in the Colonies?
<q>What is the Fear,</q>
from having the Clergy brought under a ſtricter Diſcipline? "What the Danger," in giving an Opportunity to ſuch as are deſirous of Confirmation, to receive it in this Country? Theſe are the ONLY Ends propoſed by an Epiſcopate; and every Epiſcopalian muſt allow that theſe are real Advantages. And ſince the Power of <hi>American</hi> Biſhops is to be confined to the Clergy of our own Church, and will bring no Burthen or Expence upon any Part of the Country, or upon Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; it is inconceivable that any Epiſcopalians ſhould not deſire it, excepting ſuch clerical Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents as fear, by Means of ſuch an Epiſcopate, to be brought to Puniſhment. For my Part, I have
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:011203_0211_0F9532772DE9B150"/>
met with no ſuch Epiſcopalians, nor have <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> heard of any ſuch: But on the other Hand, I have been told by <hi>many</hi> of the Diſſenters, and by <hi>ſeveral</hi> of their Clergy, and even by <hi>ſome</hi> of their Clergy belonging to <hi>New-England,</hi> that they thought it unreaſonable that any ſhould object to our Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
               <p>I MEET with nothing farther worthy of Notice, after what has been already animadverted on, until we come to p. 138. The Doctor there objects to our Plan, becauſe he thinks it has been illegally ſettled. He takes it for granted, that what has been done by our Friends and Superiors at Home relating to it, has been done without the King's Approbation. And he argues that it is inconſiſtent with <hi>the Conſtitution of the Church,</hi> and the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the <hi>King's Supremacy,</hi> to take ſuch a Step; and that <hi>even the</hi> CONVOCATION, <hi>when convened by the King's Writ, hath no Authority to ſettle any Plan without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor indeed ſo much as to</hi> ATTEMPT <hi>to form one without</hi> HIS LICENCE. What the Rights and Powers of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Convocation are, is not my Buſineſs to enquire; as it is not pretended that the Plan in Queſtion was ſettled in Convocation. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that the two Houſes of Convocation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Declaration of the upper Houſe in 1702, as quoted by the Doctor,
<q>without a royal Licence, have no Authority to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any CANON by whatever Name it might be called,</q>
which is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Statute of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Clergy, even in Convocation,
<q>are ſtill in ſeveral inferior Inſtances, left prefectly free<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Atterbury's Rights,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of an Engliſh Convocation,</hi> p. 132. See alſo <hi>Wake's State of the Church,</hi> p. 85,</note>.</q>
The two Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> cannot, without a
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:011203_0212_0F953277EFC85C60"/>
royal Licence, attempt, enact, promulge or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any <hi>Statute,</hi> more legally than the two Houſes of <hi>Convocation</hi> can enact a <hi>Canon</hi>; but I hope the Members both of Parliament and <hi>Convocation,</hi> whether legally convened, or not convened, as they happen to meet with one another, may confer upon and propoſe Plans for the public Good, and agree to carry them into Execution, as ſoon as the royal Licence ſhall permit them to act in their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Capacity. Every Aſſociation of <hi>diſaffected</hi> Perſons ought to be ſuppreſſed; but Conſultations for the public Happineſs, held by Perſons of the utmoſt Fidelity, with a due Deference and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Wiſdom of Government, will always be encouraged by prudent Princes, and under wiſe Adminiſtrations. If nothing farther than this, could be ſaid in Favor of thoſe who ſettled the Plan for an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate, it would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtify them: And the Doctor would have no Reaſon to cry out, as he does, p. 139, in the following ſupercilious Language: <hi>Is this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conduct, in any Degree, conformable to the conſtituted Order of the Church of England? Dare Biſhops, or even Archbiſhops, at home, venture upon a Method of acting ſo repugnant to the</hi> SUPREMACY <hi>in all eccleſiaſtical Matters, with which, by repeated Acts of Parliament, the</hi> CROWN <hi>has been veſted?</hi> That he is much miſtaken in his Notion of the King's Supremacy, as maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> has been already proved; that he is alſo miſtaken in his Notion of the general <hi>conſtituted Order</hi> of that Church, is too plain to require any Proof.</p>
               <p>HE has pronounced all Conſultations of our Biſhops for the Intereſt of Religion, to be, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:011203_0213_0F953278AF0FC678"/>
an Infringement of the King's Supremacy, unleſs a Licence for that Purpoſe is formally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Crown. But can any Man believe this to be true, in the Senſe wherein it is affirmed; and without any Exceptions? Suppoſing the King were made acquainted with the particular Subject of any ſuch Deliberation, and privately conſulted upon it, and he ſhould give undoubted Proofs of his Approbation of the Meaſure; would the Doctor ſtill call it an Infringement of the Supremacy? If not, neither ſhould he thus ſpeak of the Plan in Queſtion, as it has been honored in this Manner, with the royal Approbation. And here it may be proper to explain what has been before ſaid; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Plan was ſettled by thoſe, who were warranted by a royal Commiſſion conſtitutionally iſſued. The <hi>Charter</hi> granted to <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> has the Nature and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of a royal Commiſſion. By this Charter or Commiſſion, the Members are warranted to concert Meaſures and to <hi>ſettle Plans,</hi> for carrying on the Deſign of their Incorporation in the moſt effectual Manner. The Society ſoon ſaw, that an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate was highly expedient to this Purpoſe; they therefore ſketched out a general Plan for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops to <hi>America,</hi> which Plan was publickly approved and patronized by her Majeſty, Queen ANNE. Many Cauſes concured to delay the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, at that Time, and through the Two ſucceeding Reigns; but Marks of the royal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation were not wanting in either of them. Of late Years the Plan has been reſumed and digeſted with peculiar Attention, and our preſent moſt gracious Sovereign has given it particular Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Surely,</hi> after this Explanation the Doctor will not ſay, <hi>a Plan for an Epiſcopate thus formed,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011203_0214_0F9532796F67F0C8"/>
ſettled and publiſhed, ought to have no great Regard paid to it.</hi> For were it inconſiderable in itſelf, it is ſtill reſpectable on Account of its honorable Origin.</p>
               <p>IN p. 140, he goes on, fulminating againſt the Audaciouſneſs of thoſe Perſons, who ventured to form and encourage the Plan; and <hi>(Riſum tenea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis?)</hi> conſtrues it to be a <hi>direct Violation</hi> of the 73d CANON. The Canon injoins,
<q>that no Prieſts, or Miniſters of God's Word, nor any other Perſons ſhall meet together in any private Houſe, or elſewhere, to conſult upon any Matter or Courſe to be taken by them, or upon their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Direction by any others, which may any Way tend to the <hi>impeaching,</hi> or <hi>depraving</hi> of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of the Book of Common-Prayer, or of any Part of the Government or Diſcipline now eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under Pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication <hi>ipſo Facto.</hi>
                  </q>
Whoever knows any Thing of the Hiſtory of the Times in which the Canon was framed, muſt be ſenſible that it was <hi>deſigned</hi> againſt a very different Sort of Perſons from thoſe venerable Prelates, who formed and ſettled the Plan for an American Epiſcopate. And as it was deſigned againſt a different Sort of Perſons, ſo the Words of it <hi>clearly point out</hi> a very different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I know not but the Doctor may laugh at me, for <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> replying to what is evidently in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo <hi>highly extravagant, I might rather ſay, to a great Degree ludicrous</hi>; but yet I am really unable to determine, whether he was, or was not, ſerious himſelf, at the Time of his writing. However, on the favorable Suppoſition that he was ſerious, as I preſume he <hi>ought</hi> to have been, I will proceed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:011203_0215_0F95327A2CF4ED28"/>
—That what the Canon condemns, are fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Combinations and Conſultations which tend to <hi>impeach</hi> and <hi>deprave</hi> the Doctrine, Liturgy or Government of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the forming of the Plan for an <hi>American</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate has no ſuch Tendency, it comes not within the <hi>Words,</hi> any more than within the <hi>Intent</hi> of the Canon.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſays the Doctor, it is <hi>a Plan for altering the Government and Diſcipline of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the Colonies.</hi> Does he then believe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was intended to ſecure the Government and Diſcipline of the Church of England <hi>in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies?</hi> Without this Intention, the Propoſal of any Alteration of the Form of eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, can be no Violation of the Canon. But what is the Nature and Tendency of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration propoſed? Is it to <hi>deprave</hi> the Government of the Church of England <hi>at Home?</hi> No, it is in Reality to honor it, by endeavoring to bring the Government of the Church here much nearer to her Pattern and Example, than it is, or can be, while deſtitute of Biſhops. Nor is the Plan for a different <hi>Mode</hi> of an Epiſcopate for the Church of America, any <hi>Impeachment</hi> of that under which it exiſts in England. As to ſuch Externals, the Church of England has always allowed them to be Things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the Circumſtances and Opinions of different Countries, or even of the ſame Country in different Ages. To ſay therefore that Circumſtances in America require, or make it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that the <hi>Externals</hi> of an Epiſcopate ſhould be under a Regulation peculiar to this Country, is ſaying no more than the Church of England has
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:011203_0216_0F95327C41380EB8"/>
always, in Effect, ſaid and implies no Reflection upon the Eſtabliſhment at home, which alſo may be beſt fitted for a Church ſituated as the national Church is in England.</p>
               <p>IN p. 141, the Doctor, although he is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he <hi>might be reaſonably excuſed from taking any farther Notice of this Plan, as it is, not only deſtitute of all Authority, but comes</hi> HANDED TO CONSIDERATION, <hi>in evident Contradiction to it</hi>; yet, upon the whole, thinks proper to <hi>go on, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly mention the Objections</hi> WE <hi>have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to make againſt it.</hi> Here then the moſt eſſential Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his Publication comes forward; in which, he not only lays out his own Strength, but calls in to his Aid what was POWERFULLY <hi>offered by the late excellent Dr. Mayhew.</hi> His own Objections he diſtinguiſhes, ranges and numbers, as follows.</p>
               <p>OBJECT. 1. <hi>THE Government and Diſcipline of the Church of England under the propoſed American Epiſcopate, is injurious, both to the Church, and the Biſhops that are to preſide over it.</hi> But how is it <hi>injurious</hi> to the Church? Why, it ſeems, by the Limitation of the Biſhops Authority to the Clergy, ſo that it ſhall not operate on the Laity. But if the Laity are not to be affected by the Biſhops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they are certainly not to be injured by it; that which does not operate at all, producing no Effect, either injurious or beneficial. With Regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Exerciſe of Diſcipline over the Laity, no Benefit is propoſed, and no Injury is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but with Regard to the Government of the Clergy, much Advantage is propoſed, expected and foreſeen; ſo that in this Reſpect, and upon the whole, the Plan is not <hi>injurious,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, to the American Church. Why no farther
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011203_0217_0F95327C6DA9C608"/>
Diſcipline is to be exerciſed over the Laity when Biſhops ſhall be appointed, has been ſhewn in a former Section, and need not be repeated here. It is thought by much better Judges than either the Doctor or myſelf, that it will be more advantageous to the American Church, to leave the Laity as they are, than to introduce any Degree or Species of Diſcipline over them, with which Americans are unacquainted.</p>
               <p>THE propoſed Plan is repreſented as <hi>injurious to the Biſhops</hi> themſelves, becauſe thereby <hi>they are, in a meer arbitrary Manner, reſtrained in the Exerciſe of that Authority, which properly belongs to them, both by the apoſtolic Appointment, and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of England,</hi> p. 143. But if ſuch a Reſtraint is not injurious to the Church, it will be difficult to prove that it can be injurious to the Biſhops. Are we to conſider the Authority of Biſhops as ſo much <hi>private Property,</hi> which belongs to them, and every Limitation of it as ſo much <hi>Damage</hi> ſuſtained by the Biſhops? And yet, unleſs we conſider it under ſome ſuch Idea, I ſee not how it can be made out, that any prudent Reſtraints of their Authority can be an Injury to them. He that is fond of exerciſing Power for the Sake of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing it, without regarding whether it tends to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification or Deſtruction, is unworthy of it.</p>
               <p>OBJECT. 2. <hi>THE Biſhops in this Plan, are ſo widely different from the Biſhops of the Church of England, that it is not reaſonable they ſhould either be deſired, or ſent,</hi> p. 144. The Biſhops in this Plan, are eſſentially the ſame with the Biſhops at Home, how widely ſoever they may differ in ſome Circumſtances. But let them be never ſo different,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:011203_0218_0F95327D2DE999E0"/>
if ſuch Biſhops as are propoſed are fitter for the Colonies than ſuch Biſhops as are in England, and the Doctor will hardly ſay that they are not; then, it may be reaſonable that they ſhould be both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſent. This I take to be a full and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to the Objection as it ſtands; and what has been before ſaid, I take to be a ſufficient Anſwer to all the Doctor has offered under this Head, excepting one Conſideration, in p. 146, which may require more particular Notice. The Conſideration is this: That <hi>if Biſhops ſhould be ſent to the Colonies with theſe reſtrained Powers, undeſirable Conſequences might be naturally feared, both here, and at home.</hi> The Conſequence to be feared here, he tells us, is, that our Biſhops would be uneaſy under ſuch a Reſtraint, and <hi>be diſpoſed to throw it off as ſoon as might be.</hi> But was it ever before offered as a Reaſon why exorbitant Power ſhould not be limited, (and ſuch the Doctor eſteems to be the Power of Biſhops in England) becauſe the Perſons curtailed would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to throw off the Reſtraint, as ſoon as may be? But why are we to ſuppoſe, that the American Biſhops will be uneaſy under ſuch a Limitation of their Power, as the Plan ſpecifies? Thoſe who have been in actual Poſſeſſion, or even in Expectation, of any great and extenſive Power, will naturally be uneaſy under any remarkable Abridgment of it; but this will not be the Caſe of our American Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Whatever Powers or Privileges they ſhall once poſſeſs, by Virtue of their Office, they will continue to hold, as long as they ſhall remain in the Office; and as they will know the Terms before they accept of it, there can be no Diſappointment. And why ſhould they be uneaſy, becauſe the Biſhops at home are inveſted with civil Authority? The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops at home may as properly be uneaſy and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:011203_0219_0F95327DED8DE168"/>
becauſe they are not, like ſome of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſovereign Princes. Perhaps the Uneaſineſs of the American Biſhops may be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the Reflection, that deſtitute as they are of civil Power, they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the ſame Church with their Brethren in <hi>England.</hi> But they will not be able to avoid the farther Reflection, that they are Biſhops of the ſame Church in <hi>different</hi> Countries, and under <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Circumſtances; which eſſentially alters the Caſe. And no better Reaſon can be given, why they ſhould not be contented with leſs Power than belongs to the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> than why the other Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> ſhould not be contented with leſs Power than belongs to the Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> This ſame Kind of reaſoning would operate as ſtrongly againſt epiſcopal <hi>Clergymen</hi> in America, as againſt Biſhops. The Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at home, are, in a great Meaſure, ſupported by Tythes; therefore, it may be ſaid, if Clergymen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are once admitted in this Country, under whatever Reſtrictions and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, they will not be eaſy, until they ſhall have ſecured to themſelves the Tythes of our Eſtates.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor alſo mentions Two ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be feared at Home: One is, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there who diſlike the preſent Power of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, will be apt to be clamorous, and to make Diſturbances, when they ſhall find that an Epiſcopate is ſettled here in the Form that they deſire, while they are refuſed the like Indulgence in <hi>England.</hi> The Reader can hardly avoid remarking, that here, and in many other Places, the Doctor forgets his proper Buſineſs and Character. His Buſineſs is
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:011203_0220_0F95327EB043D9A8"/>
to anſwer the <hi>Appeal</hi> upon the Principles of the Diſſenters; but inſtead of this, he frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to raiſe Difficulties and Objections, which cannot properly be made but upon Principles op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his own, and of thoſe whom he repreſents in this Controverſy. This ſhews the Diſpoſition with which he undertook to oppoſe the Epiſcopate in Queſtion, and that he came prepared with a Reſolution to object <hi>at any Rate,</hi> rather than not to object at all. It will never be admitted as an Objection <hi>coming from the Diſſenters</hi> here or in <hi>England,</hi> that many at Home will grow more cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous againſt the preſent Power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, in Conſequence of the Settlement of ſuch an Epiſcopate here as is propoſed for the Colonies. But ſhould the Objection be made by any who have a Right to make it, it is ſufficient to refer them to what has been already ſaid to the Purpoſe, viz. That ſuch an Epiſcopate may be erected here with Eaſe; but it cannot be effected in <hi>England,</hi> without ſubverting an Eſtabliſhment, and making a very viſible Alteration in the national Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—a Work never to be undertaken but in the greateſt Extremity, and even then, not without a trembling Hand.</p>
               <p>THE other ill Conſequence ſuggeſted is, that the Biſhops in England will be jealous, that an Invaſion of their Authority is farther intended. In Reply to which, I will only remind the Doctor of one Circumſtance which he happened to forget; namely, that this very Plan has been formed and introduced by thoſe Biſhops themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſhould they be jealous that any Invaſion of their Power is therein intended, they muſt be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that they have intended to invade it themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:011203_0221_0F95327F6EFF3830"/>OBJECT. 3. <hi>THE Church of England knows no ſuch Biſhops as are ſpecified in this is Plan, nor can they in Conſiſtency with its Conſtitution, be ſent to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi> p. 149. This Objection, and all that has been offered to ſupport it, has been fully anſwered already.</p>
               <p>OBJECT. 4. <hi>WE are, in Principle, againſt all civil Eſtabliſhments in Religion; and as we do not deſire any ſuch Eſtabliſhment in Support of our own religious Sentiments, or Practice, we cannot reaſonably be blamed, if we are not diſpoſed to encourage one in Favor of the epiſcopal Coloniſts,</hi> p. 152. If by WE, the Doctor means thoſe of the congregational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion in New-England in general, the Objection contains an Article of Intelligence that is to me NEW. That ſome particular Writers among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Denominations of Diſſenters, both in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and in this Country, have expreſſed a Diſlike of all religious Eſtabliſhments, I well know; but I have been of Opinion, that a large Majority of thoſe ſeveral Perſuaſions, excepting the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quakers, notwithſtanding the Declamations that have been publiſhed againſt Eſtabliſhments in the groſs, had always a Reſerve in Favor of the Eſtabliſhment of their <hi>own</hi> Religion. The Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth
<q>did not deſire a Toleration, but the <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of their own Scheme; <hi>ſuch</hi> an Eſtabliſhment of it as would have kept <hi>all</hi> others, in particular the Lutherans, and the Friends of Edward's Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, out of the Church; and as they did not deſire a Toleration for themſelves, ſo they <hi>would not grant it to others.</hi> The full Eſtabliſhment of their own Plan, abſolute and univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with it, without any Favor or Indulgence,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:011203_0222_0F95328031578FB0"/>
was what they wrote for, and earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to obtain<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Maddox</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Neal,</hi> p. 110.</note>.</q>
In the laſt Century, when they were able to ſeize upon the Power of the State, they preſſed it into their Service, and according to the Doctrine of their Fathers, an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> without a Toleration was urged and practiced, as a Matter of indiſpenſible Duty. The Doctor's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors and mine, who planted themſelves in New-England, brought with them the ſame Principles; upon which they made farther Improvements, not ſuffering even thoſe of their own Perſuaſion, except they were <hi>in full Communion</hi> with them, to enjoy ſome of the moſt eſſential Rights of Engliſhmen. The Preſbyterians in Scotland, and the Calviniſts in Geneva, Holland and other Places, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been Friends to religious Eſtabliſhments, and ſtrenuous Advocates for the Magiſtrate's Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>true</hi> Religion. And I imagine, from certain hiſtorical Accounts and authentic Anecdotes in my Poſſeſſion, that it muſt have been within a very few Years only, that the Doctor's PRINCIPLE, <hi>againſt all civil Eſtabliſhments in Religion,</hi> has been generally adopted New-England, if it has been adopted at all.</p>
               <p>I INTIRELY agree with him, that if he, and thoſe of his Perſuaſion, <hi>do not deſire an Eſtabliſhment in Support of</hi> their own <hi>religious Sentiments,</hi> they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be blamed, if</hi> they <hi>are not diſpoſed to encourage one in Favor of the epiſcopal Coloniſts.</hi> They are not deſired to do this; nay, when it ſhall appear that the American Epiſcopalians endeavour to introduce any farther Eſtabliſhment of the Church in the Colonies, than it now has, I will not blame them if they <hi>oppoſe</hi> it, provided the Oppoſition be
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:011203_0223_0F953280EFFE1648"/>
made <hi>fairly,</hi> and they confine themſelves within the Limits of <hi>Truth, Candor</hi> and <hi>Decency.</hi> After all, what has the Caſe of religious Eſtabliſhments to do with the Plan for an American Epiſcopate, which has been offered to the Public? Does this Plan propoſe an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the Church? Will the Execution of it imply, or amount to, any ſuch Thing? Will the Introduction of Biſhops, who
<q>ſhall have no Authority, but purely of a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eccleſiaſtical Nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State</q>
—whoſe
<q>Authority ſhall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity, nor upon Diſſenters of any Denomination</q>
— who
<q>ſhall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whether civil or religious, of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Diſſenters</q>
—who
<q>in particular, ſhall have no Concern with the Probate of Wills, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Guardianſhip and Adminiſtration, or Marriage-Licences, nor be Judges of any Caſes relating thereto</q>
but who
<q>ſhall only exerciſe the original Powers of their Office, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordain and govern the Clergy, and adminiſter Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to thoſe who ſhall deſire it;</q>
I ſay, will the Introduction of ſuch Biſhops as theſe (and no others are propoſed in the Plan, or intended by its Advocates) amount to an Eſtabliſhment? Nay, can it have any more Effect againſt the civil or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Privileges of the Coloniſts, than againſt thoſe of the <hi>Crim Tartars?</hi> If not; then whatever has been offered upon this Subject in Anſwer to the Plan, by the Doctor or others, and much has been offered by all that have written againſt it, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely foreign from the Point, and has no Manner of Connection with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:011203_0224_0F953281B2C75420"/>FOR this Reaſon I ſhall paſs over what is ſaid, in p. 153, about the general <hi>Right</hi> of States to make religious Eſtabliſhments, with this Obſervation; that the ſame Argument, with which the Doctor endeavours to overthrow it, is as forcible againſt the <hi>Right</hi> of private Judgment. This will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from the following Experiment. <hi>If a</hi> Perſon <hi>in England has this Right, muſt it not be owned, that</hi> a Perſon <hi>in China, in Turkey, in Spain, has this</hi> Right <hi>alſo? What ſhould make the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Eye of true Reaſon?</hi> Have Perſons <hi>in England been diſtinguiſhed by Heaven by any peculiar Grant, beyond</hi> Perſons <hi>in other Countries? If</hi> they have, <hi>let the Grant be produced. If</hi> they have <hi>not, all</hi> Perſons <hi>have, in common, the ſame</hi> Right. <hi>And as they muſt ſeverally be ſuppoſed to exert this</hi> Right, in forming <hi>their own Sentiments in Religion; what can the Conſequence be, but infinite Damage to the Cauſe of God and true Religion? And ſuch in Fact has been the Conſequence of</hi> this pretended Right of <hi>private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all Ages, and in all Places. What Abſurdities in Sentiment, and ridiculous Follies, not to ſay, groſs Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities in Practice,</hi> have been occaſioned by the Exerciſe of this Right; <hi>in ſome or other Nations of the Earth?</hi> Thus the Reader ſees the Force of the Doctor's Argument <hi>againſt</hi> Eſtabliſhments; if he chooſes to ſee what can be ſaid <hi>in Favor</hi> of them, let him conſult, among other Authors, Biſhop Warburton'<hi>s, Alliance between the Church and the State,</hi> Dr. Stebbing<hi>'s Eſſay concerning civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Dr. Rogers'<hi>s Vindication of the civil Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,</hi> Biſhop Ellys <hi>on ſpiritual Liberty,</hi> Tract III, and a late elegant <hi>Eſſay on Eſtabliſhments in Religion,</hi> in Anſwer to the <hi>Cofeſſional.</hi>

                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:011203_0225_0F9532826F569760"/>OBJECT. 5. <hi>THE Church of England in the Colonies, in its comparative low State, inſtead of an Epiſcopate, upon this Plan, or any other, needs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the charitable Aſſiſtance of its Friends to ſupport its preſent Miniſters, and others that are ſtill wanted,</hi> p. 154. The Doctor forgets, that the Church of England in ſeveral of the Colonies, is not in that <hi>comparative low State</hi> he here ſpeaks of; but is able to ſupport and does ſupport, its Miniſters in general, as amply as any Set of Clergymen are ſupported in the Britiſh Dominions. But ſuppoſing it were otherwiſe, and that the Church throughout the Colonies need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>charitable Aſſiſtance of its Friends to ſupport its Miniſters,</hi> as is aſſumed in the Objection; yet this would be no Proof, that it does not alſo need an Epiſcopate. The <hi>deplorable Sadneſs of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous State of Things in North-Carolina,</hi> where there are ſo few Clergymen, inſtead of anſwering the Objector's Purpoſe, is, on the contrary, a ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove the Neceſſity of American Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Charity, which might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Maintenance of as many Miſſionaries as would be needful there, would be ſwallowed up by one Biſhop only. And would this ſo much tend to the Honor of God, and the Good of Souls, as if it was expended in Support of Miſſions that are really neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary?</hi> It is ſurprizing to ſee what <hi>Advantages</hi> are claimed by ſome People; how <hi>they can make Uſe of the ſame Argument to contrary Purpoſes!</hi> When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ends are to be anſwered, the Writers againſt the Church can tell us, that the Society have no Power to apply their Funds to other Uſes than were intended by the Donors—that
<q>the Money given muſt be looked upon as ſtrictly appropriated by the pious Donors to particular Uſes; and may
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:011203_0226_0F9532832E117500"/>
not on any Pretence, be diverted to other and different Uſes, though thoſe other Uſes may ſeem to have Something pious and charitable in their Nature<note n="*" place="bottom">

—that the Society are <hi>Stewards,</hi> and that
<q>Stewards are not allowed to uſe the Goods or Money with which they are intruſted, but for thoſe Ends and Purpoſes for which they are committed to them. If they knowingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to any others, however good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are unfaithful in their Truſt<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <hi>But now an Eſpiſcopate is in View,</hi> it is thought reaſonable and juſt, that the Society ſhould alienate a Fund, <hi>more</hi> ſtrictly appropriated to a particular Uſe than any other in their Power, (for this may be truly ſaid of the Fund for the Support of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Biſhops) and expend it upon Miſſionaries to be ſent to Carolina, or other Places, provided always that ſuch Places be at a due Diſtance from New-England. But as the Society have never acted the Part of <hi>unfaithful Stewards</hi> in other Caſes, we can be under no Apprehenſions that they will in this.</p>
               <p>IN p. 155. the Doctor repreſents the Church of England in the Northern Colonies, as having <hi>grown but little in Compariſon with the other Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Chriſtians.</hi> If this were really the Caſe, it would not be ſtrange, ſince it might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be accounted for, from the peculiar Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes to which the Church in the Colonies has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſubject; and whether it is the Caſe or not, the Plea for an Epiſcopate is exactly the ſame, it being not founded on the <hi>comparative</hi> Increaſe on the Church, but on its preſent State, with Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:011203_0227_0F953285678F6160"/>
both to the Numbers it now contains, and the Neceſſities it is under. But I conceive he muſt be miſtaken, as to the Fact. In Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey and New-York, I will not be poſitive that the Church has increaſed beyond the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Denominations, for 50 Years paſt. In ſome particular Towns and Diſtricts it undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has, but perhaps in others it may have propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably decreaſed. But in the New-England Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, it appears from good Accounts, that the Church has conſiderably increaſed, and that the Number of its Profeſſors at this Day bears a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Proportion to the Number of Inhabitants, than it ever has before. I may be miſtaken with Regard to ſome of the New-England Colonies; but my Opinion is founded upon credible Report, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by this Argument—that it is a common Thing there, for Families of Diſſenters to conform to the Church; whereas it ſeldom happens that a Family is known to leave the Church, and join with the Diſſenters. But as to Connecticut, of which I can judge from my own Obſervation, the Church has increaſed there moſt amazingly, for 20 or 30 Years paſt. I cannot at preſent recollect an Example, in any Age or Country, wherein ſo great a Proportion of Proſelytes has been made to any Religion in ſo ſhort a Time, as has been made to the Church of England in the Weſtern Diviſion of that populous Colony; unleſs where the Power of Miracles or the Arm of the Magiſtrate was exerted to produce that Effect. This Progreſs of the Church has greatly alarmed the more rigid Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in New-England; and however the good Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may affect to deſpiſe it, I think that I can diſcover, in ſome of his late Writings, that he is not a little alarmed by it himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:011203_0228_0F953285CC150098"/>IN p. 157, he intimates, that it is not prudent yet a while for us to <hi>deſire an Epiſcopate,</hi> ſince it <hi>will be attended with a vaſt Charge, which muſt be defrayed ſome Way or other.</hi> If Americans were to ſupport the Epiſcopate, and are not yet able, it were wrong in them, I will not ſay, to <hi>deſire,</hi> but to requeſt it. But this is not to be the Caſe. And ſince there is an appropriated Fund for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which will go far towards defraying the <hi>Charge</hi>—ſince there is no Reaſon to doubt but it will be ſufficiently augmented by voluntary Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—and eſpecially, ſince the Doctor and his Friends are not to be taxed to raiſe it to a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>they</hi> have no Cauſe to be uneaſy on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Under this Head he argues againſt an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate, from the American Church's being yet in its <hi>Infancy</hi>—in ſuch a feeble State as not to be <hi>able to ſtand upon its own Legs</hi>—and, in ſhort, as being ſo far from <hi>a State of Maturity, as</hi> not <hi>to make it</hi> WORTH WHILE <hi>for a Biſhop to come here.</hi> But infant and feeble as She is, he has allowed that She my be 270,000 ſtrong in the Colonies, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the Iſlands, after reducing her Numbers as low as poſſible. Now can he poſſibly think, when he allows himſelf Time for Conſideration, that the Church of England in America, containing 270,000 Members (beſides many Thouſands more in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands) in which are included moſt of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and principal Perſons in the Colonies, is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that it is not <hi>worth while</hi> for a Biſhop to take Charge of it? Would he look upon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Number of any People upon Earth, however low in their Circumſtances, or however light when weighed in the political Ballance, in ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Light?</p>
               <p>

But before he makes this <hi>Exit,</hi> he complains that I ſuffered what was <hi>wrote in Anſwer to this very Plan,</hi> by Dr. Mayhew, to lie unanſwered, without having <hi>liſped a Word in Reply to him.</hi> This Appearance is againſt me, I freely confeſs. It was the profeſſed Buſineſs of the <hi>Appeal</hi> to obviate and remove Objections againſt an American Epiſcopate, and Dr. Mayhew was too conſiderable a Writer to be overlooked. But the DEFENCES of his <hi>Obſervations</hi> I had not then ſeen; and although I made much Inquiry, and ſent as far as into Connecticut, I was unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them. I was told however by one that had read them, that they contained nothing material upon the Subject, but what had been ſufficiently anſwered by Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> and nothing but what I had conſidered in the Courſe of my Papers; upon which Information I proceeded to publiſh. This Excuſe I now offer to the Public, not doubting of its being candidly accepted. But what Excuſe can Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> make, for taking no Notice of what was <hi>powerfully offered</hi> by Mr. Apthorp, in Anſwer to theſe very Objections of Dr. Mayhew, and for <hi>not having liſped a Word in Reply to him?</hi> Was it treating his Readers generouſly, or fairly, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, to preſent them with Dr. Mayhew's Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, broadly hinting, although not directly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they had not been anſwered; when he muſt have known, that they had not only been anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, but that no Reply had been made to the Anſwer? Unleſs ſome ſatisfactory Account ſhall

be given of this Conduct, he muſt bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, as well as he can.</p>
               <p>BEFORE he introduces Dr. Mayhew, he <hi>ſuggeſts an Expedient to compromiſe Matters between Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, and other Denominations, in the Colonies,</hi> p. 158. The Expedient is, that the King ſhould grant a Commiſſion to ſome of the epiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy here, to perform all the Offices of a Biſhop. Every plauſible Expedient for compromiſing Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the various Denominations of Chriſtians, ought to be attended to; but Plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity cannot be predicated of this. It can neither anſwer the Ends of the Epiſcopalians, nor even thoſe of the Projector and his Adherents. The Powers wanted by the American Church are
<q>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſpiritual Nature,</q>
which therefore the King cannot give; ſuch Authority as can be given by the King, is altogether <hi>temporal,</hi> which is the very Thing that the Diſſenters dread: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopalians nor Diſſenters, can poſſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Expedient.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now lay before the Reader Mr. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp's Reply to what has been produced from Dr. Mayhew on the Subject; firſt begging that worthy Gentleman's Pardon, for making free with his Property.</p>

               <p>"SUCCESSIVE Propoſals for American Biſhops have been made at different Times, through a long Courſe of Years, by Men of high Rank and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the Church; and are ready now for the Peruſal of any worthy Perſon, who ſhall declare himſelf unſatisfied in this Point: All which agree with what the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has avered. One of them perhaps may have peculiar Weight with the Doctor; I mean that made in the Year 1750, by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Biſhop BUTLER, in the Doctor's own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

This Scheme, with which the Writer was favored by a Gentleman of Diſtinction in <hi>Boſton,</hi> is <hi>in the Biſhop's own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,</hi> of which the following is an exact Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript."</p>
               <p n="1">I.
<q>THAT no coercive Power is deſired over the Laity in any Caſe; but only a Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Behavior of the Clergy who are in epiſcopal Orders; and to correct and puniſh them according to the Law of the Church of England, in Caſe of Miſbehavior or Neglect of Duty, with ſuch Powers as the Commiſſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad have exerciſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II.

               </p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV.
<q>No Biſhops are intended to be ſettled in Places where the Government is in the Hands of Diſſenters, as in New-England, &amp;c. But Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be given, ONLY to ordain Clergy for ſuch Church of England Congregations as are among them, and to inſpect into the Manners and Behavior of the ſaid Clergy, and to confirm the Members thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"THIS Plan is ſo exactly ſimilar to that in the <hi>Anſwer to</hi> Dr. Mayhew'<hi>s Obſervations,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, they are the ſame, and that it is the only one intended to be put in Execution. And it is ſuch a ſimple and beautiful Model of the moſt ancient and moderate Epiſcopacy, that it ſhould, not only remove all the Doctor's Apprehenſions, but the Scruples of every rational and learned Diſſenter againſt that apoſtolic Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
               <p>"SUPPOSING this to be the real Scheme, the Doctor owns that it ſets the Matter in a leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Point of View, than he had ſeen it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Yet he cannot forbear going 50 Years back, to ridicule ſome harmleſs, though ill-choſen, Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in which the Subſtance of it is expreſſed; and expoſe to ſcorn, with burleſque Gravity, what he calls a Matter
<q>ſo ſublime, myſterious and ſacred, as the Impoſition of the Biſhop's Hands.</q>
Yet,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:011203_0233_0F9532892F4FD8D0"/>
he well knows, or eaſily may, that we aſcribe no more Efficacy to the laying on of Biſhops' Hands, than his Brethren do to the laying on of Preſbyters' Hands. And if we apprehend ourſelves bound to admit it in one Office, which they have rejected, I mean Confirmation; we may indeed be miſtaken in it, but ſurely cannot be Objects of Deriſion for it. The ſame is the Caſe of epiſcopal Ordination, and epiſcopal Viſitation of the Clergy of our Church. We think them all appointed, and uſeful to us: We are ſure they are injurious to no other Perſons. And therefore according to thoſe Principles, for which the Doctor avows the warmeſt Zeal; we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to have theſe Offices performed for us by Perſons of that Order, to which we conceive they are committed: Elſe, we do not enjoy
<q>that full entire Liberty in religious Matters,</q>
which the Doctor deſires for himſelf, and
<q>which all Men, whoſe Principles or Practices are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Safety of Society, he ſays, have a Right to enjoy.</q>
He tells us indeed, that we do enjoy it without American Biſhops, "though under ſome <hi>Inconveniences,</hi>" as he gently calls them. The BUFFOONERY that immediately follows, in Order to prevent any Compaſſion for our Caſe, I omit. So he thinks we are poſſeſſed ſufficiently of the whole Exerciſe of our Religion, becauſe our young People may be confirmed, and Clergymen ordained for us, and properly inſpected afterwards; provided they will all go from Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca to Europe for theſe Purpoſes. Can the Doctor ſay with a good Conſcience, that Liberty like this is all that he ſhould deſire for himſelf and his Brethren? Let me intreat him to read over again ſome Words of his <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> to which he has made no Reply: Whether, becauſe they deſerve
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:011203_0234_0F953289F00D6C10"/>
none, or becauſe they admit of none, let others judge.
<q>The American Diſſenters from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, would think it inſupportably grievous to have no Miniſters but ſuch as received Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in England or Ireland; or to be withheld from the Uſe of any religious Rite, which they eſteemed as highly as we do Confirmation; or to have their Churches deſtitute of a Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, which they conceived to be of apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtitution. <hi>I</hi> ſhould in ſuch a Caſe be a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Advocate for them, as not yet enjoying the full Toleration to which they had a Right. And ſurely they ought to aſk their Conſciences very ſeriouſly, why they oppoſe our Application for ſuch Indulgence, as they would claim for themſelves; and whether indeed ſuch Oppoſition is not downright Perſecution; and that, in a Matter merely ſpiritual, without the Mixture of any temporal Concern.</q>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> p. 60.</p>
               <p>"THE Doctor, ſtill flying to Ridicule in Defect of Argument, intimates, how much the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians in America need to be <hi>well ruled</hi> and <hi>governed,</hi>—how much the Clergy need to be <hi>united,</hi> and reduced <hi>to Order.</hi> On which I would only obſerve, that the American Clergy are known to be unanimous in their Wiſhes to be under the immediate Inſpection of Biſhops reſident among them: Which Concurrence implies quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a preſent diſorderly State of that Clergy; who are perhaps, as faithful to their Truſt, and as blameleſs in their Manners, as any Body of Men in the Chriſtian Miniſtry."</p>
               <p>"HE ſays, that great Inconveniences are likely to follow from the ſending Biſhops to America.
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:011203_0235_0F95328AAEDBFCA8"/>
But he ſays alſo,
<q>It is readily owned that our Apprehenſion of what may poſſibly or probably be the Conſequences of it, ought not to put us on infringing the religious Liberty of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects and Chriſtian Brethren.</q>
Nay, he adds,
<q>neither have we any Power to do ſo; if we were <hi>unreaſonable and wicked enough to deſire it</hi>; our Charter granting ſuch Liberty to <hi>all Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi>
                  </q>
Therefore, Biſhops may, by that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſettle even in New-England. And if the having Biſhops among them be Part of the religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Epiſcopalians, as it evidently is; the Diſſenters ought not to oppoſe it on Account of apprehended Conſequences: Much leſs ought they to oppoſe the Settlement of them in other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, totally independent on New-England; or their reſorting to the New-England Epiſcopalians occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. For any Thing of this Kind would be <hi>doing evil</hi> on Pretence <hi>that good may come</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> III.8.</note>."</p>
               <p>
                  <q>BUT why are bad Conſequences apprehended? Biſhops, he tells us, are ambitious and unquiet.</q>
But ſo are Preſbyters, and all Sorts of Men too often. Biſhops partake of juſt the ſame Nature with the Reſt of the Species: And the Doctor will own, that they are now, and long have been, as quiet an Order of Men, as any in his Nation. But who knows whether they will continue ſo? And who can know with Certainty any ſuch Thing concerning any Perſons whatever? Who knows whether the New-Englanders will not <hi>hang Quakers</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See the excellent and truly Honourable Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s Hiſt. of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> p. 187, 196, 320.</note> and Witches again? But why ſhould either be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The Clergy of England are in general Friends
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:011203_0236_0F95328B6E456DB0"/>
to religious Freedom: The People of England, Whigs and Tories, are unfavorable to clerical Power; and a far greater Danger, than the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's imaginary one, is, that of their laying aſide all Regard to the Chriſtian Miniſtry, in every Shape, and to Chriſtianity itſelf. Surely then, there never was ſo little Proſpect, that a Spirit of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Intolerance would revive here. Or if it ſhould, it might not extend to New-England; for it did not, in the Reigns of JAMES and CHARLES the Firſt. But even ſuppoſing it to reach thither, its Effects would be very little diminiſhed by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of no Biſhops being already placed in America. They might ſoon be ſent, and with much greater Authority than is aſked for them now; <hi>and perhaps with ſome</hi> RESENTMENT <hi>at the Oppoſition made to them before.</hi> But the whole Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is groundleſs. The Engliſh Diſſenters, who have Six and Twenty Biſhops eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, fear no Harm from them. Why then ſhould the New-England Diſſenters fear any, if one or two ſhould be eſtabliſhed, with much leſs Power, in one or two neighboring Provinces? Thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are not inhabited by Bigots; far from it. Governors, Aſſemblies, Diſſenters, nay Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and even Clergymen, would be all on their Guard againſt epiſcopal Encroachments. Add to this, that ſo public a Declaration as has been made of the Model of Epiſcopacy, propoſed to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in America, will itſelf be an effectual Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt any undue Extenſion of eccleſiaſtical Power; of which the Doctor affects to be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive."—</p>
               <p>"BUT he has one Objection againſt Biſhops in our Colonies, which I had almoſt overlooked. He
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:011203_0237_0F95328C305A0D40"/>
knows not how they are to be <hi>maintained.</hi>
                  <q>Nor, as he thinks, will they run this Riſque, unleſs they have more Faith in God, and leſs Love to the World, than moſt of their Order have had, ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great became a <hi>nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to the Church, and the pious maternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> ſuckled her with the clear and pure, the uncorrupt and <hi>ſincere Milk</hi> of <hi>Homoöuſianity,</hi> that ſhe might grow <hi>thereby.</hi>
                  </q>
One might be at a Loſs to find out the Aſſociation of Ideas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Maintenance of Biſhops in <hi>America.</hi> We can only ſuppoſe that the Doctor has an equal Love for them both. But if no proper Maintenance can be found for them, he needs not be uneaſy at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſending them: And that it is not to be at the Expence of the Colonies, he has ſeen in Biſhop <hi>Butler</hi>'s Scheme, with which the others agree."</p>
               <p>"HE imagines that appointing Biſhops for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, would probably increaſe the epiſcopal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there; and then great Evils might follow. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern in what other Way it can increaſe that Party, than by ſupplying them more eaſily with a competent Number of Miniſters; taking Care that thoſe Miniſters ſhould be diligent and exemplary; and promoting an early Senſe of Piety among their young People. Theſe are no Evils; and what can one or two Biſhops, on a Continent 600 Miles long, do beſides? The Doctor ſays indeed, that Pretexts might eaſily be found for enlarging their Powers, and increaſing their Number. But enlarging their Powers would immediately raiſe a Clamour that could not be withſtood. If a few Biſhops proved diſagreeable, more would not be added. And though they ſhould prove agreeable
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:011203_0238_0F95328CEE0FDAD8"/>
and uſeful; more would be ſent, only to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as choſe them. In the ſhort Stay which one of them would chooſe to make in New-England, he could not bring over many Perſons to our Church. And therefore how terrible Things ſoever Epiſcopalians, if they ſhould become the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may attempt and perform there, they will be almoſt, if not quite, as likely to accompliſh, without ever ſeeing a Biſhop among them, as with ſeeing one now and then. But indeed there is very little Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their ever becoming the Majority there; and ſtill leſs, of their carrying Points in their own Favor, as the Doctor fancies they may, while they continue a Minority; for all Parties, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themſelves, will be ſure to unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Nay, had they Power, there is no Reaſon to think they would be oppreſſive; for they are not oppreſſive in the Colonies where they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have it: Or that they would attempt—for they could not, with any Modeſty, or any Hope of Succeſs—ſuch Laws againſt the Diſſenters, as the Diſſenters have not attempted againſt them. And if the Zeal of the New-England Clergy threatens any Danger, Biſhops would temper it, as they have done in England, inſtead of inflaming it. Therefore upon the whole, I hope the Doctor will, on conſidering farther, endeavor to reconcile our Countrymen to their Admiſſion: A Requeſt, in my Opinion, ſomewhat more reaſonable than his, that the Society ſhould reconcile the Members of our Church to being contented <hi>without</hi> epiſcopal MINISTERS<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s REVIEW of Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s REMARKS on the ANSWER to his <hi>Obſervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society,</hi> &amp;c. p. 54—62.</note>."</p>

                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:011203_0239_0F95328F06F99560"/>AT Length Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> re-enters, telling us, p. 178, that <hi>it is evident by this Time, that Objections can be offered againſt ſuch a Plan as has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi> To which it is a ſufficient Reply, that it is alſo evident BY THIS TIME, that thoſe Objections can within a much ſmaller Compaſs, be anſwered and confuted.</p>
               <p>I AM unable to account for ſo great a Confuſion of Ideas, as diſcovers itſelf in the two next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs. The Doctor ſeems very ſtrenuouſly to deny, that the Church of England in America has any RIGHT to the Epiſcopate propoſed: But then he declares himſelf perfectly willing that we ſhould have it—chooſing perhaps that it ſhould be granted us as a Matter of Favor, rather than of Right. But what need is there of this Diſtinction, and to what Purpoſe will it ſerve, if it is not to operate againſt us? Our Claim is, that we may be upon an equal Footing with the other religious Denominations in America. In Order to this, it is neceſſary that we be allowed the Enjoyment of our eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, in the ſame compleat Manner as it is enjoyed by them. Of our eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conſtitution Biſhops make an eſſential Part; and therefore, without an Epiſcopate we cannot enjoy it. Our Claim is juſtified by the common Principles of human Nature, of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of civil Society. We call it a RIGHT, becauſe all good Writers agree in calling a Claim thus founded by that Name. But for Words we do not contend. What we inſiſt upon is this, and no more than this—that the Church of England is, in all Reſpects, fairly intitled to as <hi>full</hi> a Toleration in the Colonies, as other Churches in the Colonies
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:011203_0240_0F95328F2DA97400"/>
enjoy; and it cannot be thus tolerated, unleſs it be ſuffered to exiſt in all its Parts. It is therefore the Buſineſs of our Opponents to ſhew, that we are an Exception from the general Rule, and that we ought not to be treated in the ſame equal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with others. Unleſs they are able to ſhew this, they cannot prove that our Requeſt for Biſhops is unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>BUT ſays the Doctor, p. 180, the American E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians <hi>want to be diſtinguiſhed by having Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops upon the Footing of a</hi> STATE-ESTABLISHMENT. If we want what is unreaſonable, ſo far it is right to oppoſe us; but ſtill our reaſonable Wants or Deſires ought to be gratified. But where did he learn, that we want Biſhops upon ſuch a Footing? Not from the <hi>Appeal</hi>; for therein the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is expreſsly and repeatedly aſſerted. Did he learn it from any Thing that has been publiſhed on the Side of the Church? Let him then inform us <hi>from what,</hi> and <hi>by whom.</hi> I know of no ſuch Thing, I can ſolemnly declare. I have ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that has been written, ſince the Plan was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> either in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or America, in Print or in Manuſcript, that indicates ſuch a Deſire. I will go ſtill farther and ſay, that I have met with nothing in the Courſe of Converſation, with Clergymen or Laymen, in or our of <hi>Convention,</hi> from whence I can learn or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that there is an Epiſcopalian within the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Dominions that aims at, or expects an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate here, upon the Footing of a <hi>State-Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And yet without Heſitation, or any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Remorſe of Conſcience, we are <hi>all</hi> charged with aiming at it, and are abuſed for it by many
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:011203_0241_0F95328FED3A9918"/>
'petulant Tongues and abuſive Pens;' although not the leaſt <hi>Evidence</hi> has yet been produced, by the <hi>Managers</hi> againſt us. Our Comfort is, that the unwarrantable Condemnation we have received from theſe Writers will avail but little; our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> is made to the impartial <hi>Public,</hi> from which we doubt not of a favorable Sentence.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor affects to doubt, p. 181, whether <hi>the late Dr. Samuel Chandler</hi>
                  <q>gave his Conſent to, and Approbation of, American Biſhops, in the Manner they have been requeſted.</q>
But a Perſon of high Rank and equal Integrity, in a Letter dated <hi>May</hi> 1764, ſays,
<q>Lord Willoughby of Parham, the <hi>only Diſſenting Peer,</hi> and Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, have declared, after our Scheme (for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Biſhops) was fully laid before them, that they ſaw no objections againſt it:</q>
And a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who is now in America, was preſent at the Converſation in which the latter made that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and has heard him expreſs the ſame Sentiments on other Occaſions. Well then, if it was ſo, the Doctor <hi>wonders at it,</hi> and accounts for it by <hi>ſuppoſing, that he was too complaiſant to ſome high Dignitary of the Church.</hi> But why ſhould he <hi>wonder</hi> at it? Whoever is acquainted with the candid and generous Sentiments of that eminent Diſſenter, would much rather wonder, if he had not approved of a Plan, ſo beneficial to the Church, while it is harmleſs to all. To ſuppoſe him over-complaiſant to any Dignitary of the Church, is more than we can ſuppoſe would be the Caſe of ſome of his Brethren, on this Side the Atlantic. But there is no Need of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to account for the Fact. Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="unknown:011203_0242_0F953290AEC83A10"/>
himſelf, who ſeems to be as little addicted to the Sin of <hi>Complaiſance to the Church,</hi> as moſt Men, has, in the Page immediately preceding, ſaid full as much in Favor of the propoſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate, as Dr. S. Chandler is repreſented to have ſaid: The only Difference is, that he has not ſaid it <hi>with ſo good a Grace.</hi>

In Anſwer to this Section, inſtead of replying to any Thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the Doctor begins, with combating his own Phantom of a <hi>State-Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; of which, no more is needful to be ſaid.

of <hi>Trade, that general Policy was againſt</hi> the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners <hi>having greater Privileges than are allowed by the Laws of Toleration.</hi> How far the Grant would have interfered with the King's Coronation Oath, it becomes not me to ſay; thoſe to whom it was refered were the proper Judges; and in <hi>their</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Petition could not conſiſtently be granted. It is the unqueſtionable Duty of his Majeſty's moſt honorable <hi>Privy Council,</hi> to adviſe him againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is thought by them to imply <hi>a Breach of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath</hi>; it is a Duty more peculiarly incumbent upon any ſuch Biſhops as his Majeſty thinks fit to call up to that high Truſt. If therefore the Biſhop of London, upon the above Principle, was it more active than others in oppoſing the Meaſure, it was becauſe his Station required it. If <hi>general Policy,</hi> in the Opinion of the Lords of Trade, was alſo againſt the Grant, they were obliged to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it; and the Petitioners, I conceive, ought to reſt ſatisfied, eſpecially as it was a Matter of <hi>meer Favor,</hi> which was requeſted, and more than was thought to be allowed by <hi>the Laws of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I have been moreover told, that beſides the Reaſons aſſigned, a <hi>particular Policy,</hi> with Regard to the Preſbyterians in New-York, concurred to defeat the Petition. It was the Belief at Home, that the Church of England had been treated with peculiar Malevolence, by ſome of thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:011203_0245_0F953292F01C3538"/>
whoſe Names were annexed to the Petition. It was therefore not unnatural to ſuſpect, that any additional Power put into the Hands of ſuch Perſons, would, as Opportunity ſhould offer, be exerted againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>IN Proof of the preſent mild Spirit of the Church of England and of the Prelates who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over it, Reference was made in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> to the general Senſe of it confeſſed by the Diſſenters at Home.
<q>The late Dr. G. Benſon, a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſſenter,</q>
was given as an Inſtance to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; who
<q>did not ſcruple to make the following Declaration:</q>
                  <q>The Church of England, with its preſent Candor, Spirit of Toleration and Charity, appears to me, to be the beſt Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Face of the Earth.</q>
Here the <hi>Preſbyter in Old England</hi> furiouſly falls upon me, charging me with having been guilty of a Miſquota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an <hi>artful Deception,</hi> thereby <hi>impoſing upon the Americans.</hi> Take it in his own Words: <hi>Our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary</hi> (Pray, Mr. <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> why <hi>your</hi> Miſſionary?) <hi>ought to have given the Teſtimony its full Scope; for theſe are the Words of Dr. Benſon following in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Connection</hi>—
<q>to which I would conform moſt gladly and with all my Soul, provided they would admit me, without requiring any Thing, which appears to me unreaſonable, or unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. But, as long as ſuch Things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in her Articles, and mixed with every Part of the common Forms of Worſhip,</q>
(meaning, I ſuſpect, the Doctrine of the Trinity)
<q>my Conſcience obliges me to diſſent, and avoid Communion with her. I ſincerely wiſh her a thorough Reformation, and that ſpeedily.</q>
                  <hi>What muſt now be thought of this Miſſionary from the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:011203_0246_0F953293AF6B2900"/>
Society, thus impoſing on the Americans, not capable, for the general, of coming at Dr. Benſon's Book, nor of detecting the miſrepreſented Teſtimony; which when fairly given, is as full againſt his Church Syſtem, as the Power of Language can expreſs.</hi> This is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, in <hi>its full Scope.</hi> Before I ſaw this <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Performance, a Friend who had read it, upon my Inquiry, told me, that he met in it with but one Paſſage that could deſerve Notice; which is the Paſſage I have quoted. When I came to ſee it, it appeard to me to be in itſelf not worthy of a Reply, as I ſtill think; however as ſome officious Zealot has cauſed it to be re-printed in one of the Boſton Papers, for this Reaſon it may be proper briefly to anſwer it.</p>
               <p>Whenever an Author is quoted, to ſhew his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon any particular Point, common Senſe teaches us that it is unfair to quote him imperfectly; or in ſuch a Manner that his Opinion on that Point is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented. At the ſame Time, no Perſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe will quote farther than relates to the Point under Conſideration. Let us then examine, for what Purpoſe Dr. Benſon was quoted in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>; from whence only we muſt judge whether he was quoted fairly or not. Now if any one will be at the Trouble of turning to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 90, he will ſee, that his Teſtimony was manifeſtly produced, as an Evidence of the
<q>Mildneſs, Tenderneſs and Moderation</q>
of 'the Engliſh Biſhops' for a 'Courſe of Years' paſt; and for no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But had Dr. Benſon ever declared his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon this Point? Yes, directly and fully, in in the Words quoted. Did the Quotation include the <hi>whole</hi> of his Declaration, and fairly expreſs the <hi>whole</hi> of his Opinion? I affirm that it includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Word relating to the Subject, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:011203_0247_0F9532947020F028"/>
conveyed the whole of his Opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſo far as he thought proper to expreſs it. What then is the <hi>Preſbyter</hi>'s Objection? That I gave not the Teſtimony <hi>its full Scope.</hi> In what Manner does he attempt to ſupport it? He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges my Omiſſion of Words that follow <hi>in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Connection</hi> with thoſe quoted. What is the Tendency of the Words omited? To account for Dr. Benſon's not conforming to the Church. Was the Reaſon then of his not conforming, that the Church appeared to him to be defective in Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Moderation? No, a quite different Thing, it was becauſe
<q>ſuch Things are contained in her Articles,</q>
&amp;c. as appeared to him to be
<q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or unſcriptural.</q>
The Objector was able to ſee this, for he obſerves that the Words omited contain a Teſtimony—againſt what? Why, not againſt the Moderation of the Biſhops and Clergy, the only Thing then in Queſtion; but— againſt the <hi>Church-Syſtem.</hi> I am ſorry that he was not able alſo to ſee, that I was not upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Church-Syſtems,</hi> but of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Mildneſs to Diſſenters:—And that I might, with as much Propriety, have quoted any other Paſſage in the whole Book, as that which I am blamed for omiting, although it was <hi>in immediate Connection</hi> with the Sentence tranſcribed. It is now ſubmitted to the Reader, whether my Quotation was unfair, or the Preſbyter's Animadverſion unjuſt and impertinent.</p>
               <p>FROM the Engliſh Diſſenters, I paſſed on to ſhew the favorable Opinion of the Church of England, which was entertained by ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Reformers and foreign Proteſtants; and by CALVIN amongſt others. In Anſwer to this, Dr.
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:011203_0248_0F95329530504558"/>
                  <hi>Chauncy</hi> denies that Calvin had any Friendſhip for Epiſcopacy. <hi>The plain Truth is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Calvin was in Principle as real an Enemy to the divine Right of Epiſcopacy, as to the divine Right of Popes,</hi> p. 188. But Enemy as he was, to ſay nothing now of his Teſtimony in Favor of Epiſcopacy which was produced in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> he acknowledges that it was the Government of all the Churches upon Earth, from the Times of the Apoſtles, for 1500 Years together<note n="†" place="bottom">Inſtit. Lib. IV. Cap. IV. Sect. 2.</note>.
<q>But his extraordinary Opinion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy will farther appear in a Letter, which he and Bullinger, and other learned Men beyond Sea, wrote <hi>Anno</hi> 1549 to King Edward the Sixth, offering to make him their Defender, and to have Biſhops in their Churches for better Unity and Concord amongſt them, as may be ſeen in Mr. Strype's Memorial of Archbiſhop Cranmer; as likewiſe, by a Writing of Archbiſhop Abbot's, found amongſt the Manuſcripts of Archbiſhop Uſher<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anſwer to Peirce, p, 17.</note>.</q>
Archbiſhop Abbot's Manuſcript, to which the learned Anſwerer of Peirce refers, in the above Paſſage, has the following Words:
<q>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing ſome Papers of our Predeceſſor Matthew Parker, we find that John Calvin, and others of the proteſtant Churches of Germany and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, would have had Epiſcopacy, if permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—And whereas John Calvin had ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in King Edward the Sixth's Reign, to have conferred with the Clergy of England about ſome Things to this Effect, two (popiſh) Biſhops, viz. Gardiner and Bonner, <hi>intercepted</hi> the ſame; whereby Mr. Calvin's Offerture periſhed. And he received an Anſwer, as if it had been from the reformed Divines of thoſe Times; wherein
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:011203_0249_0F953295EDC3D5E8"/>
they checked him, and ſlighted his Propoſals. From which Time John Calvin and the Church of England were at Variance in ſeveral Points; which othewiſe through God's Mercy had been qualified, if thoſe Papers of his Propoſals had been diſcovered unto the Queen's Majeſty during John Calvin's Life. But being not diſcovered until, or about the ſixth Year of her Majeſty's Reign, her Majeſty much lamented they were not found ſooner: Which ſhe expreſſed before her Council at the ſame Time, in the Preſence of her great Friends Sir Henry Sidney, and Sir William Cecil<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 70,</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ALMOST all the foreign Proteſtants, of any Diſtinction, have been Friends to Epiſcopacy; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of them have been unable to obtain that primitive Form of Government for their Churches.
<q>Luther profeſſes that if the popiſh Biſhops would ceaſe to perſecute the Goſpel, we would acknowledge them as our Fathers, and willingly obey their Authority, <hi>which we find ſupported by the Word of God.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Melancthon</hi> lays the Blame on the Cruelty of the popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that that canonical Polity was deſtroyed, which, ſaith he, <hi>we ſo earneſtly deſired to preſerve:</hi> And bid the Papiſts conſider what Account they will render to God for thus ſcattering his Church.</q>
'And <hi>Heerbrand,</hi> Chancellor of Tubingen, ſays,

<q>Even the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> by their Preſident <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german,</hi> expreſſed their Approbation of the Church of England, and of Epiſcopacy, which they were deſirous to eſtabliſh in their Churches, but the Times would not then permit them to make this Change; complaining of their Want of it as a Misfortune:

And <hi>Le Clerc</hi> ſays, he profeſſes his Belief to be, that Epiſcopacy is of apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and that none have a Right to depart from it, unleſs in Caſes where the Corruptions of the Church cannot be remedied without it: And that thoſe, who live in proteſtant Countries where they have Biſhops, as in England, are greatly to blame

                  <hi>GROTIUS,</hi> not only the Glory of Holland, but the Honor of the human Species, aſſerts, that
<q>Epiſcopacy had its Beginning in the apoſtolical Times. This, ſays he, is teſtified by the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Biſhops left us by <hi>Irenaeus, Euſebius, Socrates, Theodoret</hi> and others, who all begin from the apoſtolical Age. But to detract from the Faith of ſuch Writers, and ſo agreeable to one another in their Aſſertions in an hiſtorical Matter, is the Part only of an irreverend and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Mind. It is as much as if you ſhould deny that to be true, which all the Roman Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories

But no Teſtimony of this Kind is more extraordinary, than that of <hi>David Blondel,</hi> who had concluded his <hi>Apologia pro Hieronymi Sententia,</hi> with Words to this Purpoſe:
<q>By all that we have ſaid to aſſert the Rights of the Preſbytery, we do not intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate <hi>the ancient and apoſtolical Conſtitution of epiſcopal Pre-eminence.</hi> But We believe that whereſoever it is eſtabliſhed conformably to the ancient Canons, it muſt be carefully preſerved; and whereſoever by ſome Heat of Contention or otherwiſe, it hath been put down or violated, it ought to be reverently reſtored.</q>

               <p>IF we come down lower, to the Beginning of the preſent Century, we find the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in their Correſpondence with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity of Oxford, and the Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, expreſſing Sentiments of the greateſt Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for the Conſtitution and Government of the Church of England; "We are ſo far," ſay

About the ſame Time, Dr. Nichols carried on a Correſpondence with <hi>Daniel Erneſt Jablonſki,</hi> a celebrated proteſtant Divine, who was Miniſter, eccleſiaſtical Counſellor, and Preſident of the Society of Sciences, in Berlin. In a Letter to Dr. Nichols, dated 1708, Preſident <hi>Jablonſki</hi> ſays:
<q>I ſpent my Youth in Pruſſia and Poland, among Britiſh Subjects, who were averſe from the Church of England, and had been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Diſputes betwixt the Epiſcopalians and Preſbyterians. Converſe with them had filled my tender Mind with ſuch Prejudices againſt your Church, that when I came a young Man into England, in 1680, I had an utter Abhorence of it, and thought her public Places of Worſhip were as much to be avoided as thoſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Soon after, in endeavouring to learn the Language, I happened on the XXXIX Articles; the pure Orthodoxy of which I ſo approved of, that, doubting of my former Opinion, I more cloſely examined the whole Controverſy; your eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, your Liturgy, the Objections made to each, and the whole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Schiſm. The longer I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with that Church, the more I grew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:011203_0253_0F953299AFE82CE8"/>
in the Opinion that her Articles had no Heterodoxy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her Liturgy no Idolatry or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, her Government much good Order and Decency; and that on this Account, among all the reformed Churches, <hi>She came neareſt to the Patern of the primitive Church, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteemed the brighteſt Star in the Chriſtian Heaven, the chief Glory of the Reformation, and the ſecureſt Defence of the Goſpel againſt Popery; and that no one can refuſe her Communion without</hi> SCHISM. Yet I ſo follow and honor the Church of England, as not to hate, but pity, your Preſbyterians; the greater Part of whom, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, trained up in hereditary Prejudices, act with a good Conſcience; but that <hi>ſome amongst them abuſe the Simplicity of the Reſt</hi>

                  <note place="margin">SECT. X.</note>ONE <hi>Section</hi> of the <hi>Appeal</hi> was devoted to the Conſideration of the grand popular Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt an American Epiſcopate, that it would ſubject the People of this Country to the Payment of TITHES. To this Section, which was one of the moſt important in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts no Anſwer at all; evading it by ſaying, p. 191, that <hi>it has no immediate Connection with the preſent Subject.</hi> But he knows that before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> it was <hi>commonly</hi> thought to be moſt cloſely and intimately connected with the Subject, and that it was one of the moſt general Objections againſt American Biſhops that was mentioned. When People were aſked their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſuch an Appointment, there was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one in Fifty, of thoſe who knew not what Kind of an Epiſcopate was propoſed, but would anſwer, that we ſhould all in that Caſe be ſubject to the Payment of Tithes. This was frequently offered as the <hi>only</hi> Objection, and almoſt always as the <hi>firſt</hi>; and there were but very few of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People that had any other Objections to offer, than this of <hi>Tithes,</hi> and that of <hi>Spiritual Courts.</hi> It was therefore one principal Deſign of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> to remove theſe two Objections; in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of which I have been ſo ſucceſsful, that even the Doctor can find nothing to ſay in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of either of them. We are told now, that
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:011203_0255_0F95329B2E1D7F08"/>
the Affair of Tithes <hi>has no immediate Connection</hi> with the general Subject in Debate. This is unfair and ungenerous. If the Doctor had ſet out, and proceeded, with as much Candor as is due, I will not ſay, from one Chriſtian and Clergyman to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but, from Man to Man, he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that theſe two popular Objections had been ſo intirely confuted in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that they ought not any more to be mentioned in this Controverſy. It would have been no Injury to his Character, or his Cauſe, to have made this candid Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; for in the Caſe of every literary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, a <hi>decent</hi> Retreat is the next beſt Thing to a Victory.</p>
               <p>TO ſtrengthen what was ſaid upon the Subject, and to confirm the Doctor in his preſent Opinion, I will preſent him with the full and explicit Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of one of the moſt judicious and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Writers, that ever treated of the Laws of England. In ſpeaking of the Britiſh Colonies in America, he ſays:
<q>It hath been held, that if an uninhabited Country be diſcovered and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Engliſh Subjects, all the Engliſh Laws then in being, which are the Birthright of every Subject, are immediately then in Force. But this muſt be underſtood with very many and very great Reſtrictions. Such Coloniſts carry with them only ſo much of the Engliſh Law, as is applicable to their own Situation and the Condition of an infant Colony; ſuch, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the general Rules of Inheritance, and of Protection from perſonal Injuries. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Refinements and Diſtinctions incident to the Property of a great and commercial Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (ſuch eſpecially as are inforced by Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)

                     <hi>the Mode of Maintenance for the eſtabliſhed Clergy, the Juriſdiction of ſpiritual Courts,</hi> and a Multitude of other Proviſions, are neither neceſſary nor convenient for them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ARE NOT IN FORCE<note n="†" place="bottom">Blackſtone's <hi>Commentaries on the Laws of England,</hi> Vol. I. p. 107.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS none of my Opponents have hitherto thought proper to revive the baffled Objections of Tithes and Spiritual Courts, I ſhall immediately proceed to the concluding Section.</p>

               <p>THE Deſign of the laſt Section of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> was to remove the few remaining Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Suſpicions:<note place="margin">SECT. XI.</note> Of which the firſt was, that, in Caſe of an Epiſcopate, Laws may <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> be made to ſubject us to the Payment of Tithes. To this it was anſwered, that
<q>there can be no more Reaſon to be apprehenſive, that new Laws will be made under an Epiſcopate, to ſubject us to this Burthen, than if Biſhops were not to be ſent hither. For Tithes are not paid in England to Biſhops, but the Incumbents of Pariſhes.</q>
Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> would be thought to be of a different Opinion, and to be apprehenſive of this Evil; <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Support of moſt of the epiſcopal Clergy, in many of the Colonies, ſhould continue to depend on the Charity of Benefactors at Home, as would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the Caſe,</hi> p. 192. Thus it ſeems, the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Tithes for the Support, not of Biſhops, but of the Clergy, is the Evil to be dreaded. But the Clergy will have the ſame Need of Support, with, as without, an Epiſcopate; and if <hi>their</hi> Support is the Object, the Appointment or Non-Appointment of Biſhops, which has no Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, will not have any great Influence upon the Purſuit of it. To ſuppoſe that two or three Biſhops in America will be able to turn the Scale ſo much in Favor of the Clergy, implies, either that the Ballance is nearly equal without them; or that theſe Biſhops will have much more Weight,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:011203_0258_0F95329D6F249A80"/>
than Perſons, ſo deſtitute of civil Power, were ever known to have. Were every Member of the Legiſlature, both at Home and in the Colonies, firmly and zealouſly attached to the Church; nay, if there were not a Diſſenter, Papiſt or Infidel, within the Britiſh Dominions, the Impoſition of <hi>Tithes</hi> upon Americans for the Support of their Clergy, would be an Imagination perfectly wild and chimerical. A large Majority of the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in England and the Colonies, are at this very Time Epiſcopalians; but there is no Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in ſo large a Number there is a ſingle Perſon that wiſhes it; and if they were all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men without Exception, it is more that probable that there would not be one Advocate for ſuch a Meaſure.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſays the Doctor, <hi>without all Doubt, this Law, or ſome other leſs offenſive in Sound, would take Place here, as ſoon as the State of Things would allow of it.</hi> I find it much harder to aſcertain the Meaning of many of his Objections, than to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer them, when the Senſe is aſcertained. If he means in theſe Words, that ſome other Law, leſs offenſive <hi>only</hi> in Sound, but equal in its Effect, with the Impoſition of Tithes, will <hi>without all Doubt</hi> be made for the Support of the Clergy; it is anſwered above. And, what are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Expreſſion, <hi>as ſoon as the State of Things will allow of it?</hi> The State of Things which in his Opinion would amount to this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an Explanation previouſly to an Anſwer. The Doctor ſeems here to have ſhifted the Idea of <hi>Tithes,</hi> or of ſome <hi>Equivalent,</hi> for the Support of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for that of a <hi>Tax</hi> to ſupport the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> For he immediately obſerves, that I had <hi>incauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:011203_0259_0F95329F52376BF0"/>
dropt that, which naturally leads to ſuch a Thought,</hi> viz. A Tax for the Support of American Biſhops. And then I am introduced as anſwering the <hi>next Objection,</hi> which is no other than this very Suſpicion or Apprehenſion. Thus the Reader ſees, that by an unexpected Tranſition, whether artful or artleſs, I will not determine, we are carried to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point.</p>
               <p>IN ſpeaking to the Subject of an imaginary <hi>Tax for the Support of American Biſhops,</hi> nothing which I meant or wiſhed to conceal, was <hi>incautiouſly dropt.</hi> For in anſwering the Objection, I denied that ſuch a Tax was at all intended or deſired. I moreover ſhewed that it could not be much wanted—that it was always propoſed, that the Biſhops ſhould be ſupported without any Expence to this Country— that a conſiderable Fund was already raiſed for that Purpoſe—and, ſo far as it ſhould be deficient, that there was no Doubt entertained by the Friends of the propoſed Appointment, of its being eaſily made up by voluntary Donations. But farther to ſhew that Americans have no Reaſon to be terrified on that Account, I conſidered the Matter under the moſt unfavourable Suppoſition that could be made; namely, that the Deficiency of the epiſcopal Fund ſhould be anſwered by a Tax upon the Inhabitants; and declared it as my Opinion, that ſuch a Tax would be inconſiderable, and amount to no more than Four Pence in a Hundred Pounds.
<q>This, as I went on to obſerve, would be no mighty Hardſhip upon the Country. He that could think much of giving the ſix thouſandth Part of his Income to any Uſe, which the Legiſlature of his Country ſhould aſſign, deſerves not to be conſidered in the Light of a good Subject, or
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:011203_0260_0F95329FADE21FD0"/>
Member of Society.</q>
This Obſervation I ſtill believe to be as true, as any Propoſition in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> or in the Doctor's <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it<note n="*" place="bottom">One of our <hi>weekly</hi> Adverſaries ſmartly retorts upon me, in theſe Words:
<q>Would not he think it a Hardſhip, and a mighty one too, to be obliged to pay one Farthing in a hundred Pounds, to the Support of any other religious Denomination in the World?</q>
(<hi>Am. Whig,</hi> Numb. XXI.) I anſwer, No, I ſhould not think it a Hardſhip to be obliged to contribute ſuch a Trifle, for the Support even of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſm; in Caſe I lived in a Mahometan Country, and were indulged with the free and full Enjoyment of my own Religion, at the ſame Time.</note>. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he apoſtrophiſes and harangues <hi>ad Populum,</hi> in the following rhetorical Strain: <hi>You ſee here, ye Coloniſts, the Opinion of the Dr. and, we reaſonably preſume, of the epiſcopal Clergy under whoſe Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he wrote, that the Country might</hi> IN EQUITY, <hi>be taxed for the Support of Biſhops,</hi> p. 193. But I affirm that the Coloniſts ſee no ſuch Thing. Such an Opinion I never expreſſed, either cautiouſly or <hi>incautiouſly</hi>; and never once intimated that I thought ſuch a Tax would be equitable. If he will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the Paſſage, he muſt be convinced of this himſelf, unleſs he is in the Condition of thoſe, who "having Eyes, ſee not;" and if he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his own Conduct relating to it, perhaps he may be convinced of—Something elſe.</p>
               <p>THE Argument he uſes to prove, that a good Subject and Member of Society might conſiſtently refuſe to pay the ſix thouſandth Part of his Income, towards the Support of American Biſhops, in Caſe ſuch a Tax ſhould be conſtitutionally impoſed; by proving too much, unfortunately proves nothing. <hi>If the Country might be taxed Four Pence in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it might for the ſame Reaſon,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011203_0261_0F9532A06E444CA0"/>
and with</hi> AS MUCH <hi>Juſtice, if it was thought the Support of Biſhops called for it, be taxed Four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or Four Pounds in the Hundred, and ſo on to Ten Pounds, until the Tax of Tythes was compleatly faſtened on us,</hi> p. 194. To ſay nothing of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Notion, that we may with <hi>as much</hi> Juſtice, or with as little Injuſtice, tranſgreſs the Rules of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity greatly and notoriouſly, as in a ſmall Degree; which is equivalent with this, that a Man that has aberrated 100 Miles from his proper Road, is <hi>not farther</hi> out of his Way, than he that has deviated <hi>one</hi> Mile: The ſame Argument will equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt every Degree of civil Authority. Thus, for Inſtance, if a Country may be taxed Four Pence in a hundred Pounds, it may, for the ſame Reaſon, and <hi>with as much Juſtice,</hi> if it was thought that the Support of GOVERNMENT called for it, be taxed Four Shillings, or Four Pounds in the Hundred, and ſo on to the whole. Again, if a Man's perſonal Services may be juſtly claimed by the Public for one Day in the Year, they may <hi>as juſtly</hi> be claimed for a Week, a Month, or even the whole Year. Any Man that ſhould reaſon at this Rate, and act according to the Tenor of ſuch reaſoning, I fancy, would not be eſteemed a good Subject or Member of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, in any State or Kingdom on the Face of the Globe. And yet, this Kind of reaſoning the Doctor teaches!</p>
               <p>THE next Subject of his Animadverſion, is the Anſwer given in the <hi>Appeal</hi> to the Objection or Suſpicion, that probably the Power of American Biſhops may be hereafter augmented. But what was then ſaid, I conceive, remains in full Force,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:011203_0262_0F9532A12E0EA640"/>
notwithſtanding the Doctor's Attempts to weaken it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The <hi>American Whig</hi> has given himſelf very triumphant Airs, in his Attack upon the Paſſage under our preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. "However," as is remarked by one of my Friends,
<q>he does not offer a Syllable that will invalidate the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. He rings the Changes on the Words <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>poſſible,</hi> till he becomes moſt tedious, diſguſting and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. He inſinuates that Dr. C. in his Anſwer to the Objection, ſubſtituted the Word <hi>poſſible,</hi> in the Place of <hi>probable,</hi> to evade the Force of the Argument. But every Perſon of the leaſt Diſcernment, muſt perceive that the Doctor, when he uſed the Word <hi>probable,</hi> put it in the Mouth of the ſuppoſed Objector: When he uſed the Word <hi>poſſible,</hi> he ſpeaks in his own Name. The ill Effects which are ſuppoſed in the Objection to be <hi>probable,</hi> he denies to be ſuch, but barely <hi>poſſible</hi> only; and juſtly obſerves from thence, <hi>that if every poſſible ill Effect of a Thing, although confeſſedly proper in itſelf and harmleſs in its natural Tendency, may be made an Argument againſt it, there is nothing that can eſcape.</hi>—Evidently, there is in this no <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> no <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> with which the Whig very decently charges him.</q>

                  </note>. If he has ſaid any Thing upon the Subject which is worthy of Notice, it has been abundantly anſwered, in the different Parts of this Defence, which I need not repeat. Nay, much more that was ſaid upon the Subject by Dr. Mayhew, who puſhed the Objection to Extremity, has been fully anſwered by Mr. Apthorp; and, I may add, was <hi>powerfully</hi> anſwered and confuted by himſelf, in Words quoted <hi>incautiouſly</hi> by the Doctor, in p. 174.
<q>It is readily owned, ſays Dr. Mayhew, that our Apprehenſion of what may poſſibly or probably be the Conſequence of Biſhops being ſent hither, ought not to put us on infringing the religious Liberty of our Fellow-Subjects, and Chriſtian Brethren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>TO ſhew that Americans need not be frightened with the Imagination that our Biſhops may in Time
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:011203_0263_0F9532A1ED4D9478"/>
be inveſted with civil Authority, I explained in what Manner it would probably operate, on <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> that the Caſe ſhould actually happen. My Words are theſe:
<q>But ſhould the Government ſee fit hereafter to inveſt them with ſome Degree of civil Power, worthy of their Acceptance, which it is impoſſible to ſay they will not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is no Appearance that they ever will; yet as no new Powers will be created in Favor of Biſhops, it is inconceivable that any would thereby be injured.</q>
The Doctor ſays, <hi>this has unwarily opened the Workings of</hi> my <hi>own Heart.</hi> And in p. 202, he goes farther and ſays, that I <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>believe</hi> (as his Uſe of the Word neceſſarily implies) that the American Biſhops will be inveſted with civil Authority; but with what Juſtice, is ſubmitted to the Reader. Is ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief deducible from my having made the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Things confeſſedly improbable, and even impoſſible, are frequently <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> for the Uſe of Illuſtration. Is it infered from my declaring it to be
<q>impoſſible to ſay, that Biſhops will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with civil Authority?</q>
I can alſo truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it is impoſſible to ſay that Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> will not be made an American Biſhop; but it would be unjuſt to infer from thence, that I <hi>believed</hi> ſo extraordinary a Thing would happen; eſpecially if I ſhould add, as I did in the other Caſe, that 'there is no Apearance that he ever will.'</p>
               <p>IN p. 196, the Doctor turns aſide to ſhew, that the Miniſters of Chriſt's Kingdom, which is not of this World, ſhould not concern themſelves with temporal Matters; and he quotes St. Paul, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Opinion. But how far he means to carry the Doctrine, whether as far as it was carried by
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:011203_0264_0F9532A30DAA69C0"/>
the <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> or the Diſciples of <hi>Herman Pongilup,</hi> in the 13th Century, he does not ſay; but he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently carries it much farther than the venerable Doctors <hi>Increaſe</hi> and <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whoſe Opinion we have ſeen. As it is not my Buſineſs to enter into a Diſcuſſion of this Subject, which has no Relation to that of American Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, I ſhall paſs it by; thanking the Doctor for recomending to me good old Biſhop Latimer's <hi>Sermon of the Plough</hi>; and promiſing him to read it carefully, if he will be ſo kind as to direct me where I can meet with it; if perchance he himſelf hath met with any more of it than is quoted by Mr. Peirce.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor now, drawing towards a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, looks back upon his Performance, and ſeems to be mightily ſatisfied with what he has been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I fear I have ſomewhat broken in upon his Repoſe; the Apprehenſion of which, I aſſure him, gives me no Pleaſure. If I could have done Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Cauſe I have undertaken to plead, without diſturbing him, I would moſt willingly have avoided it. I have a Veneration for his Years, and much Reſpect for his Character, which I am ſorry he has expoſed by engaging in ſo wretched a Cauſe. He has written with Reputation on other Subjects, but he is manifeſtly unequal to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he had to encounter with on this. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where is the Man that is equal to ſuch a Taſk? Who is able to prove, that good is evil, and evil good—that Darkneſs is Light, and Light Darkneſs—as well as to <hi>call</hi> them ſo? Until a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch a Genius and Abilities can be found, it never can be proved, that it is not cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to oppoſe our having ſuch an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:011203_0265_0F9532A381BE9050"/>
as is requeſted for the Church in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor has a few other Things to ſay, of which ſome Notice muſt be taken. I had inſiſted that Reaſons of Policy demanded from our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and Governors at Home, peculiar Attention to the Complaints of Epiſcopalians in the Colonies: Becauſe
<q>the Church of England here is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with the Church at Home, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is eſſentially the ſame with it</q>
—and becauſe this Church
<q>in its external Polity, is ſo happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected and interwoven with the civil Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that each mutually ſupports and is ſupported by the other; no Form of eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo exactly harmonizing with a <hi>mixed</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as that of a <hi>qualified</hi> Epiſcopacy.</q>
The Doctor anſwers, that according to my own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Biſhops, they <hi>are abſolute Monarchs in the Church; and ſuch muſt Kings be in the State to make out a proper Analogy,</hi> p. 198; and much has been offered to the ſame Purpoſe by one of my weekly Antagoniſts. But to all that they have ſaid, it is a ſufficient Reply, that according to the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> Biſhops are inveſted with an Authority for which they acknowledge themſelves to be accountable,—an Authority limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by fixed Laws, which is incompatible with the Idea of an abſolute Monarch; who knows no other Law than his own arbitrary Pleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, Book II.</note>. The true Parallel between eccleſiaſtical and civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as I concieve, runs thus: <hi>Independency</hi> anſwers to <hi>Democracy—Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> to an <hi>Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy</hi>—primitive, or proteſtant <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to a <hi>mixed Monarchy</hi>—and <hi>Popery,</hi> to an <hi>abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="unknown:011203_0266_0F9532A441EA8250"/>
From hence it follows, that in the View of <hi>meer Policy,</hi> it is abſurd to encourage epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Republicks and democratical States; and as much ſo, to prefer Preſbyterianiſm or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, where the civil Government is regal, or monarchical.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor is pleaſed to ſay, p. 199, in the true Spirit of Contradiction, what I believe has never been ſaid by any before him, that <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church,</hi> by ſuch Biſhops as I had deſcribed, <hi>is</hi> MORE UNLIKE <hi>the Government of the State, by Kings, Lords, and Commons, than any Form of Government of the Church that was ever known in the Colonies; and perhaps, is</hi> MORE <hi>naturally and powerfully adapted to</hi> SUBVERT <hi>it.</hi> But whither will theſe extraordinary Flights at laſt carry him? He forgets that he ſet out upon the contrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, in the Beginning of his Book; ſtoutly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that Epiſcopacy was eſtabliſhed at the Time of the Reformation, not upon the Footing of a divine Inſtitution, but upon Account of its being beſt fitted to the Form of Government in the State. The civil Conſtitution of the Britiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is, in all eſſential Points, the ſame now that it was at that Period, and Epiſcopacy is the ſame; ſo that if they were peculiarly adapted to each other then, they are now. That this was, and is, the Caſe, I fully believe; and Reaſons for this Belief were given in the <hi>Appeal</hi>; which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Doctor has not attempted to invalidate.</p>
               <p>IT is well known that the ſame Opinion has been maintained, by the greateſt and beſt Writers upon the Subject.
<q>For the Government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</q>
                  <pb n="257" facs="unknown:011203_0267_0F9532A4FA740128"/>
ſays the incomparable <hi>Lord Bacon</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">As quoted by Biſhop Ellys.</note>,
<q>for my Part, not prejudging the Proceedings of other Churches, I do hold it to be warranted by the Word of God, and by the Practice of the ancient Church in better Times, and <hi>much more convenient for</hi> KINGDOMS, than a Parity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Government by Synods.</q>
It was an Obſervation of the noble and learned <hi>Philip de Mornay,</hi> who was not only a Calviniſt, but a principal Support of the Proteſtant Religion in France;
<q>that although the preſbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might do well enough in popular States, ſuch as Geneva and Switzerland, yet in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Monarchies, epiſcopal Government is rather to be choſen.</q>
                  <q>And the ſame Opinion in much ſtronger Terms, and <hi>with a particular View to England,</hi> was profeſſed by another Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, who underſtood Politicks as well as moſt Men of his Time, and was both a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and had great Candor in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; I mean the celebrated <hi>Paſſendorf,</hi> who expreſſes himſelf in the following Words:
<q>In this Reſpect likewiſe not a little Blemiſh is thought to lie upon many of the Calviniſts, as being too much inclined to affect Democracies, and being on the contrary averſe to Monarchies, and forward to <hi>ſubvert</hi> them.</q>
                  </q>
                  <q>When <hi>Puffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf</hi> ſays that the Calviniſts are too much inclined to Democracies, he is not to be underſtood as if he repreſented all of that Sect as being at all Times thus diſpoſed; for no doubt, while the Kings under whom they live encourage and favor them, they may ſo long be well enough pleaſed with their Government, and willing to ſupport it. The Baron's Meaning I take to have been,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:011203_0268_0F9532A81084C280"/>
that the popular Forms of their Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have a natural Tendency to raiſe Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, when either they are ſoured by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable Treatment, or not enough ſweetned by perſonal Intereſt under Monarchies, are apt to lean much towards popular Schemes<note n="*" place="bottom">Elyls <hi>Tracts,</hi> p. 148.</note>.</q>
I might quote innumerable Authorities to the ſame Purpoſe; but I will content myſelf with one more.
<q>The eſtabliſhed Religion, and the eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</q>
ſays a Writer of great Candor and Penetration,
<q>are in their Conſtitution and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts ſo interwoven and linked together, that they who would <hi>ſubvert</hi> the Government, have no ſurer Way to compaſs their wicked Ends, than by endeavouring to ruin the Church firſt. The greateſt Strength of the Government ever did and ever will lie in the Fidelity and Affection of the Members of the eſtabliſhed Church: As the Government knows this to be true, <hi>ſo do its Enemies,</hi> who therefore are as ready by all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices and Attempts to weaken it, as our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors can be to favor and protect it<note n="†" place="bottom">Hare's Works, Vol. I. p. 332.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE are neither ſo void of Diſcernment,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>or unacquainted with the Intrigues of thoſe who are moſt zealous for an American Epiſcopate, as not to be fully ſatisfied, they have much more in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than they have been pleaſed openly to declare,</hi> p. 201. But notwithſtanding his Opinion of his own <hi>Diſcernment,</hi> he ſhould remember that this Charge brought againſt us before
<q>the Tribunal of the Public,</q>
ought to be ſupported, at leaſt, with an <hi>Appearance</hi> of Evidence. It is no ſmall Thing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to accuſe of Prevarication and Falſhood,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:011203_0269_0F9532A8C3F14AE8"/>
ſuch a Number of Men, who have always been reſpected for their Integrity; and ſomething more than arbitrary Suſpicions will be needful, to juſtify ſo high an Impeachment. But he tells us, he is <hi>not unacquainted with their Intrigues.</hi> Let him then, for the Sake of his own Reputation, diſcover them to the World. This is what he owes both to the Public and himſelf; and it is expected from him, as he would not betray the Cauſe, for which he profeſſes to be uncommonly zealous. Let him mention ſome one <hi>Intrigue,</hi> ſome over-Act, from which it can reaſonably be concluded, that our Deſigns are contrary to our Declarations, and we will take Shame to ourſelves; but if he can offer no other Proof than his pretended <hi>Diſcernment</hi> of our ſecret Intentions, he will be conſidered as no better than a falſe Accuſer of his Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who have given him no juſt Cauſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. This Matter is of ſo great Conſequence in the preſent Debate, that we cannot give it up, but muſt inſiſt that he comes to a particular Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Much, very much, depends upon it. The Uproar about Biſhops has been, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, excited and continued by this very Pretence. If we are guilty of what he charges us with, we deſerve to be oppoſed; if we are innocent, we ought to be acquitted. I therefore call upon him in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Manner to produce his Evidence, or to retract his Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEIR ultimate Views,</hi> ſays he, <hi>whatever they propoſe to begin with, have not been ſo perfectly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted in their own Breaſts, but that they have been whiſpered about from one Friend to another, ſo that we are at no Loſs to form a true Judgment of them.</hi> And again: <hi>Things have tranſpired from thoſe, who
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:011203_0270_0F9532AB06B6C3E8"/>
did not know how, or were not able to keep a Secret,</hi> p. 202. I once more affirm, that we have no other Views than what we have publiſhed; and I defy any of our Adverſaries to prove the contrary. I can, at leaſt, anſwer for myſelf; I can anſwer alſo for our Convention, with whoſe Views and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it will be allowed that I am acquainted— that we have no <hi>Secret</hi> in the Caſe; that we have no <hi>ultimate Views</hi> that are contrary to our <hi>immediate</hi> ones; and that theſe are not contrary to our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Declarations. But to anſwer to ſuch an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Charge of <hi>private Whiſpers,</hi> by no Body knows <hi>whom</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> about no Body knows <hi>what</hi>; is more than I will undertake, as I am conſcious of my Want of the neceſſary <hi>Diſcernment.</hi> And if the Doctor has no other Evidence, it is meer trifling with the Attention of the Public, to inſiſt upon this. It concerns him to ſhew that ſome Diſcovery has been made, either with or without Deſign, by ſome Perſon who may be ſuppoſed to be acquainted with all <hi>Secrets</hi> of the Kind, that the Clergy have been acting a deceitful, double Part with the World, and are aiming at a different Epiſcopate from that of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> This is the grand Point; and upon his Proof of it, I will venture to riſque the whole Controverſy.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now done with Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, having replied to every Thing material in his Performance, whether it relates immediately to the propoſed Epiſcopate, to the Church of England, or to the <hi>Appeal</hi>; excepting what he has ſaid upon the general Subject of Epiſcopacy:—And even to ſome Things that are not material, any farther than as they are thought ſo by ſome ignorant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Perſons. I have paſſed over nothing, from
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:011203_0271_0F9532ABE1F7C148"/>
any Opinion of Difficulty in replying to it; and I have endeavored to obviate all the Objections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in anſwering the Doctor's. Different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from his has been frequently uſed in the late periodical Exhibitions againſt the Church; but the Objections have been much the ſame; and I am miſtaken, if I have not done Juſtice to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Repreſentations of thoſe Writers, as well as to his.</p>
               <p>THERE is indeed one Objection ſtarted by them, which has not yet been conſidered; and I hardly know, whether it is worth conſidering. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, that ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for the Colonies, is an <hi>impoſſible</hi> Thing in its own Nature. <hi>The Impoſſibility of the Thing</hi> is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one Writer, to be ſo glaringly evident, that it is <hi>utterly incredible that they</hi> (the Clergy) <hi>ſhould be ſo exceſſively ignorant, as not to know it</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>American Whig,</hi> Numb. IV.</note>. It is a ſufficient Anſwer to this Objection, ſuppoſing it to have been made ſeriouſly, that thoſe eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who firſt projected the Plan, and thoſe who have from Time to Time been its Patrons—many of whom were much better acquainted with the Conſtitution of the Kingdom and its Colonies than theſe Objectors—could ſee no Impoſſibility or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Matter. Nay, as to <hi>the Impoſſibility of the Thing,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> himſelf, who, in the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig</hi>'s Opinion, is <hi>one of the moſt learned and able Writers in America</hi>

Objection. To this may be added: It is a good Evidence that the propoſed Epiſcopote <hi>may</hi> exiſt in America, that ſuch an Epiſcopate <hi>has</hi> actually exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>does</hi> now exiſt, in America, among the Moravians; and if it may in one Church, why not in another? It has been ſaid that the Church of England is an Exception, becauſe its Biſhops by <hi>the Law of the Land,</hi> are intitled to certain Powers and Preheminences wherever they are ſettled in the Britiſh Dominions; which Powers are diſclaimed in the Plan. <hi>The Law of the Land</hi> in this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſuppoſe, means the Laws of England, and not any Laws peculiar to this Country; and if by the Laws of England Biſhops, contrary to the clear Opinion of Dr. Blackſtone, will be inveſted with ſuch Powers and Preheminences in America, as ſoon as they ſhall be ſent hither; it muſt be owing to this only Reaſon—that the Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land eſtabliſh the Church throughout the Britiſh American Colonies, in the ſame Manner that it is eſtabliſhed in England. But will the Objectors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this Doctrine? Have not the ableſt Writers of their Party, always inſiſted upon the contrary? Does not this Doctrine neceſſarily imply, that we have, beſides an equitable, a <hi>legal,</hi> Right to an Epiſcopate; and that our Oppoſers tranſgreſs the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> as well as the Laws of Equity? But ſtill, an Eſtabliſhment in Favor of the Church here, which they inſinuate in this Controverſy that we have, but which they mean not to allow on any other Occaſion, would by no Means exclude an Epiſcopate in the very Form that is ſpecified; for ſuch an Epiſcopate, I believe, may, at any Time, be erected, or rather, reſtored, in England. It was ſhewn in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that the Biſhops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for America, were firſt mentioned by the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:011203_0273_0F9532AD2F002678"/>
Title of <hi>Suffragans</hi>; and thoſe who are acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Church, and the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws of England, know, that the Biſhops marked out in our Plan, whatever they may be called, are in Reality no other than Suffragans. If therefore the Laws of England admit of Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which they as certainly do, as of Dioceſan Biſhops, they then admit of ſuch an Epiſcopate as we contend for; even were we to ſuppoſe the Church of England to be as fully eſtabliſhed in the Colonies as it is in England, and by the ſame Laws. Suffragans have been frequently appointed at Home, under the preſent eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Conſequence is unavoidable, that they may be appointed here. But after all, were the Caſe in every Reſpect as the Objection repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to be, which it is not in any Reſpect; yet an Act of Parliament would make our Plan prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; and there can be no Doubt but its Friends have Intereſt enough to obtain ſuch an Act, ſhould they find it to be neceſſary.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CONCLUSION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Reader is now acquainted with both Sides of this Controverſy. An Epiſcopate is requeſted, in Behalf of the Church of England in America. The Reaſons for which it is deſired, have been offered in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> The Nature of the propoſed Epiſcopate, has alſo been explained. Diſſatisfied Perſons were candidly invited to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Objections. The Adverſaries of the Church have had Time to object; and a ſufficient Number of Perſons has been employed in this Service. The periodical Objectors have had peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical Anſwers; and a Reply is now given to the more formal Objections of Dr. <hi>Chauncy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT Objections would ariſe againſt the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Biſhops in the Colonies, unleſs they ſhould be under peculiar Regulations, was originally fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; and therefore, in forming the Plan for an American Epiſopate, all poſſible Care was taken to render it inoffenſive. It is eſſential to this Plan, that the Biſhops intended, are to have no Support from the Colonies, except by voluntary Donations from private Perſons; and that they are to exerciſe no Juriſdiction, but over the Clergy of the Church of England; by which Proviſion, the great popular Objections of <hi>Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> have no Foundation to reſt on. This is ſo evident, that our Opponents have hazarded but very little upon thoſe Points; and have found it neceſſary to introduce a new Set of Objections, in Order to keep up the Oppoſition againſt the Church, being unable to defend the old ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="unknown:011203_0275_0F9532AEB8B476D8"/>THEY now object that we do not really deſire to have an Epiſcopate under ſuch a Modification, as is propoſed to the Public. This is a very material Objection, could it be ſupported; and deſerves perhaps more Attention, than all the others which they are able to offer. But important as it is, it has nothing more ſolid to depend upon than malevolent Conjecture; for whatever may be their Pretences, every Reader knows that they have hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely failed in the Article of <hi>Proof.</hi> On our Side, the ſtrongeſt Evidence that the Nature of ſuch a Caſe will admit of, has been laid before the Public. We have produced as Witneſſes the Society's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Sermons, their Abſtracts, and indeed all that has peen publiſhed on the Subject by ſuch as could be ſuppoſed to underſtand the Caſe, for Half a Century paſt; all which, without one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, teſtify in our Favor. We have added our ſolemn Declarations, which muſt have a Weight proportionable to what is allowed to our Characters. The Teſtimony of our Vouchers is clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, uniform and conſiſtent, and directly to the Point; while not one counter Evidence has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other Side to weaken it. To the Weight of our Declarations nothing has been oppoſed, but ungenerous Reflections and pretended Suſpicions.</p>
            <p>AETER driving the preceding Objection as far as poſſible, it has been farther urged, that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch an harmleſs Epiſcopate as that of the <hi>Appeal</hi> to be at firſt ſettled, yet it would ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into one that is oppreſſive. We ſee not the leaſt Probability of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we abſolutely deny that any ſuch Thing is intended: So far from it, that the Friends of the Church would even join ++with its Enemies, were that neceſſary, in guarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:011203_0276_0F9532AF6DFD6830"/>
it. All the Aſſurances, all the Evidences, all the Securities which we have in our Power to give, to prevent Uneaſineſs, we are willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and all that is not beneath the Dignity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to give, we are willing to ſollicit. We want not an Epiſcopate on the Footing of a <hi>State-Eſtabliſhment</hi>; we deſire no more than a compleat Toleration, which we have not at preſent; and thereby to be raiſed to an Equality with other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Denominations in the Colonies. To this, we think ourſelves intitled, upon the common Principles of religious Liberty and of the Engliſh Conſtitution; and we are ſurprized and concerned, to find that any who profeſs a Regard for thoſe Principles, can oppoſe our Claim. We are ſtill more ſurprized to ſee the Arts to which they can deſcend, in ſupporting their Oppoſition. From Men of Senſe and Candor, reaſonable and candid Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is naturally expected. From Gentlemen we expect, at leaſt, Decency; and from Chriſtians, Charity. Our Opponents make high Pretenſions to Candor and good Senſe, and call themſelves Gentlemen and Chriſtians; but how far their late Attacks upon the Church have been reaſonable, or candid, or decent, or charitable, I am perhaps too far intereſted, fairly to determine. The <hi>Public</hi> have been invited to judge of this Controverſy; and to their impartial Deciſion the Manner, as well as the Matter of it, is moſt reſpectfully ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>IF this Diſpute is to be continued, I would humbly propoſe a <hi>new</hi> Plan of Operations, viz. That the Debate be reduced within a narrower Compaſs, and that nothing which does not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately relate to the Merits of the Cauſe, be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on either Side. We have already treſpaſſed too
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:011203_0277_0F9532B02F7B1EF0"/>
far upon the Patience of the Public; let us be careful hereafter to make a proper Uſe of their Indulgence. I would alſo propoſe, that no Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Abuſe, nothing that ſavors of Bigotry or Barbarity, be ſuffered to mingle in the Debate; but that ingenuous, ſober Reaſoning, ſhould decide it. It ought to be remembered, that we are not only accountable to the Public for our Behavior in this Controverſy, but that we muſt one Day anſwer for it before a higher Tribunal.</p>
            <p>THIS laſt Conſideration had ſuch an Effect upon Dr. du Moulin, who, it ſeems, had been an <hi>abuſive</hi> controverſial Writer, that when he came to lie upon his Death-Bed, he made the following penitential Declaration; which may deſerve our peculiar At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, while we are engaged in the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about American Biſhops.
<q>As for my Books, ſays he, in which I mixed many perſonal Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am now ſenſible I vented too much of my own Paſſion and Bitterneſs; and therefore I diſclaim all that is perſonal in them; and am heartily ſorry for every Thing I have written to the <hi>defaming</hi> any Perſon. I humbly beg God, and all thoſe I have wronged, Pardon, for Jeſus Chriſt's Sake, and am reſolved, if God ſpare my Life, never to meddle more with ſuch perſonal Things: And do earneſtly exhort all People, as a dying Man, that they will ſtudy more Love and mutual Forbearance in their Differences; and will avoid all bitter and uncharitable Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on one another's Perſons. And as I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray thoſe worthy Men of the Church of England to have Charity and Tenderneſs for the Diſſenters from them; ſo I beg of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters that they would have a due Regard and
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:011203_0278_0F9532B11621A640"/>
Reſpect to thoſe of the Church of England: Of many of whom I ſay now, let my Soul be with theirs! And that all true Proteſtants among us may heartily unite and concur in the Defence and Preſervation of the holy reformed Religion, now by the Mercy of God ſettled among us. And that Men of all Sides may, according to St. Paul's Rule, ceaſe to <hi>bite and devour one another, leſt</hi> we <hi>be deſtroyed one of another</hi>; and that whereunto we have already attained, we may walk by the ſame Rule; hoping that if any Man is otherwiſe minded, in ſome leſſer Things, God ſhall either reveal that to them, or merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive it, through Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
