            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WHAT</hi> is here Emitted in the Subſequent Pages, was never Preach'd to be Printed, but only to be Succeeded with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for an Impreſſion upon the Hearts of the Hearers: and Publiſhed to Gratify ſuch Pious well Affected Perſons, who having received ſome fruit &amp; benefit thereby themſelves; were willing to be at Expences in Publiſhing what is here preſented, with a ſingle aim at the Profit of their Neighbours: and that the Seed ſown might yet produce more Fruit, to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>The Author would have been very well Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed &amp; Contented, if the Enſuing Sheets had been lodg'd in ſilence, with the Reſt of his Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Manuſcripts, as being ſenſible, that what is Expoſed to Publick View (tho' the beſt Ends be aimed at) is Expoſed to the Cavils

and Cenſures of ſuch, who Read only to Paſs their Verdict upon the Worth or Weakneſs of the Author; rather than for any Edification or Profit.</p>
            <p>But ſince (thro' Grace) the Seed hath fallen upon ſome Good Ground, &amp; Proſpered; as it doth abundantly Compenſate the Barrenneſs of the other Sorts of Soil; So it doth arm againſt the Reflections of thoſe, who are wont to Redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching: Remembring alſo the Obligations I lye under to a kind Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom I have Served in the Goſpel of Chriſt upwards of Thirty Years; and who may juſtly Challenge any of my Poor Labours, for their Rewards.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Grounds, what hath been Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered, could not Reaſonably be denied a farther Publication; Eſpecially the Subject Inſiſted on (tho' weakly managed by the Author) yet it is of the greateſt Importance in theſe Latter, Declining, Apoſtatizing Days; wherein (as our Saviour hath foretold, <hi>Luk. 18.8.) That Faith ſhall ſcarce be found on Earth;</hi> and wherein moſt are ſo beſotted to the Earth, that they are miſerably bewilder'd in their way to Heaven: Ignorance, Atheiſm, Errour &amp; Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm beſot the World: Millions are born

Millions of miſerable Souls live as if they had no <hi>SOULS</hi> they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (it may be) for this Life; but what have they to build on, for <hi>ETERNITY</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souls they have, that muſt live for Ever; but no Preparation for Life &amp; Happineſs for Ever; All have Souls to Save, but few have Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them; an Eternity to Paſs through; but nothing to bear their Charges in that Endleſs Duration &amp; Ages without End.</p>
            <p>If any among theſe Dark Mountains here below, ſhould chance to Stumble upon the Jailors Queſtion, &amp; cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be Saved</hi>? Why what is here offered, may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething, which (with Gods Bleſſing) may Prove an Anſwer in due Seaſon by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Saving &amp; Effectual Faith in Chriſt, the only Condition of Salvation; &amp; Detecting a falſe Counterfeit Faith, whereby Multitudes of Profeſſors run themſelves upon the Rocks; making-Shipwrack of Faith and a Good Conſcience; and ſo miſcarry in point of Salvation: that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but never are Saved; and miſs of Heaven in the Height of their Hopes.</p>

            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, the Great Prophet of his Church; and the Apoſtle &amp; high Prieſt of our Profeſſion, was wont to reveal the Myſteries
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001527_0007_0FB39DC8B495B350"/>
of the Kingdom of Heaven in Parables; and in Parables to utter things, that have been kept Secret from the Foundation of the World. Great truths were thus Parabolically Delivered, Enigmatical and hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood &amp; diſcerned; a ſingular judgment upon Goſpel-Deſpiſers for their Contumacious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; Leaſt at any time, they ſhould ſee with their Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; hear with their Ears; underſtand with their-Hearts; and ſhould be Converted &amp; Healed; Our Saviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake to them in Parables; <hi>&amp; without a Parable Spake He not unto them,</hi> Matt. 13.15. <hi>But who is wiſe ſhall underſtand theſe things; Prudent, and he ſhall know them.</hi> Theſe Myſteries (tho' Myſtically Revealed) the true Followers &amp; Diſciples of Chriſt ſhall be inſtructed in them.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour (in the Chapter, wherein you find our Text) obſerving the Infidelity and Unfruitfulneſs of great Numbers of his Hearers &amp; Followers; He puts forth a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable admirably adapted to the Purpoſe; to ſet forth the various Efficacy of the Word (the Seed of Faith) upon four ſeveral Sorts of Hearers, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Parable of the <hi>Sower,</hi> and the <hi>Seed,</hi> that fell upon four ſeveral Sorts
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001527_0008_0FB39DCA37D66730"/>
of the Ground; the <hi>High Way,</hi> the <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> the <hi>Thorny Ground,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Good Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parable is (1) Propounded <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. (2) Expounded in our Text &amp; Context.</p>
            <p>In our Text, under the Parable of the Seed that fell on Stony Places (or on the Rock) our Saviour Detecting a Sort of Hearers, upon whom the Word (the Seed of Faith) falling, it had two notable Effects. (1) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Affections [<hi>When they Hear they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word with joy.</hi>] (2) Operating Faith. [<hi>Which for a while Believe.</hi>] The Seed of the Word, Received with Joy, Produced this Fruit. [<hi>Faith</hi>] Which Fruit is Deſcribed three ways in our Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From its Sprouting &amp; Springing: It Sprang from a Sudden Pang &amp; Flaſh of Joy in Hearing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From its Laſting &amp; Continuing: they Believe for a while, &amp; indeed it was but for a While: it was not long &amp; laſting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From its Waſting and Withering, Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Scorching Sun of Temptation. [<hi>In the Time of Temptation they fall away.</hi>] So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.6. <hi>When the Sun was up, they were Scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>: and the Reaſon is Render'd; <hi>Becauſe they had in Root, they withered away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001527_0009_0FB39DCBB0ECA0B0"/>So in our Text [Theſe have no Root; <hi>Which for a while Believe,</hi> &amp;c.] Their Faith was not well bottom'd, well Rooted, but like the Seed, that fell on the Rock, where poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there was ſome Earth, on the Top of the Rock; or Work'd into the Roots of the Rock: but no depth of Earth: Hence the Roots being Shallow, when the Sun aroſe, the moiſture was ſoon dried up; and the Sprouting ſoon turned to Withering.</p>
            <p>So it was with the Seed of Faith, that fell upon theſe Hearers; there was ſome ſhallow Earth, but the Rock at the Bottom; the Heart Unbroken, Unhumbled, Unſubdued; hence the Seed had ſome Sprouting but took no Rooting: Their flaſhy affections, in Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, had no Principles, to maintain them; therefore came to nothing. The Root of the matter was not in them: they wanted depth of Earth: The Plough had not gone deep enough; and therefore, tho' the Earth were good and the Seed good; yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well covered, it miſcarries: <hi>Exoriuntur ſed Exuruntur</hi>: the Roots are burnt up, like the Wicked, Job 18.16. <hi>His Roots are Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up beneath; and above his Bud is cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what becomes of the Faith of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001527_0010_0FB39DCFF6903F18"/>
the Stony Ground Hearers: they had a Faith; but not being well Bottom'd &amp; Rooted, it was not Sound &amp; Saving: they fell away &amp; miſſed of Heaven, in the Height of their Hopes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Faith.</p>
            <p>Admiſt the many Truths, that are Deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from this Text, we are to take notice of this one; from thoſe Words, [<hi>Who for a while Believe; and in time of Temptation fall away.</hi>]</p>
            <div type="doctrine">

                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> There is a Believing, or a Faith which many that Sit under the Hearing of the Word Preached, may attain unto, that is not Sound and Effectually Saving; or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, Perſons may fall away and Miſcarry in Point of Salvation.</head>
               <p>There is a believing or a Faith which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attain unto, thro' a Delight in Hearing the Word Preached; who yet miſcarry in Point of Salvation: So it was with the Stony Ground, they Heard the Word with Delight; they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it with joy; which Produced a Faith [the Genuine Fruit of Hearing the Word, <hi>For Faith comes by Hearing,</hi> Rom. 1.16.]
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001527_0011_0FB39DD0F2E5CCE8"/>
And when Faith Springs from Delight in Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word; Such perſons are ready to think themſelves in a ſure and ſafe Eſtate; and that their Faith is well bottom'd, they bid fair for Heaven: But even ſuch may be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and miſcarry in the great Point of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for want of laying a good Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there being nothing of the Work of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: they never went to the Bottom, to break the Rock at the Heart: Saving Faith hath Humiliation laid for its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, When Faith ariſeth only from a Flaſh of Delight in Hearing the Word, it is but a Counterfeit and not Laſting. Many Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates have had many meltings &amp; much Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſtrong joy: So had thoſe Stony Ground Hearers; but it amounted not to Saving Faith. They had ſome flight Knowledge of Chriſt, their affections were ſtirred; their underſtandings were gilded over with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kind of Supernatural Light, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.) but not to a Tranſmentation. They were Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in Hearing the Word; and had ſome Aſcenſions upwards, in their Affections; but were like Meteors hanging a while in the air, not having ſtrength enough to aſcend to the upper Region: Hence they ſoon vaniſh:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001527_0012_0FB39DD273FC1718"/>
their Faith fails and comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Word [<hi>The Seed of Faith</hi>] in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, falls upon four Sorts of Ground; but it takes Rooting in but One. The Good Seed, if not caſt into the Good Ground, it yields no Harveſt. The Word [<hi>The Seed of Faith</hi>] it miſcarry's in moſt: It is trampled upon by the High Way Hearers; and the Devil Caſhiers it: the Devil comes and picks the Word out of their Hearts; leſt they ſhould Believe &amp; be Saved, <hi>v.</hi> 12. The Seed of Faith in others ſoon withered and ſcorch'd up; as in the Stony Ground: Faith in others is chocked &amp; ſtifled; as in the Thorny Ground; Eminently with thoſe three Chokers, the Cares, &amp; Riches &amp; Pleaſures of the World.</p>
               <p>The Seed of Faith Proſpers only in the Good Ground: there, tho' ſmall and as a Grain of Muſtard-feed, it grows and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>It had ſome fair Beginnings in the Stony Ground and Thorny Ground; there were ſome motions, ſome meltings &amp; ſome Good Affections, ſome Breathings in Prayer; and Delight in Ordinances; as in Hearing the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here were fair Beginnings! So it is with many. Oh! ſee how far a man
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001527_0013_0FB39DD3F511FBB8"/>
may go; and yet be never the near after all. The Stony and the Thorny Ground were nearer to the nature of the Good Ground, than that of the High Way; and yet no Fruit of Faith: they fell Short of Heaven. They had ſome ſproutings of Faith, a ſort of Faith; but yet far ſhort of Saving: they attained to a Faith but yet (our Text tells us,) <hi>They fell away,</hi> and miſſed of Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is not Every Faith, that is Saving: there are many that attain to a Faith; but yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain the End of their Faith. It is a moſt certain Truth, That there are many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that ſhall never be Saved; for all Faith in the Name of Chriſt is not ſound &amp; ſaving. It is true, it is granted, that Faith or Believing is the Goſpel Condition of Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.36. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be Saved, but he that Believeth not ſhall be Damned.</hi> Faith &amp; Salvation are inſeparably Connected; and without Faith there is no Salvation. This is the Hinge of our Salvation: Here is the Condition of Life under the new Covenant: The Covenant of Grace is, <hi>Believe</hi> &amp; <hi>Live; Believe</hi> &amp; be <hi>Saved.</hi> Faith is the Condition; but then you had need look to your Faith, that it be of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001527_0014_0FB39DD5BB61B8A0"/>
Right Stamp: a Faith of the Operation of God; for Every Believing is not Saving: there are many that Believe &amp; are Damned; as well as others that Believe and are Saved. Great Numbers Pretend to Faith; &amp; Hold up a Head of Profeſſion; but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors that are no Believers; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Believers, that have not Faith; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that have Faith, that miſs of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Many there are of Great Profeſſion, that Live and Dye in ſtrong Deluſion; &amp; miſs of Heaven in the Height of their Hopes; being miſtaken, as to the Foundation of their Faith. There are many in Hell, that have had a Preſumptuous Confidence that they ſhould get to Heaven: <hi>Praeſumendo Sperant &amp; Sperando Pereunt</hi>: Many Damned, that have been Perſwaded, they ſhould be Saved: there are many, that go believing to Hell; their Eyes never opened till ſhot into the other World.</p>
               <p>Many grow bold in an Ignorant Sottiſh Conceit of their good Eſtate, becauſe of ſome good affections; &amp; becauſe they have ſome ſlighter Experiences, tho' unſound: ſome taſte of the good Word of God and a Faith, that hath ſprung from a Delight in Hearing the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001527_0015_0FB39DD6F146C6D0"/>
Word: they have Received the Word with joy; as the ſtony Ground; which for a while Believe; and yet miſcarry at laſt and miſs of Heaven; their Faith being not the Faith of Gods Elect; as wanting its true Object, and a Good Foundation, having no Root; and therefore cannot ſtand in the Day of Tryal, againſt the Burning Tempeſt &amp; Floods of the Wrath of God to come: thoſe ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will wither up their ſhallow Roots.</p>
               <p>But for a more methodical Proceeding, in the management of the Truth in Hand briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We ſhall Confirm the Truth from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Proving, <hi>That there is a Believing that is not Saving.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>For Confirmation</hi>; The Scriptures of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001527_0016_0FB39DD9727EAE78"/>
Truth tell us, that there are many Believers, <hi>That ſhall never be Saved</hi>: Our Text produceth an inſtance in the ſtony Ground Hearers, they were called <hi>Believers</hi>: they had a Faith, yet that their Faith was not Sound and Saving; as appears from the laſt Clauſe of the verſe, [<hi>In time of Temptation they fell away.</hi>] There is a Believing, that doth not put the Subjects into a ſtate of Salvation: many may be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on the Name of Chriſt; and yet not true and effectual Believers; as many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did; and yet were ſhort of Saving Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23: Men may believe on Chriſt with ſome kind of Faith; &amp; yet never be Accepted and Entertained by Chriſt with his Peculiar Love; and Conſequently never Saved.</p>
               <p>All Faith in the Name of Chriſt is not ſound and ſaving: this truth is confirmed alſo from other Scriptures: We read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. <hi>Among the chief rulers many Believed on him; but becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not confeſs him; for they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God</hi>; and therefore Chriſt tells them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44 That ſuch a Believing could be no true Faith. [<hi>How can ye Believe, that receive honour, one of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] See, <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001527_0017_0FB39DDBAED44030"/>
4.4, 32. We read there of a great Multitude, that are called <hi>Believers,</hi> to the number of about five Thouſand; but yet there were in that croud of Believers, ſundry that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound; as appears by the ſpecial inſtance of <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphira, Chap.</hi> 5. So, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. Its ſaid (of that Sorcerer) <hi>That Simon himſelf Believed; and was Baptized;</hi> but yet he had no true Faith; for (<hi>v.</hi> 21.23.) <hi>his heart was not right in the ſight of God</hi>; we find him in the Gall of Bitterneſs; and in the Bond of Iniquity. See, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Holding Faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faith have made ſhipwrack</hi>; and therefore they were Bottoms, laden with ſome kind of Faith: they had of that ware in their veſſels; how elſe could they make ſhipwrack of it: So, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,</hi> therefore there is a <hi>feigned Faith, Jam.</hi> 2.14, 17. There is a <hi>Dead Faith</hi> there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which Saves not. But thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is frequent in the mentioning of a Faith that is not Saving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 37. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We may Enquire, <hi>What Sorts of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thoſe are that miſcarry in Point of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that do Believe, but not Effectually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001527_0018_0FB39DDD526B02F8"/>Omitting needleſs diſtributious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They may be reduced to two Sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that do only Outwardly Profeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men to Believe</hi>; that do conform their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, to the ways of God; and take up a general formal Profeſſion. There are ſwarms of theſe eſpecially, in all places, where Religion is in Credit, men run with the croud and do as orders do; they put on a viſard of Religion, a common ſhew of it, without any Impreſſion; or any Conſiderable Impreſſion upon their Hearts at all.</p>
               <p>Indeed thoſe in the Text went farther than thus; for they did not only ſeem, Pretend and Counterfeit a Believing; but had ſome real Common work upon them: But yet thoſe others are in a large ſenſe called Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that do make an Outward Profeſſion, as many do for faſhions ſake; out of Cuſtom; Example of others; to pleaſe men; to be well ſpoken of, to gain Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' they have no Love to God, nor his ways, in their Souls. So. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. So men go in the croud (as they from Egypt) theſe, in a large ſenſe, are called Believers, who ſeem before men to Believe, when all this while, there is no truth of Grace in their Hearts. There is a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001527_0019_0FB39DDEA3884870"/>
great deal of ſeemingneſs in the World; and Every Grace hath its Counterfeit; and thoſe that have no Grace, can for a while Look and Live like Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ſort of Perſons, who pretend to Faith; but fall ſhort, are thoſe, <hi>That have ſome Impreſſions upon their Minds &amp; Hearts, and do really believe</hi> (and not only ſeem to do ſo) <hi>with ſome kind of Faith, which yet is not Saving and Effectual</hi>: there is ſomething, that looks like true Faith: they have ſome kind of work wrought upon them; it is not a meer outward <hi>Seeming</hi>; they have ſome kind of actings in their Minds and Hearts towards Chriſt; ſome ſtirrings of Affections. Now how far this goeth &amp; diſcovereth it ſelf; take up in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Men may take up a Profeſſion of the Truth; and not only ſeemingly, but Really</hi>: they may do as others do; be carried in the ſtream and croud of Profeſſors, in the Place, where they are; attend Ordinances; take up the Name of God &amp; Chriſt, into their Mouths; ſeem to be Religious, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. Say, <hi>Lord, Lord</hi>; give an outward Honour to the ways of Chriſt; &amp; yet fall ſhort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They may Believe the Truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001527_0020_0FB39DE0170C7F58"/>
at leaſt in a general Way</hi>; both know the Heads and Truths of Religion; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Believe them; Believe that Chriſt is the Son of God &amp; Saviour of the World. Men may believe the great Truths concerning his Perſon, Natures, Offices, Benefits; The Myſtery of his Incarnation, His Birth, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Seſſion at the Right Hand of God, &amp; Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion there, His coming to Judgment; the Reſurrection of the Body, &amp; the Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. <hi>In a word</hi>; a man may know all the Heads &amp; Points &amp; Principles of Religion; and Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Creed; and yet miſcarry in Point of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for want of Effectual Saving Faith.</p>
               <p>A man may believe, that Chriſt is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and yet fall ſhort of Saving Faith; not having a diſtinct underſtanding of the way of cloſing with Chriſt in his Offices, as the object of Faith: So they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.12. When they had ſeen the Miracles, that Jeſus did, <hi>Said, this is of a truth, that Prophet, that ſhould come into the world</hi>: they believed what was Propheſied concerning him; and that he was the Great Prophet &amp; Teacher ſent of God; and ſo his Doctrine to be true, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001527_0021_0FB39DE177945138"/>
that he was indeed the Meſſiah, that was to come; and therefore they believed on his Name: tho' they did not take up his Name aright. There was a common work of Grace upon their Hearts: there was a general work of Converſion wrought in them; but not Saving Faith: But hence they cry out; <hi>This is of a Truth the Prophet that ſhould come</hi>; and ſo; <hi>Joh</hi> 7.31. <hi>And many of the People Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, &amp; ſaid, when Chriſt cometh will he do more Miracles than theſe which this Man hath done.</hi> Theſe you ſee, had a Faith; and what they did underſtand of Chriſt &amp; of his Doctrine, they did believe it to be true. And thus there are many, that do Aſſent to the Fundamental Truths of the Goſpel: they believe what the Scriptures ſay concerning Chriſt, &amp; the way of Salvation by Faith in him; but yet fall ſhort of Saving Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man may be much Affected with and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſt, Receive his word with Joy</hi>; They may extol, applaud hint; they may behold his Works &amp; Miracles with wonderment and joy in his word; as the Stony Ground, and cry out as they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.46. <hi>Never Man ſpake as this Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The word may rap them into a great eſteem of it, and an high Perſwaſion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001527_0022_0FB39DE3128D4480"/>
concerning the Glorious Truths delivered.</p>
               <p>Never Sermon had ſuch an Impreſſion; never Preacher ſpake like this Man! But yet after ſuch Raptures of Affection, ſuch may fall away with the Stony Ground; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but for a while.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They may be Forward &amp; Earneſt for a Time, in attending upon Chriſt, &amp; Seeking after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> As thoſe, in the Text, <hi>Who for a while Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>: they may be forwardeſt with the firſt, as the Seed in the Stony Ground; ſprang up quickly &amp; forwardly. And there may be a great Zeal for the Name of Chriſt, as they ſhewed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.15, 24. <hi>They would come and take him by force, to make him a King</hi>; and they followed him, whitherſoever he went: they took Shipping and came to Capernaum, Seeking for Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Many others are zealouſly Affected, for the Name of Chriſt; and therefore have a ſtrong Faith and Confidence, that they ſhall be be accepted at that Day; as appears by there Plea, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils, &amp; in thy Name have done many wonderful Works.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001527_0023_0FB39DE58CF8ADC0"/>
their forwardneſs &amp; zeal, they fell ſhort of Saving Faith; and miſs'd of Heaven in the Height of their Hopes; for Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I never knew you: Depart from me ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> And thus we have diſcovered what ſorts of Believers they are, that miſcarry in Point of Salvation; that do Believe, but not Effectually.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We may Enquire, <hi>What Sorts of Faith ſuch attain unto</hi>?</p>
               <p>This may be eaſily gathered from the ſorts of Believers, that pretend to a Faith; but it is not Sound and Saving. There are two Sorts of Faith, that are not Saving, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Temporary</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An Hiſtorical Faith.</hi> Many, yea moſt, that live under the Sound of the Goſpel, may attain to this; and do content &amp; quiet their Hearts with a bare, Notional Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; Aſſent to the Doctrine of the Goſpel: On this Sandy Bottom moſt Profeſſors Build their Hopes for Heaven; and claim their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges among the beſt of Saints on Earth; even to Eat and Drink in Chriſts Preſence. Indeed without knowledge the Mind cannot be good; and the Hiſtory and Knowledge
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001527_0024_0FB39DE79534C5A0"/>
of Goſpel Truths is neceſſary and leading on to a Saving Faith. See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they Believe on him, of whom they have not Heard</hi>? Yet a bare Hiſtorical Faith will Scarce Diſtinguiſh the Faith of Men from the Faith of Devils, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thou Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt there is One God; Thou doeſt well; The Devils alſo Believe and Tremble.</hi> They Believe there is a God and they Tremble at his Wrath: their Hearts ake and Tremble within them. They Believe, that Chriſt is the Son of God and the Saviour of Men: See the Confeſſion of their Faith, in the Poſſeſſed Gergeſene, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.29. <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus, Thou Son of God: art thou come to Torment us before our Time?</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Believe and Tremble; but how many among us, worſe than Devils in this Reſpect, that Believe, but never Tremble at the Wrath of God; and at the Wrath of the Lamb; a Generation of Gods Wrath; who are warned, but never awakened to flee from the Wrath to come, <hi>Matt,</hi> 3.7. They Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Judgment, and Know the Terrour of the Lord; they have an Hiſtorical Faith, but more Regardleſs than Devils; They Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Goſpel Truths revealed;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001527_0025_0FB39DE9082E0E20"/>
but are Strangers to the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of Godlineſs: The Hiſtory of the Great Truths of the Goſpel, Relating to the object of Saving Faith, may be attained by Reading, Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by acquaintance with the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures opened and applied in the ordinary Diſpenſations of the Miniſtry; but the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of thoſe Goſpel Truths can never be diſcerned, without Supernatural and Saving Illuminations of the Spirit working Faith in the Soul. A man may have his natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding informed in the Doctrinal Truths, neceſſary to Salvation; but his Mind blinded by Satan, leaſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. A bare Hiſtorical Faith is, when the Mind only gives aſſent to the Truth, without any work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart; this is a Sort of Faith, but far from Saving.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Temporary (or rather an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual) Faith.</hi> When there is ſome work on the Heart; but not thorough and ſolid: So the Stony Ground in our Text, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that we read of, that were Chriſts Followers; they not only Believed the Doctrine of Chriſt, ſo far as they knew of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001527_0026_0FB39DEA7479EDF0"/>
it, but alſo their Hearts were Affected: they Heard the word with joy: they did not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſemble; but they had their Hearts awed and affected with the Majeſty and Power of Chriſts Doctrine and Miracles: So that for a while, they Believed: they had a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith, now this Temporary Faith, where there is ſome kind of lighter work upon the Heart, which is not thorough, it may Expreſs it ſelf ſundry Ways, (as we find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) <hi>viz.</hi> From hence, from this Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faith, there may be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Forwardneſs in men to give up their Names to Chriſt,</hi> to become his Followers and Profeſſed Diſciples; to Enrol their Names in that little Flock and Company, that are for Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaid that Scribe) <hi>I will follow thee, whitherſoever thou goeſt, Luk.</hi> 9.61, 62.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There may be a taſte of the Sweetneſs of the Things of Chriſt, of his Word, Grace, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Heavenly Priviledges,</hi> Heb. 6.4—6. Having a taſte of the Gift of Faith; they may alſo have a Tranſitory and Lighter Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sweetneſs of the Word and Joys of Heaven, by ſome Hopes and Pangs of Tranſporting Affection: as Balaam had,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001527_0027_0FB39DEBF4970728"/>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10 <hi>Who can Count the Duſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob and the Number of the fourth Part of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrael? Let me dye the Death of the Righteous, and let my laſt End be like his.</hi> So the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ground, in the Text, Joy in Hearing the Word and the affecting things therein.</p>
               <p>And ſo, on the other ſide, there may be Tears and Terrours in the apprehenſions of Wrath; as in <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>: The Affections may be ſtirred; and yet the Rock, the ſtone in the Heart never broken; the Will and Affection never throughly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and transformed; the Conſcience never purged; and the Heart never took off from all other things to cleave to Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There may be a Doing of ſeveral Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Services for Chriſt</hi>; for which they may have much applauſe from men and be lifted up in the Mouths of others, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22. They may be Miniſters admired in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Preach well, and they may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in their Places, and by their Gifts, to do much Good: God may ſo Sanctify a mans Gifts, as to make them Profitable to others; and yet not unto the Salvation of his own Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There may be an Affectionate Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001527_0028_0FB39DEEF892D190"/>
for the Preſent; and Conviction of the Excellency of Chriſt;</hi> and that none is like to Chriſt: Joh. 7.46. <hi>The Officers anſwered, never Man Spake like this Man.</hi> Yet we have not Grounds to think, that they were Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly wrought upon; for they go their ways and return to the Tents of his Enemies. They were but for the Preſent overpowred and aſtoniſhed by the Majeſty, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, and in his Word: So <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.28, 29. <hi>And it came to Paſs, when Jeſus had Ended theſe Sayings, the People were aſtoniſhd at his Doctrine; for he taught them, as one having Authority and not as the Scribes.</hi> They were ſtrangely tranſported and rap'd with an Extaſy of admiration and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at his Doctrine; for he taught them, as having authority: but how many Heard Chriſt at that Time, who in Hearing did not Hear: yet all this that we have been ſpeaking of falls ſhort, becauſe the whole Heart is not Divorced from all things elſe, &amp; turned to God in Chriſt Jeſus. There is no Effectual Change in the Soul; but the Rock is unbroken the thorn unſtubbed up: Men Sow among Thorns; and hence the Fruit is choaked. And thus we have Diſcovered,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001527_0029_0FB39DF080E8C5D8"/>
what Sorts of Faith are not Saving and Effectual.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>We may Enquire into the Flaws and Defects of Faith: whence it Proves Ineffectual and Unſound</hi>?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When the Object of Faith is not Rightly underſtood and diſcerned.</hi> This Defect is ſuch a Flaw, as Renders the Faith of ſuch of none Effect: and here many miſs it in Point of Salvation: thus it was with many in the Goſpel, that followed Chriſt and did indeed Believe, that he was the Meſſiah; they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a right underſtanding of Chriſt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, whom they were to cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: So they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.14.15. They dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Temporal Kingdom and a Temporal Advantage and Pomp, to come by the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, which was the Common Errour of the Iews at that Time: They Embraced him, as a Worker of Miracles, by whom his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might have Glory and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they did not underſtand the Spiritual Office of Chriſt; nor did they look at the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bleſſings to be had by him: They Miſtook the Perſon, they Believed on; or at leaſt were not duly Informed concerning him out of the Word; and ſo were not well Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001527_0030_0FB39DF2413F9868"/>
either in the Knowledge of the Object, or the Word of Faith. Theſe Defects and Flaws Spoil'd all: Their Faith was not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon the True Object.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second Flaw and Defect in Faith, that makes it unſound and ineffectual, is <hi>The want of an Inward Spiritual Work of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Regeneration.</hi> When Perſons are ſtrangers to Inward Regenerating Grace and change of Heart; then they are ſtrangers to Saving Faith. Whatever other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Excellencies they may Pretend to, Relating to the Knowledge of the Object of Faith, Eminency of Gifts, Parts, Place or whatever; yet without Inward Regenerating Grace, wrought by the Spirit, cauſing a Change of Heart; no Saving Faith. We have an Inſtance of this in Nicodemus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1—10. He was a man in Place, a Phariſee, a Ruler of the Jews, One that was a Follower of Chriſt, an admirer of him: <hi>Rabbi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>We know that thou art a Teacher, Sent from God. v.</hi> 2. He had a Reſpect for Chriſt; and hence Chriſt falls upon him with that, in the firſt Place, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> i. e. Thou art taken with the Miracles; and giveſt me
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001527_0031_0FB39DF370CAC8A0"/>
Honourable Titles; and haſt ſome Good general Affections; yea but thou wanteſt ſtill a Work of Regeneration, a new Birth, a Change of Heart and State, a Spiritual Work of Grace Soaking into the whole Heart, and making the Frame thereof new: without this thou canſt never come to Heaven. Do not think, that a General Hiſtorical Faith or ſome general Good Affections will ſerve without Regeneration: And hence alſo ſuch want the Preparatory work of Sound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in order to Saving Faith. Such have not the Fallow Ground broken up; nor are they Broken off from their Sins and Selves: they yet remain like the Stony Ground: the rock at the Bottom remains ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Flaw and Defect, rendering Faith Ineffectual, is, <hi>Not coming up to the Goſpel Terms of Effectual Faith.</hi> Not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Goſpel Conditions of cloſing with Chriſt; Renouncing and Forſaking all other things, and Following Chriſt with the Croſs on our Backs; not getting over the Stumbling-Blocks of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Worldly Honours, Pleaſures, Profits; So as to part with all for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This was the fault Chriſt found with many
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001527_0032_0FB39DF68B933220"/>
Followers of him, and ſeeming Believers on him: Thus <hi>Nicodemus came by night,</hi> for fear of the Jews, and as aſhamed to be Known to Own Chriſt: He was not got over the Blocks of Carnal Fear and Worldly Honour: So they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. <hi>Among the Chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, many Believed on him; but did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, leaſt they ſhould be Put out of the Synagogue: for they loved the Praiſe of men more than the Praiſe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Terms of Saving Faith propounded are to forſake <hi>All</hi> to Follow Chriſt, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sin, Self, &amp; World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.26, 27, 33. The Stony Ground in the Text, fell away in Time of Temptation. The Faith of moſt can hardly comply with Goſpel Propoſals: the Terms Propoſed are not agreeable to their Diſpoſitions and Affections: Hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Faith fails them: In the Hour of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fall away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth Defect and Flaw in Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from the <hi>Falſeneſs and Hypocriſy of the Heart.</hi> Men Believe; but not with the whole Heart. This God calls for, <hi>The Heart</hi>: and this is a mark of true Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>For with the Heart man Believeth unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>: Upon this Flaw and Defect we may
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001527_0033_0FB39DF8099041E8"/>
ground the main Reaſon for the confirmation of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Why there is a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that is not Saving; and ſo, Why there are many Believers that ſhall never be Saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe God accepts of no Faith as Saving, but only that, which is with all the Heart.</hi> That which carries the whole Soul with it; that whereby a Man doth embrace whole Chriſt, according to the Terms of the Goſpel, with an whole Heart; that, that infers a change of Heart, that carries with it a New Heart, and a New Spirit. But now there may be ſome kind of Believing, and yet not come thus far.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of the Deceitfulneſs of the Heart.</hi> There is ſuch cunning and guile in the Heart, that it will <hi>ſeem</hi> to Do ſome things; <hi>ſeem</hi> to Believe, and yet not believe indeed; act a part upon the Stage of Profeſſion; and yet hide and keep its Sin: yea not only deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, but a Man's Self, by its fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and partial comings off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe of the ſtrong and deep-rooted En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Heart againſt God and Chriſt, which is not over-come and ſubdued by lighter Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>: Nor when there is ſome Temporary good Affection towards Chriſt. The heart
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001527_0034_0FB39DF97730D090"/>
may yield a little, and yet not be changed from its enmity and oppoſition to all that is Holy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe of the Inability of Nature to put forth the Supernatural act of Faith, without the Mighty Power of the Spirit, to cauſe it ſo to do.</hi> It is above the Power of Nature, (yea tho' aſſiſted with the common workings, lighter impreſſions, ſtrivings and motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) to put forth ſuch an act as Saving Faith is: Joh. 6.65. <hi>No man can come unto me, Except it were given unto him of my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>We now Proceed to lay down the Signs of an Unſound, and the Nature of Sound and Saving Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An Unſound Faith may be Diſcovered by theſe Signs; which may have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to what hath been Premiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Faith is Unfound, that is without Previous Humiliation.</hi> A ſudden Faith and Joy, without Humiliation, without breaking of the heart <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> Sin: Such was the Faith of the Stony Ground in our Text; it had no depth: the Rock at the bottom was never broken and diſſolved. Conſider, if thy Faith hath been but a ſuddain pang of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001527_0035_0FB39DFB06665DE0"/>
Affection in Hearing the Word, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, ſight and ſenſe of Sin and Wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such ſlight Faith is not to be reſted in. When a Man on the ſuddain, hearing of the Riches and Glory of Chriſt, is taken therewith; but never was Convinced of Sin; never ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a periſhing condition; never ſtung with the fiery Serpent; never loſt, poor, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, blind, naked in thine own feeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why this is a ſhallow Faith, which a little heat of the Sun will wither away. Till a Man ſee Sin, as the greateſt Evil; he will never prize Chriſt, as the greateſt good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Faith is Unſound, that doth not bring a Man to an abſolute, preſent, preremptory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to take Chriſt, and give up himſelf wholly to Chriſt upon his own Terms.</hi> So it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; Chriſt makes his Motion, requires their Hearts, bids them renounce all other Lovers, and imbrace Him alone for ever; but when the Heart gives him good Words, and yet puts him off, and ſaith, <hi>I will hereafter,</hi> at ſuch a Time, <hi>I will conſider of it</hi>; and ſo continues Parlying &amp; Bartering with Chriſt; but comes not to an abſolute Marriage conſent, to part with all, and cloſe with him; this is a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of an Unſound Heart. Why if there be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001527_0036_0FB39DFEF29BFE60"/>
not ſuch a Faith as reacheth the proper Work of Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> The abſolute Taking and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt on his own Terms; then true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is here no effectual Faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.61. The Unſound heart hath ſtill ſome-what to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will Follow Chriſt: it never comes to a preſent cloſing with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That Faith is not ſound, which is not ſee upon the Perſon of Chriſt, upon Chriſt Himſelf.</hi> To run away with the Word and Promiſe, and to miſs of Chriſt himſelf, is a broken Faith, which will deceive. Saving Faith doth not only cloſe with a Truth or Propoſition, but with a Perſon. Many, when they hear of the Word, the Promiſe, (viz. <hi>He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth &amp; forſaketh, ſhall find Mercy. He that hungers and thirſts after Righteouſneſs, ſhall be filled. He that Mourns is Bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c.) Why they apply the Promiſe to themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truth of it, and ſo have Peace: Here they reſt, and here is all their Faith but to believe on Chriſt, and Match and Cloſe with the Perſon of Chriſt, this they are great Strangers to.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That Believing that a Man has found Eaſy, which he could do and attain of himſelf, by his own Strength, that is Unſound.</hi> Right
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001527_0037_0FB39E0040C1AA20"/>
Faith is not of our ſelves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. The Lord makes the Soul, on whom he works effectually, to feel that it is not of Himſelf, it is not in his own Power to Believe; it is a Supernatural Work (as we have heard.) If a Mans Faith be bred by Fleſh and Blood; by his own Will and Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a baſe, baſtard Faith, and not begotten of the right Father, and therefore ſhall never poſſeſs the Inheritance. If there hath not been a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Hand and Power on thy Heart, thou art in a State of Nature to this day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That Faith that doth not Separate and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Man from every known Sin, and ſet him upon a Warfare againct all Sin whatſoever; that Faith is not Sound.</hi> Faith ſo ſeparate, I mean, as to make a Man willing to part with Sin, &amp; deſirous to improve all means againſt it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That Faith that is Barren &amp; Unfruitful, is an Unſound Faith</hi>; that brings not forth Fruits of Grace and New Obedience in the Life, and Converſation. When a Man hath a Faith, that does him no good, that he is never the better for; the Faith that brings no Life into the heart, no quickning Spirit into the Soul; but a Man is the very ſame after he has believed, as he was before; Dead to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001527_0038_0FB39E01E03CAB98"/>
all good Works; when there is no Working by Love. That is a falſe Faith that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8, 9. And know for a certainty, that the Faith that never <hi>Sanctifies</hi> thee, will never <hi>Save</hi> thee in the Day of Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next Branch to be Enquired into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, <hi>The Nature of Sound &amp; Saving Faith.</hi> And I intend here, only ſome brief hints, both Negatively and Affirmatively; to ſhew both what it is not, and what it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively</hi>: Which may lead us to a right underſtanding of it, and the Premiſſes may be helpful herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Saving Faith is not a bare Knowledge of, or Aſſent to the Truth of the Scriptures</hi>; to believe the things that are written in the Law and Goſpel: tho' this muſt be, but this is not Saving Faith, <hi>James</hi> 2.19. Neither is it the Truth of the Scripture only in general, but Chriſt Jeſus, the Perſon of Chriſt, that is the Object of Saving, Juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither is it the bare Believing of Chriſt, or of the Truth about the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> Tho' this is neceſſary; Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not Believed? And how ſhall they Believe in him
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001527_0039_0FB39E036063DAD8"/>
of whom they have not heard?</hi> &amp;c. There cannot be believing <hi>on</hi> Chriſt, without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>of</hi> Him, without Knowledge and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Truth concerning his Perſon, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Offers and Benefits. There muſt be in all Adult Believers a competent Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Things, and Aſſent to them; this is abſolutely neceſſary. True Faith is an Affiance grounded upon Knowledge: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Chriſt cannot be Believed on, as, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23. <hi>Paul</hi> found an Altar at <hi>Athens</hi> with this Superſcription: [<hi>To the Unknown God,</hi>] <hi>whom therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ignorantly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> But this is not enough; to believe Chriſt and to believe on Chriſt are ſeveral things; the former is but the act of the Mind, the latter of the Will alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Nor is it an Aſſurance or Settled perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Mans Intereſt in Chriſt, and of the Lords Everlaſting Love to him in Chriſt.</hi> Tho' this being rightly grounded is a Precious, ſweet and comfortable thing; and true Faith ought to grow up to this. It is fearful Security for any to be at reſt without Aſſurance; but yet this Aſſurance is not the proper act of Saving, Juſtifying Faith; but follows it, as preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it: for there muſt be Intereſt in Chriſt,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001527_0040_0FB39E06B4D60BF8"/>
in order of Nature, before there can be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it; and there muſt be Saving Faith, before Intereſt, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> To ſpeak Poſitively, What this ſound and effectual Faith is, that is the condition, upon which Salvation is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Goſpel. Not to enter into any large or full Diſcourſe. In Sum, you may take up this Deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>Deſcirp. <hi>Saving Faith is a Saving Grace of the Spirit, whereby we Receive and Reſt upon Chriſt Jeſus, for Righteouſneſs and Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or more fully.</p>
               <p>Effectual Faith or Believing, Is when a Soul, feeling its Sinful and Periſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receiveth Chriſt, as he is freely offered in the Goſpel, reſteth on him, as an Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Saviour for Righteouſneſs and Life.</p>
               <p>This ſets forth the Nature of Saving Faith, whereby an humbled Sinner, being perſwaded of, and aſſenting to the Truth of the Goſpel, and Chriſt revealed therein; he doth heartily embrace and reſt on Him for Righteouſneſs and Salvation. But the Nature of Saving
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001527_0041_0FB39E090511F558"/>
Faith may be more familiarly ſet forth, by the eſſential requiſites comprized in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>There are four eſſential requiſites, that go to the conſtitution of Saving Faith. There muſt be, (1) An humbling ſight and ſenſe of Sin, and Miſery by Sin. (2) A ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, revealed and freely offered in the Goſpel. (3) An embracing and receiving Chriſt thus offered. (4) A reſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon him for Righteouſneſs and Life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There muſt be an Humbling ſight &amp; ſenſe of Sin.</hi> This Humiliation (or ſenſibleneſs of Sin) whether you call it a part of Faith, taken largely; or a preparation for Faith, taken ſtrictly: to be ſure it is a neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite unto Believing. It is the humble Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican that comes to Chriſt for Mercy in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13, 14. Faith &amp; flying to Chriſt, the City of Refuge, is but a Notion to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and unhumbled. In believing there is, <hi>A flying for Refuge and Help to Chriſt</hi>; and implies ſenſe of evil and danger. There is an hearty embracing of a Remedy, that preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth hearty ſenſe of a diſeaſe. It was the bitten Iſraelite that looked to the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. It is the ſtung and wounded Sinner,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001527_0042_0FB39E0A05B4EC18"/>
that will look in earneſt to Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12, 13. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. There muſt be a cloſing with a Saviour from Sin, as <hi>Precious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. That implies, that Sin is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be bitter: The Soul muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that it is Periſhing; thy Periſhing condition muſt be felt: there muſt be a ſenſe and feeling thereof; as the famiſhing man feels what it is to be hungry: the man that is in danger of his Life, feels what it is to cry out for help: the ſick man feels what it is to need and prize the Phyſician. Oh! was thy heart ever wounded for Sin and made ſick of it? Did the Lord ever awaken thee by his Word, not only to Dream of a Natural Eſtate; but to ſee it; to ſee thy ſelf a dead man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power and Guilt of Sin, under the ſtrength of the curſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Has the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit convinced thee of Sin? That is the firſt ſtep in order to the Working of Saving Faith, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second requiſite of Saving Faith, is, <hi>The ſight of the Object, a ſight of Jeſus Chriſt revealed and freely offered and held forth in the Goſpel.</hi> And this revelation and offer, it muſt be entertained with an underſtanding &amp; aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Truths revealed. There is in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001527_0043_0FB39E0B73A223C0"/>
Faith (or goes to the making up of Faith) <hi>Knowledge, Aſſent,</hi> and <hi>Affiance</hi>; the former of theſe cannot be without the revelation of the object; and the two latter cannot be without the former. There muſt be a revelation of a Chriſt, and a ſight of Chriſt in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order to the cloſing with him by the Will: Joh. 6.40. <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me. Every one that ſeeth the Son and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, may have everlaſting Life</hi>: — and this ſight is both by Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the doctrine of Chriſt, and by aſſent thereunto, or being perſwaded of the truth thereof, which precedes embracing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31.</p>
               <p>Make not a light matter of the revelation and offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel: it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſite to Saving Faith. In the day of Grace when the Spirit, by its powerful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, works Saving Faith in the Soul; it doth it by opening the eyes of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſee Chriſt revealed and freely offered in the Goſpel, and letting in the ſweetneſs and ſavour of it to the Heart and Will; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.16, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed that a man may have the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and ſome real

ſight of the things of Chriſt; and yet not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly embrace them; as in thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and yet fall away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.26. And thoſe, in our text, <hi>Who for a while Believe.</hi> There is ſome revelation, ſome light, ſome knowledge; but ordinarily and uſually men that live in unbelief, they are Defective in knowledge of what is revealed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, concerning the object of Faith; or at leaſt in aſſent to what is revealed; eſpecially this latter; but Chriſt, as an All-ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with his Redemption, Righteouſneſs, Benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> revealed in the Goſpel and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered and held forth; is the ground of our Believing or cloſing with him by Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third eſſential requiſite of Saving Faith, is, <hi>The Souls embracing and receiving Chriſt, thus revealed and offered, even the Perſon of Chriſt, Chriſt himſelf.</hi> God holds forth his Son, and the Soul takes him; that is Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. Faith it is the Souls embracing,— receiving, reſting relying on, truſting in Chriſt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and offered in the Goſpel. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth that <hi>Fiducia</hi> or Affiance, which is the main or moſt formal act and nature of Saving Faith. Theſe terms expreſs the formal and fiducial act of Faith, reſting on Chriſt or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001527_0045_0FB39E0FF4CEB510"/>
in him; this is the formal nature of Faith: hence it is not only to believe Chriſt; but to believe on Chriſt: hence believing is oft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by truſting (as, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.21.) and that imports theſe three actings of Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A rolling and caſting our ſelves upon Chriſt, having no other bottom to ſtand on, and ſeeing with him a Rock able to bear us, and Arms open to receive us.</hi> Now we throw our ſelves &amp; our whole weight upon him, and fall into his Arms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.22 <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſtaying, hanging, leaning, depending upon him,</hi> Iſai. 50.10. <hi>Who is among you, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light; let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, &amp; ſtay upon his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>An Acquieſcence in Chriſt</hi>; a reſting of the heart in him (as well as on him) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that he is alſo able (as well as faithful) to be and do that which we depend upon him for. And now being come to the Rock of Ages &amp; built upon it; having committed our ſelves to Chriſt, embracing him, and relying on him; now we reſt there, as in One, in whom there is good enough to ſatisfy us, and power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to help us and ſave us; and who is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001527_0046_0FB39E1233060EB8"/>
faithful to fulfill what he hath promiſed. The ſoul ſeeth him able enough to ſuſtain him, a rock and bottom ſtrong enough to bear him: he ſees his arms long enough to reach, ſtrong enough to hold him; ready enough to embrace him: hence he caſts and throws himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and ſeeing no help nor hope in himſelf; no ability at all to ſave &amp; deliver; and ſeeing Chriſt able, mighty, faithful, willing to help, every way All-ſufficient: hence the Soul finds in him an everlaſting foundation; a rock fit to ſtay on; hence it lets all other hopes and ſtays go; and reſts and truſts here for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith is a reſting and relying on Chriſt for righteouſneſs and life</hi>; for righteouſneſs unto juſtification, <hi>Rom,</hi> 5.17. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.24. <hi>In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> We do not only want power from Chriſt to help us; but righteouſneſs to be the matter of our Juſtification; the foundation and ground of our whole Salvation; for that is the inlet of Life eternal. In acting of Faith the Soul comes in ſpecial to Chriſt for Righteouſneſs: Rom. 10.4, 10. <hi>For Chriſt is the End of the Law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And Faith looks to Chriſt, as for impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs unto Juſtification; ſo alſo
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001527_0047_0FB39E13B2EF0060"/>
for inherent Righteouſneſs and Life in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: And hence Faith is a relying on Chriſt for Life; Spiritual Life began in the Grace of Sanctification here, and compleated in the perfection of Glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the eſſential requiſites of Saving Faith, ſetting forth the formal Nature of it, which few attain unto. The truth is, Moſt Profeſſors content themſelves with a falſe Ineffectual Faith, like the Temporaries in the Text, <hi>Who for a while believe, and in Time of Temptation fall away</hi>: Or as others, who at laſt miſs of Heaven in the height of their hopes, being miſtaken as to the grounds of their Faith not well rooted. It is not every Faith, that is Saving; nor every Believer that ſhall be Saved; nor every one that Crys, <hi>Lord, Lord, that ſhall enter into the Kingdom.</hi> The Way through Faith to Salvation is a difficult Way to hit, and dangerous to miſs; and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes miſcarry, even many of thoſe that are Believers, who ſhall never be Saved.</p>

and for a while Believe</hi>: but neither is this a faith that reacheth home. Oh! it highly concerns all to ſee whether they have that Faith that accompanies Salvation. Fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of Examination, grounded upon the Premiſſes &amp; the Nature of Saving Faith; If you pretend to faith,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Examine which way you came by your faith.</hi> Conſider how faith was wrought in thee; or whether thou haſt a kindly work of faith wrought in thy Soul.

               <p>Has it broke thy heart, that yet, after all thy backſlidings, He ſhould lift up a cry of

Grace in thine Ears? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. Haſt thou been made to hear the Voice of Chriſt's call in the Goſpel, and been thereby drawn to come to him, and to receive him, and cloſe with him? Was it thy ſpecial end in coming to Chriſt, to get Poſſeſſed of himſelf, and by him deliverance from Sin and Spiritual Life? and has that been the voice of thy Soul in coming to him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Take away all iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He, that hath had Faith wrought in his heart, hath been made to know what theſe things mean: ſuch Breathings and Workings as theſe, are the Footſteps of the Spirit of Grace, and Expreſſions of that Faith, which is of the operation of God. Thus (I ſay) Examine which way you did come by your Faith: How ſaith was wrought in you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Examine whether you have changed the Reſt of your Souls.</hi> Where there is true faith, the Reſt of the Soul is changed; there is a reſting upon Chriſt or in him; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is the formal Nature of faith; a reſting and relying on Chriſt for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Life.

Light &amp; Glory) Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, Sound and Saving Faith: And would you by Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation have further Knowledge of it, what it is? For your further help here, take theſe three Characters of a ſound &amp; effectual Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Faith is ſound, that is accompanied with a forſaking of all for Chriſt</hi>; Sin, Self, &amp; World, and all the Luſts and Vanities thereof.

We ſee it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Faith that is Saving; much leſs any thing ſhort of Faith: and yet many ſuch things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons place their Truſt and Confidence in, and build their Hopes of Salvation upon.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some would gather up hopes for Heaven, becauſe of their Happineſs here on Earth.</hi> Their Outward Proſperity wherein God Bleſſeth them, from whence they gather that God loves them; and it ſhall be for ever well with them: and here they bottom their hopes for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If any ſhould be ſo ſtupid and fooliſh as to reſt in worldly Wealth, Riches &amp; Honours and Comforts of Outward Eſtate; why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe are not Faith, nor akin to it. The Lord hath no where ſaid in all the Scripture, That he that is a <hi>Rich man,</hi> or a <hi>Great man,</hi> ſhall go to Heaven. Riches do not carry Faith along with them, nor help to it; but often much hinder it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.23. The Young man in the Goſpel went away ſorrowful, <hi>for he had great Poſſeſſions</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>A rich man can hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. <hi>For you ſee your Calling Brethren, how that not many Wiſe men, after the Fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called.</hi> The Pooreſt Man on Earth may get to Heaven, as ſoon as the Richeſt, you often ſooner.

Rich in Faith, that is the Heir to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some build up their Hopes and Confidence, upon their Gifts and Parts.</hi> Natural and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Wit, Memory, Learning, Activity, Knowledge of Arts, or Skill therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why theſe are good and commendable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and very uſeful, and make men famous, but theſe are not Faith: theſe alone will not Save.

to ſome Vices; and more apt to gain Love and Eſteem, than others are: but this is not Faith, no nor Sanctification. The Young Man in the Goſpel was of an Amiable Lovely Diſpoſition and Demeanour: <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. <hi>Jeſus beholding him, Loved him</hi>; and yet miſſing of Chriſt, he miſſes of Heaven. An <hi>Abſolom</hi> can ſo pleaſingly carry it, as to Steal the Hearts of the men of Iſrael; and yet a Graceleſs Wretch. Be it, thy Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Carriage is ſuch, as every one is taken with thee; yet take heed of Reſting in that, that will not ſuffice.

Oh! The ſtopping of time Ears to Day, may be thy Undoing for ever. Thou lotteſt upon more time; but rememember, Luk. 12.20. <hi>Thou Fool, this Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee.</hi> And remember the Advice of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Ver. 40. <hi>Be ye therefore Ready; for the Son of Man cometh at an Hour when ye think not.</hi>

A man is in his ſins ſtill, if not in Chriſt by Faith. Faith flies to a Saviour for deliverance from ſin; but Unbelief deſpiſeth a Saviour, and chuſeth to live in ſin. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in its own Nature, is an exceeding great ſin: A deſpiſing of God, when he tenders the greateſt Gift of his Love, his only Begotten Son; when he offers Himſelf and his Grace upon the ſweeteſt and eaſieſt Terms. Oh! This ſin of Unbelief, it is a Damning ſin. And if we Enquire, <hi>Who they are, that are guilty here; and in a ſtate of Unbelief:</hi> For we ſee all men have not Faith.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>They that have no Acquaintance with Chriſt, but are utter Strangers to him; either groſly Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or utterly Negligent of Him.</hi> Where there is Faith, it brings the Soul acquainted with Chriſt: but there are, that live under the

Means and Miniſtry of the Word, that are utter ſtrangers to Chriſt, as to any diſtinct Knowledge of him. Chriſt is but a general Name, an empty Sound in their Ears: Theſe are in their Unbelief: <hi>The god of this world having blinded the minds of them that Believe not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They whoſe Hearts were never yet Broken &amp; Humbled.</hi> Faith grows in a contrite Soul; and not upon a Rock. The ſtony Ground, where the Heart is an unbroken Stone, and hath no depth of ſoft Earth, it will not bear the good Grain of effectual ſaving Faith. And how many Rocks are there, that were never Broken; hearts of Stone, never turned to Fleſh: to whom Sin was never bitter, nor Wrath terrible, nor Chriſt ſweet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They that allow themſelves in any known Sin,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.
