            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>FAITH and OBEDIENCE are the Two <hi>Pillars</hi> on which Religion stands. If either of them is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that mans Religion is Vain. And yet the greatest part of those who pretend to Christianity, fail in one of these. It is Natural for <hi>Adams</hi> Children to seek for life by works and doings of their own, without a CHRIST. They would <hi>find the Life of their Hand.</hi> The Jews sought for Salvation in a <hi>Legal way,</hi> without depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Righteousness of Christ alone for Justification unto Life: But they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it not. <hi>Wherefore? Because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> Millions of men called <hi>Christians,</hi> have split upon the same Rock. The Obedience of CHRIST alone, has been or could be Meritorious. Papists (and such Popery is Natural) teach that
<pb facs="unknown:001320_0003_0FB28935319DD010"/>
their Good Works are Meritorious of Heaven itself. A Learned man among them was not afraid to say, That if God would give him Heaven <hi>Gratis,</hi> he would not accept of it so; but would first do something to deserve it. On the other hand; There are many who think to be Saved by a Faith which is not attended with Holiness or New Obedience. Such <hi>Antinomians</hi> there were in the Apostles Dayes: To Confute whom, <hi>James</hi> wrote his Epistle; in which he sayes, <hi>What does it profit a man to say, He has Faith, &amp; have not Works? Can Faith Save him? As the Body without the Spirit is Dead, so Faith without Works is Dead also.</hi> In all Ages there have been multitudes of Professing <hi>Christians,</hi> who have in their Practice been no better than <hi>Infidels.</hi> And there seems to be more such in this than in former Generations. It is the sad apprehension of several late Authors, that the world was not more Degenerate before the <hi>Universal Deluge,</hi> than it is at this Day, One observes, That if we look through the world, of an Hundred Christians, Ninety Nine are either Heretical, or of Vicious Lives. I dare not think, (as a Late and Learned Writer believes) that of a Million of men down
<pb facs="unknown:001320_0004_0FB289365A22B068"/>
from <hi>Adam</hi> to our Dayes, scarce so much as O as has been Saved. Our late <hi>Political <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

But certain it is, that more than Twenty One Thousands yea, many Hundreds of Thousands are the Heirs of Salvation: For the Scripture speaks of them, as <hi>a Great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Which awful thought should make all Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all Church-members in special, careful to prove their real Christianity, by the Sincerity of their Obedience to the Commandments of Christ.

            <p>If the Reader would know the Reason why these Meditatious are Published by the Press, it has been thus brought to pass: Certain Pious persons who Live in a Neighbouring Town, hapning to be present when this <hi>Sermon</hi> was Preached, were very importunate for a Copy of it, which having obtained from one that took it in Short-hand, I have Pernsed and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what was brought to me by the <hi>Printer,</hi> and permitted him thus to Publish it. I shall not long trouble the world: But if! may leave any thing on the Earth, which shall be Profitable to any of the Elect of God, when I shall my self be no more seen or heard, let the Grace of God be Magnified, who has seen meet to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove one,</p>

            <p>THIS with the two following Chapters, contains the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a most Heavenly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which our Lord Jesus Christ Preached to His Disciples. The beginning of the Chapter, informs us in what place it was that Christ Preached. It was at a Mount: His Doctrine came from Heaven, the Mountain of Holiness: And a Mount was a proper place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it in. In the latter part of this Chapter, He gives an Exposition of the Moral Law; He that gave the Law on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> Expounds that Law on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001320_0007_0FB2893B343697A8"/>
Mount; and Vindicates it from those <hi>Corrupt Glosses</hi> which the Pharisees had put upon it. The Law sayes, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour; the Pharisees made an Addition to it, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That they might hate their Enemies: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Law required Love to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; therefore one not a Neighbour might be not loved, but be hated. Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed His Disciples better. He taught them a Doctrine contrary to that of the Pharisees; namely, That they should love their Enemies: And this He Confirms by Two Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Consideration of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Love and Bounty which the Most High does manifest towards all men. So that in loving their Enemies, they would resemble the Blessed and Holy God, who shews kindness to the greatest Enemies that He has on the Earth. He makes His Sun to shine on the Evil, and sends Rain on the Just, and on the Unjust. Which instructs men that they should show kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to their Personal Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Argument by which the Lord Confirms His Doctrine, is, That if they who were His Disciples should love their Friends only, they would do no more
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001320_0008_0FB28941742F9A98"/>
than the worst men in the world did. They would not out-do the Publicans. The <hi>Publicans</hi> were the <hi>Collectors</hi> of the Tribute due to the Emperor: The Chief Commissioners were Persons of Quality; they were Roman Knights; but they had inferiour Officers under them that would Oppress the People, and would Exact more than was by the Law appointed; and were therefore hated of all men. It was a Celebrated saying among the Jews, That <hi>no Publican shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now (sayes Christ) if you Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute your Brethren; that is express Love to them only, you do no more than the Publicans; you do no more than those men you count the worst in the world: If you do no more than what the Pharisees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you in, you will be very defective in your Obedience. <hi>What do you mine?</hi> i. e. more than others: <hi>Ti Peristhon quid Proestantius:</hi> What Extraordinary thing do ye do? Wherein do you Excel? You that are Christs Disciples, ought to do more than Publicans and Pharisees too: And if you will approve your selves as you ought to do, you will out-do them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:001320_0009_0FB28943579913A0"/>The DOCTRINE to be insisted on from the words is,
<hi>That it is the Duty and Property of the true Disciples of Christ, to Out-do all other men in their Obedience to the Commandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Two Particulars before us to be Enquired into.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In what Respects it is the Duty and Property of Christians to Out-do all other men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reasonableness of it.</p>
            <p>QUEST. 1. <hi>In what Respects is it the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Property of the true Disciples of Jesus Christ, to Out-do other men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>In Respect of the Universality of their Obedience to the Commandments of God.</hi> This is that that God does Require and Expect from those that are His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Deut. 10. 12. <hi>What does the Lord require of thee, but that thou shouldest walk in all His wayes?</hi> And as it is their Duty, so it is their Property. <hi>David</hi> could say, <hi>I Esteem all thy Precepts.</hi> And it is said of him, that he was a man after Gods own Heart, <hi>to fulfill all His Will.</hi> The like

spoken concerning <hi>Zechariah &amp; Elizabeth;</hi> Luk. 1. 6. <hi>They walked blameless in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord.</hi> And indeed this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sincere Servants of Christ, and those who are not so. An Hypocrite may comply with some, nay with many things that God does require: As it is said of <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>he did many things.</hi> And <hi>Jehu</hi> was a notable instance, who did some things and great things too, according to the Command of God; and yet he was not sincere in his Obedience, because there was one thing he would not do: God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to Execute judgment upon the House of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he did it readily; God commanded him to Destroy the Worship of <hi>Baal,</hi> he did that too; but then he knew was the Command of God that the Claves <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> those Idols should be removed, but that did not comport with is carnal Interest, therefore he would not do it, which discovered the falseness <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his Heart: <hi>Jehu</hi> took no heed to walk in the Law of God <hi>with all his heart.</hi> How did that appear? <hi>He did not turn from the Sins of Jereboam,</hi> 2 King. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 31. But the real Disciples of Christ is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> doing all that God requires. And the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001320_0011_0FB28945CAECA950"/>
truth is, there is no man in the world that does duely observe all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but only the true Believer on Jesus Christ. Wherefore He has said, <hi>You are my Friends, if you do whatsoever I Command you,</hi> Joh. 15. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>It is the Duty and the Property of the true Disciple of Christ, to Out-do other men in respect of the Constancy of their Obedience.</hi> The Lord said of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he should be Established in his Kingdom, if he would be <hi>Constant</hi> in keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28 7. This is One Reason why the Covenant is called, <hi>The Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant.</hi> They have broken the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant: For that Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant People are under Obligations unto Perpetual Obedience; and they that are Sincere in their Covenant with God, will practise accordingly. They have joyned themselves to the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant, never to be forgotten. Hence <hi>David</hi> said, Psal 119. 112. <hi>I have inclined my Heart to perform thy Statutes alway, even to the End.</hi> There are Professors who are very inconstant in their Profession: They change their Religion just as the Times change. So it was with the Jews; Hos. 6. 4. <hi>Thy Goodness is as the Morning Cloud,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001320_0012_0FB2894DB12E83E0"/>
and as the Early Dew it goeth away.</hi> The People generally would be of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that was uppermost: they would be of the <hi>State Religion,</hi> let it be what it would. When there was a Good King, such an one as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they would be of the true Religion. When <hi>Manasseh</hi> came to be in the Throne, then they turned back to their Idolatry. When Godly <hi>Josiah</hi> was King, then they would be of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; but they turned to the Lord feignedly and treacherously, not with their whole heart: As was evident in that when <hi>Josiah</hi> was Dead, and his Ungodly Sons Reigned in his stead, the Body of the Nation soon revolted to their old Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions. Thus was their Goodness like the Morning Cloud and as the Early Dew; soon gone. And when men take up their Profession of Religion for Carnal Ends, and meet with Disappointments, it is very probable they will turn away from the Holy Commandment. The Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. <hi>He has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me, having loved this present world.</hi> Ecclesiastical writers tell us, That that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> of a Minister of Christ became a Priest of <hi>Jupiter!</hi> There was more Money to be get by being a Priest of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> than by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001320_0013_0FB28950B10B2918"/>
being a Preacher of the Gospel. If men begin their Profession in Hypocrisy, it is likely they will end in Apostasy: As it was with many of the pretended Disciples of Christ; Joh. 6. 66. <hi>Many of His Disciples went back, and walked no more with Him.</hi> But it was not so with His true Disciples. Therefore when Christ said to them, <hi>Will you go away also? Peter</hi> if the Name of all of them said, Lord to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of Eternal Life: <hi>q. d.</hi> We can never-mend our selves let's go where we will. As for His true Disciples, nothing can move them from their stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness, no Temptation can turn them out of the way of Obedience: or if they do turn aside, they will soon return again; <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 17,—All this is come upon us, nevertheless we have not dealt-falsely in thy Covenant: Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; altho' thou hast broken us sore in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of Death. Thus then the true Disciple of Christ is constant in his Obedience; he is the same man at all Times, in all Places, in all Companies, Fixed and Constant: wherever you find him, he is a God-fearing man.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001320_0014_0FB28951C87F79E0"/>III. <hi>It is the Duty and the Property of the true Disciple of Christ, to Out-do others in respect of Passive Obedience.</hi> In respect of a Profound Submission and Resignation to the Will of God, in whatever afflictive Dispensations of His Holy Providence may attend them. This Christ has taught His Disciples, not by Precept only, but by His Holy Example, Heb. 5. 18. <hi>He learned O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by the things that he suffered.</hi> When the greatest Agony that ever man endured was coming upon Him, He said, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi> This is the highest Obedience: For a man to Submit to the Will of God in Affliction, is a greater O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience than to do what God Requires in a way of Active Obedience. We have notable Examples of this, not only in the New, but in the Old Testament Believers. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> when God had given him a Son in a Miraculous way, for him now to part with that Son at the Command of God, was certainly a great tryal as of his Faith so of his Obedience. Nevertheless he readily complyed, rising Early to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what was Commanded him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 3 <hi>Eli</hi> when Tydings was brought to him of dismal doleful Desolations coming on his Family, said, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001320_0015_0FB2895381B45720"/>
what seemeth Him Good.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> under great Afflictions said, 2 Sam. 15. 26. If the Lord say He hath no delight in me, behold here I am, <hi>Let Him do to me <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> seemeth good to Him.</hi> And the holy Prophets are recommended to us for our imitation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; Jam. 5. 10. <hi>Take the Prophets who have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of suffering Afflictions, and of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> They were Patient under all the Afflictions that God did see meet to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise them with. It is the Property of a true Disciple of Christ, to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Choice of Affliction, that is of affliction rather than Sin; any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sin; Mat. 16. 24. If a man will be my Disciple, let him <hi>take up his Cross.</hi> If the case is so circumstanced, that he must either Sin or take up the Cross; then if he is a true Disciple of Christ, he will with his own hands take up the Cross. Thus did <hi>Moses,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. <hi>He chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of Sin for a season:</hi> That now was Singular Obedience, to choose to be on the suffering side. <hi>Moses</hi> was Heir apparent to the Crown of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being the Adopted Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> only Daughter; but he chooses to part with all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001320_0016_0FB2895CB18B3A40"/>
the Honours &amp; Riches of a Kingdom, &amp; to suffer Afflictions with a poor People of God in a Wilderness. It is then the Property of a true Disciple of Christ, to be willing to suffer for His Name; yea, to rejoyce in it: As its said of the Apostles, <hi>they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced that they there counted worthy to suffer Shame for His Name,</hi> Act 5. 41. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs loved not their Lives unto the Death. One burned to Death by Papists, for making a Profession of the Protestant Religion; <hi>Alas</hi> (said he) <hi>have I but one Life to loose for Christ? If I had as many as Hairs on my Head, I should be glad to part with them all for Christ.</hi> And the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians were rather too forward, than too backward in this matter. When none accused them, they would some of them come before the Judges and accuse themselves of being Christians, that so they might Dye for the Dear Name of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>It is the Duty of true Christians to Out-do others in respect of the manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Religious Duties.</hi> True Christianity, Godliness in the Power of it, consists very much in the manner of performing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties. As now; In hearing the Word, Luk. 8. 18. <hi>Take heed how you bear.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001320_0017_0FB2895E8DC8D2E8"/>
Many hearers of the Word, never take heed how they hear; if they come and hear, they think that is enough: But says Christ, Take heed how you hear; take heed you do not hear after a careless manner; take heed you do not hear in a drowsey and a sleepy manner but that you hear so as to profit, by what you hear. It is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true Servant of the Lord to do so; Mic. 2. 7. <hi>Do not my words do good to them that walk uprightly?</hi> They that are upright in heart, will hear after such a manner as good shall come to them by what they hear. Thus also as to Prayer: There are many Professors of Religion will Pray constantly; they will attend Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer, they will Pray in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily every day; and it may be in their Closets too, and yet all this meer Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Mat. 15. 8. <hi>They draw near to me with their Mouthes, and honour me with their Lips, but their Hearts are far from me.</hi> There are many that often Pray, but what is their Praying more than a Carcass of Religion, without any Life or Soul in it? When as the true Servants of God his Heart is in Duty, Psal. 119. 10. <hi>With my whole Heart have I sought thee.</hi> The Sincere Christian seeks the Lord with his Soul, and with his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001320_0018_0FB2895FFA30B698"/>
Spirit within him. His Prayer is not a meer formal dead thing; No, he serves the Lord fervently. It is said of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> Col. 4. 12. <hi>He Labours Fervently in Prayers for you.</hi> So again as to the Sanctification of the Sabbath: There is an External Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that men who are not the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples of the Lord will conform unto. The Jews were mighty Sabbatarians, as to an External observation; they would not do any Servile work on the Sabbath Day, they would dye first: But as to the <hi>Internal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> they were strangers to it. But the true Disciple of Christ is for an Internal, as well as an External Sabbath: His care is, that his Heart be in a Sabbath frame when the Lords Day comes; that he may be in the Spirit; that he may have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God therein. When the Sabbath comes he is glad of it, his Heart rejoyceth; when the Sabbath is ended it is a trouble to him. <hi>He calls the Sabbath a Delight, and does Honour the Lord in it, not speaking his own words,</hi> Isa. 58. 13.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>It is the Duty &amp; Property of the true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ, to Out-do others in respect of their Charity towards their Personal Enemies.</hi> They will love their Enemies; they dare not take a Personal Revenge on a particular
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001320_0019_0FB28961C9E4DA28"/>
Enemy. You see <hi>David</hi> would not, when he could easily have avenged himself, and those about him did importune him to it; but because of the fear of God he did it not. The Disciples of Christ should, and if they be true Disciples they will do so; they will show love to the greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies they have in the world: they will show their Love in Praying for them. This has Christ taught us, not only by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but by His own Holy Example. As for the Jews that Crucified Him, He Prayed that God would forgive them; Luk. 23. 34. <hi>Father Forgive them, &amp;c. Stephen</hi> a true Disciple of Christ, when his Adversaries were stoning him to Death, he Prayed, <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge.</hi> Yea, the true Disciple of Christ will not only Pray for his Enemies; but if he have an opportunity he will do them Good, as well as wish them Good: he will not requite Evil for Evil, but Evil with Good; Rom. 12. 20. <hi>If thine Enemy hunger, seed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink.</hi> And indeed in this Precept of forgiving the greatest injuries, our Christian Religion does Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other Religions. The Jews thought they might Revenge themselves, that they might hate their Enemies; and they counted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001320_0020_0FB2896791BF3A68"/>
all that were not Jews to be their Enemies. Some of the Jewish <hi>Rabbies</hi> say of all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as the Papists do of Protestants, That it is no more Sin to Kill one of them than to Kill a Dog. And the Philosophers among the Gentiles, altho' they taught Excellent Morality in many particulars; in this the greatest Moralists of them fell short in their Doctrine, and much more in their Practice. They taught, that if a man had sustained a little Injury he may do well to forgive it; but if a great One, they say he should not forgive it, but be revenged for it. Christ teaches His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples better than so. The Emperor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> justly Sir-named <hi>the Apostate,</hi> was a man of great Morality; with respect to this particular, he discovered that he had a Graceless Soul. He would Scoff at many Holy Sayings of Christ in this Sermon Preached at the Mount, and would parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Deride at a mans forgiving his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Enemies. Well but the true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ will do it, tho' others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Christians, would you not be glad to know whether you are true Disciples or no? This is one of the greatest signs of it that can be mentioned. If a Christian thinks with himself, God has forgiven me
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001320_0021_0FB28968F8A21F88"/>
greater Injuries than ever I received from any man, therefore they that have been injurious to me, I will heartily forgive them! This is one of the greatest signs of a true Believer that can be.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>It is the Duty and Property of the true Disciples of Christ, to Out-do other men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their hatred of, and opposition unto Sin.</hi> Ye that love the Lord hate Evil. If men love the Lord, they will hate the Evil of Sin more than any Evil whatsoever. They will not allow themselves in such sins, as other men do indulge themselves in. They are careful &amp; watchful not only against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deeds, but also not to sin in Words. The man that ruleth not his tongue, his Religion is vain. He only seems to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>I will take heed to my wayes, that I Sin not with my Tongue,</hi> Psal. 39. 1. Nay, the true Disciple of Christ is careful not to Sin so much as in his Thoughts: He hates vain Thoughts, much more vile ones. <hi>I hate vain Thoughts: but thy Law do I love,</hi> Psal. 119. 113. In a word; The true Disciple of Christ will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from every thing that he knows or thinks is a Sin against God; Psal. 119. 101. <hi>I have refrained my Feet from every Evil way.</hi> The true Disciple of Christ will not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001320_0022_0FB2896A78419C80"/>
refrain from Greater Grosser Evils only, but from Lesser also; such as the world it may be, makes no Conscience of. There are some men that would be counted Christians, who will not Swear bloody Oathes, but will Swear such as they call <hi>Petty Oathes;</hi> they will Swear by their <hi>Faith and Treth.</hi> But Christ sayes to His Disciples, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Again; There are some that would be counted true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, they will not Blaspheme the Name of the Holy God, but they will take His Name in vain: At every turn they will say, <hi>Lord Bless me!</hi> And without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of that Fearful Name, they will say, <hi>O Lord! O God!</hi> Christ does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low His Disciples to do so. And there are those that will use weighty Assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about trifling matters; they will say, <hi>Wom it is so: I Swear it is so.</hi> Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord Jesus Christ allows not His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples in such needless Asseverations. He sayes, Let your Communication be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> what is more is from Evil. Moreover, The true Servants of God will not only abstain from Sin themselves; but will bear a due Testimony against the Sins of the world about them. They will have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001320_0023_0FB2896D86F23A90"/>
Darkness; but reprove them rather: yea, tho' they Expose themselves to the hatred of the would for it. Christ said unto some of His Natural Relations who were Ungodly men; The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth; because <hi>I testify that the works thereof are Evil,</hi> Joh. 7. 7. So will the Faithful Servants of Christ Testify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sins of the Times; altho' it should Expose them to the rage of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant world, and cost them their Lives. <hi>John Baptist</hi> did so; and the holy Prophets did so. Therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> said to the Jews, <hi>Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers Persecuted, and Slain them?</hi> Act. 7. 52. The Jews themselves own it: They tell us, That the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> was sawn asunder for his Faithfulness in reproving the Sins of King <hi>Manasseh,</hi> who was his near Kinsman: And that the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> had his Brains knock'd out by wicked men: That the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was Murdered in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> because they witnessed against the Sins of a wicked World. This is Singular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>It is the Duty and Property of the true Disciples of Christ, to Out-do others in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedness, and in weanedness from this
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001320_0024_0FB28971243731C8"/>
world.</hi> This does Christ require of His Disciples, Mat. 6. 19, 20. <hi>Lay not up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures on Earth; but lay up for your selves Treasures in Heaven:</hi> Let your Hearts be there; let your Treasure be there. This is proper to real Christians. It is said of the holy Patriarchs, Heb. 11. 13. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a better Countrey; that is an Heavenly one.</hi> Ay, their hearts was there; their hearts were not glued to this Earth. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> could say he had <hi>a weaned Soul,</hi> Psal. 131. 2. His heart was taken off from the Riches and Honours of this world. And this is true of the Sincere Disciples of Christ, more than of other men: Other men their <hi>Portion is in this world;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their hearts are set more upon Earth than upon Heaven. There is not an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer in this world, but if the Lord should say to him, Take thy choice, either come to me in Heaven; or live on the Earth in all Temporal Felicity; he would chuse to live here for ever. But it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise with the true Disciple of Christ; he longs for Heaven. The chief reason of his willingness to abide here, is that he may do service for Christ. <hi>For me</hi> (said the Apostle) <hi>to live is CHRIST.</hi> If Christ should say to the Believer, Wilx
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001320_0025_0FB289757977CEA8"/>
thou come to me, or remain on the Earth? he would say, Nay, Lord, let me be where thou art. He has by Faith seen that there is a better World than this: A World in which there is no Sin; and he can't but love such a world; a world where Christ is to be seen in all His Glory, and he can't but long to be there. There are his Thoughts, there is his Heart, there are the desires of his Soul. <hi>I desire to be with Christ,</hi> which is far better than to be in this world, Phil. 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that it is both the Duty and the Property of the Disciples of Christ to do more than others. We proceed to Enquire into the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it. I shall mention but Two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons briefly.</p>
            <p>Reason 1. <hi>God has done and will do greater things for Believers on Christ, than for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in the world.</hi> Therefore they have infinite reason to study how they may do more for Him. There is not a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the world, but God has done glorious things for him. The Lord has given him that which is more Valuable than all Earthly Riches: He has given Grace to him: And the least dram of true saving Grace, is more worth than all the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001320_0026_0FB2897735BC68A0"/>
Silver and Gold and Jewels that this world does afford. Grace is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Rubies, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared with it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 15. As for the true Believer, God has Pardoned all his Sins, which were many. Suppose a man were deeply in Debt, if the Creditor should frankly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him all his Debts, would he not think that he could never do enough for one that has been so kind to him? And can we ever do enough for God, who has free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitted our Infinite Debts, which it was impossible for us Ever to satisfy for? And yet the Law Condemned us to Prison until the utmost Farthing was paid. And if we are Believers on Christ, God has A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted us to be His Children; 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>You shall be my Sons and Daughters, faith the Lord Almighty.</hi> He will then give them a Glorious Inheritance, nothing less than a Kingdom. It may be, they are Poor Contemptible People, that make no figure in the world; yet they are Heirs of a Kingdom, Better &amp; Greater than all the <hi>Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi> put them all together. Jam. 2. 5. <hi>Has not God chosen the Poor of this world, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom which He has promised to them that love Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001320_0027_0FB28978C8B77200"/>Reason 2. <hi>True Believers on Christ are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do more in a way of Obedience, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can.</hi> That Principle of Grace which is wrought in their Souls, is a mighty thing. It is <hi>Might in the Inner man,</hi> Eph. 3. 16. Thences are they able to resist Temptation, so as others cannot. How did Godly <hi>Joseph</hi> resist great Temptations? <hi>How can I do this wickedness, and Sin against God?</hi> said he. If he had not had Grace in his Soul, such a Temptation would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> withstood such Temptations as few in the world would or could have done. It was because there was a principle of the Fear of God in his Heart; Neh. 5. 15. <hi>So did not I, because of the Fear of God.</hi> The Holy Spirit dwells in the hearts of Believers. He will not fail to assist them, if they do not Grieve Him: He will Enable them to mortify Sin so as others cannot; Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If you through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the Body, you shall live.</hi> The Holy Spirit will assist them in Duty, ver. 26. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helps our Infirmities.</hi> He helps Believers to use such Arguments with God in Prayer, as will be sure to prevail: He Enables them to Pray with such Faith, and with such brokenness of Heart, and meltings of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001320_0028_0FB2897A385DEE80"/>
Soul, as others are not acquainted with.</p>
            <p>We proceed to the APPLICATION of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> thus far Cleared.</p>
            <p>The First USE may be for INSTRUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, in several Particulars.</p>
            <p>Instruct. I. <hi>We may here see, that among Christians, there are but few true Christians to be found.</hi> Among <hi>Nominal</hi> Christians, but few <hi>Real</hi> Christians: For there are but few that Out-do others in their Obedience to the Commandments of God. They call themselves Christians, they are Christians in Profession, but in Practice like the rest of the world. <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of it in his time: He sayes, that <hi>Prater Pau<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Look over the Earth, and see if there be many Real Christians among those that bear the Christian Name. In the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations there are Millions who are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but they are miserable Christians. In <hi>Africa,</hi> that great Continent, Three times as big as <hi>Europe,</hi> there are indeed now but very few that have the Christian Name, compared to what once there was. That

Part of the world once full of <hi>Christians,</hi> is now overwhelmed with <hi>Mahomitans:</hi> Yet about <hi>Egypt</hi> there are many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Christians, but miserable ones. And if we look on the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, what lamentable Christians are they? Let us cast our Eyes upon <hi>Europe,</hi> there we may see more <hi>Papists</hi> (who are <hi>Pagan-Christians</hi>) than <hi>Protestants.</hi> They boast of the great multitudes of Christians they have made in <hi>America;</hi> they say as many as all the <hi>Latin Church:</hi> They pretend to Fourteen Millions, but they are most wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Christians. Then consider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Nations; How is it among them? As for the Generality of those that go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Name, are there not such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their Christian Profession, by a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conversation? As to their <hi>Morals,</hi> they are not much better, than the Papists. It is so too generally. Blessed be God, who has put it into the Hearts of some Great Personages, as well as others, to promote <hi>Reformation of Manners.</hi> The Churches of the <hi>Reformation</hi> need <hi>Reformation.</hi> Among Protestants, Drunkenness, Profane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sabbath-breaking, Unrighteousness, Vile Debaucheries, Coveteousness are common Evils: Besides very many who
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001320_0030_0FB2898484891E18"/>
maintain Fundamental Errors in Religion; as do <hi>Antinomians, Socinians, Quakers,</hi> and such like, whose Heresies are Damnable. Alas! For men to take up a Profession of Christianity is Easy; there is no difficulty in that, when tis the General Profession of the Countrey, but to Practise, to live like Christians, that is Difficult: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but few do so. So true is that word of Christ, Mat. 7. 14. <hi>Strait is the Gate, and Narrow is the Way, that leads to Life, and Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Instruct. II. <hi>Hence then, there is an Holy Singularity that doth become the Servants of Christ.</hi> There is indeed a Singularity which is not to be commended: When men will not comply with the Laudable Civil Customs of their Neighbours; when they will not conform to the Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Christian world. You know there is a sort of men, that won't stir their Hats, nor how their Bodies out of Civil Respect to their Neighbours; no not to any be they never so much their Superiors. Are they like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who Bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Children of <hi>Heth?</hi> Are they like <hi>Jacob,</hi> who when his Brother <hi>Esau</hi> was become a Great Man he called him Lord, and Bowed himself to the Ground seven
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001320_0031_0FB28987E579B060"/>
times before him? Are they like the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> who when he dedicated his History to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> whom he thought to be a Noble man of <hi>Antioch,</hi> calls him, <hi>Most Excellent?</hi> Are they like <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he defended himself before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, called him, <hi>Most Noble <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> But then there is an Holy Singularity, that is well-becoming the Faithful Servants of God: When men in matters of Religion do not do as the world does, nor do any thing at all, but what they have in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Word of God a warrant for it; Rom. 12 2. <hi>Be not Conformed to this world;</hi> that is in matters of Religion. The Lord Jesus Christ would have His Disciples to be <hi>Non-conformists</hi> to the Corrupt Manners of the world. They may not live by such Rules as others do. It was wicked <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Complaint and Accusation against the Lords People, that they had <hi>Laws di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from all People, and that they did not keep the Kings Laws,</hi> Est. 3. 8. In matters of Religion, the Laws of God and not of the Emperor was their Rule. Thus then an Holy Singularity becomes the Servants of Christ: They must differ from a great part, yea, the greatest part of the world. They must be of more girt Conversations,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001320_0032_0FB28989480E60C0"/>
Eph 5 10 <hi>Walk Circumspectly. Acribos,</hi> Precisely Endeavouring to come up to the height of the Rule. They must do as but few do; Rev. 3. 4. <hi>Thou hast a few Names.</hi> They may not walk after the <hi>Course of the world.</hi> They must Swim against the Stream, and not be like Dead things, which go which way soever the Stream carries them. When the whole World was become an <hi>Arian,</hi> there was one <hi>Athanasius</hi> against the whole World. But if a man acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus like a Christian, he will be counted a Fool. The world will say, <hi>He is more Precise than Wise. Austin</hi> sayes it was so in his time. Some Christians of an ill Life (he sayes) when they saw an Holy Christian, they would in a deriding man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner say to him, <hi>You are a</hi> John Baptist, <hi>are you not? You are for Heaven, no question of it!</hi> But let them mock on. <hi>Christians</hi> ought to be <hi>Precisians.</hi> They ought to be men of more Conscience, and should have more of the Fear of God in them, than others have. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Singular man in his time. The Lord said to him, <hi>Thee have I seen Righteous before me in this Generation,</hi> Gen. 7. 1. He did not do as the most of men in that Generation, in which he lived were wont to do. And <hi>Lot</hi> was a Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001320_0033_0FB2898AC00E9660"/>
man; there were not Ten more such men to be sound in Five Cities together as <hi>Lot</hi> was, so Singular was he in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Prophet <hi>Elisah</hi> was a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man. He sayes, I have been Zealous for thy Name, and <hi>am left alone.</hi> God indeed told him of Seven Thousand known to the Lord, who had not bowed to <hi>Baal.</hi> What a small number was that? Seven Thousand in a Populous Nation? Seven Thousand, to so many Hundreds of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; that could loose in one Battle Five Hundred Thousand. Well then, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God must be Singular in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; yea, so as that the World shall wonder at them. It was said to <hi>Joshua</hi> the High Priest, <hi>Thou &amp; thy Fellows are men wondred at.</hi> That they should venture to Build the Temple at such a time, their Faith and their Courage made them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at; that they should set upon Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple, when all the Powers of the world were set against them; they were on that account men of an Holy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. <hi>Zec.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Instruct. III. <hi>It is a sad thing, when men that call themselves Christians, do not Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do others in that which is Good; but it may be others Out-do them.</hi> It has been so, that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001320_0034_0FB2898C7B7CBAB0"/>
some Insidels have Out-done many that call themselves Christians, in some Moral Duties. The Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> tho' a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, was mightily taken with divers of Christs Precepts in this Sermon at the Mount. Especially that, <hi>Do to others, as you would have others do to you.</hi> How many Christians are there that little regard that Holy Precept? What shall I say, that there have been those among <hi>Mahometan Infidels,</hi> that have Out-done most Christians in some Duties of Morality. A Late Writer speaks of one in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that another coming to his Shop to Cheapen a Commodity; I can (said he) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate you with it, but my next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour has it also; I have had a great deal of Custom to Day, my Neighbour has had none; therefore I wish you would go to him, that so my Neighbour may gain something as well as my self! This shames many Christians. Yea, and those Infidels are Constant in Prayers to God, tho' not in the Name of Christ; nevertheless they Pray to that God who made the world, commonly Five times every Day: And they look upon it as the greatest Disgrace that can be mentioned, for to say, such a man lives without Prayer. When two
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001320_0035_0FB2898F33F0D830"/>
Turkish Infidels fell out, bitterly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with one another; One of them that he might be sure to Disgrace his Adversary to purpose; said he, <hi>That man there, has not Prayed to God so much as Once this Day!</hi> And for that he was looked upon as an horrid Wretch. But are there not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians in the world, that do not Pray to God so much as once in a Day? It may be there are some in this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that have not Prayed to God this Day: The Lord be merciful to them. Infidels will rise up in Judgment against them, and Condemn them in the Last Day. But especially, it is a sad thing when those that pretend to an higher Form and greater Attainments than others in Religion, yet don't Out-do them in an holy walking before the Lord. It is so when Church-members don't Out-do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Holiness, and in Obedience to the Commandments of God. To those that make an higher pretence to Religion than others, what sayes the Prophet? Hos. 4. 15. <hi>Tho' thou Israel play the Haylot; let not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah Offend.</hi> So the Lord sayes, If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors at Large will indulge themselves in these and those Evils, let not Church-members do so. If other men indulge
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001320_0036_0FB289959B5957C0"/>
themselves in Drinking to Excess, do not you who are Church-members do so. If other men will Over-reach, and be Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive in their Dealings with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, you that are Church-members may not do so. It is a sad thing, when the world shall have occasion to say, Those Church-members are like us; they squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away their Time in Publick Houses as much as we do: They speak as Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as Unprofitably as we when met together. And there is one Duty which many who are not Church-members attend, but yet many who are so live in a sinful Neglect of it: I mean that of attendance upon the Lecture in this great Town: Many that are not Church-members, come to Hear and that constantly; but the greatest part of Church-members seldom or never come, altho' they have no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Excuse for their Neglect. It may be the thoughts of it will be terrible on a Death-bed. An Eminent Minister in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> informed me of one, a great Professor of Religion, a Member of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church who came to a Tragical End, but not long before his Death he declared to that Divine, That it lay heavy
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001320_0037_0FB28997D8EE3B90"/>
upon his Spirit, when he remembred how seldom he went to hear a Lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sermon, tho' there was Excellent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the City, and near the House where he lived, yet he cared not to stir out of Doors to Hear the Word of God. Oh! Think of it; and let not others who do not pretend to Religion so much as you do, Out-do you in any thing that is Good.</p>

doing Good: When He came into this and that Company, He would drop some word or other whereby they might be Edified: So should it be with us.
