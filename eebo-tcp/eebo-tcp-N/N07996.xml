            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Miſſionaries and School-Maſters being authorized by the Board of Correſpondents, ſat out as before-mentioned; Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> for <hi>Onohokwage,</hi> agreeable to the Deſire of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians there, which they ſent in Writing to this Board <hi>March</hi> 12th, by good <hi>Peter</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Gwedelhes Agwirondongwas</hi>) their Meſſenger. This Place is on <hi>Suſquehanna-Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> where ſeveral Miſſionaries have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been; and eſpecially the Rev.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010207_0012_0F7D90F6B5FD80B0"/>
To this Party the Rev. Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rice</hi> were ſent by the Honorable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a Church conſiſting of 12 or 14 Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in 1762. But the laſt Spring the Famine prevailed in that Place before Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> could get there, ſo that the Indians were obliged to remove and diſperſe, in order to get a living, 'til their Corn ſhould be fit to eat. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Gunn</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, went to the largeſt Party of them, who were for the preſent ſet down by the Lake <hi>Utſage,</hi> at the Head of <hi>Suſquehanna-Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> where he put <hi>Moſes,</hi> one of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Mohawk</hi> Boys, into a ſmall School, inſtead of <hi>Joſeph Woolley</hi> who was appointed School-maſter to that Tribe, but was then ſick at <hi>Cherry-Valley.</hi> The Account of this School I give in the Words of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Letter, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at ſaid Lake, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3d 1765.— <q>I am every Day diverted and pleaſed with a View of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his School; as I can ſit in my Study, and ſee him and all his Scholars at any Time, the School-Houſe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an open Barrack. And I am much pleaſed to ſee 8, 10, or 12, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more Scholars ſitting round their Bark Table, ſome Reading, ſome Writing, <note n="*" place="bottom">We have found it uſeful to put them to Writing as ſoon as they can ſpell.</note> and others a Studying; and all engaged, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, with as much Seriouſneſs and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010207_0013_0F7D90F992D08F10"/>
as you will ſee in almoſt any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Aſſembly: and <hi>Moſes</hi> at the Head of them with the Gravity of a Divine of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Threeſcore. How agreeable ſuch a Sight would be to you, is not hard to gueſs! I expect this School will be much larger when it comes to <hi>Onohokwage,</hi> as there are but a few here, and many of thoſe that are, upon the Account of the preſent Scarcity, are obliged to employ their Children. The School at <hi>Onohokwage</hi> will doubtleſs be large enough for <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> both.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Woolley</hi> lived with this Party of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians at <hi>Onohokwage</hi> laſt Winter, in order to teach their Children, and learn their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But there were not many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſend their Children to learn Engliſh. The Chief Sachem ſaid, they might learn enough in Indian; which Notion, I ſuppoſe, he and that Party imbibed from ſome white People who had been there. But after <hi>Peter</hi>'s return to them from hence in the Spring, they ſeemed unanimouſly inclined to have an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh School ſet up; and are much engaged to introduce Agriculture among them, and have lately petitioned earneſtly to be aſſiſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and deſire to have Mills built, and a Blackſmith ſettled with them, and ſo many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſettle among them, as ſhall be neceſſary to inſtruct them in theſe Affairs. They promiſe they will obſerve and obey to their utmoſt, all the Advice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſent them by <hi>Peter</hi> laſt Spring.—
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010207_0014_0F7D90F9F9F33098"/>
They have promiſed to build a Houſe for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Woolley,</hi> and help him fence ſome Lands for Tillage, and for keeping Cows, &amp;c. and to do all on their Part, and within their Power, to enable him to govern and teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And I hope ſoon to hear, that he and <hi>Moſes</hi> are ſettled in a large School at that Place. This is a remarkable Alteration in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The like alſo, <hi>David Fowler</hi> informs me, appears in the Indians at <hi>Oneida,</hi> about a hundred Miles diſtant from thence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> after he had ſettled ſeveral Indian Boys in Schools in ſeveral Indian Towns in the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Country; viz. <hi>Hezekiah Calvin</hi> in a School of 24 Scholars, <hi>Abraham Primus</hi> in one of 16, and <hi>Abraham Secundus</hi> in one of 11; was about to go with the <hi>Oneidaes,</hi> on their return to their Country, which they alſo had been obliged to leave, on account of the Famine there. At that Place he purpoſed to ſpend the moſt of his Time this Year; and takes <hi>Johannes</hi> with him for his Interpreter, who has hitherto ſerved him in that Capacity; and at proper Seaſons to viſit the Schools which he has erected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David Fowler</hi> met with a kind Reception among the Indians at <hi>Oneida;</hi> and ſet up a School among them in <hi>May,</hi> conſiſting of 26 Scholars, and continued in it ſome Weeks. He alſo taught a ſinging School, in which the Indians made great Proficiency, and had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned well to carry three Parts to ſeveral Tunes.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010207_0015_0F7D90FA9A798EB0"/>
They promiſed to build him a Houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare Materials, (i.e. HemlockBark) to build it. They alſo promiſed him a free Uſe and Improvement of their Lands, and to aſſiſt him in clearing and fencing them; and were many ways exerting themſelves to ſet up Huſbandry, and deſired him to inſtruct them therein. But by reaſon of the Famine which prevailed among them, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to remove with their Children 'til their Corn ſhould be fit to eat; and deſired <hi>David</hi> to come down to <hi>New-England,</hi> and procure a Carpenter, who might be able to build them Houſes, make Ploughs, Carriages, &amp;c. for them; and deſired he would return to them when they ſhould be able to ſubſiſt in their Country; which he has alſo done. They alſo promiſed to ſend their Children to School, and ſuitably encourage him in governing them, &amp;c. He yet finds difficulty in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to them the Things of Religion, not being ſufficiently Maſter of their Language, and having no ſkilful Interpreter with him. But he hopes this will be ſoon remedied by his becoming compleat Maſter of their Tongue.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Kirtland,</hi> who went among that ſavage and brutiſh Tribe, the <hi>Senecas,</hi> laſt Fall, ſoon after the Peace was ſettled with them, to learn, their Language, and fit himſelf, and prepare the Way for a Miſſion among them, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, on account of the Famine which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010207_0016_0F7D90FB52123880"/>
in that Country, to come to <hi>Mohawk</hi>-River, two Hundred Miles, laſt <hi>June,</hi> for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and brought with him 13 <hi>Seneca</hi> Boys, to aſſiſt him in carrying his Proviſions to that Country. Soon after they came down, 12 of the Boys were taken ſick with a Dyſentery, and four of them died. The reſt recovered, and are returned with Mr. <hi>Kirtland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Kirtland</hi> has ſurpriſingly inſinuated himſelf into their Affection and Eſteem. Their Jealouſies of him, which at firſt were very ſtrong, are now removed. They are fond of his continuing with them; and he hoped, ſoon on his return to them, to be able to ſet up a large School among them. And as ſoon as he is become ſufficiently Maſter of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they expect to hear great Things from him. And if God ſhall mercifully preſerve this Youth to accompliſh the Plan laid for him, on which there has evidently been the Smiles of Heaven hitherto, it will perhaps be eſteemed, when it ſhall be fully known in all the Circumſtances of it, to have been as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary an Undertaking of this kind, as has ever been in this Land.</p>
            <p>His Excellency Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON, (whoſe Underſtanding and Influence in Indian Affairs, is, I ſuppoſe, greater than any other Man's, and for whoſe indefatigable and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Labours to ſettle and ſecure a Peace with the ſeveral Tribes who have lately been at War with us, our Land and Nation are,

under God, chiefly indebted) has not been wanting in his Care and Endeavors for Mr. <hi>Kirtland</hi>'s Safety and Uſefulneſs among them.</p>
            <p>But theſe Affairs are many of them yet ſo new, and my Diſtance from the Miſſionaries ſo great, and no Poſt to keep up a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, that my Accounts at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent muſt needs be very imperfect: Nor am I yet able any further to aſcertain the Number of Indian Children now at the ſeveral Schools in the Wilderneſs. However, all Accounts I have yet received, agree, that there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Deſire of Knowledge among thoſe who have got a little Underſtanding of Chriſtianity; and a great Willingneſs, and, in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a Deſire to have their Children taught. —Their Jealouſies of the Engliſh, ſeem more than ever to be removed.— Miſſionaries and School-maſters are received and treated with more Reſpect and Kindneſs than uſual.—And among ſome Parties, ſuch a Deſire and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedneſs to introduce Agriculture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon that, inſtead of rambling and hunting, for a Living, as has never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known: and a Motive hereto with many of them ſeems to be, that they and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be in a better Capacity to receive Inſtruction, than is poſſible while they are on their fiſhing and hunting Marches hundreds of Miles together.</p>
            <p>And by the Way I would obſerve, that if only here and there a Tribe were civilized,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010207_0018_0F7D90FCC3EBB538"/>
chriſtianized, and Huſbandry introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, what agreeable Places of Retreat might theſe be for our Miſſionaries! And what a Saving of the great Expence for their Support, which cannot be avoided, ſo long as their Proviſions are to be tranſported ſuch a great Diſtance! Beſides the many uſeful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences they will have from a <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> there, and many comforting and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating Conſiderations ſuggeſted to encourage and ſtrengthen them in the Work of the Lord! And I would humbly propoſe to Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the Advantages we may expect hereby, will not be worth all the Coſt and Pains that will be neceſſary to aſſiſt the poor Creatures to ſet up Huſbandry, and give them all neceſſary Inſtruction in the Practice of it? I conceive the neceſſary Expence for this will not be vaſtly great. And when it is once introduced into a few Places, they will ſoon be able to aſſiſt their Brethren, and ſo carry the Practice ſtill further into other Tribes. I doubt not, the Thoughts of Gentlemen of Penetration, will at once ſuggeſt many and very great Advantages that may accrue to the general Deſign hereby.</p>
            <p>And as Divine Providence has always from the firſt prevented me with ſeaſonable Supplies, before the Caſe came to extremity, or to be at all diſtreſſing, however threatning the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances have often been; ſo I would hope in the ſame Fountain of Goodneſs to ſupply
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010207_0019_0F7D90FD746BE818"/>
theſe growing Neceſſities. And this I think we may do with the more Confidence, as we have endeavoured to go no faſter in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, than to obſerve the Openings, and follow the plaineſt Dictates of Providence in every Step that has been taken. And hitherto ſcarce a Step has been taken, but God has evidently made it to proſper. If the Cauſe be God's, and the Courſe we ſteer right, it is ſafe enough.</p>
            <p>But I would humbly propoſe to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether as ſwift a Progreſs of this Work as may be, is not likely to be attended with greater Succeſs proportionable to the Expence, than a more leiſurely Procedure? which will not have that Tendency to awaken their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, convince their Conſciences, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to Emulation; and which will give the Adverſaries to it much more Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to embarraſs the Way.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that the peculiar Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Newneſs of the Thing, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of God's People to accompliſh it, and to do it by ſuch Means and Endeavours, as muſt neceſſarily appear great and ſtrange to the Savages, is, in itſelf, likely to have great Force and Influence to make them hear atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and conſider cloſely, the Nature, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and Evidence of the Things ſpoken to them; and to convince them effectually of the Sincerity of our Intentions towards them, while they ſee our Practice to be ſo agreeable to the vaſt Importance of the Errand on which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010207_0020_0F7D9100612E2BD0"/>
we come to them. And while our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are uſed, as they now are, ſo much by their own Sons, we have a great additional Advantage to avoid the miſchievous Effects of thoſe Jealouſies and Suſpicions which they have ſo long entertained, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our Pretentions, there is a ſecret Plot laid to get away their Lands, and make a Prey of them.</p>
            <p>The Number of Charity-Scholars now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this School, is eighteen; beſides the five <hi>Mohawk</hi> Boys before-mentioned, as employed in the Indian Country, who are expected to return to the School next Winter. Eleven of theſe are Males, [5 Engliſh and 6 Indians] and ſeven Indian Females. Two of theſe Engliſh and two Indian Boys, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be coupled, an Engliſh and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and to be ſent into ſome remote Tribes next Spring, if Providence ſhall favour it, to learn their Languages, and prepare for a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among them.</p>
            <p>I am daily expecting two more <hi>Delaware</hi> Boys, and one from <hi>Narraganſet;</hi> and before Winter, if they may be well choſen, a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> among which is the Grandſon to the <hi>Onondaga</hi> Sachem. And I have the Pleaſure of thinking, that the Boys I have, are in general, very promiſing.</p>
            <p>It was generally thought, before I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Boys from the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Country, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Parents could be perſuaded to ſend,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010207_0021_0F7D9100D0614878"/>
nor their Children to come to School, at ſuch a great Diſtance. And the firſt three who came, appeared to come with great Caution and Fear—brought each of them an Horſe with them, prepared to return in haſte, if there ſhould be occaſion. But ſo great is the Alteration in this Reſpect, that the Difficulty now is not in procuring what Number I pleaſe; but in obtaining ſuch as are promiſing, and ſuch as are, on account of their Families, of greateſt Importance to their Tribes.</p>
            <p>I would take this Opportunity to renew my Thanks to the kind Benefactors of this School, for thoſe generous Benefactions, by which it has, through the Divine Bleſſing, continued to this Time. And deſire the Continuance of their fervent Supplications at the Throne of Divine Grace, for all that Light, Direction, and Aſſiſtance, which ſhall be neceſſary, for all thoſe who are any way actively concerned in promoting the important Deſign; and for that Bleſſing of God upon all Endeavours, without which the beſt Plans, and moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Efforts to put them in Execution, will be to no Purpoſe. And I perſwade myſelf, that the growing Proſpects of Succeſs, will be a further and very ſtrong Inducement to that Liberality, which will bear Proportion to the great Expences neceſſary therein. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be conſidered, that theſe young Gentlemen who are employed in this Buſineſs,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010207_0022_0F7D910168CD7AF8"/>
and are expoſed to all the Hardſhips and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Wilderneſs, without any comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Habitation, or any Accommodations to indulge the Pleaſures of the natural or ſocial Life, have entered upon this Service, not through any Neceſſity, or want of any lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and honorable Poſts they might deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Brethren; but only to ſerve the great Deſigns of advancing the Kingdom of the Redeemer, and the Salvation of the Souls of Men. And they aſk for, and deſire no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reward for all their Service, but to be ſupported while they are employed in it. And I am perſwaded, that the Accounts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Expences, when Time ſhall give an Opportunity to ſet them in a true Light, will be ſufficient Evidence of their Prudence and Frugality.</p>

            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> returned from his Miſſion among the Six Nations, laſt Friday, (accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by two <hi>Oneyada</hi> Boys, for this School) to procure another Miſſionary for one of the Places where he has been preaching among the <hi>Mohawks</hi> and <hi>Oneyadas;</hi> and to get Recruits and Supplies of Neceſſaries for the Winter, for himſelf and the Schoolmaſters, who deſign to winter with the Indians.</p>
            <p>He informs me, that the Indian Schoolmaſters have, in general, conducted very well: are received chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and treated kindly; and that there are now in their ſeveral Schools, 127 Children; and that he had provided another School of upwards of 20 Children more, for <hi>Peter;</hi> but he was taken ſick, and could not enter into it—which is ready for him, or another, next Spring.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> alſo informs me, that he has lately made a Tour among the <hi>Onondagas</hi> (accompanied with Delegates from the <hi>Mohawks</hi> and <hi>Oneyadas</hi>) and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them, where never any Miſſionary had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That the Repreſentative of that whole Tribe, told him, after a Conſultation of two Days among themſelves, that they were all agreed to receive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and would have him be eaſy in his Mind, and know, that from that Day they ſhould be glad to be inſtructed; and deſired him to tarry and preach to them. And when he left them he told them he would do his Endeavour that a Miniſter ſhould be ſent to them next Spring.</p>
