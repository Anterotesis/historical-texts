            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For this cauſe he ſent prophets and apoſtles to preach and teach mankind, by their diſcourſes and writings: For this cauſe he ſent his ſon and ſpirit in the world. Theſe doctrines have been maintained by the ſaints in all ages, at the peril of their lives and all they held dear: This cauſe, Chriſt, his apoſtles, martyrs, and confeſſors, have held ſo dear, that they have ſeal'd them with their blood.

God ſo loved the church, that he redeemed it by his own blood, he ſpared not his own Son, but gave him for his choſen people; Chriſt loved the church, and gave himſelf for it, gave himſelf to a life of ſorrows, to inexpreſſible agonies, and to the accurſed death of the croſs. Immanuel regards the injuries and favors done the church, as if done to himſelf: When Saul perſecuted the church, he ſaid unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecutest thou me,</hi> and at the laſt day he will ſay to thoſe who have fed the hungry ſaint, given drink to the thirſty believer, cloathed his naked diſciples, viſited the ſick and impriſoned mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his inviſible body, inaſmuch as ye have done it to the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. When the true believer is injured, oppreſſed, perſecuted, plundered, impriſoned, tormented, and murdered, he looks upon their cauſe as his own, <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his ſight is the death of his ſaints</hi>: he is the father of their fatherleſs children, the God and protector of their widows, the friend of their friends, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their enemies. The enraptured Pſalmiſt thus celebrates the kindneſs of God to his people: <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiſeth up all that be bowed down, the Lord is righteous in all his ways, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all his works; the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth, Pſ.</hi> 140 146. <hi>He will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him, he will alſo hear their cry and will ſave them. The Lord preſerveth all them that love him, but all the wicked will he deſtroy: Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and earth, the ſea and all that in them is; who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for the oppreſſed, who giveth food
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015378_0008_0F98D28085029BA8"/>
to the hungry: The Lord looſeth the priſoners: the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord loveth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: the Lord preſerveth the ſtrangers, he relieveth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and the widow, but the way of the wicked he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upſide down: the Lord doth build up Jeruſalem, he gathereth together the outcasts of Iſrael: he delighteth not in the ſtrength of the horſe; he taketh not pleaſure in the legs of a man: the Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy.</hi> Thus you ſee my brethren, that the cauſe of truth, the cauſe of religion, the cauſe of righteouſneſs, the cauſe of his church and people, is the cauſe of God: It is, as the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>his own cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus my brethren, I have ſhewn you what is meant by the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to explain what we are to underſtand by God's pleading this cauſe, which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point propoſed.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew word here tranſlated plead, may be rendered litigate, ſtrove, contend, ſight, but being here connected with cauſe, it is beſt tranſlated, by the Engliſh word plead, a term very familiar to moſt of us, which ſignifies an advocate, lawyer, or patron's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, ſupplicating, interceeding, contending for his client, and repreſenting his caſe to the beſt advantage, eſpouſing or patronizing it, or taking it in his own hands and managing it. The phraſe of God's plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people's cauſe, frequently occurs in ſcripture. Thus David, Pſalm 35.1, invokes the divine help ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>plead my cauſe O Lord with them that strive with me, fight againſt them that fight againſt me:</hi> and when Saul unjuſtly perſecuted him and ſought his life, he thus accoſts the cruel tyrant, 1 Sam. 24 15. <hi>the Lord therefore be Judge, and judge between me and thee, and ſee and plead my cauſe, and deliver me out of thine hand:</hi> and in the 143d Pſalm he ſaith, <hi>Judge me O God and plead
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015378_0009_0F98D281452058F0"/>
my cauſe against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjuſt man.</hi> Solomon exhorts, Proverbs 22 23. <hi>Rob not the poor becauſe he is poor; neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the afflicted in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cauſe, and ſpoil the ſoul of thoſe that ſpoiled them:</hi> And again he ſays in the next chapter: <hi>Remove not the old land marks, and enter not into the field of the fatherleſs, for their Redeemer is mighty; he ſhall plead their cauſe with thee:</hi> See alſo Jeremiah 50, 33 34. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the children of Iſrael and the children of Judah were oppreſſed together, and all that took them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, held them faſt, they refuſed to let them go. Their Redeemer is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſts is his name, he ſhall ſtrongly plead their cauſe, that he may give reſt to the land and diſquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</hi> There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage in the enſuing chapter, in which God ſpeaks of the injuries done to his people, as if done to himſelf; he makes their cauſe his own, and declares that he will plead it. See Jeremiah 51, 33 &amp;c. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon hath devoured me, he hath cruſhed me, he hath made me an empty veſſel, he hath ſwallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with his delicates, he hath caſt me out. The violence done to me and to my fleſh, be upon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, ſhall the inhabitant of Zion ſay; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, ſhall Jeruſalem ſay, therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will plead thy cauſe, and take vengeance for thee:</hi> and this was by puniſhing Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar in a moſt ſignal manner, and by deſtroying the inhabitants of Babylon. See the declaration of God's injured Church, Micah 7.8, &amp;c. <hi>Rejoice not againſt me, O mine enemy: when I fall I ſhall ariſe: when I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, untill he plead my cauſe, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his righteouſneſs. Then ſhe that is mine enemy ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015378_0010_0F98D28204BD5160"/>
ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her which ſaid unto me, where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes ſhall behold her: now ſhall ſhe be trodden down as the mire in the ſtreets.</hi> Thus you ſee that God will plead his own and his people's cauſe, againſt their common enemies. But how doth God plead for his people, how doth he plead his own cauſe? I anſwer, he pleads it by his word, his ſpirit, and his providence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He pleads his own and his people's cauſe by his word, both in a general and particular manner. He forbids all injuſtice, oppreſſion, tyranny, murder, theft, plunder, adultery, ſlander, falſe witneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly coveting our neighbour's property: he incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates univerſal love, benevolence, compaſſion, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, peace, and righteouſneſs: he commands all chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to love their neighbour as themſelves, and to do to others as they would that others ſhould do unto them: he commands brethren to dwell together in unity, concord, and mutual forbearance; he declares that to ſubvert a man in his cauſe, is not right; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the injuring our neighbour's name, life, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; he pronounces a woe againſt them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievouſneſs which they have preſcribed, to turn the needy from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take away the right of the poor of his people; he commands that he who ruleth over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of the Lord; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands magiſtrates to be a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well.</p>
            <p>God pled the cauſe of liberty with the Iſraelites, when they fooliſhly deſired a king to reign over them: he told them the prejudice it would be to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and happineſs, in order to diſcourage them from it: he ſaid, <hi>this will be the manner of the king that ſhall reign over you; he will take your ſons and appoint them for himſelf, for his chariots and to be his horſemen, and ſome ſhall run before his chariots, and he will appoint him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

over hundreds, and over fifties, and will ſet them to ear his ground, and to reap his harveſt; and he will take your fields and your vineyards, and your olive yards, even the beſt of them, and he will take your men and maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and your goodlieſt young men, and your aſſes, and put them to his work, and ye ſhall be his ſervants.</hi> God commanded the Iſraelites, ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall not oppreſs one another.</hi> Leviticus 25, 14 17. When the ten tribes had revolted from Rehoboam, becauſe of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when Rehoboam and Judah went out to fight againſt them to bring them back to ſubjection, God ſent his prophet to Rehoboam and Judah, ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your brethren</hi> 1 Kings 12 24. God declared to Abraham, <hi>I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe them that curſe thee.</hi> See alſo 1. Chron. 16 22, compared with Pſalm 105 15, where Jehovah is repreſented, ſaying, <hi>touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm</hi>: i. e. God's anointed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not kings, becauſe it is ſaid in the preceeding verſe, <hi>he ſuffered no man to do them wrong, yea, he reproved kings for their ſake.</hi> I need not multiply arguments, to prove that God by his word, pleads his own and his people's cauſe, what has been ſaid is ſufficient—I ſhall now point out ſome particular inſtances, in which God has by his word, pled his people's cauſe. He pled the cauſe of pious Abel, againſt cruel Cain, Gen. 4 10. <hi>And he ſaid, what haſt thou done? the voice of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now thou art curſed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. When thou til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the ground, it ſhall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond ſhalt thou be in the earth</hi> God pled the cauſe of righteous Lot, to ſave him as a brand out of the burning of Sodom; ſee Gen. 19 17: <hi>He ſaid, eſcape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither ſtay thou in all the plain; eſcape to the mountain, leſt thou be conſumed.</hi> When Laban purſued Jacob with

            <p>Philip the 2d, king of Spain, was on the throne of the moſt powerful kingdom in the world; he had not only great dominions in Europe, Spain, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, under his command: but he had the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and the mines of Mexico and Peru. He oppreſſed the Dutch, and began to abridge their civil and religious liberties; they petitioned for a redreſs of their grievances; but they were ignominiouſly ſtyled <hi>Geux,</hi> that is beggars, and their petitions with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcorn and contempt: whereupon, relying on God, they, although but a handful of men, againſt a mighty monarchy, rebelled againſt Spain, under the conduct of the prince of Orange, and at length, after a long, and arduous ſtruggle, were acknowledged by their tyrants, to be FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES!</p>

the covenant, on which the cloud of glory, the ſymbol of God's preſence, reſted. This ark was carried by the Levites on their ſhoulders, when the Iſraelites marched to attack their enemies. When the march began, and the Levites were about to take up the ark, they ſang, <hi>Let God ariſe; let his enemies be ſcattered: let thoſe that hate him, flee before him.</hi> So that this cuſtom teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us, that the Iſraelites looked to, and depended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon God for the ſucceſs of their military enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes—they ſought his aid, they invoked his bleſſing, preſence, and protection; they did as it were, cry out with Moſes, <hi>Lord if thy preſence go not along with us, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us not to go up hence.</hi> Ariſe O God, like an almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conqueror; exert thine almighty power, make bare thine everlaſting arm in our behalf: go before us, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our way, and ſucceed our operations.

            <p>From the preceeding, diſcourſe, I think we have reaſon to conclude, that the cauſe of this American Continent, againſt the maſures of a cruel, bloody, and vindictive miniſtry, is the cauſe of God.

that all the ſurpaſſing glory, by which ſhe has eclipſed other nations, has been owing to this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble form of government, ſo favorable to the rights of mankind. She never has been more illuſtrious at home or abroad, never more remarkable for her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory or external ſplendor, her peace, plenty and proſperity at home, or her victories, atchievments, &amp; conqueſts abroad, then when her liberties flouriſhed, and a patriot king ſway'd the ſceptre; as ſhe never has been poorer, more miſerable and inglorious, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been more impotent in herſelf, or made a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er figure in the eyes of her neighbors, than when her liberties were violated, and a tyrant ſat upon the throne. The attentive reader of Engliſh hiſtory, who compares the auſpicious reigns of William, George the firſt and ſecond, and part of Queen Ann's, with the fatal adminiſtrations of the former and latter James and Charles, will ſee the ſtriking contraſt, &amp; be fully convinced of the truth of this remark. England, during the laſt war, happy in a king that lov'd his people, and favored their rights, happy in a people that lov'd their king, and were zealous for his honor, triumph'd, gloriouſly triumph'd over the united fleets of France and Spain, and the confederate powers of tyranny. England I am bold to ſay, has proſpered, as her lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty proſpered, and declined, as deſpotiſm has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, When principles of liberty, and a miniſtry and parliament under their influence have governed Great-Britain, how happy have her ſubjects been? how formidable to her enemies? but when oppoſite principles, and rulers have been predominant. What miſery has overwhelmed her inhabitants? and what a contemptible appearance did ſhe make in the ſight of other nations? How has ſhe been torn to pieces by civil broils, and been covered with her own blood? How evident is this from the preſent unnatural war,

waged againſt her own children, to eſtabliſh arbitrary power? How have her once victorious troops fled ignominiouſly, before an army of undiſciplined pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, commanded by officers, moſt of them utterly inexperienced in war! How have her ſturdy veterans been led captive by country boys, and her tranſports, merchantmen and military ſtores, been taken by our privateers? What inſults doth ſhe not continually meet with from her enemies, without daring to reſent them? And unhappily divided againſt herſelf, doth ſhe not totter on the brink of deſtruction, and owe her preſent precarious reſpite from ruin, to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and forbearance of her foes? O England! thou once beloved, happy, and glorious country! Thou land of freedom and delight! How is thy gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dim, and thy fine gold changed!

            <p>You ſee my brethren, from the preceeding obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, the unſpeakable advantages of liberty, to Great-Britain, and how fatal to her have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion and decline of this ineſtimable bleſſing.

Elijah the Tiſhbite, <hi>Go down to meet Ahab king of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, who is in Samaria: behold he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to poſſeſs it, and thus ſhalt thou ſpeak unto him ſaying: Thus ſaith the Lord, in the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, ſhall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab his male children. And of Jezebel (by whoſe advice Ahab ſlew Naboth, and took poſſeſſion of his vineyard) ſpake the Lord alſo, ſaying, the dogs ſhall eat Jezebel, by the wall of Jezreel. Him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Ahab in the city, ſhall the dogs eat, and him that dieth in the fields, ſhall the birds of the air eat.</hi> This curſe was awfully and punctually executed, and ſtands recorded on the Bible, as a tremendous warning againſt tyranny and oppreſſion. God has ſhewn his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abhorrence of theſe attrocious crimes, by ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the perpetrators of them with loathſome diſeaſes, and has commiſſioned lice, worms, and vermine to crawl within and upon them, to devour them alive, to render them a living carrion, ſpectacles of horror and deformity, and inſufferable ſtench and abomination to all about them. Thus has God, in the moſt lively characters, written his hatred and deteſtation of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppreſſion, upon the bodies of thoſe who have been guilty of thoſe heaven daring offences— thus hath he ſhewn how much he deteſts, and how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely he will puniſh cruelty and injuſtice, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the innocent, and the invaſion of their rights and property. And now are there any who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chriſtians, who dare avow, eſpouſe and ſupport, the invaſion of liberty, and the murder of thoſe who riſe up in its vindication?

            <p>The right honorable the Earl of Chatham, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and beſt friend of Great-Britain now living: a man, to whoſe great endowments, vaſt attainments, wiſe, faithful, and glorious adminiſtration, ſhe was, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, indebted, for all the great and important conqueſts ſhe made the laſt war. This illuſtrious Stateſman, diſtinguiſhed Patriot, and unrivall'd bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of his country, has been, from the begining, a warm advocate for America.

            <p>But once more. Whom doth Great-Britain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy, whoſe blood doth ſhe ſhed, whoſe houſes doth ſhe burn, whoſe Temples doth ſhe demoliſh, whoſe lands doth ſhe doſolate, whoſe ruin doth ſhe ſeek? Why of thoſe who have rejoyced in her happineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed her calamities, earneſtly prayed for her welfare, implored the greateſt earthly bleſſings, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joys of immortality, in behalf of her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and his royal houſe—who have rendered her the moſt ſignal, and important ſervices, enabled her to make the moſt glorious, and extenſive conqueſts; careſſed, and honored her officers and ſoldiers, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with diſtinguiſhed hoſpitality, kindneſs, and reſpect; fought, and bled at her ſide, and aſſiſted her in the laſt war, with ſo liberal a generoſity, that ſhe frankly aknowleged, we had gone vaſtly beyond the bare line o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Beſides all this, the principles of liberty, upon which we act, are the ſame, which expell'd James the ſecond, from the Britiſh throne, and ſeated his preſent majeſty, and his royal anceſtors upon it; and if thoſe principles and meaſures, according to which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſtry conduct themſelves, had prevailed, at the time of the revolution, they would effectually have prevented their acceſſion to it. How hard! how cruel! how painful the thought; that the beſt friends to the principles upon which this throne was erected

and eſtabliſhed, ſhould ſuffer from it, all the horrors of war, at the inſtigation of its worſt enemies!</p>
            <p>We have this further conſolation to ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent affliction; that all our aſſemblies on the continent, and the Congreſs at two ſeveral times, have endeavored, by the moſt humble and earneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the throne, to prevent the fatal war, which now rages and deſolates our land. Every expedient, that human ſagacity could dictate, to divert the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſtorm, has been tried: both houſes of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the people of England and Ireland, have been moſt affectionately addreſſed and ſupplicated, to pity and relieve us, and ſuffer us to enjoy our ancient privileges; and it was not until every pacific meaſure failed, and our petitions were ſcornfully treated, and rejected, and a powerful fleet and army had actually invaded us and ſhed our blood; that we took up arms, in behalf of our lives and liberties. Our cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my dear brethren, is not only good, but it has been prudently conducted: Be therefore of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; it is a glorious cauſe: It is the cauſe of truth, againſt error and falſhood; the cauſe of righteouſneſs againſt iniquity; the cauſe of the oppreſſed againſt the oppreſſor; the cauſe of pure and undefiled religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt bigotry, ſuperſtition, &amp; human inventions.
