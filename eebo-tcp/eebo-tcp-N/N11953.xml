            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                           <p>Worthy Delegates! It is the judgment of your country, that your conduct, of which I have juſt marked the grand lines, in the American Congreſs,

Hence your conſtituents, ſenſible of the propriety of your conduct, and of the benefits, which, with the bleſſing of the Almighty, it is calculated to ſhed upon Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, have conſtituted me, their inſtrument, as well to ſignify to you their approbation, as to preſent to you their thanks: and it is in the diſcharge of theſe duties, that I now have the honour to addreſs you.</p>
                           <p>In an important criſis like the preſent, to receive the public thanks of a free people, is to receive the moſt honourable recompence for paſt ſervices—and to deſerve ſuch thanks, is to be truly great. I know that it is with pain, ſuch men hear their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—Gentlemen, with the public recompence, I mean to pay in to you, my mite alſo; and leſt I wound your delicacy, when I mean only to do juſtice to your merit, I forbear to particularize, what is already well known: I therefore confine myſelf; and I do moſt reſpectfully, in the name of the Congreſs, preſent to you, and to each of you, the thanks of your country, for your important ſervices, in the American Congreſs, at Philadelphia.</p>

                           <p>WHEREAS the Britiſh Parliament, claiming of late years a right to bind the North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Colonies by law, in all caſes whatſoever, have enacted ſtatutes for raiſing a revenue in thoſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and diſpoſing of ſuch revenue as they thought proper, without the conſent, and againſt the will of the coloniſts. And whereas, it appearing to them, that (they not being repreſented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:015091_0135_0F95D14FF0401CA0"/>
ſuch claim was altogether unconſtitutional; and, if admitted, would at once reduce them from the rank of Freemen to a ſtate of the moſt abject Slavery; the ſaid colonies, therefore, ſeverally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt the paſſing, and petitioned for the repeal of thoſe acts—but in vain. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſaid claim being perſiſted in, other uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and oppreſſive ſtatutes have been ſince enacted, by which the powers of the Admiralty Courts in the colonies are extended beyond their ancient limits, and juriſdiction is given to ſuch Courts in caſes ſimilar to thoſe which in Great-Britain are triable by jury—Perſons are liable to be ſent to, and tried in, Great Britain, for an offence created and made capital by one of thoſe ſtatutes, though committed in the colonies—the harbour of Boſton was blocked up—people indicted for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, may, at the will of the Governor, be ſent for trial to any other colony, or even to Great-Britain—the chartered conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government in that colony is materially al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—the Engliſh laws and a free government, to which the inhabitants of Quebec were intitled by the King's Royal Proclamation, are aboliſhed; and French laws are reſtored; the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Religion (although before tolerated and freely exerciſed there) and an abſolute government are eſtabliſhed in that province, and its limits extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a vaſt tract of country, ſo as to border on the free Proteſtant Engliſh Settlements, with deſign of uſing a whole people, differing in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principles from the neighbouring colonies, and ſubject to arbitrary power, as fit inſtruments to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:015091_0136_0F95D150B0AB32B0"/>
over-awe and ſubdue the colonies. And whereas the Delegates of all the colonies on this continent, from Nova Scotia to Georgia, aſſembled in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Congreſs at Philadelphia, in the moſt dutiful manner, laid their complaints at the foot of the throne, and humbly implored their Sovereign, that his royal authority and interpoſition might be uſed for their relief from the grievances occaſioned by thoſe ſtatutes, and aſſured his Majeſty, that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between Great-Britain and America, ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired by the latter, would be thereby immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reſtored, and that the colonies confided in the magnanimity and juſtice of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for redreſs of the many other grievances under which they laboured. And whereas, theſe complaints being wholly diſregarded, ſtatutes ſtill more cruel than thoſe abovementioned, have been enacted, prohibiting the intercourſe of the colonies with each other, reſtricting their trade, and depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many thouſands of people of the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, by reſtraining them from fiſhing on the American coaſt. And whereas, large fleets and armies having been ſent to America, in order to enforce the execution of thoſe laws, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel an abſolute and implicit ſubmiſſion to the will of a corrupt and deſpotic adminiſtration, and in conſequence thereof, hoſtilities having been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, by the troops under command of General Gage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of peaceable, helpleſs, and unarmed people, were wantonly robbed and murdered; and there being juſt reaſon to apprehend that like hoſtilities would be committed in all the other colonies, the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:015091_0137_0F95D153B4650E30"/>
coloniſts were therefore driven to the neceſſity of taking up arms to repel force by force, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves and their properties againſt lawleſs invaſions and depredations.—Nevertheleſs, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates of the ſaid colonies, aſſembled in another Congreſs at Philadelphia, anxious to procure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with Great Britain upon juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional principles, ſupplicated his Majeſty to direct ſome mode by which the united applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his faithful coloniſts might be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation; that in the mean time meaſures might be taken for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the further deſtruction of their lives; and that ſuch ſtatutes as immediately diſtreſſed any of the coloniſts might be repealed. And whereas, inſtead of obtaining that juſtice to which the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were and are of right intitled, the unnatural Civil War, into which they were thus precipitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are involved, hath been proſecuted with unremitted violence; and the Governors and others bearing the Royal Commiſſion in the colonies, having broken the moſt ſolemn promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and violated every obligation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, juſtice and humanity; have cauſed the perſons of divers good people to be ſeized and impriſoned, and their properties to be forceably taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, or deſtroyed, without any crime or forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture— excited domeſtic inſurrections—proclaimed freedom to ſervants and ſlaves—enticed or ſtolen them from, and armed them againſt their maſters inſtigated and encouraged the Indian nations to war againſt the colonies—diſpenced with the law of the land, and ſubſtituted the law-martial in its
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:015091_0138_0F95D1547139B710"/>
ſtead—killed many of the coloniſts—burned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral towns, and threatened to burn the reſt; and daily endeavour, by a conduct which has ſullied the Britiſh arms, and would diſgrace even ſavage nations, to effect the ruin and deſtruction of the colonies. And whereas a ſtatute hath been lately paſſed, whereby, under pretence that the ſaid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are in open rebellion, all trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce whatſoever with them is prohibited—veſſels belonging to their inhabitants trading in, to, or from the ſaid colonies, with the cargoes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on board ſuch veſſels, are made lawful prize, and the maſters and crews of ſuch veſſels, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, by force, to act on board the King's ſhips, againſt; their country and deareſt friends; and all ſeizures and detention, or deſtruction of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and properties of the coloniſts, which have at any time been made, or committed, for withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuppreſſing the ſaid pretended rebellion, and which ſhall be made in purſuance of the ſaid act, or for the ſervice of the public, are juſtified; and perſons ſuing for damages in ſuch caſes are, on fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſuits, ſubjected to payment of very heavy expences. And whereas, large reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of troops and ſhips have been ordered, and are daily expected in America, for carrying on war againſt each of the United Colonies, by the moſt vigorous exertions. And whereas, in conſequence of a plan recommended by the Governors, and which ſeems to have been concerted between them and their miniſterial maſters, to withdraw the uſual officers, and thereby looſen the bands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and create anarchy and confuſion in the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:015091_0139_0F95D1552E789758"/>
colonies; Lord William Campbell, late Governor, on the 15th day of September laſt, diſſolved the General Aſſembly of this Colony, and no other hath ſince been called, although, by law, the ſitting and holding of General Aſſemblies, cannot be intermitted above ſix months; and having uſed his utmoſt efforts to deſtroy the lives, liberties and properties of the good people here, whom by the duty of his ſtation he was bound to protect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from the colony, and carried off the Great Seal and the Royal Inſtructions to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. And whereas the Judges of the Courts of Law here have refuſed to exerciſe their reſpective functions, ſo that it is become indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that during the preſent ſituation of American Affairs, and until an accommodation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy differences between Great-Britain and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica can be obtained, (an event, which though tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and treated as rebels, we ſtill earneſtly deſire) ſome mode ſhould be eſtabliſhed by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and for the good of the people, <hi>the origin and end of all government,</hi> for regulating the internal polity of this Colony, THE CONGRESS, being veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with powers competent for the purpoſe, and having fully deliberated touching the premiſes, Do therefore RESOLVE,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Honourable Gentlemen of the Legiſlative Council, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the General Aſſembly.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has afforded me much ſatisfaction, to obſerve, that though the ſeaſon of the year rendered your ſitting very inconvenient; your private concerns, which muſt have ſuffered greatly by your long and cloſe application in the late Congreſs to the affairs of this colony, requiring your preſence in the country; yet, continuing to prefer the public weal to eaſe and retirement, you have been buſily engaged, in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch laws, as our peculiar circumſtances render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely neceſſary to be paſſed, before your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment.—Having given my aſſent to them, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you are now deſirous of a receſs.</p>
            <p>On my part, a moſt ſolemn oath has been taken, for the faithful diſcharge of my duty—On yours, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſurance has been given, to ſupport me therein. —Thus, a public compact, between us, ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.—You may reſt aſſured, that I ſhall keep this oath ever in mind—the Conſtitution ſhall be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable rule of my conduct—my ears ſhall be always open, to the complaints of the injured—Juſtice, in mercy, ſhall neither be denied, or delayed—Our Laws and Religion, and the Liberties of America ſhall be maintained and defended, to the utmoſt of my power.—I repoſe the moſt perfect confidence in your engagement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:015091_0159_0F95D165ACF458B8"/>And now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> let me intreat, that you will in your ſeveral pariſhes and diſtricts, uſe your influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and authority, to keep peace, and good order, and procure ſtrict obſervance of, and ready obedience to, the Law.— If any perſons, therein, are ſtill ſtrangers to the nature and merits of the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and the Colonies, you will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to them fully, and teach them, if they are ſo unfortunate as not to know, their inherent Rights. —Prove to them, that the Privileges of being tried by a jury of the vicinage, acquainted with the parties and witneſſes; of being taxed only with their own conſent, given by their Repreſentatives, freely choſen by, and ſharing the burthen, equally, with themſelves, not for the aggrandizing a rapacious miniſter, and his dependant favourites, and for corrupting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuverting their Liberties, but, for ſuch wiſe and ſalutary purpoſes, as they themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and of having their internal polity regulated, only by laws, conſented to, by competent judges of what is beſt adapted to their ſituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, equally bound too by thoſe laws, are INESTIMABLE, and derived from that Conſtitution, which is the birthright of the pooreſt man, and the beſt inheritance of the moſt wealthy.—Relate to them, the various unjuſt, and cruel ſtatutes, which the Britiſh Parliament, claiming a right <hi>to make laws for binding the colonies in all caſes whatſoever,</hi> have enacted, and the many ſanguinary meaſures, which have been, and are, daily, purſued, and threatened, to wreſt from them thoſe invaluable benefits, and to enforce ſuch an unlimited and deſtructive claim. To the moſt illiterate it muſt appear, that no power
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:015091_0160_0F95D16672516C88"/>
on earth can, of right, deprive them of the hardly-earned fruits of their honeſt induſtry, toil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour—even to them, the impious attempt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many thouſands, from uſing the means of ſubſiſtence, provided for man, by the bounty of his Creator, and to compel them, by famine, to ſurrender their rights, will ſeem to call for Divine Vengeance.—The endeavours, by deceit and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to engage barbarous nations, to embrue their hands, in the innocent blood, of helpleſs women and children, and the attempts, by fair but falſe promiſes, to make ignorant domeſticks, ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to the moſt wicked purpoſes, are acts, at which humanity muſt revolt.</p>
            <p>Shew your conſtituents, then, the indiſpenſable neceſſity which there was, for eſtabliſhing ſome mode of government in this colony; the benefits of <hi>that,</hi> which a full and free repreſentation has eſtabliſhed; and, that the conſent of the people is the origin, and their happineſs, the end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Remove the apprehenſions with which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and well-meaning, but weak and credulous minds, may be alarmed; and prevent ill impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by artful and deſigning enemies.—Let it be known, that this conſtitution is but temporary— till an accommodation of the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and America can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that ſuch an event is ſtill deſired, by men who yet remember former friendſhips and intimate connections, though, for defending their perſons and properties, they are ſtigmatized and treated as Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="unknown:015091_0161_0F95D1672E15B6D8"/>Truth, being known, will prevail over artifice and miſrepreſentation—Conviction muſt follow its diſcovery.—In ſuch a caſe, no man, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of life, liberty or property, will, or can, refuſe to join you, in defending them to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity—Diſdaining every ſordid view, and the mean paltry conſiderations of private intereſt, and preſent emolument, when placed in competition, with the liberties of millions; and ſeeing that there is no alternative, but, abſolute unconditional ſubmiſſion, and the moſt abject ſlavery, or a defence becoming men, born to freedom, he will not heſitate about the choice.—Although ſuperior force may, by the permiſſion of Heaven, lay waſte our towns, and ravage our country, it can never eradicate, from the breaſts of freemen, thoſe principles which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in their very nature—ſuch men will do their duty, neither knowing, or regarding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, but, ſubmitting them, with humble confidence, to the Omniſcient and Omnipotent Arbiter, and Director, of the fate of empires, and truſting that his Almighty Arm, which has been ſo ſignally ſtretched out for our defence, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, in a righteous cauſe.</p>
            <p>The eyes of Europe, nay of the whole world, are on America.—The eyes of every other colony, are on this—a colony, whoſe reputation, for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity and magnanimity, is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. I truſt, therefore, it will not be diminiſhed by our future conduct; that there will be no civil diſcord here; and that, the only ſtrife amongſt brethren will be, who ſhall do moſt, to ſerve, and to ſave, an oppreſſed and injured country.</p>
