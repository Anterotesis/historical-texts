            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>REASON, that principle which the Author of our exiſtence implanted in our breaſt, is ſufficient to teach us, The offspring of one common parent ought to live in conſtant harmony: And the inſpired writings abound with exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to mutual affection, together with the interchange of thoſe kind offices, which are eſſential to the happineſs of families, and of larger ſocieties.</p>
            <p>THE true felicity of thoſe who dwell together in unity, is deſcribed in the old teſtament, by ſome of the moſt pleaſing figures of eaſtern language. "Behold,"
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015866_0004_0F9A309A14CF4D10"/>
ſays King David, "How good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the ſkirts of his garments. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that deſcended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for ever more."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm. 133.</note>—And the great founder of our Religion, Jeſus Chriſt, hath aſſured us, we cannot be his diſciples, nor may we hope to ſhare in the peculiar bleſſings which he hath purchaſed, unleſs we feel the influence of kind affection one towards another. <note n="†" place="bottom">John, 13, 34, 35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT a ſhocking reverſe, to what reaſon dictates, and the ſcriptures enjoin, have the actions of mankind exhibited, in all ages of the world.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of the human race, from Adam to the preſent day, is gloomy and affecting. In the very page where we read, "Men began to multiply on the face of the earth," it is alſo written, "God ſaw the wickedneſs of man was great, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015866_0005_0F9A309ACEA38F00"/>
heart, was only evil continually." And a little after we read, —"The earth alſo was filled with violence." <note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſes, vi. Chap.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the account which comes to us by inſpiration from heaven: Such were the offspring of Adam before the flood, generally abandoned to their luſts, and under the government of the vileſt paſſions.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we now look into the records of human actions, which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by faithful men from the earlieſt times, we ſhall find the volums ſwell with the ſad narrative of fraud, injuſtice, rapine, murder—and every kind of violence.—</p>
            <p>BY violence we underſtand an unlawful application of force, or the arbitrary ſtretch of power which unreaſonable and wicked men, have frequently exerciſed over ſuch as were under their controul.</p>
            <p>AGE, natural ſuperiority, and a great variety of circumſtances, give ſome of the children of men opportunity to rule over others. And ſuch is the love of power, which has generally been diſcovered by the Sons of Adam, that thoſe who had a little were conſtantly wiſhing for more; and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015866_0006_0F9A309B8F9D67F0"/>
thoſe who had arrived to great authority, grew impatient of reſtraint, and wiſhed for abſolute dominion.</p>
            <p>PARENTS have been guilty of violence towards their children: Although the ties of nature oblige them to treat their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring with the tendereſt affection, there have been inſtances of a very different conduct: there have been inſtances where it was neceſſary to apply the Apoſtolic cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "Ye fathers provoke not your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſians vi.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>MASTERS have been guilty of violence towards their ſervants: Men of unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſions, have treated their ſlaves and dependants with great inhumanity, not remembering that "their Maſter alſo is in Heaven," <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. vi, 9.</note> to whom they muſt give an account.</p>
            <p>THE rich have been guilty of violence towards the poor: They have in many caſes extorted from them ſervices without returning a ſuitable reward. The Apoſtle James addreſſeth himſelf to covetous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors in the following language. "Behold
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015866_0007_0F9A309C4DB0FD58"/>

               </gap>d, crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth." <note n="*" place="bottom">James v.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>GOVERNORS and rulers of the earth, have been guilty of violence towards their ſubjects. Solomon informs us, he "return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done under the Sun, and behold the tears of ſuch as were oppreſſed and they had no comforters; and on the ſide of their oppreſſors there was power; but they had no comforters." <note n="§." place="bottom">Eccleſ. iv.i.</note> Such was the melancholy ſtate of the children of men, while under cruel oppreſſors, that the wiſe King of Iſrael adds, —"I praiſed the dead which are already dead, more than the living, which are yet alive."—</p>
            <p>AND ſhould we caſt an eye over the Kingdoms of the world at the preſent day, we ſhall diſcover the effects of oppreſſion and violence, on every quarter of the globe.</p>
            <p>AMBITIOUS and haughty men, by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in war, or by taking advantage of the weakneſs or inattention of their neighbors, have eſtabliſhed deſpotiſm over the greateſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015866_0008_0F9A309D0E19B5F0"/>
part of the earth. And while ſome nations have preſerved more liberties than others, none have eſcaped attacks from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy of human freedom.</p>
            <p>NORTH-AMERICA, which ſeemed to have been reſerved in divine providence, as the laſt retreat of a virtuous few, who were determined never to yield thoſe rights which they had received from Heaven to the will of any temporal monarch, has, for ſome years paſt, been threatned with ſlavery and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>UNWEARIED attempts have been made by the powers of Great-Britain to deprive the inhabitants of this land of their moſt valuable intereſts; and compel them, by violence and cruelty, to lay themſelves, with every thing precious to them, at a Tyrant's feet: Ye, ſo determined is that prince who now diſgraces the throne of his anceſtors, to eſtabliſh <hi>abſolute Government,</hi> through the ſeveral parts, of what he calls, "<hi>his dominions,</hi>" that he would rather ſpill the blood of millions, and expoſe himſelf, as well as the Nation to infamy and ruin, than abandon an object ſo pleaſing to him, and which he promiſes his parliament he "<hi>will ſteadily purſue.</hi>" <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Speech Nov. 20. 1777.</note>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:015866_0009_0F9A309E6DEC39C0"/>THE inhabitants of this State, received the firſt attacks which were made by the enemy, on the common rights of America. —The ſons of violence firſt pointed the inſtruments of death at our breaſts.—</p>
            <p>I MIGHT now call you, my friends and fellow citizens, to remember the fifth of March, One thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy.—I might call you to view the ground, where the blood of our brethren was moſt wantonly ſpilled on that memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able night, but your feelings, I know, will be ſufficiently touched by the worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, at the deſire of the Town, will ſoon pronounce an Oration from this deſk.</p>
            <p>THE ſhocking maſſacre, perpetrated on that gloomy evening, which we ſhall never forget, may be conſider'd as the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hoſtilities by the Britiſh troops in America: And the inhabitants of theſe States, muſt have been juſtified by the impartial world, had they reſolved from that moment, never to ſuffer one in the livery of George the III to walk this ground.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuch was our patience under ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated inſults—ſuch our hopes that after all, the unhappy diſpute might be amicably ſettled, that we ſaw forces collecting from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015866_0010_0F9A309EC9D98BA0"/>
all quarters without reſiſting them.—We ſaw the ſacred Charters, which had been given, by former Kings of England to the firſt planters of theſe Colonies—We ſaw thoſe ſacred Charters which confirmed to us the eſſential rights of freemen, the ſport of a prince, who was bound by ſolemn ties to obſerve them.</p>
            <p>OPPOSITION was not made to that force which we ſaw collecting againſt us, till our enemies carried fire and ſword into the heart of the country.</p>
            <p>NEVER ſhall we forget the ninteenth of April, One thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-five, when a number of Americans were murdered at LEXINGTON, and we heard the firſt ſolemn call, to <hi>arm,</hi> and oppoſe the ſtrength of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>SINCE the ſword on both ſides has been drawn, the operations of war, on the part of the enemy, have been cruel beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. —Conqueſt has not been the ſole object of their exertions.—Devaſtation, barbarity and murder, have been their delight.</p>
            <p>SOME of our ancient and moſt flouriſhing

                  <hi>Charleſtown</hi> was conſumed by the enemy on the 17th of June, 1775. The flames of which warmed the imagination of General Burgoyne, for the ſtriking Deſcription he gave of the Battle on Bunker's-Hill.— A great part of FALMOUTH was burnt in the month of October, 1775, by the infamous Mowat, Capt. of a 16 Gun-Ship. NORFOLK, one of the oldeſt and moſt flouriſhing Towns in Virginia, was wholly conſumed in the month of January, 1776. KINGSTON, the third Town in the State of New-York, was reduced to aſhes in the month of October, 1777.—Beſides the wanton deſtruction of theſe places, between 4 and 500 houſes were pulled down and burnt in Boſton, while the town was held by Britiſh troops.—The enemy took peculiar pleaſure in abuſing the houſes erected for the worſhip of God. One <hi>venerable pile,</hi> known by the name of the OLD-NORTH was torn to pieces by the ſons of violence; thoſe wretches accompaning their impious work, with language too profane and blaſphemous to relate.— One large and elegant Building was ſhamefully defaced, and uſed as a Manage for their <hi>Horſe.</hi> Three others, and one among them the moſt finiſhed and expenſive on the Continent, were proſtituted to the purpoſes of Barracks; and one was uſed as a Barn to contain fodder for their Cattle.—</note>

            <p>NEITHER the delicacy of the ſex, or the infirmities of the aged were ſufficient to ſecure them againſt Britiſh and Savage in humanity.—</p>
            <p>THE weak and infirm have been ſlain in their houſes.—The venerable head grown white with years has been mangled by ruffian Soldiers.—The blooming virgin dreſſed for her nuptials, has been ſeized by Savage hands, hurried away and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with unutterable cruelty <note n="†" place="bottom">See Gen.

"That the Savages of America, ſhould in their warfare, mangle and ſcalp the unhappy priſoners who fall into their hands, is neither new nor extraordinary: But that the famous Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, in whom the fine Gentleman is united with the Soldier and the Scholar, ſhould hire the Savages of America to ſcalp Europians, and the deſcendants of Europians: Nay more, that he ſhould pay a price for each ſcalp ſo barbarouſly taken, is more than will be believed in Europe, until authenticated facts, ſhould in every Gazette con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of the horrid tale.—Miſs M'Rea, a Lady lovely to the ſight, of virtuous character, and amiable diſpoſition, engaged to be married to an officer in your army, was, with other women and children, taken out of a houſe near Fort-Edward, and carried into the woods, and there ſcalped and mangled in a moſt ſhocking manner. Two parents, with their ſix children, were all treated with the ſame inhumanity, while quietly reſiding in their once peaceful dwellings.

Upwards of an hundred men, women and children have periſhed by the hands of ruffians, to whom it is aſſerted, you have paid the price of blood."</note>—</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015866_0012_0F9A30A00E43FE28"/>BUT I forbear.—The reherſal is too ſhocking.—Who then could endure the ſight of woes, a deſcription of which we find inſufferable?—None, moſt certainly, none could endure the ſight of ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcenes, but thoſe Britains who were ſo loſt to the feelings of humanity, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Savages for mangling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and defenceleſs.</p>
            <p>AND beſides the open murder of the aged and infirm,—of women and children, our enemies have baſely <hi>ſtarved</hi> many of our brethren to death, who were in their hands as priſoners.—Many have ſuffered in the moſt ſhocking manner and died in priſons and guard-ſhips.—More than a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015866_0013_0F9A30A0D0472510"/>
thouſand <hi>periſhed</hi> in the city of New-York the winter before laſt.—And when our brethren were ſuffering hunger and cold, and the vileſt inſult, a ſorded enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to prevail on them to inliſt into the Britiſh ſervice; but ſuch was the virtue of thoſe heroes, that the laſt extreme of miſery, was not ſufficient to ſhock their fidelity to their country. They rather choſe to periſh in want of all things, than draw their ſword againſt the liberties of America.—They met the approaches of death, in their diſmal circumſtances, with a degree of fortitude ſeldom to be found in the hiſtory of mankind.—Some of our unhappy brethren who were captivated, and carried to Great-Britain, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent to the Eaſt-Indies, from whence they can have little or no reaſon to expect they ſhall ever return.</p>
            <p>SUCH acts of meanneſs and cruelty have our enemies been guilty of.—Such are the men who have promiſed their haughty maſter, that by devaſtation and ſlaughter they will compel the inhabitants of theſe States to yield unconditional ſubjection to his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>EVERY ſon of freedom then throughout this Continent, muſt be juſtified in the view of that God who hateth violence and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015866_0014_0F9A30A18DCFC058"/>
cruelty, when he draws his ſword, and appealing to Heaven, ſolemnly ſwears, he will never ſheathe it, till thoſe miſcreants— thoſe enemies to the common rights of mankind, are utterly deſtroyed, or drove from this once happy land.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the inhabitants of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated American States act with wiſdom and ſpirit, it is certainly in their power, by the common ſmiles of divine providence, to eſtabliſh their independency and ſecure the bleſſings of civil and religious liberty to themſelves, and to millions of unborn poſterity. And we have the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence, that the ſupreme Ruler of the univerſe, who giveth the Kingdoms of the world to whomſoever He will, is ready to grant every needed aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>DIVINE goodneſs is to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in raiſing up men of the <hi>firſt abilities</hi> to watch over our common rights, and give us warning when thoſe rights were invaded.—We eſteem <hi>converts</hi> to the true intereſt of our country, and rejoice to ſee any come in even at the eleventh hour, and join heartily in the cauſe of virtue and freedom; but we revere thoſe characters which <hi>firſt</hi> appeared, and in oppoſition to every danger, boldly impeached the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our liberties, and conjured us by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015866_0015_0F9A30A2582FB620"/>
every thing ſacred, not to ſuffer the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance purchaſed by the blood of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be wreſted from us.</p>
            <p>HOW remarkably hath divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence taken us up when our circumſtances were moſt perplexing and difficult?</p>
            <p>HEAVEN hath frequently ſent us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of warlike ſtores when in great want of them; and prevented the enemy from acting with vigour againſt us, when we were prepared but feebly to reſiſt them.<note n="*" place="bottom">There was a time after the Battle on the Heights of Charleſtown when our army, which was not large, had not nine rounds of powder to a man, nor was any tolerable ſupply procured till an ordnance Brig was taken by Capt. <hi>Manley,</hi> ſome time in Dec. 1775. In the Spring after a large Ship with 75 Tons of powder, together with a great variety of warlike Stores, was taken by Capt. <hi>Mugford</hi> and brought into Boſton. Thoſe two Captures afforded a large ſupply.—The quantities of Proviſion and Merchandiſe taken by the American Cruiſers, are immenſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE temporary advantages of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, have, in ſeveral inſtances, been, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them: And altho' by accounts which have been laid before the Britiſh parliament, we find they had more than fifty thouſand troops in America the laſt year, their proſpects at preſent, to be ſure, are not better than they were when the campaign opened.—One large army, lately under the command of General Burgoyne is wholly conquered; near half of them waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtroyed, and the remainder are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015866_0016_0F9A30A38E931058"/>
now priſoners of war. And the main body under General How have effected little more through the laſt ſeaſon, than to change their quarters, from New-York to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>TO deſpair ſince Heaven has done ſo much for us, would evidence a criminal diſtruſt of divine goodneſs: To be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged ſince the whole force of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, aided by large bodies of German hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings have effected ſo little, would diſcover unpardonable cowardice and meanneſs of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>WE have every motive to a vigorous exertion, that can operate on the human mind,—If we ſupport our liberties we may be as happy a people as ever exiſted, —We ſhall have it in our power to ſettle our own forms of government, and ſuit them to our peculiar circumſtances, our genius and diſpoſition.—We have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the means of ſubſiſtance, but we find many of the means of defence in our own country: And we are at ſo great a diſtance from the other parts of the world, that no enemy will ever attack us if we ſucceed in the preſent ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, ſhould we through ſtupidity; or a want of wiſdom, or ſpirit in thoſe who are intruſted with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015866_0017_0F9A30A3CEAC8BC8"/>
our moſt important affairs; or a general decay of public virtue in all orders of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among us:—Should we by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe or any other cauſes, ſuffer our country to be over-run by the enemy, imagination cannot paint the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that muſt follow.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we ſuffer ourſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, we muſt bid adieu, a final adieu to freedom civil and religious:—To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:—To domeſtic happineſs, and the moſt valuable bleſſings which now diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Americans from the wretched ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of foreign deſpotic ſovereigns.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER thinks of ſubmitting to the power of Britain, as it is now exerted againſt us, muſt endeavor to reconcile himſelf to the ideas of beggary and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſlavery: Yea further, he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to reconcile himſelf to the axe—the halter—the gibbit. The dreadful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which will be inflicted on the Americans, if Great-Britain ſhould prevail, may be inferred from the threatnings which our enemies have denounced, and the cruelties they have already exerciſed. —Many no doubt would be ſhamefully executed.—Thoſe who have moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves in the preſent ſtruggle, would be marked out as the firſt victims to Britiſh fury. When the anger of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed

monarch is in ſome meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed with the blood of thouſands, the whole burden of the war, will no doubt be laid on the miſerable ſurvivers.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould any American, propoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the government of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain while the king and parliament are uſing their utmoſt endeavors to bring us under abſolute ſubjection, or extirpate us from the earth, he would deſerve the fate of that timid Athenian, who, for only mentioning an <hi>accommodation</hi> with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian King, when his numerous armies were ſpreading deſolation far and wide, was ſtoned to death; his own mother being the firſt perſon to execute the ſentence of the people againſt him.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Rollin's ancient Hiſtory. v.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is ſeriouſly to be wiſhed, all ranks of people would meditate on the miſerable condition we ſhall be in, if we ſuffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſubdued by Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>MANY are engaged in the eager purſuit of riches—many are intrigueing for places of honor and profit, as inattentive to the public intereſt, as if our country were out of danger.—But what advantage, let me aſk thoſe men,—what advantage can you expect to receive from your wealth, or your titles, if America is at laſt ſubjected to Britiſh tyranny?—Should that ever take place, through a general ſtupidity, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015866_0019_0F9A2FE9C243C5E0"/>
want of exertion, your wealth, eſpecially if it has been acquired in the preſent war, and your titles which you hold under thoſe who are denominated by the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>The leaders of the rebellion,</hi> ſo far from being of any ſervice will expoſe you to the peculiar vengeance of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies —You will be ſtript of your money, of your lands, and your honours, if not deprived of life itſelf:—Or ſhould your eſtates be ſpared to you, they will be ſo burdened with taxes, to defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the war,—to ſupport a large ſtanding army to hold the country in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection after it is once conquered, and maintain a ſwarm of crown officers to govern, to plunder and inſult you, that your eſtates would not be worth poſſeſſing: —Yea, death would be deſirable rather than a life of ſuch diſhonor and miſery.</p>
            <p>MUCH might be ſaid to deſcribe the common wretchedneſs in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this country muſt be involved, if they ſuffer themſelves to be ſubdued,— but the time allowed me for this exerciſe, will not ſuffer me any farther to enlarge.</p>
            <p>AT ſuch a day as this, when we are threatned with the loſs of every thing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable,—when our enemies are many and powerful, we ſhould forget, in ſome good meaſure, that we have a private intereſt:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015866_0020_0F9A2FE9D2BA1528"/>
We ſhould employ our utmoſt vigour in the cauſe of the public. A Roman <hi>Hero</hi> informs us, at a time when the liberties of the people required his ſervices, <hi>he gave himſelf to the immortal Gods, and to his country;</hi> after that ſolemn conſecration he declares he was happy. His conduct affords an example worthy of our imitation.— Every freeborn ſon of America ſhould at <hi>this time</hi> devote himſelf to the God of Heaven, and to the ſervice of theſe United States.</p>
            <p>AT once deſpiſing danger, and the <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> idea of profit, Americans ſhould at this time ſolemnly vow unto the Lord, that they will give themſelves no reſt, till our common enemies are wholly ſubdued.</p>
            <p>SHOULD this magnanimity of ſoul—this heavenly principle inſpire our boſoms: ſhould it happily exterminate that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit—that criminal ſelfiſhneſs— that inordinate love of money which have imbarraſſed every thing for ſome time paſt, we might defy the forces of Britain, and laugh at her threats.</p>
            <p>HOW ardently then is this noble affection —this enthuſiaſm for the public good to be deſired! May it kindle up in ſome favorite breaſt! May it catch from ſoul to ſoul, till the inhabitants of this land in general, feeling the irreſiſtable inſſuence, ſhall unite in one vigorous effort againſt the enemies of our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015866_0021_0F9A2FEA90A7DAE0"/>
civil and religious liberties and put an end to their exiſtence on this part of the world.</p>
            <p>NOW is the time, the beſt time in all probability we ſhall ever have: If we act with wiſdom and ſpirit the forces at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent employed againſt us may be ruined before they can be joined by larger numbers. God forbid my country ſhould let this golden opportunity paſs over unimproved! God grant thoſe who are intruſted with our public affairs may act with wiſdom, with ſpirit, and deciſion! And may there be ſufficient numbers ready to take the field at this moſt critical ſeaſon!</p>
            <p>BUT before we conclude, it becomes us as chriſtians to lament the awful ſpread of moral evil, and pray for the univerſal eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of the Redeemer's kingdom, which is a kingdom of righteouſneſs and peace.</p>
            <p>SHOCKING have been the calamities which have followed ſin in every age of the world.—The earth was ſoon filled with violence, and its wicked inhabitants were drowned with the flood.—Far the greateſt part of thoſe who now dwell on the face of the earth are at once abandoned to their luſts, and are in ſlavery to arbitrary ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.—But the reign of moral evil ſhall not be perpetual.—The Son of God came into the world to deſtroy the works of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015866_0022_0F9A2FEB4FCA6F48"/>
devil.—He will put an end to violence and oppreſſion.—He will overſet the thrones which have been eſtabliſhed by wickedneſs, and give univerſal peace to the inhabitants of the world.</p>
            <p>THE time ſhall come, when according to prophetic language "The wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion, and the fattling together." And to give us a repreſentation of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally pacific diſpoſition, it is added, "And a little child ſhall lead them."— <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah 11.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>LET us look forward to that Day with pleaſure and ſatisfaction. In the mean time let us unite in earneſt prayers to Almighty God, that the ſons of vi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p>WE pray for the peace of our Jeruſalem. "They ſhall proſper that love thee.— Peace be within thy walls and proſperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions ſakes, I will now ſay, peace be within thee." <note n="†" place="bottom">Plaſm. 122.</note>
