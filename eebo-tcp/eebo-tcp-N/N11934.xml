            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>JOHN ROGERS, A SERVANT of JESUS CHRIST.</hi> To any of the Flock of Chriſt that may be ſcattered among the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> Greeting.</head>
            <p>I WISH you grace and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath called us with an holy calling, and hath revealed his everlaſting Love (in and through Jeſus Chriſt his beloved Son) unto us by his own ſpirit.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, brethren, I beſeech you to walk worthy of this holy calling, not faſhioning yourſelves according to the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the time of your ignorance, when you were ignorant of the true God; but now being tranſlated out of a ſtate of darkneſs into a ſtate of light, now walk as children of light, bringing forth the fruits of God's ſpirit, ſeeing he hath ſowed the ſeed of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in your hearts, be ye now the followers of them, who through faith and patience, come to inherit the promiſes which God hath made to them that love him; for though you may have a great and terrible wilderneſs to travel through before ye come to inherit that bleſſed promiſe, yet, through faith and patience, you may be led through the great deep, and ſee your enemies drowned in the depth of the ſea, and you ſtand and rejoice in the God of your ſalvation; yet did thoſe afterward periſh that believed not in their journey toward the land of reſt, but fell ſhort of it.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſeen and learned by experience, that it is a needful thing, that patience ſhould have its perfect work, in the day of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that without believing in God, in all trials, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we can enjoy it, without being led by his ſpirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015068_0003_0F95A23D1324B220"/>
it is written, <hi>as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, are the ſons of God; and if we be the ſons of God, then are we heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chirſt, of that inheritance which our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath promiſed us, even that inheritance which is everlaſting;</hi> but take heed leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God, and ſo you come to fall ſhort of that reſt; for there remains the keeping of an everlaſting ſabbath of reſt, to the people of God.</p>
            <p>BUT the people, after they were delivered out of Egypt, periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wilderneſs, becauſe of their unbelief, and ſo fell ſhort of that reſt, which was a figure of the true, unto whom the goſpel was preached; but they not being united to it by faith, they periſhed in the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>BELOVED in the Lord, I am greatly ſenſible, though you are not, how that you are entangled in the evil net of antichriſt, and miſerably bewildered in the traditions and deluſions of a wicked and an adultrous generation, who have gone a whoring from God, and is become an harlot, and her teachers are ſuch as have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the ſheepfold by the door, but have climbed up another way, that is, they are not ſent from God, but have their call and authority from an earthly power, according to what was before told us by our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, how that <hi>in the laſt days there ſhould come falſe, teachers, as there had been of old falſe prophets;</hi> and how that they would deceive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by reaſon of which the way of truth ſhould be evil ſpoken of; and how that many ſhould follow their pernicious ways; therefore it is written, <hi>they ſhall heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears, and ſhall t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall give heed unto fables:</hi> Now the truth which they ſhall turn their ears from is Chriſt himſelf, although they confeſs him in words, yet deny him in works; for Jeſus Chriſt is a quickning ſpirit, and this ſpirit is in all God's children, and is the truth according to Chriſt's words, <hi>I am the way, and the truth, and the life;</hi> he that is in this ſpirit is in the truth, and he that is led by it is in the truth; and it is the life of Chriſt in you, and you need not that any man ſhould teach you, for you are compleat in Chriſt, who is the head of all power and authority whatſoever. I cannot ſay to you as once the apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Chriſt; this is the very grounds of your walking in darkneſs, and not in the light of aſſurance; but I can ſay to you as he did to them in the very next words, <hi>for in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, and ye are compleat in him, and you need not be taught but as that ſpirit of truth teacheth you;</hi> and if ye be followers of it, it will lead you into all truth, even that ſpirit whom the world cannot receive, becauſe the world doth not ſee it, nor know it, but ye know it, for it dwelleth in you, and it hath given you an underſtanding, to know him that is true; you that are of Chriſt's ſheep, have heard his voice ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, in the voice of the ſpirit of truth, which hath taken of his righteouſneſs, and revealed it unto you; and if this ſpirit abide in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Father and in the Son; for to be led by the ſpirit of truth, is the path of the juſt, which will lead unto a perfect light, and by this means you will be able to try the ſpirits of falſe prophets, and alſo of the true; for many falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world, which in words confeſs Jeſus Chriſt to be their king, but ſin rules in them; they will confeſs Chriſt to be their prieſt, but never yet was freed from the guilt of ſin, through the ſacrifice of himſelf; they will ſay he is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but never yet heard the voice of his ſpirit ſpeaking in them; yet they will pray, preach, and make a great outward ſhow, when the ſpirit of Chriſt is not in them. Theſe are the antichriſts and deceivers that we have had fore-warning of, that ſhould come, that have not the ſpirit of Chriſt in them; but ſaith the apoſtle John, <hi>ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things: I have not written unto you becauſe ye know not the truth, but becauſe ye know it.</hi> This unction is the ſpirit of truth, which all God's chrildren are annointed with; it is the immediate teaching of Chriſt, who dwells in his own children, as the ſpirit of the wicked one dwells in his children; and it is the ſpirits that we are exhorted to try, and not to believe every ſpirit; for many falſe prophets were gone out into the world in the days of the apoſtle John, but have now ſpread over nations and kingdoms, who ſet light for darkneſs, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for light, who call evil good, and good evil: Theſe are not called or ſent of God, neither hath Jeſus Chriſt revealed himſelf to them; their call is only from an earthly power, and through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; with feigned words, they make merchandize of you, and their preachings is only their own imaginations or ſtudyings.</p>
            <p>AND I have written unto you the way and manner of God's call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſending his meſſengers, in all ages, as the penmen of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015068_0005_0F95A23DD404ADF8"/>
holy ſcripture have left upon record, whoſe writings are as a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts; which will certainly be, if you order your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright, and become fruitful branches in Chriſt the true vine; for the goings of the Lord towards his people (that are led ſingly by his ſpirit) is like the morning light, which ſhines more and more even unto the perfect day. And there is no writings of the holy prophets or apoſtles that is of any private interpretation; for the ſcriptures of truth came not in old time by the wiſdom or learning of the world, but holy men of God ſpake as they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enlightened by the ſpirit of Chriſt which was in them; and it is the ſame ſpirit that gives us an underſtanding of their writings, according to what is written. Luke xxiv. 45. <hi>Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the ſcriptures,</hi> 1 John v. 20, 21. <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and eternal Life. Little children keep yourſelves from idols.</hi>

               <p>HERE ariſeth a queſtion in the firſt place, what this promiſe is? Which queſtion is reſolved in the 17th verſe; which was the promiſe that God made by the prophet Joel, ſaying, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days (ſaith God) I will pour out of my ſpirit upon all fleſh; and your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy.</hi> So that this promiſe is the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. The ſecond queſtion is, to whom is it promiſed, and upon what conditions? Anſwer, it was promiſed to all that was there preſent, which were both Jew and Gentile, yea, of every nation under heaven, verſe 5. And upon what condition is ſhewed in the 38th verſe? <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, repent, and be baptiſed, every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call:</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, this promiſe is not made only to you that are here this day preſent, but to your children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, and to all that are afar off; for ſo did God before promiſe,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015068_0006_0F95A230DF4B3330"/>
by the prophet Joel, not only to pour out his ſpirit upon their ſons and daughters, but alſo upon all fleſh, that is, ſo many as God ſhall call, both far and near, they repenting, believing, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that this promiſe is made (both to father, ſon and daughter, upon their repentance, and being baptiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) that they ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and alſo to all afar off, not only to Jews, but alſo to Gentiles; as ſaith Paul, Eph. ii. 17. <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off,</hi> that is the Gentiles; <hi>and to them that were nigh,</hi> that was the Jews; for both Jew and Gentile have an entrance into God's love and favour, only by Jeſus Chriſt, and that through the blood of Jeſus, who was that lamb of God that taketh away that ſin of the world.</p>
               <p>NOW the outward waſhing with water by the miniſters of Chriſt, is but an outward ſign to the world; and there is no virtue at all in it; for all divine virtue is only from the divine power, for every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from God; and that is not the baptiſm that is outward with the element of water, but that is the baptiſm that waſheth the heart and inward parts, from the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, James i. 17. Matt. iii. 11. 1 Cor. xii. 13. which is the work of God, done only in the name of his ſon; and by a divine water, which is the water of life, and doth quicken the dead ſinner, that repents and believes in the God that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, he alſo is raiſed up by the ſame ſpirit with Chriſt. And this outward ſign, acted by the miniſters of Chriſt, is a figure of this death, burial, and reſurrection with Chriſt, which is ſeen and felt by every one that is Chriſt's; for they have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate witneſs of God in themſelves, 1 John ii. 20. 1 John v. 10, 20. 2 Tim. iii. 5. But the antichriſtian world, that hath not this immediate inſpiration of God, which is a holy unction, they idolize the outward ſigns, and are enemies to godlineſs, but know nothing of that mighty power that worketh in us; as it is written, Eph. iii. 20. Col. i. 29. 1 John iv. 4.</p>

               <p>THE firſt thing that we are to take notice of is this, that this chapter is an anſwer to what this church wrote to Paul about, and is to reſolve their doubt about marriage; as verſe 1, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as had newly turned from dumb idols to the living God, and queſtioning whether it was lawful for the believer to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the unbeliever, as man and wife; to which doubt Paul gives his judgment, as in the 12th verſe, <hi>but to the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord;</hi> for though he had not any immediate commandment from the Lord, yet he gives them his judgment, ſaying, <hi>If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>And the woman which hath an huſband that believeth not, and if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</hi> And the reaſon that he gives, why the believer ſhould not put away the unbeliever, is this, <hi>that the unbeliever is ſanctified to the believer;</hi> for it is evident, though the marriage was made in the belivers unconverted eſtate, yet to be kept by the believers; for <hi>marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled,</hi> Heb. xiii. 4. But the queſtion here ariſeth, only by the believer; now if the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver be not ſanctified to the believer, then of neceſſity the children muſt be ſo eſteemed alſo, as unclean, and not holy, to the beliver; as in <hi>Ezra</hi> x. 3. and ſo both wives and children to be put away, not being ſanctified, but unclean to the believer: For this ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and holineſs, that the unbeliver and belivers children is to the beliver, comes not in by the redemption of Chriſt, to which baptiſm is a figure of, but by the covenant of marriage, which <hi>is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled;</hi> for the children's holineſs comes as well from the unbeliever as from the believer; for if the unbeliever be not ſanctified by, or to the believer, then the children are unclean to the believer alſo; for theſe children's cleanneſs to the believer, comes in by the unbelievers being ſanctified to or by the believer; ſo that both wife and children are clean to him, or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and children clean to her; but if the one be to be put away, then the other alſo; for if the one be not ſanctified, then is the other unclean alſo, and not holy, and ſo both to be ſeparated from the believer, as not clean; ſo that if the unbeliever be not firſt ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the believer, then are the children unclean alſo to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015068_0008_0F95A2281972E868"/>
believer, and not holy; ſo that the unbeliever bears the root of this holineſs, as well as the believer, which is the cauſe of the branches, or children are holy. Why do ye not baptize, and receive into your churches, in the firſt place? And ſo when you have baptized, and received the unbelievers into your churches, then their children which come to be holy, by their being ſanctified to the believer? For ye fools and blind, whether is greater, the child's holineſs, or the unbeliever's being ſanctified by, or to the believer, by which the children come to be eſteemed holy? elſe ſaith the ſcripture, <hi>they would be unclean;</hi> for which is the greateſt, the gold, or the temple that ſanctifieth the gold? for ſo it is in this caſe.</p>

               <head>Concerning <hi>ABRAHAM'S</hi> Covenant.</head>
               <p>AS to the covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> it contained in it, ſpiritual promiſes as well as temporal; and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral promiſes were figures of the ſpiritual, or ſigns. Now when God made this covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was ninety-nine years of age, and had no child but <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and being affected with God's gracious promiſe, in promiſing and covenanting with him, to <hi>be a God to him, and to his ſeed after him; and to give unto him, and to his ſeed, the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</hi> I ſay, and having no children but <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he breaks forth into ſupplication and prayer to God for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee! And God ſaid,</hi> Sarah <hi>thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon indeed, and thou ſhalt call his name</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and I will eſtabliſh my covenant with him for an everlaſting covenant, and with his ſeed after him. As for</hi> Iſhmael (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I have heard thee, &amp;c. but my covenant will I eſtabliſh with</hi> Iſaac; ſo that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the ſon of promiſe, not being yet born, to whom God promiſed to eſtabliſh his covenant ſaying, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> ſhewing to Abraham, when as yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was in his loins, that he would eſtabliſh his covenant in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in his ſeed, pointing at Chriſt, who was in the loins of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after in <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for this covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was in Chriſt, and he alone was intended of God, who is the natural heir of that inheritance, for God doth not covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, to thy ſeeds, as ſpeaking of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt; <hi>and if we be Chriſt's,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>then are we</hi> Abraham's <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> for we come to be heirs of this inheritance, by adoption in Chriſt, and God comes to be our God and father by adoption; for we are heirs but by adoption in Chriſt, of this inheritance; for we are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015068_0010_0F95A232C5154118"/>
the children of God by faith in Chriſt, upon which the covenant is founded; for the children of the fleſh, though <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, are not counted for the ſeed, nor intended in the covenant; <hi>but it is the children of promiſe,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle. <hi>Now, we, brethren</hi> (ſaith the apoſtle to the Gentiles) <hi>as Iſaac was, are the children of promiſe;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of all them that believe. So that the covenant as it is ſpiritual, and a goſpel covenant, it is made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, counting them only to be <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, who are Chriſt's by adoption, and that through faith, and ſo come into this covenant, Gal. iii. 16, 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 15, 16, 17. Eph. v. 11, 13, 14. 1. Pet. i. 3, 4. Rom. ix. 8. Gal. iv. 18, 29. Rom. iv. 11.</p>
               <p>NOW as the covenant was temporal, it contained only temporal promiſes, which had a temporal token annexed to it, which was the outward circumciſion that was made in the fleſh; but to relate it in order as it was temporal, it was thus, God was a God to Abraham's fleſhly ſeed, begotten by Iſaac and Jacob, in that he brought them out of Egypt, and led them forty years in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gave them the earthly Canaan, read Gen. xv. begining at the 13th verſe to the end, for there the covenant was firſt made with Abraham.</p>
               <p>BUT the goſpel covenant was preached to Abraham by theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, as thus; God is a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, through faith in Chriſt, in delivering them out of the bondage of ſin, and leading them ſafely through the wilderneſs of of affliction, till he brings them to the everlaſting inheritance purchaſed by Chriſt, and there gives them reſt from all their enemies; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is everlaſting, world without end. And the token of this covenant (as it is ſpiritual) is the circumciſion of the heart, wrought by the ſpirit of God, in cutting off our ſins, by the circumciſion of Chriſt; and this circumciſion of the heart is the ſeal of this coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as it is a goſpel covenant; and therefore it is written, <hi>That is not circumciſion that outward in the fleſh.</hi> And again, ſaith the Apoſtle, Abraham <hi>received the ſign of circumciſion,</hi> calling the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumciſion, the ſign of circumciſion, <hi>That he might be the father of all them that believe;</hi> ſo that only them that believe by ſcripture account, are reckoned for Abraham's ſeed: And another ſcripture ſaith, <hi>After that ye belived, ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance;</hi> Rom. ii. 29.

               <p>BAPTISM is an ordinance of the New Teſtament, and it is a viſible figure of the death, burial, and reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and of our death, burial, and reſurrection by Jeſus Chriſt; for the Lord Jeſus did ordain, that the excellent virtues of his ſufferings ſhould be held forth by outward figures, which have no virtue in themſelves, but are outward ſigns of real bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and virtue that we have received by Chriſt. For as Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin through the eternal ſpirit of God, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a lamb without ſpot and without blemiſh;</hi> ſo the repenting ſinner that believes in him, and comes to God through faith in him, God ſends forth his holy ſpirit into the ſinner, in the name of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon, and ſo condemns ſin in the ſinner; that the ſinner feels ſenſibly a death to ſin in himſelf; that he hath an inward witneſs immediately from God; that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt and Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> Gal. iii. 1. 1 John v. 10. And can give as true a witneſs of the death of Chriſt as they that did behold his ſufferings with a mortal eye; and can ſet to his ſeal that the holy ſcriptures are true by an immediate inſpiration of God, 1 John ii. 20, 21. For the ſinner is now born again, and is become a ſaint, and doth ſee by the eye of faith, that the body of ſin, which he before carried about with him, is crucified with Chriſt, dead and buried with him; ſo that the old man, or body of ſin, is put off by the power and ſpirit of God; ſo that he ſees by the ſpirit of faith which dwells in him, that he is put to death in the fleſh, as to ſin, by the virtue of Chriſt's death, applied to him by the ſpirit of God; and he hath not only a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's death, but alſo of his reſurrection; for by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, a reſurrection out of ſin is brought to light, and alſo a reſurrection of the body; for what is loſt by the firſt Adam is recovered by the ſecond; for upon repentance and faith in Jeſus Chriſt there is not only a death to ſin, but the very ſpirit that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead hath quickened us alſo together with him, and raiſed us up to a new life, 1 Pet. iv. 1, 2, 3. So that we are recovered by Chriſt out of a ſtate of ſin al-already, and brought to a ſtate of innocency; and hereby is brought to light a reſurrection of the body, and an eternal life, by the immediate witneſs of God's ſpirit in us, by which we have a lively hope. And thus the ſinner hath an entrance into the love of God by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtands and rejoices in hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, ſeeing he is born of God even by the ſpirit of truth, by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015068_0012_0F95A23352E21F28"/>
which ſpirit he is purified and waſhed from the guilt and filth of ſin; and his body, which before was a body of, in which the prince of the power of the air did rule, is now become the temple of God, even a ſanctified body, being baptiſed by the ſpirit of truth, and thereby made a fit habitation for God to dwell in by his ſpirit, John iii. 5, 6, 7. Heb. x. 22. 1. Cor. iii. 16, 17, chap. vi.xix. 2 Cor. vi. 16.</p>
               <p>NOW this great work, which is the workmanſhip of God, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinſible to the world, and therefore God hath ordained that it ſhall be preached by an outward and a viſible figure, miniſtred by his meſſengers, in burying the repenting and believing ſinner into the likeneſs of Chriſt's death, and raiſing him up in the likeneſs of Chriſt's reſurrection; ſo that the death and reſurrection of Chriſt is figured out, and our death and reſurrection by Chriſt, in that ordinance; and this is the reaſon why we are buried with him in baptiſm, Rom. vi. 3, 4. <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life. Col.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Buried with him in baptiſm, wherein alſo you are riſen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 29. <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do, which are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> So that this ordinance of baptiſm, being adminiſtred according to the form and pattern delivered to us by the ſcriptures, doth by a viſible ſign, preach and ſhew forth the death, burial, and reſurrection of Chriſt, with our death to ſin by Chriſt, as alſo our reſurrection out of ſin by him, and alſo the reſurrection of the body.</p>
               <p>BUT as to the antichriſtian foppery, who have a baſon of water brought into their meeting-houſe, is a ſign of nothing elſe but their own deluſions, an idle of their own invention and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, in the adminiſtring of it, take the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, in vain; and yet will pretend the ſcripture to be their rule, although they walk as contrary to it, as light is to darkneſs; for the ſcripture of the apoſtles teacheth them otherwiſe, although they may be wholly blind, as to any divine light by God's quickening ſpirit, and therefore cannot diſcern the things that are ſpiritual, as God's children can, <hi>who have an unction from the Holy One, and know all things,</hi> 1 John ii. 20.

And ver. 9, it is ſaid, that <hi>Jeſus was baptized of John in Jordan.</hi> And in acts viii. 38, 39, it is ſaid, that <hi>they both went down into the water, and came up out of the water.</hi> As alſo John iii, 22, 23, <hi>after theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

of the New Teſtament, whereby the man Chriſt Jeſus, who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, who was fore-ordained of God to be the <hi>Lamb that ſhould take away the ſins of the world;</hi> and through the blood of this Lamb of God, which is the blood of the New Teſtament, the guilt of ſin is taken away by free pardon and remiſſion of ſin. So that the blood of the New Teſtament is drink indeed; for the free pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin through the blood of Chriſt, is revealed immediately by the ſpirit of God in the ſinner, where remiſſion and forgiveneſs is: And there is no remiſſion of ſin but only by the blood of this Lamb of God, for this is he that came by water and blood. By his blood we have free remiſſion of ſin, and by the divine water we are waſhed or ſanctified from the defilement of ſin, and it is the ſpirit of truth that applies the virtue of his blood to us. So that we being now ſprinkled from an evil conſcience by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, we can draw nigh to God with a true heart, in the full aſſurance of faith, which cauſeth joy unſpeakable, yea, greater than the joy of wine that makes the heart glad; which wine is miniſtred only in remembrance of his blood ſhed for ſin. And his body that was offered a ſacrifice for ſin, by the application of the ſpirit of God, is the true bread of life by which we live; for Jeſus Chriſt is both God and man; for he took our nature and laid down his life, and hath taken it up again, <hi>and of his fullneſs have we all received, and grace for grace,</hi> and becauſe he lives we live alſo; for he hath given us of his ſpirit, even of that ſpirit which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and hath given us life through him, who were dead in ſins before. And it is the ſpirit of Jeſus that quickens us; for ſaith Chriſt, John vi. 63, <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth the fleſh profiteth nothing:</hi> And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> So that the ſpirit of Chriſt is the true bread of life, that quickeneth and ſtrengtheneth us in righteouſneſs, and dwelleth in us; and this true bread of life is given us through the ſacrifice of himſelf, as he was the ſeed of David, whom God raiſed from the dead; for it is he that was dead and is alive, and lives for evermore.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THIS was a parable ſpoken by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was upon the earth, but the hired ſhepherds of Iſrael that he put it forth to, underſtood it not, as in ver. 6, compared with ver. 12. Now a parable is to ſet forth another thing, and hath always a meaning to it, as in Prov. i. 6. Now this parable of Chriſt hath an interpretation to it, which we are to ſearch into. In the firſt verſe we read of a ſheepfold, and a door to enter into the ſheepfold, alſo, they <hi>that enter not into this ſheepfold by the door, but climeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi> In the ſecond verſe we read, that he <hi>that entreth in by the door, is the ſhepherd of the ſheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW theſe things raiſe queſtions, and an enquiry, what this ſheepfold is? And what the flock is? And what the door is? And who the thief and robber is? And who the ſhepherd is that enters in by the door?</p>
               <p>TO which I anſwer: The ſheep is Chriſt's flock, the fold is the place where they reſt, the door is Chriſt, as in verſe 9; the thief and robber were thoſe ſhepherds which the world hired, and not ſent by Chriſt, as in verſe 12; and the ſhepherd that enters in by the door, are thoſe ſhepherds that go not into the fold till Chriſt ſends them; ſo that they enter in by him, who is the good or chief ſhepherd of his own flock, as verſe 14.</p>
               <p>BUT ſome may ſay, I deſire to be farther informed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how Chriſt calls and ſends his ſhepherds, ſo that it may be truly ſaid, they enter into the ſheepfold by the door, which is by himſelf? And alſo, how the thief and robber that climbe up ſome other way into the ſheepfold, may be found out who he is, that ſo the true ſhepherds may be diſcerned from the falſe, and that by ſcripture teſtimony? To which I anſwer: I cannot give fight to the blind, but Chriſt can; as you may ſee in the former chapter

all this diſcourſe aroſe about the blind man, whoſe eyes were opened by Chriſt, the chief ſhepherd; but, for ſeveral reaſons, they did not believe aim to be the chief ſhepherd, but rather took him to be the chief deceiver, or Belzebub; one reaſon was, becauſe he hid the man carry his bed on the Sabbath day, and alſo mingled clay and ſpittle on the Sabbath day; <hi>therefore</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>this man is not of God, becauſe he keepeth not the Sabbath day,</hi> as in chap. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>NOW we ſhall come to deſcribe, by the ſcriptures of truth, which way the true ſhepherds come into their miniſtry; and then 2dly, how the thief and robber climbs up another way, which is the hireling. In verſe 8 ſaith Chriſt, <hi>all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers;</hi> ſo that here in this verſe the thief and robber is ſaid to be thieves and robbers, that is, the hirelings, or hired ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. Now to look with a carnal eye at Chriſt's words, where he ſaith, <hi>all that ever came before me,</hi> it might be objected and replied to him, that Abraham, Moſes, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, and the like, were true ſhepherds, and came into the ſheepfold before thee, yet were no thieves nor robbers, but entered in by the door. Chriſt would have anſwered, they did not come before me, for before Abraham was, I am; and Abraham did not go before I called him, and ſent him, Gen. xii. 1, 4. Iſa. xli. 2. And ſo Moſes did not go before, till I appeared to him in the buſh, and called him, and ſent him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> people Iſrael, to be their ſhepherd. Yea, it may truly be ſaid, that Chriſt was in them, and went with them, and that it was his voice which ſpake; <hi>and that no man taketh this honour to himſelf but he that is called of God, as was Aaron,</hi> Heb. v. 4; if they do they are thieves and robbers, though men and devils or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them in their office, and teach them all the learning that the world can afford; to preach and to pray with all the excellent words they can ſtudy, and that the devil can ſuggeſt into them; yet if Chriſt have not called them, and ſent them, they do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, and a devil is in them, that transforms himſelf as an angel of light. Now ſuch ſhepherds as theſe come not in by the door, but come in as a thief, only to kill and ſteal, as in verſe 10, not being called nor ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the door, but climb up another way. They come to cloath themſelves with the wool, and to kill them that Chriſt hath fed, according to what is written, Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3, <hi>Wo be to the ſhepherds of Iſrael that do
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015068_0018_0F95AA3502408DA8"/>
feed themſelves. Ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed.</hi> Theſe are the hirelings that have no faith in God, but, contrary to the ſcripture, take thought what they ſhall eat, and what they ſhall drink, and how they ſhall be cloathed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no ground of faith in him, not being called nor ſent by him, but climb up another way into the ſheepfold.</p>
               <p>NOW all the true ſhepherds of Chriſt come in by the door, that is, by Chriſt; for they are called and ſent by him into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and ſo enter in by the door, not to kill nor ſteal, but to feed the flock. They do not go before he comes to them, and calls them, and ſends them, and delivers to them the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſo that they enter in by the door into the ſheepfold, that is to ſay, by Chriſt himſelf. And being thus called and ſent by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, having their authority from heaven as John the baptiſt had, and not from an earthly power, they come in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, in oppoſition to the world, and to thoſe hireling ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds that have their authority only from men, and ſo have entered into the ſheepfold another way, and not by Chriſt, who is the door.</p>
               <p>NOW conſider the cloud of witneſſes that have left record in the holy ſcriptures, after what manner Chriſt called and ſent his ſhepherds into the world to feed his flock, and to bear witneſs againſt the thieves and robbers that climb up into the ſheepfold, and enter not in by Chriſt the door, who have their call and authority from an earthly power, and have not ſeen Chriſt nor heard his voice at any time; for tho' <hi>he was in the world, and the world was made by him,</hi> yet <hi>the world knew him not;</hi> neither doth the world know his ſhepherds, and therefore ſaith the ſcripture, <hi>the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew not him;</hi> as Chriſt ſaith to his ſhepherds, <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love you, but becauſe I have choſen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT thoſe <hi>hirelings,</hi> as Chriſt calls them in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. or <hi>thieves and robbers,</hi> as he calls them in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. who have their call and authority from an earthly power, and are not called nor ſent by Chriſt, <hi>they are of the world and therefore the world heareth them,</hi> ſaith the ſcripture. They have their call and commiſſion from the world, and therefore the world heareth them; and they have their reward and their honour from the world. They do not nor cannot deliver any meſſage from Chriſt, for he hath not ſent them with any; but to deceive the world they ſtudy a meſſage of their own heart, and not from the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015068_0019_0F95AA35C06E65B8"/>
mouth of the Lord, according to what is written, Jer. xxiii. 16. <hi>Hearken not unto the words of the Prophets that propheſy unto you; they make you vain; they ſpeak a viſion of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they run; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſied.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>But if they had ſtood in my counſel, and had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>Therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Now theſe Prophets were looked at in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the true Prophets and meſſengers of God, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to be the falſe Prophet, as in Jer. xviii. 18, <hi>chap.</hi> xxix 26, 27, <hi>chap.</hi> xliii. 2. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſly, the Lord our God hath not ſent thee.</hi> Thus they refuſed to hear the voice of Chriſt by his meſſenger whom he ſent, not believing that he was ſent, but inclined their ears to the falſe Shepherds, and would not believe the true. Now this Prophet whom they did not believe, but reviled and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a deceiver, was ſent, and did not run before he was ſent, though he had no call from the earthly power, yet was he called by Chriſt, ſent with the key of knowledge, and ſo entered in by the door, Jer. i. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19. Now when Chriſt ſends his meſſengers thus into the world, it is to be a witneſs againſt them that enter into the ſheepfold, but not by the door, and to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt Kings and Governors for ſetting theſe up, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them whom he hath not ſent. Thus Chriſt comes by his meſſengers, not to ſend a meſſage of peace to theſe intruders, thieves and robbers, or hireling Shepherds, as Chriſt calls them, but to bear witneſs againſt them, and againſt their upholders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is written, <hi>You ſhall be brought before Kings and Governors for my ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them.</hi> And ſaith Chriſt in another place to his brethren that did not believe on him. <hi>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtify againſt it, that the works thereof are evil.</hi> And thus Chriſt comes, not to ſend peace to theſe intruders, who are the chief men of the world, but to ſend a ſword and to kindle a fire; and therefore the Prophet Jeremiah, chap. xv. 10. ſaith, <hi>Wo is me, my mother, that thou haſt born me a man of ſtrife, and a man of contention to the whole earth;</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt's meſſengers always meet with but coarſe entertainment in the world, for they are ſtrangers to it; as Chriſt ſaith to the world, <hi>I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in;</hi> that is, his meſſengers were ſo to the world. Now theſe intruders that come into the ſheepfold, and not by the door, but climb in another way, that is, ſuch as are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of men, and ordained of them, and not called nor ſent by Chriſt, thoſe the world will reward and reſpect, they will feed, and they
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015068_0020_0F95AA364D074BF0"/>
will cloath, and they will viſit: theſe can look every one for his gain from his quarter, as ſaith Iſaiah, chap. lvi. 11. <hi>Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are Shepherds that cannot underſtand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.</hi> Thus it is with theſe Shepherds that have their call from the world, and are not ſent by Chriſt: But the Shepherds whom Chriſt ſends to feed his flock, who are faithful, they come not for gain, nor for reward, but to feed the flock of Chriſt. They covet no man's ſilver or gold, or apparel, but labour with their hands night and day, that they may not be chargeable to any, They conſider Chriſt's words, who ſaid, when he was upon the earth, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give then to receive</hi> Acts xx. 33, 34, 35. Theſe are reviled, reproached, and perſecuted for the ſake of him that ſends, according to what is written, Acts xxviii. 22. <hi>For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt;</hi> but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>wo be unto you, when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their fathers of the falſe prophets; but bleſſed are you when men revile you and perſecute you,</hi> and the like; <hi>for ſo did their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the prophets that are before you.</hi> Thus they did to Jeremiah, chap. xx. 1, 2, and xxvi. 11, and xxxii. 2, and xxxvii. 15, and xxxviii. 6. Iſa. l. 6. Yet theſe their perſecutors made a great ſhew in the world of ſeeming worſhip to God, by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the world and themſelves: They would faſt, and make prayers, and keep ſabbaths, and have ſolemn meetings; thus they garniſhed their outſide with a high profeſſion of the name of God, but their inſide was full of pride, and covetouſneſs, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt, they are ſent by him with a meſſage of peace and reconciliation to thoſe that repent and believe in God; for God will waſh ſuch from the defilement of ſin: And his meſſengers were always ſent with this meſſage, viz. that it is purity and cleanneſs in the inward parts that God looked at, and not a flattering of God with the mouth and lips, when the heart is defiled and full of ſin; and therefore ſaith Jeremiah chap. iv. 14, <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayſt be ſaved.</hi> And Iſa. i. 16, <hi>waſh ye, make you clean.</hi> This hath always been the doctrine of Chriſt's meſſengers, <hi>to make clean the inſide of the cup and platter: To worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth, in the inward man.</hi> But this doctrine is grievious to the world, for they never ſaw a clean inſide waſhed from the guilt and filth of ſin, neither will they believe this meſſage, becauſe their lives are always with the unclean; the ſtrong man of ſin hath ever kept his throne in them, and they never yet ſaw a ſtronger than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the next place, let us come to the following generations, which were in the days when Chriſt and his Apoſtles were in the world; for reaſon will afford us, that the world had got better experience, in ſeeing how their fathers had been deceived, and that by theſe intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that climbed up into the ſheepfold, and how that God puniſhed their fathers with ſore judgments, for the abuſe of his meſſengers, as it is written, 2 Chron. xxxvi. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And the Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place: But they mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy.

Mich. iii. 1, 2, 3. Amos v. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>But I ſay. it was a purified church that came out of Babylon, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015068_0023_0F95AA3EA8F93A30"/>
her ſhepherds were the meſſengers of God, immediately called and ſent of God, as in Hag. i. 13. <hi>Then ſpake Haggai the Lord's meſſenger in the Lord's meſſage unto the people. Zech.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Therefore ſay thou unto them, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Theſe were now true ſhepherds that entered into the ſheepfold by the door; for they were called and ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, and his flock knew his voice, while they were in a ſtate of purity and holineſs while they were an inclining people, and not a declining people, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>my ſheep hear my voice, and the voice of a ſtranger they will not hear, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi> However, it was not long before this people came to be a declining people, and yet retained and upheld an outſide profeſſion; but God that ſearches the heart and the reins, did ſee what his church began to be in her inſide, in the days when he ſent his meſſenger Malachi; ſhe was then much corrupted and declined, yet I do not ſay, but that ſhe kept a fair outſide profeſſion, ſo that ſhe could not come to have a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcerning of herſelf. She was ſo far gone from God, and declined, that ſhe reaſoned with God's meſſenger, in a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way of herſelf; for God had ſent a curſe upon the fruits of the ground, and ſhe could not diſcern the reaſon why it was, ſhe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended thoſe ordinances commanded in the law, which were ſigns and figures of heavenly things, as ſabbaths, ſacrifices, and the like; yet notwithſtanding her exactneſs in theſe things, and all outward rules whatſoever was commanded in the ſcripture, yet while Chriſt ſees the love of his eſpouſals grows cold to him, and that her heart begins to go after other lovers, after the world, and the things of the world, Oh! how this wounds the Lord's ſpirit! jealouſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a grievous thing! for Chriſt to look upon his Church, his ſpouſe, and to ſee her flatter him with her tongue, but ſees her heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him, and ſet upon other lovers, this is grievous to be born; this was the ſtate of her mother, who had a bill of divorce, <hi>Iſa. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, where is the bill of your mother's divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have ſold you? behold, for your iniquities have you ſold yourſelves.

For their heart was not right with him.</hi> Now this pure and ſanctified church of Chriſt that came out of Babylon, begins to be enticed with the love of the world, and her prieſts and teachers were in a declining ſtate, yet not ſo far gone as to perſecute God's meſſenger, yet to be ſo careleſs and negligent of the flock, that they were in great danger of thieves and robbers entering in upon them. But they reaſon with the prophet, Mal. i. 7, <hi>Ye offer poluted bread upon mine altar;

Now they were not ſo far declined as to perſecute him, for ſhe was not yet become a harlot, but began to be bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in Mal. iii. 14. <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Yet here was a remnant that feared the Lord, and obeyed the voice of his meſſenger, and <hi>ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of rememberance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name, ver.</hi> 16. Here we ſee God's church did hearken to his meſſenger, though ſhe was far declined, and her teachers ſo far declined, that they cauſed many to ſtumble at the law, yet were ſtirred by God's meſſengers, ſo that they ſpake often one to another; and then God made them gracious promiſes, how that he would ſend his meſſenger, that was John the baptiſt, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the Lord whom they did ſeek ſhould ſuddenly come, that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, chap. iii. 1.</p>

               <p>Now are we come to the age and perſons to whom Chriſt put forth this parable, and tho' it ſpeaks to all times and ages paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come. As to the time paſt, hath been ſhewed, how that always the true ſhepherds entered in by the door into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, they did not run before they were ſent, and Jeſus Chriſt, as he was God, was preſent with them, and it was his voice that ſpake in them; but thoſe that were not of his ſheep, could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his voice by his ſhepherds, as in ver. 26. but his own ſheep could, as in ver. 27. but his flock is very ſmall, Luke xii. 32. Matt. vii. 14. And we ſhall find, that this great ſhepherd of the ſheep did not run before he was ſent, as in John viii. 26. <hi>I have many things to ſay, and to judge of you, but he that ſent me is true.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He that ſent me, is with me, the father hath not left me alone.</hi> Thus we ſee the great ſhepherd of the ſheep did not run before God ſent him, but followed his calling, till he was about the age of thirty years, Luke iii. 23. But when he was called and ſent of God, he went into the meeting-houſe and taught, but it was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive to the people that were brought up under the hirelings, which they hired to teach them, Mark vi. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And he went from thence, and came into his own country, and his diſciples follow him. And when the ſabbath-day was come began to teach in the ſynagogue; and many hearing him, were aſtoniſhed, ſaying, from whence hath this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, robbers, and hirelings, as Chriſt calls them, they are taught and inſtructed by their ſhepherds, that none are fit to teach but the ſcribes and learned men of the world; and becauſe they ſaw their elders or ſhepherds perſecute Chriſt, they judged him to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, that they were curſed that did believe on him, John vii. 48, 49. For theſe ſhepherds, which were intruders, never had any viſion from the Lord, therefore the people under their teaching, always periſh; their flock ever did and ever will be a depending upon their wiſdom, and their learning, and their ſtudy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never did, nor never will believe any that come from God by an immediate call and ſending. This is the reaſon of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution that ever was; for theſe intruders never had, in any age, any revelation from God, nor never would believe there was any
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015068_0027_0F95AA42F81A32A8"/>
that is to ſay, in their day: They would acknowledge that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom their fathers ſlew, had <hi>immediate revelation</hi> from God, but would not believe any in their day, in no age of the world, and therefore always perſecuted God's meſſengers with a confident boldneſs, <hi>That they were falſe reachers, and ſeducers, and peſtilent fellows, and troublers of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT let us now take a deſcription of them from the mouth of of Chriſt, the great ſhepherd of his flock, for he is the beſt able to give a deſcription of theſe hirelings, thieves and robbers, as he calls them; and when we have a deſcription from Chriſt's own mouth, we ſhall have no reaſon admire why they were offended at him, to take it upon himſelf, as they judged, whom they knew to be a tradeſman, viz. a carpenter, for going into the meeting-houſe to teach; for thoſe that are in their ſtate and condition, are liable to the ſame error and cenſure. For, firſt, conſider their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were wiſe learned men, not brought up to trades, or work, but to learning, to the end that they might be able to teach others; for they did not expect nor believe any immediate call from God; a falſe church and falſe teachers never had nor never did expect any revelation immediataly from God, neither did they believe that any had in their day; they alſo looked at themſelves to be God's church and miniſters, not conſidering that they had gone a whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, were degenerated, and ſo were not now his church.</p>
               <p>BUT to come to the deſcription that Chriſt gives of the ſtewards or intruders into the ſheepfold: They are ſuch ſtewards as cannot work for their living, and to beg they are aſhamed, for they are the learned men of the world. Now when they come to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their ſtewardſhip [it is bad times with ſuch then] theſe bad ſtewards will certainly be as Luke xvi. 3. <hi>Then the ſteward ſaid within himſelf, what ſhall I do? for my Lord taketh away from me my ſtewardſhip, I cannot dig, and to beg I am aſhamed.</hi> For theſe intruders lay heavy payments upon the people, but the receivers bear none of it, according to Chriſt's words, Matt. xxiii. 4. <hi>For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on men's ſhoulders, but they themſelves will not move them with one of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> Here is two deſcriptions of theſe ſtewards, thieves, robbers, or hirelings, as Chriſt calls them; the one is, <hi>they cannot dig, and to beg they are aſhamed,</hi> which ſhews they are the honorable men of the world. The ſecond is, <hi>they are ſuch as lay heavy burdens on the people, but bear nothing themſelves.</hi> Well, let us ſee what further deſcription Chriſt gives of them, viz. <hi>they are ſuch as expect the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

rooms at feaſts, and that men ſhould greet them in the market, and to ſit in the uppermoſt ſeats in the meeting-houſe, and to be called of men, maſter, maſter.</hi> Theſe are very notable deſcriptions that Chriſt gives of them, which will ſtand good to diſcover them in any age or time of the world, whenever they ſhall appear to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, Matt. xxiii. 6, 7. But that which theſe deceive the world with, is, they will ſit on Moſes's ſeat, or climb up into the ſheepfold, under a pretence of expounding Moſes law, and the prophets writings; and under a pretence of duty to God, they will make long prayers, and be very ſtrict in Sabbath-keeping, judging Chriſt and his apoſtles for being ſhort in their duty. And thus theſe blind guides will make clean the outſide of the cup and platter by an outſide ſhow of ſeeming worſhip to God, by which they deceive the goats, but kill and ſteal Chriſt's flock from him; and by this means they feed and cloath themſelves, but their inſide is full of extortion and exceſs: Yet Chriſt ſhews that theſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by theſe outſide pretences, appear righteous to men, Matt. xxiii. 28. <hi>Even ſo ye alſo outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocriſy and iniquity.</hi> But theſe thought in themſelves, that if they had been in the days of their fathers, they would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets; but they are puniſhing and putting to death them that they judge to be evil doers, blaſphemers, perverters of the nation, and deceivers; but it may be, they may be deceived as their fathers were before them, for thus they judged of Chriſt and his apoſtles; but they do ignorantly as their fathers did, as it is written, Acts iii. 15. <hi>Ye killed the Prince of life. Ver.</hi> 27. <hi>And now, brethren, I wet that through ignorance ye did it, as did alſo your rulers.</hi> And ſaith Paul, 1 Cor. ii. 7, 8, <hi>But we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in myſtery, which none of the Princes in this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> But however, they thought themſelves to be in the right way, and thoſe they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, they thought to be in the wrong way, as always a wicked and an adulterous generation doth. <hi>Upon this generation will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all the righteous blood ſhed from the foundation of the world to this very day.</hi> Now it is to be obſerved, that the falſe prophets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep in friendſhip with the judges of the earth, and make an image of worſhip to the earthly power; and they command all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, to worſhip that image, or form of godlineſs, and that no man muſt buy or ſell, that refuſes to worſhip the ſaid image, that is, they muſt not meddle with the ordinances of Chriſt, though they are ſent of God, but muſt be

judged; for theſe will always get into the ſeat of judgment, which is Chriſt's place, and judge thoſe that are ſent of God. as <hi>deceivers and troublers of the world;</hi> and indeed God's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers be, and ever were, offenſive to the world: Yea, the ſcripture ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is a rock of offence, and a ſtone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> For the world always was, and ever will be offended by his meſſengers, becauſe they are witneſſes againſt their falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. When the world ſees ſuch poor objects appear, and do not ſee him that ſent them, they cry, <hi>Do you think ſo ſtand againſt the whole world? Or who is able to make war agaidſt the beaſt?</hi> That is, the earthly power that ſets up falſe worſhip.</p>
               <p>NOW we have had a view of the ſtate of the church in the time of Chriſt and his apoſtles, and find, that they were as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as their fathers that were before them, for all their high conceits and opinions of themſelves, but is a declining church, like to be deceived the third time, yea, ſo often as ſhe declines; for though ſhe keeps all the outward rules of the ſcripture, as exactly, and as ſtrictly as theſe ſcribes and Phariſees did in Chriſt's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now when Chriſt's church is ſo far declined, that ſhe is become a perſecuting church, yea, an adulterous generation, then Chriſt, after ſhe hath had her time and ſpace of repentance, and doth not repent, then he diſcovers her deluſions, by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his appearing in his meſſengers, and diſcovers her ſcarlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls. Now though ſhe be thus beautified and glorified with outward ornaments, enough to win the affection of the whole world, yet ſhall ſhe be ſtripped naked, and made bare of all her outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and her ſcarlet coloured garments ſhall be ſeen to be only coloured with the blood of the ſaints and martyrs of Jeſus, and that ſhe drunk only with the blood of the ſaints whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for deceivers and deluded perſons, and that the ſcarlet-coloured beaſt that ſhe rid upon, was only an earthly power that upheld her, and perſecuted the flock of Chriſt, and ſo became a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, being ſtained with the blood of ſaints and martyrs of Jeſus, and that her teachers were only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated

and inſtituted, defended and maintained by an earthly power.</p>
               <p>IN the next place, let us come to view the cautions and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that Chriſt and his apoſtles give to the children of God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of theſe outſide gilded deceivers, that are garniſhed with an outſide profeſſion, but inwardly are ravening wolves; they will be very ready to judge ſinners, and look upon their own fine gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ordinances of <hi>praying, ſinging, expounding of the ſcriptures, keeping their Sabbaths, faſts,</hi> and the like; are forward to accuſe the woman taken in adultery, although they are every one of them guilty ſinners themſelves. Thus they look upon their outſide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as if they did ſome ſervice to God, without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that it is all ſin and wickedneſs, and burdenſome to God, according to what is written, Iſa. i. 13, 14. <hi>Your Sabbaths, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meetings, and the like, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.

Cor. ii. 3. And all Chriſt's ſhepherds are miniſters of this covenant, as ver. 6. <hi>Not of the letter but of the ſpirit. Now the Lord is of that ſpirit, ver.</hi> 17. And teacheth the righteouſneſs which is of faith, and is written in the heart by the ſpirit, and are not letter teachers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit. Now all that are in covenant with Chriſt, are all immediately taught by him, accoding to what is written, Heb. viii. 11. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt:</hi> They ſhall be all taught of God; and as the apoſtle John ſaith, <hi>They need not that any man teach them, but as this anointing teacheth them,</hi> as before was ſaid. The word that was made fleſh is in all God's children, which is Chriſt's divine nature, even that word which was in the beginning of this world, and all things were made by it, there is not any thing that our eyes behold, that was made without it; for in that word is life, and this word is in all God's children, and is their teacher, and this word is God, 1 John v. 7. <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe three are one.</hi> Now this is the commandment of God, that we ſhould believe on the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, and he that keepeth theſe commandments dwelleth in God, and God in him; and by this we know that Jeſus Chriſt dwelleth in us, by the ſpirit he hath given us, and this ſpirit of God witneſſeth to our ſpirits, that we are his children. So that all God's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which have received his ſpirit, and are led by it, walk in a perfect light, and a clear ſight, that they are the children of God, for all ſuch have the witneſs of God in themſelves, even his ſpirit witneſſing to their ſpirits, that they are his children, and theſe can draw nigh to God, in a full aſſurance of faith, for there are no clouds of darkneſs comes betwixt God's ſpirit and theirs, while they are obedient children, being led ſingly by his ſpirit, they come under no condemnation, but their inward joy and peace

Seeing then that it is the heart and inward parts that God looks at, and a clean inſide, which is cleanſed by the blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt, then we ought to beware of falſe prophets that come in ſheep's cloathing, not having Chriſt's ſpirit in them, but a ravenous ſpirit, even the ſpirit of a wolf, and not of a lamb; and therefore ſaith the apoſtle John, <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God; for many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> Thus we are taught to try the ſpirits of theſe prophets, and not their profeſſion only, for they may ſay, and do not; therefore examine them, whether Jeſus Chriſt be come into them (and caſt out the ſtrong man of ſin that rules in the antichriſts) and whether they can ſay with Paul, <hi>It is not I that live, but Chriſt that liveth in me, and Chriſt in me is my hope of glory;</hi> and as John ſaith unto the children of God, <hi>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them,</hi> that is, the falſe prophets, as in the foregoing verſes; <hi>for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world;</hi> for he that is in the children of this world, is the prince of the power of the air; but he that is in God's children, is Jeſus Chriſt, who rules in them in righteouſneſs, and is their King, who hath offered himſelf a ſacrifice for their ſins, and hath purged them from the guilt and filth of ſin, and therefore is their prieſt; and he hath ſent his ſpirit into their hearts to teach them, and therefore is their prophet, or teacher, and they need not that man teach them, but as that ſpirit teacheth them. And ſo I ſhall conclude with Paul's good exhortation to all that are under the profeſſion of the name of Chriſt: Not to deceive themſelves with a bare profeſſion of his name, but to examine themſelves, whether they be believers or not, by looking in their own hearts, to ſee whether Jeſus Chriſt be in them; for if he be not, then are you but droſs, and not ſilver, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. <hi>Examine yourſelves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own ſelves; know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobrates?

               <p>The firſt Miniſtration was the Miniſtration of God's Juſtice to the Tranſgreſſor, in which Miniſtration the Light of the ſpiritual Law of God was communicated to <hi>Adam</hi> and to his Poſterity, which gave them the Knowledge of Good and Evil, even the Knowledge of Sin, and this came by eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was in the Midſt of the Garden of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Miniſtration</hi> is the Miniſtration of Life and Righteouſneſs to the Tranſgreſſor, in which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration God's free Grace and Mercy is miniſtred to him through Jeſus Chriſt; for in this Miniſtration the Cherubims and flaming Sword, which turned every Way to keep the Tree of Life (leſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould alſo put forth his Hand and take of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever) is removed, that the Tranſgreſſor

may come at the Tree of Life, and put forth his Hand, and take of that alſo, and eat thereof and live forever, which Tree of Life was in the Midſt of the Garden of God alſo.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are only under the firſt Miniſtration, are under the Guilt of their Sins, and the Wrath of God, and have a Spirit of Fear attends them, whoſe Kingdom and Glory is of this World.</p>

               <p>In the firſt Miniſtration there is only Juſtice miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Tranſgreſſor; in the ſecond Miniſtration there is only Mercy miniſtred to the Tranſgreſſor.

But thoſe that are under only the firſt Miniſtration, they are under the Law, and not under Grace, and their Kingdom is only of this World; for they bear only the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and have only the Light of the moral Law, which is the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which Knowledge is the Effect of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; by which Knowledge they ſhall be

               <p>So that they which are under the firſt Miniſtration only, they have received a Light, by which they ſee themſelves to be under the Guilt of Sin, and therefore fear the Wrath of God.</p>
               <p>But they that are under the ſecond Miniſtration, have received a Light, by which they ſee themſelves made free from Sin, and ſo conſequently free from Guilt, and free from the Fear of God's Wrath. But thoſe that are under only the firſt Miniſtration have not this Goſpel Light, and therefore know nothing of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they believe there is ſuch a Thing; for they have eaten only of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but have not yet taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Tree of Life in the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that their Eyes have not ſeen, nor their Ears heard, neither hath it once entered into the Heart, the Things which God hath made known by his Spirit to them that are under the ſecond Miniſtration, by which Spirit they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Followers of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is their alone Pattern, ſince he came into the World.</p>
               <p>But before he came into the World, thoſe that were under the ſecond Miniſtration were led and taught by a ſhadowing Law, and were under Typical Judges Kings and Prieſts, who were Types of Chriſt's kingly, prophetical and prieſtly Offices; but ſince his coming

in the Fleſh they are ceaſed, and he himſelf is their alone King, Prieſt and Prophet to rule and teach them, in a more Evangelical or Goſpel Way; and this was propheſied of before his coming into the World, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from the Midſt of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken.</hi> Iſa. 3.6. <hi>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name ſhall be called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Councellor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, of the Increaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no End.</hi> Pſal. 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt forever after the Order of Melchizedeck.</hi> Thus was he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of before his coming in the Fleſh, to wit, in his prophetical, kingly and prieſtly Offices; but he being now already come, we are to hear him in all Things, and to follow him in all exemplary Things, and he alone is to rule in his Church, being their King, Prieſt and Prophet.</p>

               <p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015068_0041_0F95AA573430A820"/>
theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38, 39. Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, but I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not Evil. Now this was the Work of the Judges un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtration of the Law of Juſtice, to reſiſt this Evil, on the Behalf of him that was ſmitten, who was to give Life for Life, Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.23, 24. So that the Lord doth both forbid ſuch a Judgment by his Diſciples, and doth alſo forbid the Proſecution of it by him that ſuffers the Wrong, being his Diſciple. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give Place unto Wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord. By this, we may ſee, the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, are not to avenge themſelves by an earthly Judge, as they had Liberty to do under the Law: but they are to leave Vengeance unto their Lord, who will repay it on their Behalf; and to take him alone for their Example, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. for God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World by him might be ſaved. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.47. for I came not to judge the World, but to ſave the World: neither did he aſſent to condemn the Woman taken in Adultery, but ſaid unto her, go and ſin no more. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus are we to be Followers of him, who is our only Preſident and Example to follow. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. Be ye Followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt. And thus are we to be Followers of him, and not to take the Place of a Judge upon us, from the Hands of the Children of this World, and ſo follow them in their Kingdom, to ſit with them in Judgment, to judge and condemn Sinners, whom Chriſt did not come to judge,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015068_0042_0F95AA57699727E0"/>
or to condemn, but to ſave. And alſo ſeeing he who was without Sin, hath not executed Juſtice upon us who were Sinners, but hath extended his Grace and Mercy to us, in acquitting and forgiving us, ſo ought we to be Followers of him, and not now become Judges and Condemners of Sinners, ſeeing he hath not judged nor condemned us for our Sins. And ſeeing he who was without Sin, did not caſt a Stone at the Woman taken in Adultery, who was a Sinner, ſo likewiſe let us, who were once Sinners, learn of him to be merciful unto Sinners, as he hath been merciful unto us, who came not to deſtroy Men's Lives but to ſave them, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.56.</p>
               <p>And by his Doctrine, he teacheth us that the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare are not carnal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. and that we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. but we know that the Weapons of the Powers of this World are carnal, and that they have no other Weapons to fight withal, and that it is Fleſh and Blood they fight againſt; contrary to Chriſt's Doctrine here taught to his Diſciples; for they are under the Miniſtration of the Law (but Chriſt's Diſciples are under the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel) but God hath put into their Hand the Sword of Juſtice, and they themſelves alſo ſhall be judged by the Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>But Chriſt's Doctrine doth not give his Diſciples ſo much Liberty as to defend themſelves by the Law of Juſtice from the Hands of earthly Judges. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, but I ſay unto you that ye reſiſt not Evil, &amp;c.

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:015068_0043_0F95AA58D63BC9A8"/>From hence we may obſerve, That under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Law, before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, it was an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, that is, if any Man ſmote another Man's Eye or Tooth out, he might reſiſt by the Law and Judges, who were to give Eye for Eye and Tooth for Tooth; but now in the clear Goſpel Diſpenſation, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is, by Chriſt's Doctrine, forbidden to reſiſt this Evil by the Hands of worldly Judges, but are to commit their Cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.23. who hath ſaid to his Church, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,</hi> ſaith the Lord; therefore if thine Enemy be hungry, feed him; if he be thirſty, give him drink; for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heap Coals of Fire on his Head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19, 20.

               <p>And foraſmuch as Chriſt's Followers have no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from him to defend themſelves by the Law of Juſtice, from the Hands of earthly Judges, ſo it doth conſequently follow, that they are not to ſit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them; for that is alſo abſolutely forbidden both by his Doctrine and Example; for, ſaith he, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> Joh. 18.36.

departed again into a Mountain alone.</hi> From hence we may note, that he declares that his Kingdom is not of this World. And ſecondly, When they would have made him a King, he refuſed to receive that Office at their Hands, to wit, to be a King by the Ordination or Appointment of Man; for the Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of this World are the Ordinances of Men, who ordain them to their Offices, to govern and rule over them; for ſo hath God appointed it ſhould be among them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake, whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Governors, as unto them him that are ſent by him for the Puniſhment of Evil Doers.</hi> From hence we may obſerve, that a worldly King is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man, for it is they that have ordain'd him and ſet him over them, by God's Appointment, to rule &amp; govern them, under the Miniſtration of the Law, they being the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Succeſſors in his Kingdom. And earthly Governors they are alſo the Ordinance of Men, for the King hath ordained them under him to puniſh Evil Doers; and all this is by God's Appointment under the firſt Miniſtration of the Law, and is ſo to continue ſtill over them that are under the firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, to wit, of the Law.</p>
               <p>And alſo, under the Law, before Chriſt was Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, God ſet over his Church a typical Kingdom and a typical Prieſthood, till he came in the Fleſh, who is the alone and only Ordinance of God, and not the Ordinance of Man, as worldly Kings are; but God alone hath ordained him to be a King and a Prieſt forever over his Church, whoſe Members in this World are as Strangers and Pilgrims, according to what

               <p>From hence we may obſerve, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Ordinance of God, and not of Man; for it is God alone that hath ordained him to be a King, and not Man; and ſaith Chriſt unto his Diſciples, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> So that God hath appointed Chriſt's Kingdom, and Chriſt hath appointed his Diſciples Kingdom. And this he ſaith unto them, that they may know, as his Kingdom is not of this World, ſo likewiſe that their Kingdom is not of this World; and as he refuſed to exerciſe kingly Power in this World, ſo ought they to refuſe the ſame likewiſe, and to take him for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who though he was born a King, and for this Cauſe came into the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.37. yet, ſaith he, <hi>I am among you as he that ſerveth;</hi> and therefore he teacheth them, as being their Preſident, to take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

by him, and to learn of him, who did conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to miniſter to them in the meaneſt Service in the World, even to waſh their Feet, <hi>John</hi> 13.4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Even thus he hath left us an Example to miniſter one to another in this ſtrange Country, even while we are Strangers among the Kingdoms of this World, and not to exerciſe Lordſhip or Authority among them; for ſaith he, and they that exerciſe Authority upon them, are called <hi>Benefactors,</hi> but ye ſhall not be ſo, ſaith he, but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that doth ſerve.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee, that though God hath appointed the Children of this World to ordain Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors over them, to puniſh Evil Doers whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory is of this World, yet he hath not ſo ordained among his Diſciples, but hath appointed a King over them, whoſe Kingdom is not of this World, and his Servants are but Strangers here in the World, being free born Subjects to his Kingdom, being born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. but though the Children of God are free from the Kingdoms of this World; yet they are not to uſe this Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God, and of Chriſt, they are to honour all Men, and to love the Brother-hood, to fear God and to honour the King, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16, 17.

               <p>We thus ſeeing that Chriſt hath rebuked the Uſe of Sword in his Church, and that they are to learn War no more, but are to beat their Swords into uſeful Tools, for neceſſary Uſes; it is an evil Thing for a Chriſtian to practiſe any Geſture that tendeth to War, as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, warding or training, or exerciſing any Poſture leading to War; for it is ſome Degree of Contempt to the Doctrine of Chriſt, who hath taught us to learn War no more, but to live the Life of Faith and Love, who hath promiſed us his Protection and Preſervation from Famine, Peſtilence and Sword, when we love him and keep his Commandments, as throughout the 91 <hi>Pſalm, Job</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10.</p>
