            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as my Father was thus waiting and looking for a more general breaking forth of this glorious, powerful and Goſpel-day, which had in a good degree ſprung up in his Heart, he had not, as yet, ſeen that worthy and good Man GEORGE FOX, although he paſſed through thoſe Parts about that Time; but ſoon after came WILLIAM DEWSBERRY, and at the Sound of his Voice, I have heard my Father ſay, he was exceeding glad, in hearing him declare the Way to find the loſt Piece of Silver, the Pearl of great Price <hi>within,</hi> a Saviour <hi>near,</hi> that had been held forth by Men to be at a diſtance. But having left the dark Watchmen, of whom they uſed to enquire, they now met with their Beloved at home, in their own. Boſoms; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned be the great Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus the hearing and, receiving the ever bleſſed Truth, was as the Seed, or Word of the Kingdom, ſown in the <hi>good Ground,</hi> or honeſt Hearts of Men, which took Root downward and ſprang upward, and brought forth Fruit in ſome <hi>thirty,</hi> in ſome <hi>ſixty,</hi> and in others an <hi>hundred Fold,</hi> to the Praiſe of the great and good Huſbandman.</p>
               <p>My ſaid Father was early raiſed up to bear a publick Teſtimony, which was living and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Friends, but was ſo much attended with Weakneſs of Body for many Years, that he went little abroad in the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. He ſuffered patiently the Spoiling of his Goods, and Impriſonment of his weakly Body,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018158_0009_0FA5622DB6A8F738"/>in the great and more general Impriſonment; he not only believed in Jeſus Chriſt, but ſuffered for him; he was a good Neighbour, a loving Huſband, and a tender Father over all that was good, but ſevere to all that which was wrong, and was for Judgment, without Reſpect of Perſons, and ſpared it not even to his own Children; and eſpecially he was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for me, <hi>for,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>I was the wildeſt of them;</hi> and as he lived well, and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, I doubt not but he has finiſhed his Courſe in the Love and Favour of God, is entered into a Manſion of Glory, and is at Reſt with all the Faithful who <hi>loved not their Lives unto Death,</hi> but rather hated them in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that endeared and unfeigned Love they bore to God the Father, and to Jeſus Chriſt his dear and well-beloved Son, who died for them, and alſo for the whole World.</p>
               <p>He departed this Life in 1679, aged about fifty-five Years, and was decently buried in Friends burying Place in <hi>Hotham,</hi> near <hi>Cave,</hi> where he was born.</p>

I was young when my Father died, not above thirteen Years of Age, yet the Lord was at work by his Light, Grace and holy Spirit in my Heart, but I knew not then what it was which inwardly diſquieted my Mind, when any Thing which was evil did prevail over the Good in me, which it oftentimes did, for want of taking heed to that of God in my Heart; I deſired Eaſe and Peace ſome other Way, without taking up the Croſs of Chriſt to my own corrupt Will, and ſtrove for ſome Time (as no doubt many do) to make merry over the juſt Witneſs, until for a Seaſon the converting and true Witneſs of God ſeem'd to be ſlain, or diſappear'd, and then I took Liberty, but not in groſs Evils which many ran into, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved religiouſly inclined, ſeeking after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and enquiring of them, for my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Satisfaction, to find (if I could) any Thing that was ſafe to reſt in, or any true and ſolid Comfort to my poor diſconſolate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd Soul, but I was afraid I ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, or take up a falſe Reſt in any Thing that was wrong or unſafe; which was the great Love and Mercy of God to me. But after many Searchings and Enquirings among thoſe who were but in the Letter without, and in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, where the Veil is over the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Eye of the Mind is not truly opened to ſee into Things that are inviſible, and hid from all carnal-minded Men; even ſo was my State and Afflictions hid from them, and all the deceitful Workings of Satan, and the

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018158_0014_0FA56233D1724348"/>Heart, before I met with his inward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to me, in and by his holy Spirit, Light and Grace; but when the true Light did begin to ſhine more clearly, and the living Witneſs did ariſe in my inward Man, Oh then my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, bewildered and miſerable condition began to appear, and then great and unutterable were my Conflicts, and the Diſtreſs I was in; I thought no Man's Condition upon the Face of the whole Earth was like mine; I thought I was not ſit to die, neither did I know how to live; I thought in the Evening, <hi>Oh! that it was Morning;</hi> and in the Morning, <hi>that it was Evening.</hi> I had many ſolitary Walks in the Fields, and other Places, in which I many Times poured out my Complaints and Cries before the Lord, with fervent Supplications to him, that he would look upon my Afflictions, and the ſtrong Temptations I was then under, and that he would rebuke the Adverſary of my Soul, and deliver it, for I even thought it was as in the Jaws of a devouring Lion, and amongſt the fiery Spirits, and, as it were, under the Weight of the Mountains. Read and underſtand the Afflictions of thy Brother, thou that haſt come through great Tribulations, and haſt waſhed and made thy Garments white in the Blood of the Lamb; this is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Baptiſm which <hi>doth ſave,</hi> and of that Waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which the Lord <hi>ſheds upon the Believers in abundance;</hi> this is the Blood which <hi>ſprinkleth the Heart from an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018158_0015_0FA56235E853F598"/>that the Children of Men,</hi> thus changed, <hi>may ſerve the living and true God;</hi> this is the Life which <hi>converts the World,</hi> even as many as are converted; this is the Virtue, Life and Blood, which <hi>maketh clean the Saints Garments, and inwardly waſheth them from all Filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi> I found this was and is he of whom it is ſaid, <hi>by him were all Things made, and he is Lord of all;</hi> a Man ought to be Servant to him, and all Things in Man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to him, who commands and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all Things, in whom all the Types and Shadows alſo do end, or are fulfilled.

               <p>Although I had ſeen many Things, and had divers Openings, yet great were my Trials, and many were the Temptations I met with in thoſe Days, for I lived at a Diſtance from Friends, and Meetings, which made my Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the harder, as will more fully hereafter appear, in the Courſe of my Travels and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in this Vale of Tears and Troubles, and ſome of them not very common; but the Lord helped me through them all, bleſſed be his Name for ever.</p>
               <p>I now came to witneſs that Scripture to be fulfilled, which faith, that <hi>when the Lord's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018158_0016_0FA56236A9740B98"/>are in the Earth,</hi> or earthly Hearts of Men, <hi>the Inhabitants learn Righteouſneſs:</hi> And notwithſtanding there was an Averſion in my wild Nature to the People in ſcorn called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as alſo to the Name itſelf, yet when the afflicting Hand of the Lord was upon me for my Diſobedience, and when, like <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> I ſaw in the Light <hi>my Hurt</hi> and <hi>my Wound,</hi> I bemoaned myſelf, and mourned over that juſt Principle of Light and Grace in me, which I had pierced with my Sins and Diſobedience; and although that Miniſtration of Condemnation was glorious in its Time, yet great were my Troubles, which humbled my Mind, and made me willing to deny myſelf of every Thing which the Light made known in me to be evil, I being in great Diſtreſs, and wanting Peace and Aſſurance of the Love of God to my Soul; the Weight of which ſo humbled my Mind, that I knew not of any Calling, People, Practice, or Principle, that was lawful and right, which I could not embrace, or fall in with. This was ſurely like the Day of <hi>Jacob's</hi> Troubles, and <hi>David's</hi> Fears; I ſaw that the Filth of <hi>Sion</hi> was to be purged away by the Spirit of Judgment and of Burning; this is the Way of the Deliverance and Recovery of poor Men out of the Fall, and the Time of the Reſtoration of the Kingdom to God's true <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Read ye that can, and underſtand. This was the Day of my Baptiſm into the Love of God, and true Faith in his beloved Son, as alſo into a Feeling of, or Sympathy with him in his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018158_0017_0FA562378675BB78"/>Sufferings, which were unutterable, and I found that Miniſtration changed; that which <hi>had been unto Death,</hi> was now unto Life; and the Miniſtration which was <hi>of Condemnation</hi> unto the firſt Birth, when that was ſlain, and in a good degree nailed or faſtened to the Croſs of Chriſt the Power of God, then the Good prevailed over the Evil, and working out the Evil in the Mind, and alſo in the Members, made all good or holy. The Lord's living Power, and conſuming burning Word, when it works and prevails, it brings into Subjection, and maketh the very Heart or Ground holy in Men.</p>
               <p>Whereas there had been an Averſion in me to the People called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> and alſo to their ſtrict living and Demeanour, Plainneſs of Habit, and Language, none of which I learned from them; for when the Lord changed my Heart, he alſo changed my Thoughts, Words and Ways, and there became an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in me to Vice, Sin and Vanity, as there had been to the Ways of Virtue, but having taſted of the Terrors and Judgments of God becauſe of Sin, I was warned to flee from ſuch Things as occaſioned Chriſt's Coming, <hi>not to bring Peace upon the Earth, but a Sword;</hi> a Sword indeed, yea, his Heart-penetrating, ſearching Word, <hi>which is ſharper than any two-edged Sword,</hi> that pierceth to the cutting or <hi>dividing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>nder between Fleſh and Spirit, Joints and Marrow.</hi> And as thus I came to ſee and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018158_0018_0FA562382927EF38"/>abhor the Evil in myſelf, when ſuch who had been my Companions in Vanity reviled me, or came in my Way, I was often moved to warn and reprove them, having as before hinted, taſted of the Terrors of the Lord for Sin, I could not well forbear to warn others to flee ſuch Things as I had been judged for. Now I came clearly to be convinced about the <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, bowing the Knee,</hi> the <hi>corrupt Language,</hi> as well as <hi>finery</hi> in <hi>Habit;</hi> all which for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake, and the Peace thereof, I came to deny, and take up the Croſs to, and had great Peace in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Although the bleſſed Truth thus prevailed in me, yet notwithſtanding, I was not without great Conflicts of Spirit, Temptations and Trials of divers kinds; nevertheleſs, my Mind was reſigned to the Lord, and my fervent Prayers were to him, and he kept me, and opened my Underſtanding, for I was afraid of being miſled in any Thing, eſpecially relating to my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I came to be weaned from all my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and Lovers which I had taken Delight and Pleaſure in, and all Things in this World were little to me, my Mind being much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of the World, and not only the corrupt and evil Part thereof, but even from the lawful Part; ſo that my Heart and Mind became much inclined and given up to ſeek the Lord, waiting upon him to feel his Preſence, and Peace, and to know his Will, and receive Power to do the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:018158_0019_0FA56238F1619230"/>
As thus my Mind came to be brought into a depending and waiting Frame upon the Lord, and to be ſtayed in the Light, and experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and feelingly to partake of his Love and Grace, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elped me againſt my Infirmities, (bleſſed be his Name) I found it ſufficient for me, as I kept to it, in all Trials and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Then I came to ſee, that all the outward Performances in Matters of Religion did not avail nor render Man acceptable to God, but as the Heart came to be truly given up to him, that he might not only purge it from Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but keep it clean through the Indwelling of his holy Spirit: And, as near as I remember, I ſaw clearly through theſe Things before the ſixteenth Year of my Age; although, between the Death of my Father and this Time, I took Liberty to go among what People I would, my Mother giving us great Liberty, although ſhe was a Woman well accounted of among all People who knew her, and not undeſervedly, for her Induſtry and fair Dealing concerning the Things of this World.</p>
               <p>After this Time I attended the Meetings of the Lord's People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as diligently as my Circumſtances would well admit: My Mother being left with five Children, I had only one Siſter who was elder than myſelf and three Brothers younger, the youngeſt about three Years old when my Father died, he leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little of this World to bring us up with; yet my Parents always had as much as kept them above Contempt, and no body loſt by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018158_0020_0FA56239A7B0A500"/>them; but I found myſelf under a Neceſſity to work hard for my own Support, the Help of my Mother, and Education of my Brothers, more eſpecially as my Siſter died ſoon after.</p>
               <p>We being leſt in a Farm of Grazing, and part Huſbandry or Tillage, did well as to the Things of this World, yet I cannot well omit mentioning one Thing which became a great Exerciſe to me, which was thus; my Mother married one that was zealous for the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and I being much againſt it, ſhewed my Diſlike to the Marriage, and told my Mother, <hi>I was afraid that ſhe had too much an Eye to what he had,</hi> for he was counted rich as to this World; <hi>but if ſhe thought to augment our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſo marrying, the Hand of the Lord would be againſt her, and a Blaſting or Mildew would come upon even that which we had got through Induſtry and hard Labour, and what the Lord had intended to have bleſſed to us, if we kept faithful to the Truth, and contented ourſelves with our preſent Conditions.</hi> Then my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>as to the worldly Enjoyments, it had not been better with her than now.</hi> I muſt write with great Caution; ſhe was my Mother, and a tender Mother over me, and was loth to offend me, and had promiſed, as far as ſhe well durſt, not to marry with any one with whom I was not ſatisfied. But as to their Procedure in Courtſhip, and Marriage, from this Time I was intirely ignorant, until it was accompliſhed. But when my poor Mother was married, her Cry was, <hi>My Son, how ſhall I ever be able to look
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018158_0021_0FA5623B0750FC60"/>him in the Face any more, it will be ſuch a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him; he that hath not at any Time diſobliged me, but if I bid him go, he ran; and if I bid him do any Thing, he did it with all his Might;</hi> or to that Effect, as ſeveral told me who heard her. But ſhe being married, what we had was mixed with my Father-in-Law's Goods, and my Mother died firſt, and our Father married again, made his Will, and dying, left me Five Shillings for all my Part, which was of Right to deſcend from my own Parents upon me; I gave his Executors a Receipt in full, and there was an End of all, except ſome ſmall Matter given to my youngeſt Brother, for the reſt of my Brothers and Siſter were dead. As near as I remember, this Marriage was in the eighteenth Year of my Age, ſo that what I foreſaw about the <hi>Blaſt</hi> and <hi>Mildew,</hi> came to paſs.</p>
               <p>Now to return to my further Account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Troubles and Trials that attended me in the Time while I was in my Father-in-Law and Mother's Houſe, after Marriage; we, and what we had, being removed to his Houſe, except Part of the Stock which was left in the Ground. Now I foreſaw that I was like to come to a great Trial, and I was brought very low, what with the Trouble about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Exerciſe of my Mind concerning my own Condition, having had many great Conflicts of Spirit, ſo that I was almoſt in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Alſo, when I came to my Father's Houſe, he being a Man much given to Family Duties, of ſaying Grace, &amp;c. before and after Meat, none of which I could comply with, except I felt evidently the Spirit of Truth to attend therein, and open the Heart and Mouth into ſuch Duties. The firſt Day I came to the Houſe, being called to the Table with all or moſt of our Family, I thought, <hi>Is it now come to this? I muſt either diſpleaſe my heavenly or earthly Father:</hi> But oh! the Awfulneſs, or deep Exerciſe which was upon my Spirit, and ſtrong Cries that aſcended unto the Lord for my Help and Preſervation that I might not offend him. My Father-in-Law ſat with his Hat partly on, and partly off, with his Eyes fixed on me, as likewiſe mine were on him in much Fear; ſo we continued as long or longer than he uſed to be in ſaying Grace, as they call it, but ſaid nothing that we heard; ſo at length he put on his hat again, to the Wonder of the Family: Neither did he then, or ever after, aſk me why I did not put off my Hat; neither
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018158_0023_0FA5623CF6FBE5B0"/>did he perform that Ceremony all the Time I ſtayed with him, which was above one Year: Thus the Lord helped me, renowned be his great Name now and for ever. My Father might ſeem for Age, Spirit and Underſtanding, to have been much more than a Match for me a poor Shrub, but the Lord (who cauſed the Pillar of the Cloud to be bright and give Light to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brought Darkneſs upon the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and fought againſt them, and for <hi>Iſrael</hi>) I believe touched and ſmote my poor Father, that he could not riſe up againſt that Power the Lord helped me with. For it was not mine but the Lord's doing, to him be given the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Praiſe, Salvation and Strength, now and for ever. I ſaw clearly, that there could not be any true and acceptable Worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God, but what was in the Spirit, and in the Truth, neither could any pray aright, but as the Spirit helped them, which teacheth how to pray, and what to pray for, and rightly prepares the Mind, and guides it in the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of every Service which the Lord calls for from his Children.</p>
               <p>I found my Father-in-Law was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with my going to Meetings, yet I could not ſee what Way to appeaſe his Diſpleaſure, except in being very diligent (which I was) in his Buſineſs, rather beyond my Ability, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very hard; it is almoſt incredible what my poor little weak Body went through in thoſe Days, but all would not gain his Love, for the longer I ſtay'd with him, the more his Love
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018158_0024_0FA5623D69BA7EC0"/>declined from me; although I told him, <hi>he need not be uneaſy about my Wages, for I would leave that to himſelf:</hi> I could not ſee what he could have againſt me, except my going to Meetings, however that was all he alledged. Now when his former Stratagems would not do, he offered me a Horſe to ride on, if I would go with him to his Place of Worſhip. I met with many a Snib and ſour Countenance from him, in my return on Foot from Meetings, although as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably as my Body was capable of performing; for my Father commonly ſent me on the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Mornings into the Fields a Mile or two, and as far upon a Common to look at Beaſts, Horſes, and Sheep (all this on Foot) I thought with a Deſign to weary and make me uncapable of going to Meetings; all which I bore patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither, that I remember, ever ſaid, <hi>this is hard Uſage;</hi> after all this, to the great Grief of my poor Mother, I had to go two, three, four, five, and ſometimes ſix Miles, to Friends Meetings. After I had walked faſt, and ran ſometimes with my Shoes under my Arms for want of Time, I have ſeen many Friends weep, and could not forbear when they ſaw me come into the Meeting very hot and in a great Sweat, they being in part ſenſible of the hard Taſk I had to undergo.</p>
               <p>There is one Thing ſomewhat remarkable, which was thus; one Firſt-day Morning when I was about going to the Meeting, my Father ſaid, <hi>iſ I would ride upon ſuch a young Mare,</hi> as he mentioned, <hi>I might;</hi> which was one of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018158_0025_0FA5624085E3B4A8"/>greateſt of ten or twelve Horſes which he kept, about four Years old, and not before rid at all: I thought his Deſign was more to hinder me of the Meeting than any Good to me, or any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of getting his Mare rightly broke, but I accepted his Offer, only aſking how I might catch her? Having got Help to anſwer that, ſhe being abroad, I put on the Bridle and mounted the topping Beaſt, and upon her firſt Reſiſtance, down ſhe came; for that was my way: And if the firſt or ſecond Fall did not, the third moſtly cured them from ſtriving to throw the Rider; I commonly fell upon my Feet, and endeavoured ſo to free my Legs that ſhe might not fall upon them, and then ſprang up on her Back while down, and made her riſe with me; ſo away we went, and came in due Time to the Meeting. This was partly the beginning of this way of managing Horſes by me; ſo I rid to the Meetings two or three Times, and then my Father aſked me, <hi>if the Mare did not carry me ſoberly?</hi> I replied, <hi>ſhe did;</hi> then I muſt have her no more, he would make her his Saddle-Mare; ſo I betook myſelf to my Feet again, except ſome other ſuch like Turn came. The Lord's mighty Power bore me up, and he gave me as it were Hind's Feet, and enabled me to go through theſe Exerciſes, and to bear the Burden in the Heat of the Day of my Trials, inwardly and outwardly, which were many and various.</p>
               <p>Now the laſt Stratagem my Father uſed to hinder my going to Meetings was thus; he
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018158_0026_0FA56241E8A22538"/>took me in his Arms in great ſhew of Kindneſs, ſaying, <hi>if I would be as a Son to him, I ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d he would be a Father to me,</hi> expreſſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about his having no near Kindred, (and much more to the ſame Effect he ſaid to my Brother <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was an innocent, wiſe, and clean-ſpirited Lad) I replied to him, <hi>if in thus making me thy Son, thou intends to hinder me from going to Meetings, or to oblige me to go with thee to the</hi> Preſbyterian <hi>Meetings, or any Thing that is againſt my Conſcience, I cannot upon this Bottom be thy Son;</hi> and, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I refuſed to be his hired Servant, although he offered to hire me, and give me Wages. Now when he ſaw that neither Frowns, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Hardſhips, nor great Promiſes of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could prevail with me, he told me bluntly and roughly, <hi>I ſhould ſtay no longer in his Houſe:</hi> I innocently anſwered, <hi>I could not help it if it muſt be ſo, as all I could do would not give him Content, without hurting my Conſcience, and the Peace of my Mind, which I valued above all mutoble Things of this World.</hi> My poor Mother heard my pleading with him, and how I offered to do the beſt for him I was capable of by Night or Day, (as I always had done) if he would be eaſy, and let me have his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but this was the Sentence, <hi>No, I ſhould not ſtay in the Houſe:</hi> And indeed that troubled my poor Mother ſo, that I was ſorced to leave my Father, and go to endeavour to mitigate her great Trouble by telling her, <hi>that if I was but faithful, the Lord, I believed, would take Care
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018158_0027_0FA56243780CE850"/>of me that I ſhould not want;</hi> and the more fully to diſcharge myſelf, I reminded her, <hi>that as ſhe had entered into Marriage Covenants with her Husband, ſhe ſhould endeavour to perform them, and in every Thing faithfully to diſcharge herſelf as a Wife ought to do to a Husband, and leave me and all, and cleave to him, and to make her Life as eaſy as ſhe could:</hi> I alſo told her, <hi>never to ſend me any Thing that my Father knew not of, for I was not free to receive it;</hi> although what we had was in his Hand, and all ſunk there, as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>I write this partly, that all who do marry, may take ſpecial heed that it be done with great Caution, and under due Conſideration, and the Lord ſought to in it, that it may be done in his Counſel, and not only nominally, but truly <hi>in his Fear,</hi> and then no doubt but it will be well with both Huſband and Wife; and being equally yoked, ſuch will not only be meet and true Helpers in all Things belonging to this Life, but more eſpecially in Things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the World that is to come, and the Good of the immortal Soul, which to the faithful People of the Lord is of great Value. Oh, how happily and peaceably do ſuch live together in the Lord, as they keep to that which thus joined them! There is more in it, both as to the Parents and their Poſterity, than it is to be feared many conſider or think of, as is but too apparent in the many forward and unequal Marriages which I have made Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of.</p>

One remarkable Paſſage occurs to my Thoughts, which happened thus; my Father having been at the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meeting and come home, he, as his manner was, put me or my Brother upon reading the Prieſt's Text, which had been that Day in <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning his being caſt into the Den of Lions for his not regarding the King's Decree, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary prayed to the God of Heaven with his Windows open toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after his wonted manner. My Father made his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations as my Brother read, and very much magnified <hi>Daniel,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>the Spirit of God was in him, but that there were none ſuch as bun in theſe our Days.</hi> I owned that he was indeed an <hi>extraordinary Man,</hi> but that there were <hi>none endowed with a Meaſure of the ſame Spirit in any Degree,</hi> in that I diſſented from him, and gave my Father a brief Account of the many Sufferings of our Friends, ſome of which were paſt, and ſome then under Sufferings for the Word of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus, which they bore for him, and eſpecially the great Sufferings of our dear Friends in <hi>New-England,</hi> viz. hard Impriſonments, cruel Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, cutting off Ears, Baniſhment if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>New-England</hi> any more; and I ſhewed him likewiſe, how they put to D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if thou haſt ſaid or done wrong, haſt not thou found great Diſquietneſs and Trouble of Mind? This is the inward Principle, Light, or Grace, that God hath placed in Man to help and direct him, which we the People of God called</hi> Quakers, <hi>do hold agreeable to the Holy Scriptures.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But that I was not willing to break in upon this Story, but keep it entire, there was one Thing worthy of Notice, which I now come to, wiſhing it may be duly conſidered by all who read or hear it: When I mentioned <hi>Marmaduke Stephenſon,</hi> that good Man and great Sufferer in the Cauſe of Chriſt, as before, my Mother ſaid, <hi>it was true;</hi> for ſhe lived a Servant with <hi>Edward Wilberfoſs,</hi> an honeſt <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>Skipton,</hi> where <hi>Marmaduke Stephen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was a Day-labourer, about the Time he had his Call to go to <hi>New-England.</hi> See the Account of <hi>New-England</hi> judged, not by Man as Man, but by the Spirit of the living God, written by <hi>George Biſhop.</hi> If I remember right, ſhe ſaid, <hi>He was ſuch a Man as ſhe never knew, for his very Countenance was a Terror to them, and he had a great Check upon all the Family; if at any Time any of the Servants had been wild, or any way out of the Truth, if they did but ſee him, or hear him coming, they were ſtruck with Fear, and were all quiet and ſtill:</hi> And if but one of the Children came into the Houſe where he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he would not have it to come, theſe were his Words, <hi>Go thy way,</hi> or <hi>go Home, leſt I whip thee;</hi> and they were ſubject and quiet. This ample and excellent Account, I thought had ſome Reach upon my Father, however, it much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected my Mind. Oh! that we the Profeſſors of the ſame holy Truth, may ſo live in it, as
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018158_0031_0FA562466D5339C8"/>to reign over every wrong Thing in ourſelves, and alſo in others, but eſpecially in our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Some little Time before the Marriage of my Mother, I was brought into the public Work of the Miniſtry, concerning which I had many Reaſonings, being young, ſcarce eighteen Years old, and naturally of a ſtammering Tongue, which I could not overcome, although I had uſed what Endeavours lay in my Power as a Man, conſidering my Years and Education, all would not do until the Truth helped me: But after many Conflicts, great Troubles and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the worſt I ever met with, and the moſt piercing Sorrow I ever had yet been in ſince I came to the Knowledge of the bleſſed Truth was, when through Reaſonings, Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Unwillingneſs to comply with, and anſwer the Lord's Requirings, he in Diſpleaſure took away from me the Comfort of his holy Preſence for ſeveral Months together. Oh! the Tribulations and penetrating Troubles I met withal in this Condition, no Tongue is able to expreſs, no nor the Heart of any finite Creature is able to conceive the Depth of the Anxiety of the Heart-piercing and wounding Sorrows I was in; I thought my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018158_0032_0FA5624727238418"/>they are fallen away from this State? I could ſcarcely believe I ſhould ever have Repentance granted to me, or be reſtor'd again into the Love and Favour of God, when I found <hi>that River of Life dried up,</hi> as to me, <hi>which did before,</hi> not only <hi>make me,</hi> but <hi>even all the whole City of God, truly glad:</hi> But being left under an Apprehenſion of the Lord's Diſpleaſure, and in part a Partaker of the Terrors of his Wrath; Oh! I thought, ſurely the very Mountains, and even the Hills, were not ſufficient (if they could have been put into the Scales or Balance) to have weighed againſt my Troubles and Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were ſo great; but as the Lord had by his Judgments brought me in a good degree from the Vice and Vanity of this World, now by his Judgments he made me willing to give up to anſwer his Requirings in part, and in my Obedience to him I began to feel ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Love and Fellowſhip of the Spirit of the Lord in myſelf, and in his People, who were brought to be Partakers of the like Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>Now I return to the Matter about my b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When I ſaw I muſt turn out, I thought it expedient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ſome worthy Friends with it, leſt any undue Reflections ſhould be caſt upon the Truth,

Is it about his going to Meetings?</hi> When they underſtood his Reaſons, which were not hard to do, they expreſſed a Pity towards me that I could have no more Liberty; and they thought, as I was ſo diligent in his Buſineſs, if he would give me a little more Liberty to go to Meetings, it would be more Encouragement to me. At which he took Offence, and gave the good Men rough Language, and aſked, <hi>What they had to do with him and his Son?</hi> and bid them <hi>go Home and mind their own Buſineſs;</hi> which they were much troubled at, eſpecially for my Sake, and much pitied me, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how I had lived with him ſo long; for he ſaid in ſhort, <hi>that there was no Abiding for me there.</hi> But <hi>Sebaſtian Ellethorp</hi> told me, which was mightily to my Comfort, that my Father had nothing againſt me, <hi>ſave that concerning the

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018158_0038_0FA56250B1D4AEF0"/>of my Tongue, as he was to ſtop the Violence of that Humour which had attended my Body, and had a Recourſe to my Leg, and made it ſore from above the Ancle to the Knee: And notwithſtanding ſeveral Men had given their Advice, and had ſhewed their Skill, it all proved ineffectual, until I came to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and to preſs through all to him, and to touch the Skirt, or loweſt Appearance of his bleſſed Truth and Power, in which I found true healing Virtue to my Soul, and alſo to my Body, and to my Tongue, even to my Admiration; ſo that I did not only ſpeak plain in the Teſtimony the Lord gave me to bear, but alſo ſpoke plain in my common Intercourſe with Men.</p>
               <p>I was likewiſe in theſe Days under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Openings and Viſions, and thought myſelf as it were upon <hi>Mount-Piſgah,</hi> and ſaw into the holy Land, and into Things relating to God and his heavenly Kingdom, and into his Work and Way of bringing Man out of the Fall and Alienation to himſelf again, and into a heavenly State in Chriſt, as Man yields true O edience unto the Leadings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But although at times I had clear Sights into many heavenly Things, and alſo had at times comfortable Enjoyments of the living Preſence of God, yet I wanted to be more eſtabliſhed in the unchangeable Truth, which I had at times ſome comfortable feeling of; and in crying to the Lord, I found he inclined unto me, and, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>he heard my Cries, and pluckt my Feet out of the Mire and Clay, and ſet them upon a Rock,</hi> that was higher than I, and in part <hi>eſtabliſhed my Goings, and put a new Song into my Mouth, even high Praiſes unto the Lord for all his tender Mercies to me</hi> in theſe trying Times; and now being more crucified to the World, and the Spirit of it, I witneſſed a more conſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the heavenly Power and living Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Light and Grace; I came to be brought into Stilneſs, and it became moſt agreeable to my Condition to keep much in Silence, and wait upon the Lord for the Renewing of Strength, that thereby I might ſurmount all Temptations and Trials that might fall in my way, or which I might be tried with, which were not a few.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Things, before recited, are worthy of Commemoration, and proved great Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018158_0040_0FA56251AB982800"/>to me in the Truth, in theſe Davs of my Tribulations and great Trials: Read and believe thou that canſt, for they are faithful and true Sayings. After the Lord had healed me, he ſent me forth in the Work of the Miniſtry, and the firſt Journey I took Southward was into <hi>Lincolnſhire, Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and through <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Warwick</hi> to ſee <hi>William Dewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry.</hi> One Thing is remarkable upon <hi>William's</hi> Enquiry <hi>what Way I came?</hi> In my Account of the particular Towns and places I had paſſed through, I mentioned <hi>Coventry,</hi> which was the laſt and the worſt; for ſome of the rude People ſlung Stones at me, as I was ſpeaking in the Meeting, with great Violence, ſo that had the Lord ſuffered them to have hit me, they muſt have ſpoiled me: but my Faith in the Lord, and the Strength of the Truth, bore up my Mind above Fear of the outward Man, or what wicked Men could do to me. After <hi>William</hi> had heard my Account, he fixed his Eyes on me and ſaid, <hi>Thou muſt go back again to</hi> Coventry. I appeared unwilling, for two Reaſons; <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe I thought I had cleared myſelf of that People. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I thought it not ſafe to run myſelf into Danger of Suffering, unleſs I was ſatisfied the Lord required it of me. But <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> was poſitive, and ſaid <hi>I muſt go, for there was a Service for me to do there.</hi> Upon a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Conſideration of the Matter, and a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord to know his Will in it, I found my way clear to go, and I had ſome Service and good Satisfaction, and left Friends nearer
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018158_0041_0FA562526628E3F0"/>to one another than when I firſt met with them; for there had been a Miſunderſtanding amongſt ſome Friends in that City: So I came from thence to <hi>Tamworth,</hi> where there was a Difference, eſpecially betwixt two Friends; both of them had been ſuch as had made ſome conſiderable Figure among Friends: I felt it upon me to go to the Man, to warn him of the Spirit of Prejudice and Envy, for if he gave Way to it, it would eat out his Love to Friends and Truth, and he would decline Meetings, and come to nought, and turn his Back on the Truth; which came to be fulfilled, as I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heard; for he became a looſe Man, and liſted himſelf to be a Soldier. I was zealous for the Name of the Lord, and had a great Concern upon my Mind for the Promulgation of the Truth, and where I met with looſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Truth, it was a great Exerciſe to me.</p>
               <p>When I returned home from this, and indeed from all my Journeys, I took Care what I well could, ſo far as my weak Body was capable, to fall into Buſineſs, and not to loiter away my Time, neither abroad nor at home. My weak Conſtitution would not well bear the <hi>Weaving-trade,</hi> therefore I left it much againſt my Will; but I wrought upon Clock and Watch-work, and many other Things, which ſupplied my Neceſſities, the Lord allowing me as much Time at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018158_0042_0FA562533201C5E8"/>becauſe I am not willing to ſwell my Account too much. I travelled through moſt Parts of <hi>England</hi> four Times, and twice through moſt Parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> between the twentieth and twenty-eighth Year of my Age.</p>
               <p>After the Lord had opened my Heart, and I came in part to underſtand the holy Scriptures, and to have a Feeling of that holy Spirit in which the holy Penman wrote them, and a Sympathy with the Spirits and Exerciſes of the Righteous therein mentioned, I took great Delight in reading them, and having a good Memory, could thereby the better deal with Prieſts, and with Profeſſors. I had many Diſputes and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings with Prieſts and Profeſſors, of ſeveral Denominations, both in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and other Parts in my Travels, ſo that through theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and much Reading, my Mind was rather too much in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and not altogether ſo much in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in <hi>Power,</hi> as it ſhould have been; for which I met with a gentle Caution from the Lord, which was thus: I heard a Voice (from the Lord) as plain as if one had ſpoke to my outward Ear, <hi>The Fowls of the Air lodge in the Branches.</hi> This being repeated to me, I beſought the Lord to ſhew me what was the Meaning of that Voice which I heard; and the Lord, the mighty God, ſhewed me in his condeſcending Love, that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> even all of them which were written as the holy Men were moved of the holy Ghoſt, ſprung from the <hi>living Root;</hi> yet thoſe who reſted only in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and came not to be acquainted

This gentle Check was of great Service to me; not ſo as to make me decline reading the Scriptures, but that I ſhould not have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Dependency on them; and to caution me againſt the Neglect of waiting for the Help of the holy Spirit, the Root and pure Spring of the right and living Miniſtry which reaches the Heart, and carries the true Evidence with it to the Believers, that <hi>it is of God;</hi> which that of the Letter cannot do of itſelf. I tenderly deſire that all concerned in this great Work of the Miniſtry, may not be Miniſters of the Letter <hi>only,</hi> but of the Spirit alſo, and may ſpeak in the Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power.

               <p>My writing thus, from this gentle Check, concerning the <hi>Fowls</hi> and the <hi>Branches,</hi> &amp;c. is not with the leaſt Intention either to leſſen the holy Scriptures, or diſcourage any from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; for I would have all true Chriſtians encouraged to be more converſant in them; yet with this Advice, <hi>kind Reader,</hi> from thy Well-wiſher and true Friend, to breath to, and truly ſeek after the Lord for a Meaſure of his holy and bleſſed Spirit, the only Key and beſt Expoſitor to open and truly expound them to thee, as by the ſame holy Spirit thy Mind and Underſtanding comes to be fitted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; and indeed the whole Veſſel muſt be brought into a Preparation to hold the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſure, and not to mix the pure with the corrupt and impure: For without this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, preparing, opening, and ſanctifying Gift of God's holy Grace and Spirit, Man can neither know the heavenly Power of God, nor yet the holy Scriptures aright, as he ought to know them; and for this reaſon it hath ſeemed good to God to hide theſe Things from the Learned, Wiſe and Prudent of this World, that they ſhould not pry into, nor find out the Myſteries contained therein, unleſs they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Lord opened to me the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parable of the <hi>Muſtard-ſeed</hi> in this the Time of my Infancy as to the Miniſtry, with which he ſent me forth into the World, that my Faith might ſtand in the Lord alone, the Author and Finiſher, as well as Giver of the true and ſaving Faith, even <hi>that Faith which works by Love,</hi> and <hi>gives Victory over the World;</hi> it was by and through the Power, Virtue and Efficacy of true Faith, <hi>which is the Giſt of God,</hi> that the Elders in former Ages obtained, and now do obtain a good Report; it was in and through this Gift, that worthy <hi>Abel</hi> with his Offering was accepted of God, although he was envied of his earthly and evil Minded Brother <hi>Cain,</hi> and alſo by him ſlain. The ever memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Enoch,</hi> through the Virtue of this holy Gift, walked with God, as himſelf gave witneſs that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed him; he walked ſo in Faith and Obedience even to the End, that he died not as Men in common do, but was tranſlated, or changed in a peculiar manner. Come, read thou that canſt, and underſtand thou that art redeemed out of (and haſt overcome) the Fleſh, and the Powers of the firſt Nature, the World and the Devil, in a great meaſure, for thou knoweſt that it is by the Operation of this Gift that the Dead in old <hi>Adam</hi> are raiſed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018158_0046_0FA56256321C1448"/>to a new Life, and Way of living in the new Man; and through this heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> that is known to theſe to be a quickning Spirit, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to holy Writ. Through Faith the Violence of Fire was quenched, the Mouths of Lions have been ſtopped, the Sword turned backward, the Armies put to flight, even ſuch as were Aliens or Strangers who outwardly fought againſt the Lord's People; which ſets before us, as in a Glaſs, how and what we are to overcome in this Goſpel-day, in which we are not to fight with Men, but with our Luſts, and overcome Sin and Satan; which is as great a Victory as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that overcame the rampant Lions, who had Dominion over the Wicked, as Sin and Satan have Power and Dominion over the Wicked and Ungodly to this Day. Conſider now in Time thou that readeſt theſe Lines, whether Chriſt or Antichriſt doth moſt predominate in thee? Whether Grace or Sin moſt abound in thy mortal Body? Whether the Spirit of Truth, that leads into all Truth, or the Spirit of Error, that leads into all Error and Untruth, is the moſt prevalent, and hath the greateſt Place in thy Heart? For to him whom thou art the moſt ſubject, and yields thy Members Servants to, his Servant thou art, and to him thou giveſt way and ſubjects thyſelf, and his Servant thou wilt altogether come to be in time, and the Wages due to his Servants thou ſhalt have given to thee at the End of thy Work: Therefore conſider in due time, while the Day of thy Viſitation is continued unto thee, and the Lord

               <p>Now to return from this Digreſſion to the hiſtorical Part. When I had travelled much of the Time between my going forth, which was from about the nineteenth Year of my Age unto
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018158_0048_0FA56259DF09F7F8"/>about the twenty ſeventh, then finding ſome little Reſpite from the Weight of that Service, I inclined to ſettle a little cloſer to Buſineſs, but had little to begin any Calling with, being neceſſitated to leave my Trade of <hi>Weaving,</hi> through Lameneſs, as before mentioned; and I had been a Sojourner ſome time at <hi>Whitby, Scarborough,</hi> and <hi>Bridlington;</hi> but upon ſeeking unto the Lord to know what Place I might now ſettle in, though my great Inclination was for <hi>Whitby,</hi> yet it ſounded as in my Ear, <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, Bridlington is the Place to ſettle in;</hi> and in the Croſs I repaired thither, and ſettled for ſome time, keeping a little Shop, and mended Clocks and Watches, as I had done for ſeveral Years paſt at times; it was of good Service my ſettling there, for the Lord began to work mightily, eſpecially amongſt the young Friends, ſo that in a few Years many had their Mouths opened in Teſtimony for the Lord, and a fine Spring of heavenly Miniſtry was in that Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, the like I have not known in the like Bounds, (for it is but a ſmall Monthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting) and hath been ſo ever ſince I knew it. For Truth did ſo mightily proſper, and Friends grew ſo in the Miniſtry, that it became a Proverb, that BRIDLINGTON <hi>was become a School of Prophets.</hi> This mighty Work of the Lord in theſe Days, is worthy to be chronicled and remembered among his many worthy and noble Acts; we had many heavenly and good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, praiſed and renowned be the worthy Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:018158_0049_0FA5625B4E8D5780"/>
We had but little <hi>Diſcipline</hi> when I firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in that Place, but afterwards many Friends Hearts were ſtirred up in a holy Zeal for the Lord, not only to promote Meetings for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but alſo for good Diſcipline in the Church, and they began to ſee a Neceſſity of coming up more in the Practice of this very needful Work; although there were ſome that ſaid, <hi>they could ſee no Need of ſuch cloſe Order and Diſcipline:</hi> Yet I found it to be my Way in the Truth to bear with ſuch, if they were not irregular in their Converſations; but if they were diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we dealt with them as the Lord opened our Way in the Wiſdom of Truth; and thus bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of ſome on the one hand, and encouraging the faithful and zealous on the other, until way was made, beyond my Expectation, for the ſpreading of the Truth, its Teſtimony, and the Diſcipline thereof in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>I had now travelled and laboured much in the Lord's Work at home and abroad for about ten Years, but had not in all that Time found my way clear to <hi>marry,</hi> although not without ſome likely Opportunity, and with ſuch as were a great deal richer than ſhe was whom I did marry; but I was afraid in this weighty Affair to miſs my Way, knowing the great Difference there is between them who only profeſs, and they who poſſeſs the Truth, and them that are only in the firſt Nature and unregenerated State, (and ſtrictly ſpeaking, <hi>but the Sons and Daughters of Men</hi>) and ſuch who are born again, not of

Read this, you that are born again, and duly conſider it in its proper Time and Place. I believe, and therefore truly ſpeak it, the Lord gave me ſuch a Wife as really feared him, loved Truth and Righteouſneſs, and all ſuch as ſhe thought loved, and eſpecially ſuch as lived in the Truth; her Name was <hi>Priſcilla Cannaby,</hi> Daughter of <hi>James Cannaby;</hi> ſhe was deſcended of an honeſt Family in the Eaſt Part of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the only Child her Parents left,

               <p>I was in the twenty eighth Year of my Age when I married my Wife, who was a Woman of an excellent Temper, very affectionate, ſober and prudent, loved Retirement much, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, and the Enjoyment of his internal and living Preſence, and eſpecially with the Lord's People, that they might alſo be made Partakers with her of the like ſpecial Favours: this was as her Crown and Kingdom while in this World, even from her Childhood; and to ſee Friends proſper in the Truth was Matter of great Rejoicing to her. When we had been married ſcarce three Years, the Lord raiſed her up to bear a public Teſtimony amongſt Friends in their Meetings, which was very comfortable and acceptable to them; and alſo ſhe had the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, meaſurably poured upon her, ſo that many with me did believe ſhe had Acceſs to the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> and to that <hi>River which maketh truly glad the City of God:</hi> She always freely gave me up to anſwer the Service I believed the Lord called for of me. She was taken from me when we had been

               <p>As I was walking in a plain Field in the fore Part of the Day, not far from the Sea, betwixt <hi>Bridlington</hi> and <hi>Broynton,</hi> my Soul was in a deep Concern, and at that Time exerciſed in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Things of God, and alſo in fervent Prayers to him for Preſervation from every hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing; and a heavenly Frame my Mind was then brought into, for then I neither ſaw
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018158_0053_0FA5625F34856388"/>Cloud over my Mind, nor yet any in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, for it appeared to me <hi>a Morning without Clouds;</hi> tho' I had paſſed under many Clouds. Soon after my Mind was brought into this heavenly Frame, and as it were ſwallowed up in the heavenly and internal Preſence of the Lord, I thought a <hi>bright Cloud</hi> came down and covered me, or caught me up into in; ſo whether I was ſtanding, walking, or ſet upon the Ground, or carried up into the Cloud in the Body, or out of the Body, I know not to this Day; yet Fear and Reverence, with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Soul, did poſſeſs me before the great Majeſty; at the Glory of whoſe Countenance, as I had it in a preceding Viſion, Men and Angels fled and gave way, and could not ſtedfaſtly behold the Brightneſs and Glory of the Countenance of the Son of the Higheſt, with the mighty God and Father, which are one in Power, Greatneſs, Goodneſs, and Glory, who was <hi>before all Things,</hi> made <hi>all Things,</hi> and uphold and fill all Things that are good, with that which is truly good, or at leaſt is for a good End. Read this Myſtery thou that canſt, and learn to fear him <hi>that hath Power over both Soul and Body, to kill and to caſt into Hell,</hi> for one Time or another he will make thee fear him, when he brings thy Sins to Judgment, whether it be now or hereafter: The Time hath been, is, or will be, in which the Lord, the Judge of both Quick and Dead, hath, doth, or will plead with thee, and all Fleſh, <hi>as in the Valley of</hi> Jehoſaphat; therefore beware leſt thou
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018158_0054_0FA5625FF1DCFBF0"/>make him wroth, as he was upon Mount <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> but be thou ſubject to the Lord, as faithful <hi>Moſes</hi> was upon Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or the <hi>Mount of God,</hi> when he obeyed his Voice, and put off his Shoes; do thou obey, if it be to the putting away of the Glory and Wiſdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> or what elſe is required of thee: Oh then thou art in the way to further Service, and wilt be enabled, as thou continues faithful, to go through all to God's Glory, and thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Peace in the End.</p>
               <p>Now as to the laſt Part of the Rapture or Viſion, when I was ſwallowed up in the <hi>lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Preſence</hi> of him that is <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> I heard a Voice, very intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to that Senſation I had then given me, ſaying, <hi>Doſt thou ſee how Pride and Wickedneſs abound in the Nation?</hi> I anſwered in much Fear, <hi>Lord, I do ſee it:</hi> The next Words which I heard in the Voice and in the Cloud were, <hi>The People are too many, I will thin them, I will thin them, I will thin them.</hi> I deſired of the Lord to ſhew me, whether it was his Mind I ſhould publiſh this in any Part of the Nation? The <hi>South</hi> was ſet before me, with this Caution, <hi>Where this is opened to thee in my Power, there ſpeak of it, and not otherwiſe.</hi> I gave up to anſwer the heavenly Viſion, and viſited moſt Parts of the ſouthern Counties, as alſo the northern Parts, and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and where the Lord opened my Mouth to ſpeak of what I had heard, as before, by way of Prophecy, I gave up, but did not ſo much inſiſt upon that Matter,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018158_0055_0FA56260ABA994F0"/>as to ſuffer it to be a means to miſlead me from that Work of the Miniſtry I was chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. I would that all, who are concerned in the like manner, may be cautious in this great Affair, and look well to the Riſe and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from whence they receive this Gift, and how; and alſo what Frame of Mind they are in, and that nothing of the Warmth of their own Spirits be ſet to work or ſtirred up, either by Sight of the Eye, or hearing, or reading out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but that the Mind may be redeemed from all Workings, from theſe and the like Grounds, and purely purged, and truly adapted or fitted to receive this Gift or Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; and alſo be ſure to be very careful to be guidable in the Gift, or otherwiſe thou mayſt miſs, as to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> &amp;c. I intend not to dwell long upon it, as there are other Services included in this of Prophecy, as <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> &amp;c. but what I have been upon, relates to <hi>foretelling ſomething that is to come;</hi> and, as once a worthy Elder ſaid to me when I was young in the Miniſtry, <hi>It is a great Thing to know what, where and when;</hi> and I have ever found it true to this Day.

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018158_0056_0FA56262172961E0"/>Journey touched of before, I was concerned to tell Friends at <hi>Kilmouck</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> eſpecially, <hi>that the Lord would take many of them away;</hi> which in a ſhort time came to paſs, for many died before that time Twelve-month, it being a time of ſcarcity of Corn; and it was thought many died for want of Bread, the Year enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my being there: I had good Service for the Lord, and great Satisfaction in theſe my long Travels, as I had in the like before, in divers of which there were ſome convinced of Truth.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Cromer</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> one <hi>Elizabeth Horry,</hi> when my Mouth was opened, deſpiſed my Youth, as ſhe confeſſed afterwards; but what I had to ſay ſo reached her Condition, that ſhe ſhed many Tears upon her fine Silks, and confeſſed, before the Meeting broke up, that all might hear, in theſe Words, <hi>All that ever I have done hath been told me this Day, and this is the everlaſting Truth.</hi> And as I paſſed along from that Meeting, not far from <hi>Cromer,</hi> with ſome other Friends, it roſe in my Heart to ſay aloud, that a Man who was watering his Horſe might hear, looking, and pointing my Hand towards him, <hi>That Man will be a Friend before he dies;</hi> and, as he owned after, he was ſo ſtruck with it, that he had no Reſt till he came among Friends, though he was then afar off, but he came to be a ſerviceable Man among us, and his Wife was alſo convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Truth, and was a ſerviceable Woman. <hi>Samuel Hunt</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> was firſt reached at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> by the Teſtimony I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018158_0057_0FA56262286F16E8"/>had given me to bear in that Meeting at that Time, as he acknowledged afterwards; but I always gave God the Glory, and laid the Creature as in the Duſt, that Man, as Man, might not be too much accounted of.</p>
               <p>After my being caught up, and hearing the Voice (as before mentioned) I had many deep and heavenly Openings, ſome of which it may not be amiſs to mention here, inaſmuch as I had now a more clear Sight into a <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted State</hi> than ever I had before; I came, thro' a divine Senſe and Participation, to have great Sympathy and dear Unity, not only with the ever memorable <hi>Enoch,</hi> whoſe walking was ſuch as the Lord gave Teſtimony or Witneſs to, that <hi>he pleaſed him;</hi> the Ground of which Witneſs was from hence, <hi>he lived near and loved God, and walked in the Ways of Virtue, and abhorred Vice:</hi> But alſo with the Apoſtle, having this Seal, <hi>that God knoweth who are his;</hi> and with ſome other of the Servants of Chriſt in former Ages who could ſay, as ſome now can ſay, (from true Experience) <hi>that the Spirit of the Lord beareth Witneſs with our Spirits, that we are his,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Lord's Children, ſo long as we do well;</hi> which laſt Words are of large Extent, <hi>to do well, think well, ſpeak well, and believe well;</hi> for he that hath no Faith, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ill, cannot do well; he that eats, drinks, or wears that which he knows he ought not, doth not well; but what is done well, is done in a pure Mind and clean Conſcience, for ſo is true Faith held, and all acceptable Work to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018158_0058_0FA56262E7857E20"/>God performed. I had great Openings into the Removal of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and taking up of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that great and worthy Prophet, from the Earth into Heaven, and I have ſeen Things not fit to be uttered, neither can the World yet believe them; and I ſaw far into the Myſtery of the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Appearance of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> with him upon the Mount; and the Voice which was heard from the excellent Glory, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him;</hi> not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Elias</hi> in Compariſon of him, for the Law pointed to him, and was as a School-maſter to bring to him. The holy Prophets foreſaw, and propheſied of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaw Chriſt, and baptized him, and bore Witneſs of him as the Light, and ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sin of the World;</hi> he alſo ſaid, <hi>He is the Bridegroom that hath the Bride</hi> (the Church;) he ſpoke of his own Decreaſe, and Unworthineſs in compariſon of Chriſt, though called by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>as great a Prophet as was ever born of a Woman,</hi> and he was alſo called <hi>Elias,</hi> which much firſt come, and is already come in reſpect of Power, Knowledge, Boldneſs and Faithfulneſs; he was as <hi>Elias,</hi> yet <hi>the leaſt in the Kingdom of Chriſt was greater than he,</hi> becauſe the Power and glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goſpel-diſpenſation was not fully brought in (and reſtored to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or thoſe who ſhould believe in him) until his <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> but now theſe great Agents in theſe foregoing Diſpenſations all paſſed away, with their figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,

               </p>
               <p>Now read theſe Things, and learn truly to underſtand how <hi>Moſes</hi> paſt away, and <hi>Elias</hi> paſt away, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is left, who is able alone to perfect the Work of Man's Redemption, <hi>who trod the Wine-preſs alone,</hi> and amongſt all the Sons of Men, none were with him or helped him; he came who was the <hi>Antitype</hi> of all Types gone before: He, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is come to remove the <hi>Covenant</hi> made before, becauſe of the Weakneſs and Imperfection thereof, which Covenant <hi>made not the Comers thereto perfect,</hi> but <hi>the better Hope brought in by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>did;</hi> ſo this Covenant is abundantly more excellent which was brought in by Chriſt, and ſettled and eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes than that was or could be, <hi>by the Blood of Bulls, Goats, and the Aſhes of an Heiſer,</hi> which reached the outſide only; but in the ſecond or new Covenant there <hi>is the Blood which ſprinkleth the Heart from an evil Conſcience,</hi> ſo that ſuch may be fitted and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to ſerve the living God, <hi>not in the Works of the old Covenant, but in the Newneſs of the holy Spirit:</hi> This is he that, as to his Divinity and Eternity, was <hi>before the Hills were ſettled,</hi> and <hi>the Seos and Fountains were made,</hi> that <hi>took delight to dwell with the Sons of Men,</hi> or <hi>in the habitable Parts of the Earth;</hi> as he was a Spirit or Word uncreated, he dwelt meaſurably in <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> before the Flood;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018158_0060_0FA56264A21CDD48"/>for by his Spirit God ſtrove with the old World to reclaim them from their Wickedneſs, when it was great; it was by this Spirit <hi>Noah</hi> was made <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and inſtructed how to build the Ark; this is he who was with <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and all the faithful Fathers after the Flood, the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all the Righteous, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs, ſuch as loved and believed in him, and ſuffered for his Name's ſake, and the Teſtimony which they held. This is he that <hi>deſpiſed the Glory of this World,</hi> and is <hi>lifted up a Standard to the People, and an Enſign to the Nations; unto him ſhall the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſeek,</hi> and <hi>his Reſt ſhall be glorious;</hi> he hath lifted up a greater Rod than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſometimes called the <hi>Rod of Iron,</hi> by which he hath, and I believe will break to pieces many People as a <hi>Potter's Veſſel,</hi> when the Sin and Iniquity of the People is come to the height; it was he that <hi>turned the Waters of</hi> Egypt <hi>into Blood;</hi> it was he that <hi>ſlew the Firſt-born throughout all the Land of</hi> Egypt, he <hi>overthrew the</hi> Egyptians, and <hi>brought forth</hi> Iſrael <hi>by a ſtrong Hand, and an Arm outſtretched.</hi> After he had marked the Dwellings of his People, and ſpared them in the time of this great Slaughter, which was executed both upon Man and Beaſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then he became <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Paſſover.

               <p>Peradventure I may mention ſome Things that may appear to be of but little moment, but I have ſeen a divine Providence attend terrene Affairs, although they may appear of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to ſome; ſuch as do not duly conſider theſe Things, may make a wrong Application, and as the courſe of my Travels hath afforded variety of Trials and Tranſactions which are in ſome Things very particular, from whence ariſeth variety of Accounts, ſo there hath been a Willingneſs in my Mind to favour ſome who have been deſirous of having me to leave a Journal of my Life, which I have complied with, as far as I can ſee my way clear in the Truth.</p>
               <p>Then we went on board of another Ship called the ARUNDEL, <hi>Splenden Rand</hi> Maſter, in which we embarked the 17th of the Ninth
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018158_0067_0FA5626CB1410DF8"/>Month 1700, and after many Storms, and much Sea-ſickneſs, not without ſome Conflicts of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, more than I am free to expreſs, and a long Paſſage, being near ſixteen Weeks upon the Sea, we arrived in the River <hi>Patuxent</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> as near as I remember, the 5th or 6th of the Firſt Month 1701, and my Heart was glad, and filled with Acknowledgments and Praiſes to the Lord, for bringing us ſafe over the mighty Waters.</p>
               <p>Now we left the Ship and Maſter, who was but a churliſh, ill-natured Man. I was very weak and low when I landed, both in Body and Mind, but the Lord helped me, and made my Journey and Labours comfortable to many, as well as to my own Soul. After the firſt or ſecond Meeting we were at, <hi>John Eſtaugh</hi> being now my Companion, as we came near a great Houſe in <hi>Maryland,</hi> I eſpied a little white Horſe, the Sight of which put me in mind of a Dream I had on board the Ship before I landed, in which I thought <hi>I got a little white Horſe which carried me well, and many Miles;</hi> I ſaid to the Friends with me, <hi>let us call here at this Houſe,</hi> which we did, and upon Enquiry about a Horſe the Man ſaid, <hi>he had none but a little white young Galloway,</hi> as he called it, which he was <hi>willing to ſell,</hi> and withal told us, <hi>it carried him one Day forty Miles,</hi> and aſked 8<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> ſterling for it, and I bad him 5<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> ſterling; the Man's Wife coming up the Paſſage, heard what I had offered, and ſhe ſaid to her Huſband, <hi>it is enough;</hi> ſo I had him, and a good Horſe he proved, and carried
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018158_0068_0FA5626D71954C60"/>me, by a moderate Computation, 4000 Miles. I took this, according to the nature of it, to be a ſingular Favour from that great Hand which led me forth, and hitherto hath preſerved me in the Land of the Living, to praiſe his ever worthy Name.</p>
               <p>Now we ſet forward towards <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> and found great Openneſs in theſe two Provinces amongſt the People, and a tender-hearted Remnant of Friends ſcattered abroad in theſe wilderneſs Countries. Although, as I ſaid before, I was brought very low, yet the Lord, in whom I did, and yet do believe and put my Truſt, raiſed me, and filled many times my Heart with his Word and Teſtimony, ſo that ſometimes it went forth as a Flame of Fire amongſt the looſe Libertines, who were proud and unfaithful, yet profeſſors of the Truth, and we had many large and good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. One Thing is Worthy of Notice; as I was ſpeaking in a Meeting in <hi>Virginia,</hi> a ſudden ſtop came upon me, and occaſioned me to ſay, <hi>I cannot go forward, whatſoever the matter may be, I know not:</hi> But giving over immediately, a Friend, whoſe Name was <hi>Edward Thomas,</hi> began to preach, who was but young in the Miniſtry, although and elderly Man, and apt to be attended with Reaſonings; <hi>but</hi> as he ſaid after the Meeting, <hi>he had ſought to the Lord with Prayers, that he wound condeſcend ſo far to his Requeſt, as to give me a Senſe of him, and in ſo doing he would take that as a great Strength, and Confirmation to his Miniſity, in this the Day of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018158_0069_0FA5626E37096AA0"/>his many Exerciſes and great Fears,</hi> or much to the ſame effect; thus we ſee the Lord in his great Mercy condeſcends to the low, weak, and as it were, infant States of his Children, like a tender Father, and being our heavenly High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, is touched with the Feeling of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his People; Thankſgiving and Honour be given to his moſt excellent Name, now and for ever.</p>
               <p>During our Stay in <hi>Virginia,</hi> one remarkable Paſſage occurred, which it may not be amiſs to inſert here, and the caſe was thus; I being at a Friend's Houſe, an ancient Widow, in order to go to the Meeting, obſerved as I ſate in the Houſe, ſeveral Perſons of not come into the Yard (a Store-houſe being near) to make, as appeared afterwards, a Seizure for Rates for the Government and Prieſt, they not being diſtinctly charged, but a mixed Rate, occaſions Friends in thoſe Parts to be ſtraitned about the Payment of them: I obſerving the Prieſt to be there, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very buſy, aſked, <hi>What he was come about?</hi> The Friend replied, <hi>They were come to make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for the</hi> 40lb. <hi>per Poll,</hi> as they phraſe it, which is 40 Pounds of Tobacco, payable for every taxable Head, (<hi>i.e.</hi> all above ſixteen Years old.) There were along with the Prieſt the Sheriff and Conſtable for the Government, and divers Merchants of note as Spectators: I underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of their coming, ſtept out to the Prieſt, who ſeemed a topping briſk Man, his Temper in this caſe not unſuitable to his Name, which was <hi>Sharp;</hi> and being come to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018158_0070_0FA5626EF2018F38"/>him, I deſired him <hi>to be careful how he devoured Widows Houſes;</hi> he briſkly replied, <hi>he did not;</hi> to which I as cloſely returned, that <hi>I found he did.</hi> He denied my Aſſertion, and ſaid, <hi>The Government gave him what he demanded and took;</hi> to which I gave the following Anſwer; <hi>Inaſmuch as he did not any thing for the Widow, for which he reaſonably might require a Reward, I believed the Government would not infiſt upon it for him, if he would be willing to drop it, which in common Equity I thought he ſhould.</hi> The Prieſt, diſpleaſed with this modeſt Reply, tartly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>You are no Chriſtians.</hi> I told him, <hi>The Charge was high, and falſe, and he might more eaſily affirm than prove it;</hi> wherefore I put the Queſtion, and aſked him, <hi>Why we were ſo charged by him?</hi> To which he returned this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Anſwer, <hi>That we denied part of the Divinity of Chriſt.</hi> I told him, <hi>he was a Novice, and receded in his Opinion from moſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſeeing it was a general Reflection caſt on us by moſt of his Fraternity, That we owned the</hi> Divinity of Chriſt, <hi>but denied his</hi> Manhood, <hi>which was falſe alſo;</hi> therefore I demanded of him, <hi>to prove what Part of the</hi> Divinity of Chriſt <hi>we denied; in which if he failed, I ſhould look upon him as a falſe Accuſer, and thoſe preſent would, I hoped, be my Witneſſes:</hi> But he ſhuſtled, and declined anſwering, though I urged him as much as poſſible; and to cut the matter off, he aſked, <hi>Whence I came?</hi> The Sheriff bid him give me a Verſe in <hi>Greek;</hi> I told them, <hi>I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not meddling in that, for as the</hi> Engliſh
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018158_0071_0FA56270395575B0"/>
                  <hi>Tongue was beſt underſtood by thoſe preſent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it would be beſt to keep it.</hi> I told him, <hi>I was of</hi> Old England; but ſtill reminded him of his proving his Aſſertion, which I looked for from him; but inſtead of that, he aſked <hi>what part of</hi> Old England <hi>I came from?</hi> I told him <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and bid him produce his Proofs, as before urged, but he ſtill evading the matter, deſired to know <hi>from what Place?</hi> I told him <hi>I was born at</hi> North Cave; <hi>and,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I was born at</hi> South Cave, <hi>and my Father was Miniſter there many Years, his Name was</hi> Sharp, <hi>and there is but a Mile difference betwixt thoſe Places:</hi> I ſaid, <hi>it was a long one.</hi> No ſooner was this over, but the Prieſt, tranſported with my being his Countryman, began hugging me to ſuch a degree, that I was quite aſhamed of him: When I had, not without ſome Difficulty, got clear of his Embraces, I aſked him, <hi>if he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a Miniſter of Chriſt?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Yea, and lawfully called thereto;</hi> I told him, <hi>if he was a Goſpel-Miniſter, as the Goſpel was free, ſo ſhould his Miniſtry be free;</hi> and turning to the People there preſent, I told them, <hi>I would not have them deceived, for they might underſtand he only poſſeſſed his Place by virtue of a</hi> Law <hi>in that Caſe provided, and his</hi> Call <hi>and</hi> Ordination <hi>was only ſuch as had been transferred upon him for a Fee, which made him require Pay for what he did, and indeed where he did nothing, which was highly unfair; wherefore they might upon Conſideration find he was but a Miniſter</hi> of the Letter, <hi>which was</hi> dead, <hi>and not a Miniſter of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018158_0072_0FA562708672A668"/>the</hi> Spirit <hi>and</hi> divine Power: From which he offered not to clear himſelf, though I urged him thereto. Then I aſked him, <hi>which of thoſe</hi> odious Characteriſticks <hi>the falſe</hi> Miniſters <hi>were branded with, and deciphered by in the New Teſtament, he could clear himſelf of?</hi> which I then enumerated to him. The Sheriff ſaid, <hi>it was ſo;</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Sharp, <hi>anſwer the Man, for the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very rational, and you ought to anſwer him, and for Honour ſake clear yourſelf of thoſe Odiums if you can:</hi> But he would not offer to meddle with it; wherefore I told him, <hi>to mind for the future, not to charge any Man or People with more than he could be ſure to prove; for it was highly ſcandalous.</hi> It being now Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, I aſked him <hi>to go thither;</hi> but he refuſing, ſaid, <hi>he durſt not;</hi> ſo we parted.</p>
               <p>Having viſited Friends here, we returned back for <hi>Maryland,</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and a great many we found who loved to hear the Teſtimony and Doctrines of Truth, but too few there were, who took up the Croſs daily, and followed Chriſt in the way of Self-denial, and knew the thorough Work of Regeneration, ſo as <hi>to have their Garments waſhed and made white in the</hi> myſtical <hi>Blood of the Lamb:</hi> Theſe are not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the Sins and Iniquities of the World, who have experienced this Blood <hi>to ſprinkle the Heart from an evil Conſcience.</hi> Theſe are capable of ſerving the living God; and coming from the Laver or Pool that truly waſhes, there is none unfruitful, <hi>but every one bearing twain,</hi> and they are inwardly clean and fruitful to God, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018158_0073_0FA56271259A2110"/>walk with him, whoſe bright and ſhining Lives are alſo fruitful to the World that will receive them. Read this thou that haſt known ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Work of <hi>Converſion,</hi> and conſider the great Difference there is between the bright Lives of the <hi>Virtuous,</hi> and the dull and cloudy Lives of the <hi>Vicious,</hi> and beſure thou look well, which of theſe thou moſt reſembleſt in thine.</p>
               <p>Now when we came into <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> my Companion before mentioned, whom I loved well, told me <hi>he muſt go back to</hi> Virginia; it became an Exerciſe to us both, for I could not ſee my Way clear to go back, having been twice through that Province. When no other Way appeared, but we muſt part, (for my Way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared clear for the <hi>Jerſeys, Long-Iſland, Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi>) I held it needful that we ſhould, as we did, call the Friends and Elders of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and thereabouts together, to let them know how we parted, for we parted in much Love and Tender-heartedneſs; yet notwithſtanding, leſt any undue Reflections ſhould be caſt upon the Friends there concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, becauſe of our parting, I thought theſe Friends would be capable of ſetting thoſe Things in their proper Light, being Witneſſes thereto; ſo taking our Leave of our dear Friends in theſe Parts, I travelled without any Companion out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or conſtantly; but I ſometimes fell into company with <hi>Elizabeth Webb</hi> and <hi>Sarah Clement,</hi> who were virtuous Women, and lived near the Kingdom, and were of good Service in their Travels, and grew in Truth, which while
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018158_0074_0FA562765ACD9E38"/>with them I was ſenſible of: We travelled under great Care and Circumſpection, both for our own good, and avoiding Offence, as became our Places, and holy Profeſſion, that in all Things we might adorn the Goſpel of the Kingdom, a Diſpenſation of which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us to preach unto others. Good Service I had for the Lord, and great Satisfaction in my own Mind in theſe Parts, the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by his mighty Power through all my Trials, as my Heart and Mind was devoted and reſigned to anſwer his Requirings.</p>
               <p>I had great Openings in ſeveral Places in <hi>New-England,</hi> and it appeared clear to me, and ſometimes I ſpoke openly of it, that the Lord would gather a great People to the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth in his Time, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what many of our Friends had ſuffered for the Name of the Lord, and Teſtimony which they held in theſe Parts, from the Predeceſſors of the preſent Inhabitants: The View of the State of theſe Things, eſpecially the great Sufferings of many of our faithful Friends, put me in mind of that Saying, that <hi>The Blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs is the Seed of the Church;</hi> and in this caſe, I believe it will be fulfilled in its Seaſon.</p>
               <p>One Paſſage happened, which I think not fit to paſs over in ſilence: There came into one Meeting, eaſtward in <hi>New-England,</hi> a Man, who was Brother to a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Prieſt, to oppoſe Friends, (who, as Friends ſaid, had been often very troubleſome in that Meeting) in the Beginning of the Meeting he deſired to have
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018158_0075_0FA562766DDE4B58"/>Liberty <hi>to aſk ſome Queſtions.</hi> I being a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not having ſo much as heard of the Man, nor any making Reply to him, I felt Liberty in the Truth to return the following Anſwer in behalf of the Meeting, <hi>That I did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it was the Deſire of Friends, inaſmuch as the Meeting was appointed for the Worſhip of God, and not for aſking of Queſtions, or Controverſies, that the chief Part ſhould firſt be anſwered; and I alſo thought the Meeting would be willing, in the Concluſion, to give him Liberty to aſk the Queſtions, if his Intent therein was for</hi> Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>or</hi> Satisfaction, <hi>and not for</hi> Contention. Friends were ſilent, and the Man ſubmitted to what was propoſed, and a good Meeting we had, the Lord's heavenly Power and living Preſence being with us, and the Subſtance was felt among us, and exalted over all the Shadows and Types; and Chriſt the true Bread and living Water, Light and Life of the World, was exalted that Day; and the mighty God and Father, with his beloved Son, through the Help of the holy Spirit, was glorified, who is worthy for ever. Near the Concluſion of the Meeting, the Man began to ſpeak well of what he had heard, particularly touching that of <hi>Water-Baptum,</hi> which, he ſaid, <hi>he had nothing to object againſt;</hi> but as to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as he called it, <hi>becauſe little or nothing had been ſaid about it, therefore he concluded, we either denied or diſuſed it;</hi> or Words to the ſame purport. Then I ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>I did not remember that the Word</hi> Sacrament <hi>was in all the Bible; but,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018158_0076_0FA56278203E8FF8"/>ſuppoſed he meant the</hi> Bread and Wine; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>he did;</hi> I aſked him, <hi>whether he was of the ſame Mind the</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>Church was of? If not of the ſame Mind he might ſay ſo; for they ſay,</hi> the Bread and Wine is an outward and viſible Sign of an inward and ſpiritual Grace, <hi>&amp;c. what ſaid he to it?</hi> He was ſome Time ſilent; then I aſked him, <hi>How long he thought that Sign was to continue?</hi> He replied, <hi>To the End of the World.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>He did not read in all the Bible, that the Lord had appointed any Figure or Sign but what was to end in the Subſtance, which is to be witneſſed and enjoyed in this World, and not put off only to the End or Concluſion thereof, as his Argument ſeemed to declare,</hi> by his urging, <hi>that the Sign of that divine Subſtance muſt remain till the End of this World.</hi> I aſked him, <hi>What he could anſwer to that?</hi> He turned off with only ſaying, <hi>I was too great a Scholar for him, and ſo he would not meddle with me.</hi> He then was ſilent, and there being many People, I had a fine Opportunity to open to the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and Friends preſent, how <hi>that</hi> was at beſt but a Sign, which the People eat and drank outwardly, in Remembrance of Chriſt's Death until he came, but that I could now prove plenteouſly from the New Teſtament, that the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> was come, and urged many Proofs out of the Scriptures to the ſame purpoſe: And when I had done, what I had ſaid, ſo reached a good-like old Man, a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> that he confeſſed with Tears, <hi>he had heard much ſaid upon that
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018158_0077_0FA56278AE8FD490"/>Subject, but had never heard it ſo opened before;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he believed I was in the right.</hi> The Meeting broke up in a good Frame, and Friends much rejoiced that Truth came over all, and the contentious Man was ſilenced: And when the Meeting was over, the goodly old Man took me to the Door, and aſked me, <hi>what a Man ſhould do in caſe of a</hi> ſolemn League <hi>and</hi> Covenant, <hi>he being entered into it?</hi> I told him, <hi>I needed not to direct him, for he had that in himſelf which would ſhew him what he ſhould do; for if one ſhould make an Agreement or Covenant with Hell and Death, in the time of Ignorance and Darkneſs, and now the</hi> true Light <hi>diſcovered it to be ſo; the ſame Light which diſcovered and manifeſted it to be</hi> wrong, <hi>as he was faithful to the ſame, would ſhew him how and when to</hi> break it, <hi>and every other wrong thing; to which Light I recommended him,</hi> and bid him <hi>take heed to it;</hi> which, he ſaid, <hi>he hoped he ſhould;</hi> and ſo I left him with Tears on his Cheeks, and paſſed on.</p>
               <p>I omitted one thing which happened in that Part of <hi>New-England</hi> near <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland,</hi> although I was twice backward and forward, yet to be brief in my Travels through thoſe Countries, intended to make one Account ſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> As I was ſpeaking in a Meeting, there came a great Damp over my Spirit, and in that Time came into the Meeting ſeveral Men, occaſioned by a topping and great Man in the World, who had given them an Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that they ſhould hear how he would
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:018158_0078_0FA562796DAB15F8"/>oppoſe the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but in a ſhort time Truth roſe, and Friends generally heard a Man ſay to this Diſputant, <hi>why do you not ſpeak?</hi> he huſhed him with ſaying, <hi>the Man is upon the Subject which I intend to oppoſe them with.</hi> After ſome time the Man was put upon again to ſpeak to me, with a <hi>why do not you ſpeak?</hi> we heard him ſay, <hi>the Man has opened the Thing ſo as I never heard it before, and I have nothing to ſay:</hi> And to his own, and the Wonder of his Neighbours, he ſat down upon a Seat near the Door and wept tenderly; ſo it was a good time to him, and many more, for the Lord's mighty Power was amongſt us. And in my Return from my Journey in the Eaſt Parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> the ſame great Man deſired me to condeſcend <hi>to have a Meeting at his Houſe;</hi> and after due Conſideration and Approbation of Friends, who deſired it might be ſo, when they knew it was his Requeſt, a Meeting was appointed, and I heard there were likely to be at it a great many of the higher ſort of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of his Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>I went to the Meeting under no ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Mind, but when I was come into the great Houſe, I was very much affected with the wiſe Conduct of the Man, to ſee in what excellent order he had placed every thing, ſo that I could not find wherein any thing could be amended; and a heavenly Meeting it was, without any Oppoſition; and at the breaking up of the Meeting, this tender Man, whoſe Heart was broken and opened by the Power of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018158_0079_0FA5627A2868C1D0"/>Truth, ſaid audibly, <hi>His Heart and Houſe were open to receive me, and ſuch as me, let all ſay what they would to the contrary.</hi> But what the ſubject matter was at the firſt Meeting when he came in, I forgot; it was enough that we remembered we had a good and heavenly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were truly thankful for the ſame to him who was the Author thereof.</p>
               <p>I and ſome other Friends being in our Paſſage by Water in a Veſſel bound for <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and meeting with high and contrary Winds, we put into a Creek ſome Miles diſtant from <hi>Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland,</hi> and deſired the People to procure us ſome Horſes to ride on, and we would pay them any thing that was reaſonable, but hoped they would not make a Prey of us, for we were Strangers, and they ought to do to us as they would be done by, if they were in a ſtrange Land, as we were; and there came up to us a goodly old Man, and aſked us, <hi>what People we were? if we were not</hi> Quakers? I told him, <hi>we were in Scorn ſo called, but we did not much mind Names, for there was but little in them.</hi> He was a briſk talking Man, and ſaid, <hi>there was a Man here lately that ſaid he was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and borrowed a Horſe, and when he was gone ſome Miles from this Place, he offered to ſell t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Horſe: I know not,</hi> ſaid the Man, <hi>but you are ſuch.</hi> I returned this Anſwer to the Reflection; <hi>That was a great Proof that we were an honeſt and reputable People where we were known, he might aſſure himſelf of that; for when a Man is ſo wicked, as to become a notorious Cheat, he will
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018158_0080_0FA5627AF2ACBF70"/>cover himſelf under the beſt Name he can think of, otherwiſe he might have ſaid he was a</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>or a</hi> Preſbyterian, <hi>or an</hi> Epiſcopalian, <hi>and deſired you to lend him an Horſe; but you mind not theſe Names, neither doth the wicked Man think he can paſs ſo well under any of theſe</hi> laſt, but under the <hi>firſt; and the reaſon of it I leave thee to</hi> judge. The old Man aſked no more Queſtions, but uſed his Endeavours to get us Horſes, and a Man and Horſe to go with us, to have the Horſes back again, and we were well mounted; but before we ſet forward, the old Man took me to his Houſe and was very courteous to me, for though we had ſpoke for ſome Victuals in as ſhort a time as well might be, he invited me to drink, and brought of his Apples and Beer, which he would have my Friends to partake of, <hi>for,</hi> he ſaid, (and we found it true) <hi>it was but a poor Inn;</hi> I think there was no Liquor at it but Brandy or Rum, and Water. The old Man and I parted very lovingly, and I gave him a piece of Money to ſhew my Gratitude for his Civility and good Service to us. The People looked upon us as ſome great Wonder, for I heard one ſay, <hi>Are theſe</hi> Quakers? <hi>well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they look like other People.</hi> How we had been repreſented, and by whom, its not hard to gather, for it is very apparent, the ſame Spirit and the ſame Enmity yet doth continue in ſome of the Inhabitants of that Country, which ſome of our Friends formerly felt the ſevere Effects of; but they are ſince ſomewhat moderated by the Government there, which is
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018158_0081_0FA5627BB3EEC108"/>of a more mild and Chriſtian Diſpoſition; although I am well aſſured, that many of the more conſcientious and thinking People in thoſe Parts of the World begin to ſee, and many will ſee and underſtand in time, that <hi>hanging</hi> and <hi>taking away Lives,</hi> for the ſake of Religion, is oppoſite to Chriſt, and the Nature of the true Religion which is wrought in Man by the Operation, Quickenings, and <hi>Indwellings of the holy Spirit,</hi> which, as it is regarded and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leavens and brings the Soul of Man in ſome degree to put on the Purity, heavenly Image, and Nature of Chriſt, which is <hi>Love, praying for Enemies,</hi> and is not for <hi>deſtroying,</hi> but <hi>ſaving</hi> Lives; but how far the Reverſe will agree with that Religion taught by Chriſt, and practiſed by him and the Apoſtles, I would have all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider of in time.</p>
               <p>While we were in <hi>Boſton,</hi> when one of the aforementioned worthy Women was declaring excellently, with both good Utterance and Voice, as alſo good Matter, as the manner of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Boſton</hi> had been for many Years to encourage, or at leaſt ſuffer a rude Mob to bawl and make a Noiſe, ſo they did now, that it was hard to hear ſo as to underſtand diſtinctly what the Friend ſaid, although ſhe ſpoke plain and intelligibly: It did very much grieve me to to ſee the Ignorance and Darkneſs of thoſe high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, ſo that when the Friend had done, obſerving there appeared Men of ſome note in the World, I requeſted them to huſh the Rabble, for I had ſomething to ſay,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018158_0082_0FA5627C7904AE00"/>which I deſired them to make known to the Governor and chief Men of the Town; ſo they ſoon quelled the Noiſe. Then I told them, <hi>That in caſe we were as erroneous as ſome might inſinuate we were, that was not the Way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our Errors, neither to bring us out of them, but rather to eſtabliſh us in them; and that was not the Way for them to gain Proſelytes, but the Way to loſe many from them, and increaſe Diſſenters; for what Convincement could there be by Noiſe and Clamour, and Hooting, as if they would ſplit their own Lungs? I had come a great Way to ſee them, and what Character could I give of them? I never thought to have ſeen ſo much Folly amongſt a wiſe and religious People as now I ſaw: Tell the Governor and chief of the Town, what the old</hi> Engliſhman <hi>ſaith; for I am aſhamed of ſuch Doings.</hi> It had a good Effect, for when I came after, we had quiet Meetings; and I underſtood by a Letter from <hi>Daniel Zachary,</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> to <hi>Old England,</hi> that the Governor ſaid, <hi>I was in the right,</hi> and ordered that Peace ſhould be kept in Friends Meetings there; and I never heard to the contrary but it is well yet as to that. We have great reaſon to be truly thankful to the Lord for thoſe, and all other his Mercies, that he the Fountain of all Good is pleaſed to favour us with: And as an Inſtance of the Lord's Mercy to many poor Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, and to ſhew the implacable Envy of theſe People to Friends, the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Maulham</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> may ſuffice, in ſome meaſure, to ſet forth both, who was a great Sufferer in the Time of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018158_0083_0FA5627D2D5D7AC8"/>hot Perſecution, when the Perſecutors had ſtript him of almoſt all he had; their inſatiable Minds not content with that, they came with Axes and hewed down all the Apple Trees in his Orchard, it being a large one, and left the Stumps about the height of a Man's Knee, and, as <hi>Thomas Maulham</hi> ſaid, they took the Way as they thought to ruin him; but the Lord turned it into a Bleſſing, for the Trees grew to Admiration, and came to bear Fruit abundantly, and a finer Orchard I have not ſeen in all my Travels, for the Bigneſs of it; let the Lord be ſanctified by all his People, and admired by all them that believe.</p>
               <p>I with ſeveral other Friends went from <hi>Salem</hi> Yearly-meeting (which was a large and good Meeting) towards <hi>Dover,</hi> and coming to a River, I ſtaying a little behind, a Friend took my Horſe with two more into the Boat, and by that time I came to the River-ſide the Boat was ſinking, and the Ferryman made a lamentable Cry, ſaying, <hi>The Boat is ſunk and we ſhall be all drowned;</hi> altho' it was ſo ordered, that there was but one Friend in the Boat with the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I do not remember that ever before now my Horſe was in any Boat, and I not there; which I looked on as the Mercy of a kind Providence to me, and to ſeveral other Friends in Company. I hearing the Noiſe, as before, (and alſo the flowndering of the Horſes when tumbling into the Water) called to the Men, to be ſure to take care to free themſelves of all the Tackling of the Horſes, (as Bridles,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018158_0084_0FA5627E1FA58448"/>Stirrups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and catch hold on my Horſe's Tail, and he would bring them both aſhore; but if they truſted to the other (as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) when the Horſes ſwam they would fail them, unleſs very ſtrong; and to have them hold by the Bridle was the way to drown both Horſe and Man: This Advice was given while they had the Horſes in their Hands; the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being a lively Youth, took my Advice, caught hold of my Horſe's Tail, it being long, (which I ever approved of among Rivers) and I calling to my Horſe, he came quickly with the Man aſhore, but left the honeſt old Friend <hi>Ezekiel Waring</hi> (to whoſe Houſe we intended to go that Night) in the River floating to the Neck, a hundred Yards from the Shore by Computation, yet watchful Providence did ſo attend, that his Life was preſerved to a Wonder; for it was ſo ordered, altho' he miſſed taking my Advice, and caught hold of his Stirrup, and the Girth broke, as they are apt to do if they be tight when the Horſe begins to ſwim, which brought off the Saddle and Pillion, and the Oar of the Boat, and his Hat, which with the Pillion-ſeat being in his Arms, juſt bore up his Head above Water for ſome time; his poor Wife ſeeing the Danger to which her Huſband was expoſed, fell into a fainting Fit; (there being neither Houſe, Man, or Boat, to be ſeen on this Side of the River, but ourſelves, the Boatman, and the Stem and Stern of the ſunk Boat full of Water.) A Houſe there was on the other Side of the River, which was half a
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018158_0085_0FA5628113ABC058"/>Mile over. The Ferryman did his beſt to get a Boat or Cannoe, and altho' it began to be dark, yet he found a Cannoe, (which is made of a fine piece of Timber hollowed in the form of a Boat, and generally will carry but two or three or four Men;) he coming near, aſked <hi>if</hi> Ezekiel <hi>was alive?</hi> I told him he was, but very weak, for I had often heard him blubber in the Water; I encouraged him, that he might not faint in his Mind, for I told him, <hi>I yet believed his Life would be preſerved;</hi> he would very faintly ſay, <hi>Unleſs Help came, he could not hold it long.</hi> I went on by the Waterſide, and laid me down often on the Land, not much regarding Wet or Dirt, ſometimes tumbling over Logs of Wood and Limbs of Trees, for ſo it is in theſe uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated Places: I directed the Man with his Cannoe where the poor Friend was, as near as I could tell by my laſt Obſervation, and withal deſired he would turn the Stern of his Cannoe to him, as he could not lift him into the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe; neither to let him lay his Hand upon the broad Side of it, but upon the Stern, leſt he ſhould overſet it, and you be both drowned: So he did, and brought him gently aſhore, to the great Joy of his loving Wife and us all. The Boatman, as he owned, had found my Counſel good, and therefore would have me tell him what he might do now; I bid him fetch the Boat to ſhore by the Fowler or Rope, and then go and carry <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the Cannoe to the Inn on the other Side of the Water, that he might dry, warm, and refreſh himſelf until
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018158_0086_0FA5628279A9BBE8"/>we came; in the mean time we cleared the Boat of Water, which when done, we put two Horſes into it, and I towed my Horſe at the Boat's Stern to make room for ſeveral, eſpecially the good Women before mentioned, who were at this time in my Company, not without their Exerciſe any more than myſelf: We got well over, and then the Ferryman and Friend on the other Side brought the Horſes that were left, being three, which were enough for the Boat, and proved too many the firſt Time. We found the good old Friend ſinely and well recruited, and got to his Houſe about Midnight, where we were glad, and our Hearts were full of Praiſes to the Lord for this great and eminent Deliverance and Preſervation.</p>
               <p>In this firſt Viſit while in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> I met with ſomething worthy of thy Notice, if thou art ſuch a Reader as I wiſh thou mayſt, which was thus: Being in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> ſeveral Friends came to me in ſome of the Intervals of the Yearly-meeting, (for it held ſeveral Days, both for Worſhip and Diſcipline) to enquire whether it was uſual to let the Young, and ſuch as had but appeared little in Teſtimony in our Parts of the World, come into Meetings of public Friends? I ſaid, <hi>Yes, if they were of clean Lives, and what they had to ſay, approved; and it was very like ſuch might want Advice as much as thoſe who were come to more Experience in the Work of the Miniſtry, if not more:</hi> This was ſome means of enlarging the ſaid Meetings of Miniſters now coming on. When I came into the Meeting,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018158_0087_0FA562848DD9D660"/>ſeveral of the Elders deſired me to go into the Gallery, which I refuſed, the Concern upon my Mind being ſo great, I thought it was enough that I could but get into the Houſe, and ſit down among the loweſt Rank.</p>
               <p>This Meeting was one not to be forgotten, becauſe of the eminent Viſitation from the Lord that was upon us in it; I have not often ſeen the like; I queſtion if there were any dry Cheeks for ſome time in it; and the manner of the working of the heavenly Power was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in order to the ſanctifying and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Veſſels for the Lord's Uſe; and he broke us down by his Judgments from following flattering Fleſh, and the pleaſing Vanities of the World, and the ſubtil Baits of Satan, by the Tenders of his Love, and engaged us to follow his heavenly and inward Calls, Knocks, and Reproofs of his holy Spirit, and to obey the Dictates of the ſame. When the Lord prepares in a good degree for this Work of the Miniſtry, many have been unwilling to give up and obey, until they have taſted of the Lord's Diſpleaſure, and in part of his Judgments, which have brought them into a Submiſſion; after which they went out with their Lives ſometimes in their Hands, and became a Wonder to men, bearing their Reproach, and ſometimes appeared in great Congregations, ſometimes in Noiſes and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and ſometimes were in Watchings and Faſtings, in Wearineſs, Hunger and in Cold, with much more, for the Name of the Lord and his Teſtimony, and for the Enjoyment
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:018158_0088_0FA56286000687E0"/>of Peace, and the internal Preſence of him that hath ſeparated us to this Work by the holy Ghoſt; and it is in and by our abiding faithful to the ſame, that we are preſerved in a Capacity of Perſeverance through all to the End, to the mutual Help and Comfort one of another, and Renown of the Name of the Lord, who is worthy now and for ever.</p>
               <p>We alſo had a very large Meeting on this Iſland in an Orchard, where I had good Service for the Lord; and I remember I was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about the two Miniſtrations, <hi>viz. John's</hi> Baptiſm with <hi>Water,</hi> and CHRIST's with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> it being clear from <hi>John's</hi> Words, that he ſaw to the End of his own Diſpenſation when he declared, <hi>he muſt decreaſe, but</hi> CHRIST <hi>muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:</hi> which is generally underſtood to reſpect their differing Diſpenſations; for the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was to baptize <hi>unto Repentance,</hi> the other to <hi>the purging of the Floor,</hi> and <hi>burning up of that which was combuſtible,</hi> viz. the Chaff and Stubble, which the Lord's Baptiſm burneth up inwardly, and which no elementary thing can do; for if all the Eatings, Waſhings, Obſervations, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law, although to <hi>Iſrael</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and enjoined by the Lord, could not make the Comers thereunto <hi>perfect,</hi> how ſhould theſe or any of them now, when not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they never were to us, <hi>perfect</hi> they <hi>Gentile</hi> World? So what I had upon my Mind, as I received I went through with, and ſhewed the Beginning, Uſe and End of the watery Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Uſe and Continuance of CHRIST's.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018158_0089_0FA5628639F35F78"/>ſpiritual Baptiſm to the End of the World. The Meeting broke up, and Friends went into an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Room in an Inn; but I felt ſuch an Exerciſe upon my Spirit that I could not eat, but deſired Friends to be eaſy, and I would eat as ſoon as I could; and while I was walking over the large Chamber alone, there came up three Men whom I knew not, or what they were, but it ſprang livingly in my Heart to ſet my Eyes on them in the Lord's Dread, and ſo I did; they paſſed away, and I was told afterwards, that they were three <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preachers who had been at the Meeting, and came once more to ſee me, with a Deſign to have a Diſpute with me; <hi>but,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>I looked ſo ſharply they durſt not meddle with me:</hi> Thus the Lord in a good degree wrought for me, bleſſed be his worthy Name for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I leave the Account of my Travels in thoſe Parts, and enter upon my ſecond, with my honeſt Companion <hi>James Bates,</hi> who was born in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and travelled much with me through many Provinces, and ſome Iſlands; we had good Service together, and it was much with me, when on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> to viſit <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket,</hi> where there were but very ſew Friends; <hi>Peleg Slecum,</hi> an honeſt public Friend nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> intending to carry us in his Sloop to the ſaid Iſland that Night; and <hi>Peleg</hi> thought we had been cloſe in with our deſired landing Place, but we fell ſhort, and Night coming on, and having but one ſmall Cannoe to help us aſhore, which would carry but three
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018158_0090_0FA56286E852E040"/>People at once, we went aſhore at twice, and left the Sloop at an Anchor; and it being grown dark, we thought we were going up into the Iſland among the Inhabitants, but ſoon found that we were upon a Beach of Sand and Rubbiſh, where was neither Graſs nor Tree, neither could we find the Sloop that Night, though we ſought it carefully, and hollowed one to another till we were weary, ſo that we were forced to ſettle upon our little Iſland, from the Centre of which, one might caſt a Stone into the Sea on every Side; here we ſtaid that Night, not knowing but the Sea, when at the Height, would have ſwept us all away, but it did not; there I walked, and ſometimes ſat, until Morning, but ſlept none; at laſt the Morning came, and the Miſt went away, and we got on Board again, and reached the Iſland about the ninth or tenth Hour.</p>
               <p>The Maſter was willing, at our Requeſt, to land three of us, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> me, my Companion and <hi>Suſanna Freborn,</hi> a public Friend, who had a Concern upon her Mind for ſome Time, (as ſhe ſignified to Friends in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> where ſhe lived) to viſit the few Friends in <hi>Nantucket,</hi> and Friends thought this a proper Seaſon to pay that Viſit. She was a Woman well beloved, and in good Unity with Friends.</p>
               <p>We landed ſafe, and as we went up an Aſcent, we ſaw a great many People looking towards the Sea, for great Fear had poſſeſſed them, that our Sloop was a <hi>French</hi> Sloop loaded with Men and Arms, who were coming to invade the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018158_0091_0FA56287A798CF70"/>Iſland: I held out my Arms and told them, <hi>I knew not of any worſe Arms than theſe on board.</hi> They ſaid, they were glad it was no worſe, for they had intended to have alarmed the Iſland, it being a time of War: I told the good like People, for ſo they appeared to me, that <hi>Peleg Slocum,</hi> near <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> was Maſter of the Sloop, and that we came to viſit them in the Love of God, if they would be willing to let us have ſome Meetings amongſt them. They behaved themſelves very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly towards us, and ſaid, <hi>they thought we might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We then enquired for <hi>Nathaniel Starbuck,</hi> who we underſtood was in ſome degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, and having Directions to his Houſe, we went thither, and I told him, <hi>We made bold to come to his Houſe, and if he was free to receive us, we would ſtay a little with him, but if not, we would go elſewhere; for we heard he was a ſeeking religious Man, and ſuch chiefly we were come to viſit:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>we were very welcome.</hi> And by this time came in his Mother <hi>Mary Starbuck,</hi> who the Iſlanders eſteemed as a Judge among them, for little of Moment was done there without her, as I underſtood.</p>
               <p>At the firſt Sight of her it ſprang in my Heart, <hi>To this Woman is the everlaſting Love of God.</hi> I looked upon her as a Woman that bore ſome Sway in the Iſland, and ſo I ſaid, and that truly, <hi>we are come in the Love of God to viſit you, if you are willing to let us
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018158_0092_0FA562886A10EFA8"/>have ſome Meetings among you:</hi> She ſaid, <hi>ſhe thought we might;</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>there was a</hi> Non-conformiſt <hi>Miniſter who was to have a Meeting, and they were going to it, and ſhe thought it would be the beſt way for us to go with them to the Meeting.</hi> I ſhewed my Diſlike to that for theſe Reaſons; <hi>firſt,</hi> we did not want to hear what that Miniſter had to ſay, becauſe ſome of us had tried them before we came there, (meaning the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> of ſeveral ſorts) and if we ſhould go, and could not be clear without ſpeaking ſomething in the Meeting, he might take it ill; but as we underſtand there is another Meeting appointed at the ſecond Hour for the ſame Man, therefore, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſtitution of Things are, we look upon ourſelves to ſtand upon an equal Ground in a religious Capacity with other <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and if we ſhould appoint our Meeting at the ſame Hour, then the People will be left to their Choice to which Meeting they will go. The great Woman approved of the Propoſal, and ſaid, <hi>indeed that was the beſt Way.</hi> The next Conſideration was, <hi>where ſhall the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be?</hi> She pauſed a while, and then ſaid, <hi>I think at our Houſe.</hi> I from thence gathered ſhe had an Huſband, for I thought the Word <hi>our</hi> carried in it ſome Power beſides her own, and I preſently found he was with us; I then made my Obſervation on him, and he appeared not a Man of mean Parts, but ſhe ſo far exceeded him in ſoundneſs of Judgment, clearneſs of Underſtanding, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018158_0093_0FA562892A0E0590"/>an elegant way of expreſſing herſelf, and that not in an affected Strain, but very natural to her, that it tended to leſſen the Qualifications of her Huſband.</p>
               <p>The Meeting being agreed on, and Care taken as to the Appointment of it, we parted, and I lay down to try if I could get any Sleep, for I have ſhewed before what ſort of a Night the laſt was with us; but Sleep vaniſhed away from me, and I got up and walked to and fro in the Woods until the Meeting was moſtly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. I was under a very great Load in my Spirit, but the Occaſion of it was hid from me, but I ſaw it my place to go to Meeting, the Order of which was ſuch, in all the Parts thereof, I had not ſeen the like before; the large and bright rubbed Room was ſet with ſuitable Seats or Chairs, the Glaſs Windows taken out of the Frames, and many Chairs placed without very conveniently, ſo that I did not ſee any thing awanting, according to the Place, but ſomething to ſtand on, for I was not free to ſet my Feet upon the fine Cane Chair, leſt I ſhould break it.</p>

                  </gap> particular in this exact and exemplary Order than in ſome other Things, for the Seats both within and without Doors were ſo placed, that the Faces of the People were towards the Seats where the public Friends ſat, and when ſo ſet, they did not look or gaze in our Faces, as ſome I think are too apt to do, which in my Thoughts beſpeaks an unconcerned Mind: The Meeting being thus gathered and ſet down in this orderly and ample
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018158_0094_0FA56289F6B0B3B0"/>manner, (although there were but very few bearing our Name in it) it was not long before the mighty Power of the Lord began to work, and in it my Comp nion eſpecially did appear in Teſtimony in the fore Part thereof; and while he was ſpeaking, a Prieſt (not him before touched on, but another) flung out ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon him, and the People for his ſake, which I did not ſee the leaſt Occaſion for; after which he went away, (but more of this in the Sequel.)</p>
               <p>I ſat a conſiderable Time in the Meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could ſee my Way clear to ſay any thing, until the Lord's heavenly Power raiſed me, and ſet me upon my Feet as if one had lifted me up, and what I had firſt in commiſſion to ſpeak, was in the Words of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> viz. <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> with theſe Words, <hi>Nay, the natural and unregenerate Man cannot ſo much as ſee the heavenly and ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, which ſtands not only in Power, but alſo in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Joy and Peace in the holy Spirit; and to be born again, was not to be done unperceivably, no more than the natural Birth could be brought forth without Trouble; and to pretend to be in Chriſt and not to be new Creatures, is prepoſterous; and to pretend to be new Creatures, and yet not able to render any Account how it was performed, was unreaſonable; for it could not be,</hi> as I urged before, <hi>without our Knowledge; for to be born again, ſignified to be quickened and raiſed into a ſpiritual and new Life, by which the Body of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018158_0095_0FA5628AAC3FAEB8"/>the Sins of the Fleſh is mortified, and we come to live a ſelf-denying Life: Thoſe who are crucified with Chriſt, they are crucified to their Sins, that as he died for Sin, we might die to Sin: In this State we live not after the Fleſh, although we live</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaid) <hi>in the Fleſh; but the Life which theſe live, is through Faith in the Son of God: And to have all this, and much more wrought in us, and we</hi> know nothing <hi>of it, is unaccountable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I was thus opened, and delivering theſe Things, with much more than I can remember, the great Woman I felt, for moſt of an Hour together, fought and ſtrove againſt the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſometimes looking up in my Face with a pale, and then with a more ruddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; but the Strength of the Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the Lord's mighty Power began to ſhake the People within and without Doors; but ſhe who was looked upon as a <hi>Deborah</hi> by theſe People, was loth to loſe her outſide Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Appearance thereof: When ſhe could no longer contain, ſhe ſubmitted to the Power of Truth, and the Doctrines thereof, and lifted up her Voice and wept: Oh! then the univerſal Cry and Brokenneſs of Heart and Tears was wonderful! From this Time I do not remember one Word that I ſpoke in Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it was enough that I could keep upon the true Bottom, and not be carried away with the Stream above my Meaſure.</p>

Or ſuch who were found in the impure State, and in the Degeneracy, by reaſon of Sin and wicked Works? Or would Chriſt be married to a People, and become as their Huſband, who were in an unconverted State? Could this be the true Church of Chriſt? Could this be the Lamb's Bride, who had departed from this Spirit, and was in the Pollutions of the World through Luſt, and running after the Pleaſures and Fineries of the World, depending upon Ceremonies, and outſide Things and Elements, which appear not to be <hi>eſſential</hi> to our Salvation, neither do we find Life in them, nor Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through them? I was of the Apoſtle's Mind, that <hi>neither Circumciſion nor Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, but a new Creature:</hi> And what Man in the World can ſay, that <hi>Water</hi> (although he may have been baptized or dipped into the ſame) hath <hi>converted</hi> him, or changed his State from a natural to a ſpiritual, or from a dead to a living State in Chriſt? Or,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018158_0102_0FA5617324BBBB78"/>who that have gone through the moſt celebrated Ceremonies (as ſome may account them) had thereby got <hi>Dominion</hi> over Sin and Satan?</p>
               <p>Having thus treated of Things, or to this purpoſe, among them, I ſaid to <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>ſhe warred and ſtrove againſt the Teſtimony for a time:</hi> And as near as I remember, ſhe ſaid their Principle was, <hi>That ſuch who believed once in Chriſt, were always in him, without Poſſibility of falling away;</hi> and <hi>whom he had once loved, he loved to the End:</hi> And it was a Diſtinction they had given to their Church, to be called <hi>Electa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> and as I ſaid, or near it, <hi>ſhe had no mind to be pulled out of her ſtrong Hold.</hi> But when ſhe ſaw the Glory of Chriſt, and the true Church, as the Queen of the South ſaw <hi>Solomon's</hi> and the Glory of his Houſe; and as ſhe had her Queſtions and Doubts anſwered, <hi>ſhe had no more Spirit in her,</hi> or Doubts or Queſtions, but openly owned, <hi>This is the Truth, this is the Glory I have heard ſo much of:</hi> That Spirit of doubting and queſtioning was ſwallowed up now, by her hearing and beholding for herſelf this greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> his Wiſdom and Glory, and the great Houſe that he had built (the Servants, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and excellent Order, with the Aſcent unto the Houſe of God, which were all wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Houſe, carried in them a lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Chriſt, his Power, Glory and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) as alſo that Order and Mean which is ſeen among his faithful Servants, his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even ſuch as our ſpiritual <hi>Solomon</hi> rules in and over by his Spirit and Power.

Learn this, ſee and know in and for thyſelf, that thou art truly tranſlated out of the Kingdom of Death and Darkneſs into the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is a Kingdom of Power, Life, Light, Peace and Joy in the holy Ghoſt.

               <p>A Paſſage is here revived to my Mind, which was thus: After a large Yearly-meeting, where were many able Miniſters, one of whom was worthy WILLIAM PENN, who taking me aſide after the Meeting, ſaid, <hi>The main Part of the Service of this Day's Work went on thy ſide, and we ſaw it, and were willing and eaſy to give way to the Truth, though it was through thee, who appears but like a</hi> Shrub; <hi>and it is but reaſonable the Lord ſhould make uſe of whom he pleaſes: Now, methinks, thou mayſt be cheerful.</hi> From which I gathered, that he thought I was too much inclinable to be caſt down; therefore I gave him this true Anſwer, <hi>I endeavour to keep in a Medium, out of all Extreems, as believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be moſt agreeable to my Station;</hi> with this Remark, <hi>the worſt of my Times rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered the beſt to me:</hi> WILLIAM ſhook his Head, and ſaid with much Reſpect, <hi>There are
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018158_0104_0FA56175322EB1E8"/>many who ſteer in this Courſe beſides thee, and it is the ſafeſt Path for us to walk in;</hi> with ſeveral other Expreſſions which beſpoke Affection.</p>
               <p>This worthy Man, and Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, notwithſtanding his great Endowments and excellent Qualifications, yet thought it his place to ſtoop to and give way to the Truth, and let the holy Teſtimony go through whom it might pleaſe the Lord to impower and employ in his Work, although it might be through contemptible Inſtruments. I ſincerely deſire this may prove profitable to thoſe whom it may concern, and into whoſe Hands it may come, that the Lord's Work may be truly minded, and given way unto, when it is opened; for ſeeing no Man can open it, let not any ſtrive on the Man's Part to ſhut the ſame. I have at times ſeen ſomething of this Nature, which hath not been altogether to my Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; <hi>a Word to the Wiſe may ſerve,</hi> I would hope, and may be ſufficient for a Caution, for what I have written is in the Love of God, and under a Concern that hath been upon my Mind at times, for ſome Years, to leave behind me a gentle Caution to my tender Friends of both Sexes, to have an eſpecial Care in all Things to recommend not only their Gifts, but their Demeanour in them, as alſo their Converſations after them, to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of God, to that you may build up the Lord's Houſe (like the wife Woman) and always have a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh! that all the Inhabitants of the Earth were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Name, and Rock of Defence, they would not then be ſo much overcome, as they are, with the Power of the Enemy of the Soul, but would live above his Region, which is in the Earth, or rather, in the earthly Hearts of Men. All you who have eſcaped the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, keep in your Tents, until the Lord moves and leads forward, and opens the Way, ſometimes as in a Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Read and underſtand from whence theſe Things have their Riſe and Original, for there is the Church's Safety, and its Comelineſs too, in abiding in the Truth; this is your Place of Safety where the Enemy has no Power, where the Wiles of Satan and Inventions of Man cannot reach, no Inchantment hath Power over theſe, renowned be the great Name of the Lord now and for ever.</p>

I ſtood with an attentive Ear and a watchful Mind; for as I ſtood leaning upon the Rails, with no ſmall Concern upon my Mind, I felt the Lord's Power ariſe, and by it my Strength was renewed in the inner Man, and Faith, Wiſdom and Courage with it, ſo that the Fear of Man, with all his Parts and Learning, was taken from me; and in this State <hi>George Keith</hi> appeared to me but as a <hi>little Child,</hi> or as <hi>nothing:</hi> Renowned be the moſt excellent Name of the Lord, now and for ever. But this great
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:018158_0111_0FA5617B24FB3190"/>Champion (<hi>Goliah</hi> like, at leaſt in his Mind) I ſuppoſed feared not any there; he overlooked us all, and in the Pride of his Heart diſdained us; but the Lord of Heaven and Earth looked down upon us in a very acceptable Time, and helped us for his Name's ſake, and covered our Heads in the Day of Battle: Gloriſied be his great Name for ever.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes thought to omit ſome Part of this Account concerning <hi>George Keith,</hi> but I remember it opened very clearly in my Mind then, and I ſaid to him, <hi>That the Hand of the Lord was againſt him, and that he would pour forth Contempt upon him, for his Diſobedience and Wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to his Reflections; he ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretend to be againſt all Ceremonies, but he could prove that they uſed many Ceremonies, as</hi> taking one another by the Hand, <hi>and</hi> Men ſaluting one another, <hi>and</hi> Women doing ſo to one another, <hi>and,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>that Women did</hi> ſalute Men; <hi>yea, they had done it to him;</hi> as it was generally underſtood by thoſe who heard him, which I thought not worthy my Notice, (but more of this anon.) He went on and ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended to be againſt all Perſecution, but they were not clear, for the</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>and the</hi> Jerſeys <hi>had perſecuted him, and would have hanged him, but that there was ſome Alteration in the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came out one of my Arrows which cut and wounded him deep: I ſaid, <hi>George that is not true.</hi> Upon that the Prieſt drew near and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018158_0112_0FA5617C8DCEB2D0"/>appeared very briſk, and ſaid, <hi>I had as good as charged Mr.</hi> Keith (as he called him) <hi>with a Lie.</hi> I replied, <hi>Give me Time, and I will prove that which</hi> George <hi>ſaid, was</hi> not true, <hi>and then thou and he may take your Advantage to reſcue him from that Epithet of a Liar if you can.</hi> The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>I knew not Mr.</hi> Keith: I replied, <hi>If he knew him as well as I did, he would be aſhamed to be there as an Abettor of him.</hi> The Prieſt got away, and troubled me no more in all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that <hi>George</hi> and I had afterwards (altho' the ſaid Prieſt was with him.) Then I demanded of <hi>George, What Way our Friends proceeded againſt him, and what Meaſures they took, as he would inſinuate, to bring him to the Gallows?</hi> But I perceived Fear began to ſurprize the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and he thinking by my Boldneſs I was an Inhabitant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oſe Parts, and knew his Abuſe to Friends in theſe Provinces, and their peaceable Behaviour towards him, was willing to let the matter drop, and demanded <hi>my Name,</hi> which was told him. I then aſked, <hi>How he could have a Face to urge ſuch a notorious Untruth in the View of that People who were much Strangers to, and ignorant of the Troubles and Differences, chiefly created by him, among Friends in thoſe Parts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Meeting (as before mentioned) being generally newly convinced of the Truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I urged to have him to come to the Particulars of Friends Proceedings againſt him, that even for very Shame, among thoſe Strangers he would ſet forth as far as he could in Truth, the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018158_0113_0FA5617CA7F28C18"/>ſteps Friends had taken in perſecuting him, as he pretended; but he would not meddle in the leaſt with it. Then I ſhewed him, and the People, the Falſity of his Charge, and the Wickedneſs of his Spirit, and the Peaceableneſs of Friends Behaviour towards him, and what great Affronts and Provocations they had put up with at his hand, as I had it from thoſe who were Eye and Ear Witneſſes of it: For, as I ſhewed <hi>George Keith,</hi> I had ſearched into the Bottom of theſe Matters, and heard that when he ſtood before Governors and Aſſembly Men in their Courts of Judicature, when they were met about the Affairs of the three Provinces, he has tore open his Buttons and told them, <hi>His Back tickled for a Whipping,</hi> and <hi>could they not cut him into Collops, and fry, and eat them with Salt;</hi> and that <hi>he ſcorned they ſhould wipe his Shoes:</hi> All which, with much more, I told him <hi>I could prove againſt him.</hi> And when he ſaw he could not provoke Friends to give him ſome condign Puniſhment, <hi>which I thought,</hi> as I ſaid to him, <hi>none but Friends would have ſpared,</hi> eſpecially, <hi>when his Back tickled ſo much for a Whipping;</hi> but they like Men of Peace and Religion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked it all, and he like a Man full of Malice, rather than want ſomething to ſlur and blacken Friends with, writ a Letter I know not where, but dated it from <hi>Bridlington</hi> Priſon in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey.</hi> It muſt have been dated on the outſide of the Priſon, the Doors being locked, ſo that he could not get into it; yet this went current far off, <hi>that</hi> George Keith <hi>was in Priſon;</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:018158_0114_0FA5617F0FD26658"/>conſequently by Friends Procurement, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chief at the Helm of Government in thoſe three Provinces.</p>
               <p>I aſked, <hi>What he had to ſay to all this, for it was all provable?</hi> He did not object one Word againſt what I had ſaid, but vainly hoping for better Succeſs relating to his Undertaking in <hi>Old England,</hi> finding me (as he might ſuppoſe) ſo well verſed in the <hi>American</hi> Affairs, hoped (no doubt) that I had been more ignorant of the Affairs in <hi>Britain:</hi> But poor Man, he ſped as ill there alſo; for he boaſtingly ſaid, <hi>Since it pleaſed God to open his Eyes to ſee into the worſt of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Errors; although,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Charity did oblige him to conſtrue every thing at the beſt whilſt in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them, but ſince they were ſo opened,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>he had been inſtrumental to bring from</hi> Quakeriſm, <hi>to the good old Mother Church in</hi> Old England <hi>five hundred People.</hi> I replied, <hi>that is not true:</hi> If he rightly conſidered what he had done in <hi>Old England,</hi> he had little cauſe to boaſt; <hi>for,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I thought about as many Perſons as he ſpoke of Hundreds, would make up the Number there; and if there was occaſion, I could name all or moſt of them:</hi> And withal told him, <hi>that ſome of thoſe few, whilſt among us, were grown to be neither honourable nor comfortable to us.</hi> I urged <hi>George,</hi> if he could, to name or make appear more in Number than I had mentioned, that he had ſo gathered, as he had falſly ſaid. This was a very great Stroke upon him, and put him to a ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:018158_0115_0FA56180C30646D8"/>
He then began to aſk of my Country, and from whence I came? With the Account of which I humoured him; yet withal put him in mind of his great Brag, and importuned him to make ſomething appear towards that great matter he had done in <hi>Old England,</hi> even for very ſhame; for I was aſhamed for him, that a Man of his Learning, Parts and Pretenſions, ſhould ſo expoſe himſelf; but he went no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it. Then I ſhewed to the People what ſort of a Man he was, (as they themſelves could not but ſee, who were impartial) and that he was not worthy of our Notice; for he cared not what he ſaid, ſo that he could but calumniate and abuſe us.</p>
               <p>By this Time he appeared ſomewhat glutted with the ſharp Sword and keen Arrow the Lord gave me, which cut and wounded deep, ſo that from this Time I did not find in our after En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, he appeared at any time ſo bold and deſperately hardy, but rather expreſſed himſelf, altho' very wickedly, yet in a ſofter Tone. He was now for being gone, threatning us with what he would do on the Morrow; but I reminded him, that he was to us as <hi>an heathen Man or a Publican,</hi> and that what he exhibited againſt us, being but the Fruits of Wrath and Envy, as ſuch we ſlighted and trod it under our Feet as Dirt, and rather deſired his Abſence than his Company: So away he went, only telling us, he would be with us in the Morning. we underſtood by it, that he intended to be with us at the Friends houſe, the Meeting-houſe
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018158_0116_0FA56181293F18E8"/>being about a Quarter of a Mile from our Lodgings.</p>
               <p>The Evening coming on, the neighbouring <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Women fell hard upon our Women Friends about <hi>their ſaluting Man,</hi> which <hi>George Keith</hi> had charged upon them, as was generally underſtood in the Plural, <hi>and this appeared as a Confirmation,</hi> as they alledged, <hi>becauſe when charged, I made no Reply to it, as I had done to all or moſt other Charges, and had overthrown Mr.</hi> Keith, as they ſaid, <hi>ſo that he was not able to ſtand before me.</hi> They ought to have ſaid <hi>before the Lord</hi> in the firſt place: But how the Women might clear themſelves of that Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the preſent Buſineſs. I ſaid, I thought it would be the beſt, at a ſuitable Time in the Morning when <hi>George Keith</hi> was come, that by handſomly bringing the matter over him, they might learn what Women they were who ſaluted him, and ſo clear themſelves from the Reflection caſt upon them; for, I ſaid, perhaps he will limit it to ſome of his near Kindred (as Wife, Mother, Siſter, Daughter) which may ſerve for a <hi>Salvo</hi> in this preſent Caſe; for I did not know of any ſuch general Practice in any Place where I had been, and I had viſited moſt of the meetings in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> So in the Morning when <hi>George,</hi> with two Prieſts, and many People were come, with ſome Friends, who filled the Houſe, a Woman Friend ſtood up and brought the Matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly over <hi>George Keith.</hi> But when ſhe put the Queſtion in the Plural, <hi>(Women)</hi> he ſhifted
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:018158_0117_0FA56181EBB32DF8"/>the Term and ſaid, <hi>he did not ſay Women.</hi> I deſired the Friend to call to her Neighbours who heard what <hi>George Keith</hi> had ſaid the laſt Evening, and were now preſent, <hi>how they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Word?</hi> One like a wiſe and juſt Man ſaid, <hi>He would do Juſtice to every Man; and he underſtood that</hi> Geoge <hi>ſaid</hi> Women; and many ſaid to the ſame purpoſe, but none to the contrary. The Friends aſked me, <hi>How I underſtood the Word? As being a North Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I might know better the North or</hi> Scotch <hi>Dielact than they.</hi> I replied, <hi>They had a broad way of expreſſing the Word</hi> Woman, <hi>rather ſounding it like the plural, but I underſtood it</hi> Women as the above mentioned diſcreet Man had ſaid.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion ſhe put to him was, <hi>What Woman?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>A good old motherly Woman that was gone to Heaven many Years ago.</hi> Then ſhe aſked, <hi>What Country Woman?</hi> He replied, <hi>A</hi> Scotch <hi>Woman.</hi> The Friend ſaid, <hi>It was very well that he had cleared all the World of that Fault</hi> (if it might be ſo termed) <hi>but</hi> Scotland, <hi>and the Woman</hi> dead <hi>many Years ago.</hi> The Women Friends were greatly ſatisfied, and glad they were ſo finely diſcharged of that which ſome counted a foul Reflection, and eſpecially before their zealous Neighbours the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> who (as the Friends ſaid) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might have twitted them with it, whether the Matter was true or Falſe, if it had not been cleared up; <hi>but,</hi> as I ſaid to <hi>George, it was a Reflection for Reflection's ſake:</hi> For I was willing
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:018158_0118_0FA56182A7C8EFC0"/>to ſet every thing that was wrong (as far as I was capable) in its proper Light, that Friends and others, of all Perſuaſions and Qualities who were preſent, might ſee Things as they really were, and not be deceived; and I had much Satisfaction in ſo doing. And inaſmuch as I was engaged in the Defence of the Truth, it appeared the moſt clear to me, to load him with his own Lies, Miſtakes and Wickedneſs, and to do what we did, as much as in us lay, in the Lord's mighty Power; for he appeared to me, like to the Angels who kept not their firſt State.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus far gone through, and the Meeting-time drawing on, I was in ſome Concern of Mind, leſt any ſhould be hurt by either hearing or anſwering <hi>George Keith,</hi> he having a great Propenſity to jangling; it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opened in my Mind to aſk him a Queſtion, withal reminding him, <hi>that he was but to us as an heathen Man or a Publican,</hi> yet he might, if he pleaſed, anſwer me the Queſtion, which was, <hi>Whether he was always</hi> ſound <hi>in the fundamental Doctrines of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>yea or nay?</hi> Upon which he ſat a conſiderable Time in Silence, of which I was truly glad, my Spirit being much bowed under the Apprehenſion I had, of the weighty Exerciſe that was likely to attend the approaching Meeting. But before we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>George</hi> ſtood up, and taking his Staff in his Hand by the Middle, ſaid, <hi>While he was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>he thought, as</hi> Paul <hi>thought,</hi> that he had the Spirit of God, <hi>and when he had the Spirit
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018158_0119_0FA5618394ACE478"/>of God, then he wrote</hi> ſound Things, <hi>but when he had it not, then he wrote</hi> unſound Things. I aſked, <hi>Whether theſe unſound Things he wrote were in</hi> Fundamentals, <hi>yea, or nay? If not in</hi> Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, <hi>then my Queſtion remained firm and untouched.</hi> He would have gone from the matter, but I reminded him of it again, as I ſuppoſed he foreſaw that he could not anſwer it, but by bringing a Stroke upon himſelf, for if he had owned his being <hi>unſound,</hi> I had it under his own Hand, in a Book written after he left Friends, <hi>that he was always ſound,</hi> &amp;c. And if he had ſaid, <hi>he was always ſound in the Fundamentals,</hi> as before, then I intended to have aſked, <hi>why he left us?</hi> For he advocated the ſame orthodox Principles which we believed and taught; but we ended quietly, and prepared to go to the great Meeting, for by this time many Friends and People were come, and coming from every Quarter, to ſee and hear how Matters would go between the poor <hi>Quakers,</hi> and this great Champion in his Heart <hi>George Keith,</hi> for I thought he moſt reſembled the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> who defied the Armies of the living God, of any I had ever yet ſeen in all my Travels, in a religious reſpect.</p>
               <p>Now to the Meeting we went; <hi>George Keith,</hi> with two Prieſts, and a great many People gathered together of ſeveral Profeſſions and Qualities into one Body, and Friends and ſome friendly People into another Body; and as we came near to the Meeting-houſe, I ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſtill, and took a View of the People, and it appcared
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:018158_0120_0FA56184284AF4E8"/>to me as if two Armies were going to engage in Battle: There appeared with <hi>George Keith</hi> Men of conſiderable Eſtates, Parts, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we appeared like poor Shrubs; and, under a Senſe of our preſent State, I had like to have been diſmayed, and my Faith had even like to have failed me; but I cried mightily to the God and Fountain of all our tender Mercies, that he would look down upon us, and help us in this Time of great Exerciſe, which was not hid from him; but his penetrating Eye ſaw, and his watchful Providence attended us, bleſſed be his Name for ever. I continued my fervent Prayers and Interceſſions to the Lord of Hoſts, that he would ariſe for his great Name's ſake, and work for us that Day, that the Enemies of Truth might not triumph or vaunt over us, and that none of theſe tender Plants, which he had brought to the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth, might be hurt.</p>
               <p>I had no ſooner thus heartily ſought to the Lord, but I felt renewed Strength come upon me, and the Fear of Man was taken away from me, and I ſaw evidently that Truth would have the Victory that Day, and my Faith and Confidence was greatly ſtrengthened in the Lord. Theſe breathings forth of my Spirit to the Lord were in ſecret, without Words to be heard by Men, but the Lord hears and knows the Diſtreſs and Language of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Being thus encouraged in myſelf, it aroſe in my Heart to ſpeak to Friends before we went into the Meeting-houſe, and I adviſed them <hi>to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:018158_0121_0FA561872E0ECD50"/>be ſwift to hear and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> and that <hi>what was ſpoken might be in the Lord's Power, for that wounds</hi> George <hi>the moſt, and ſlays that wicked and ranting Spirit in him, more than all the Wiſdom of Words without it;</hi> and let us <hi>maintain our Teſtimony of Denial againſt him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get together into one Body, that we may be an Help and Strength one to another; and let every one who knows the Lord, cry mightily unto him, that his living Power and Preſence may be amongſt us, and I believed the Lord would not ſuffer any to be hurt.</hi> So the Meeting gathered, and immediately after, <hi>George</hi> ſtood up to tell us (as before) <hi>that he was come in the Queen's Name to gather</hi> Quakers <hi>from</hi> Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, <hi>to the good old Mother Church, the Church of</hi> England (as he called it) <hi>and that he could prove out of our own Books, that we held</hi> Errors, Hereſies, damnable Doctrines <hi>and</hi> Blaſphemies; with a Threat <hi>to look to ourſelves to anſwer, or elſe the Auditory would conclude, that what he exhibited againſt us was true.</hi> I expected ſome of the elder Friends would ſay ſomething to him, but none did; and I having a deep Concern upon my Mind, leſt Truth, or the Friends of Truth, ſhould ſuffer thro' our Miſmanagement, and ſuch as waited for Occaſion, might have an Occaſion adminiſtred by us againſt ourſelves; I ſay, under this Concern of Mind I ſtood up, and ſignified to the People what manner of Man <hi>George Keith</hi> was; notwithſtanding he had walked many Years amongſt us, yet towards the latter end of his ſo walking with us, he grew
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018158_0122_0FA5618895F7F660"/>very troubleſome, by reaſon of a contentious Spirit which did poſſeſs him: and after much Labour and exerciſing of Patience, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Love towards him; in order to recover and reclaim him, all that Labour of Love and much Forbearance would not avail, but he ſtill perſiſted in the Work of Contention and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. Then he was publicly diſowned, and teſtified againſt by us, as a Perſon with whom we had no Unity or Fellowſhip: And being thus caſt out, <hi>he became to us</hi> (agreeable to the Sayings of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>as an Heathen Man or a Publican;</hi> and being thus disjointed, to expoſe us, what lay in his Power, to all ſorts of People, he choſe <hi>printing againſt us;</hi> wherein he hath much abuſed us, in leaving out many times the explanatory Parts of Sentences, and coining Words to make the Meaning appear different from what was deſigned, and indeed, from what was moſt fair and genuine: Therefore, ſome of our Friends found themſelves concerned to follow him in Print, for the clearing us from what he, through Envy, would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly faſtened upon us, and to return his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictions, Miſinterpretations, and Miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of our Writings upon himſelf, and to clear our own Innocency, and manifeſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs and Wickedneſs of his Spirit: Neither do we, as a People, hold ourſelves to be under any Obligation to follow him into foreign Parts of the World, to anſwer his Arraignments and Charges, not being conſcious to ourſelves that we hold any thing contrary to ſound and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:018158_0123_0FA56189CD1194C0"/>orthodox Doctrine; and alſo knowing that what he exhibits againſt us, is the Fruit of Envy and Malice, as ſuch we reject it and trample it under our Feet; and were it not for your ſakes, who are Strangers to theſe Things, we ſhould take no further Notice of <hi>George Keith</hi> than to ſlight and reject him as a Man that cares not what he ſays, nor is he worthy of our Notice.</p>
               <p>Then pauſing a little, <hi>George</hi> being quiet, a Friend ſtood up with a ſhort, but living Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and then my Companion; all this in much Weight and with good Demonſtration. After them it pleaſed the Lord to open my Mouth, I think in as much Strength, Clearneſs and Demonſtration as ever, beginning with the following Words, <hi>In that Way you call Hereſy do we worſhip the God of our Fathers, believing all Things that are written concerning Jeſus Chriſt, both as to his God-head and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> giving a ſummary Account of his Birth, working of Miracles, ſome of his Doctrine, Sufferings and Death, Aſcenſion and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Coming of the Spirit of Truth, or Comforter, to lead all thoſe who receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey it, into all Truth: Having great Openings concerning the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the Beginning, Service and End of the Miniſtration of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. The People appeared very much down and attentive, for the Lord's heavenly baptizing Power was amongſt us that Day: It was thought, many were there who had not been at any of our Meetings of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:018158_0124_0FA5618A2F302F58"/>Worſhip before, and the Preſence of the Prieſts there, opened a Door for all the reſt.</p>
               <p>I being clear, left them unto the Grace of God, and unto their free Teacher Chriſt, whoſe heavenly Power in the Appearance of his Spirit, the laſt and laſting Diſpenſation, was exalted that Day above all the ſhadowy and typical Things that ever had been in the World: A good Meeting it was, and Friends were mutually comforted and edified in the internal Preſence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt of this Place, whoſe Name was <hi>Sheppard,</hi> before my Mouth was opened in Teſtimony, made Preparation to write, and when I began to ſpeak, he had his Hat upon his Knee, and his Paper upon its Crown, and Pen and Ink in his Hands, and made many Motions to write, but wrot nothing; as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſo he ended, without writing at all. And as Friends entered the Meeting-houſe in the Lord's Power, even that Power which cut <hi>Rahab,</hi> and wounded the <hi>Dragon,</hi> which had been at work, kept down in a good degree the wrong Spirit in <hi>George,</hi> for he appeared much down; but this buſy Prieſt called to him ſeveral Times to make his Reply to what I had ſpoke. After ſome Time I ſaid to the Prieſt, in Behalf of the Meeting, that <hi>he might have Liberty to make Reply.</hi> He propoſed to have another Day appointed <hi>for a Diſpute;</hi> to which I ſaid, <hi>if he did make a voluntary Challenge,</hi> which he ſhould not ſay we put him upon, <hi>we or ſome of us</hi> (meaning Friends) <hi>if a Day and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:018158_0125_0FA5618AF13E75E8"/>Place were agreed upon, ſhould find it our Concern to anſwer him as well as we could.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he would have Mr.</hi> Keith <hi>to be with him:</hi> I told him, <hi>if he ſhould, and meddled in the Diſpute, if I was there, I ſhould reject him for Reaſons before aſſigned.</hi> When the Prieſt had ſaid this and ſomewhat more, an Elder of the <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Congregation clapt him on the Shoulder, and bid him <hi>ſit down;</hi> ſo he was quiet, and then ſtood up <hi>George Keith,</hi> and owned <hi>he had been refreſhed amongſt us that Day, and had heard a great many ſound Truths, with ſome Errors, but that it was not the common Doctrine which the</hi> Quakers <hi>preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>I had ſomething to ſay to obviate what</hi> George Keith <hi>would inſinuate;</hi> for his Drift was to infuſe an Opinion into them, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not commonly preach up Faith in the <hi>Manhood</hi> of Chriſt, as I had done that Day; I appealed to the Auditory, whether they thought there was a Neceſſity frequently to preſs a Matter ſo univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongſt Chriſtians, as <hi>Faith in the Manhood of Chriſt was?</hi> Yet we, as a People, had ſo often and clearly demonſtrated our Faith in the Manhood of Chriſt, both in our Teſtimonies and Writings, as might ſatisfy any unbiaſſed Perſon, or ſuch who were not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt us; and we know not of any People who believe more ſcripturally in the Manhood of Chriſt than we do: But inaſmuch as the Grace, Light and holy Spirit, is highly concerned in the Work of Man's Salvation, as
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018158_0126_0FA5618C564683C0"/>well as what Chriſt did for us without us, and this being yet much a Myſtery to many called Chriſtians, it pleaſes God to open, in the Courſe of our Miniſtry, into the Meaning and Myſtery thereof, and to preſs the latter more than the former. To which <hi>George</hi> made no Reply, but began to exhibit his Charges againſt us (as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before) and ſaid, <hi>he could prove them out of our Friends Books,</hi> naming <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burrough,</hi> &amp;c. He had in a Paper a great many Quotations out of Friends Books, and a young Man with him had many Books in a Bag, <hi>out of which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he would prove the Charges he was about to exhibit againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was now crowded up into the Gallery between me and the Rail, with a Paper in his Hand; and I ſtanding over him, and being taller, could ſee his Quotations and his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes upon them, on which I told him loudly, that all the Meeting might hear, <hi>That he offered Violence to that Senſe and Underſtanding which God had given him, and he knew in his Conſcience, we were not that People, neither were our Friends Writings either damnable or blaſphemous, as he through Envy endeavoured to make the World believe; and that he would not have Peace in ſo doing, but Trouble from the Lord in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> I ſpoke in the Lord's dreadful Power, and <hi>George</hi> trembled ſo much as I ſeldom ever ſaw any Man do: I pitied him in my Heart, yet, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid once concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I felt <hi>the Wrath of the Lord go forth againſt him:
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:018158_0127_0FA5618C6DF50B90"/>George</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do not judge me;</hi> I replied, <hi>the Lord judges, and all who are truly one in Spirit with the Lord, cannot but judge thee.</hi> So he gave over, and it appearing a ſuitable time to break up the Meeting, Friends parted in great Love, Tenderneſs and Brokenneſs of Heart; for the Lord's mighty Power had been in and over the Meeting from the beginning to the end thereof, glorified and renowned be his moſt excellent Name, now and for ever, for his Mercies are many to thoſe that love and fear him who is the Fulneſs of all Good.</p>
               <p>This Meeting was not only for Worſhip, but alſo for Buſineſs, as I ſaid to the People at our parting; it was Friends Monthly Meeting, in which their Poor, Fatherleſs, and Widows, were taken Care of, and ſuch other Things as concern them as a People. Two Friends were deſired to ſtay, to hear what <hi>George</hi> had to ſay to them who remained, which ſaid two Friends gave an Account to us afterwards, that <hi>George</hi> ſaid to the People after we were gone, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>had left none to diſpute with him but an Aſs and a Fool;</hi> when I heard it, I ſaid, could you not have replied, <hi>An Aſs was once made ſufficient to reprove the Madneſs of the Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> called to ſee me the next Day, and ſaid, <hi>You had the Advantage over me Yeſterday, for you perſuaded me to be quiet until you had done, and then you would not ſtay to hear me;</hi> neither indeed were we under any Obligation ſo to do: I told him, <hi>I hoped that Truth would always have the Advantage over thoſe who oppoſed
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:018158_0128_0FA5618D52AC4218"/>it;</hi> and ſo we parted, but met again upon <hi>Rhode-Iſland;</hi> the Governor of which Place, who was a friendly Man, having heard of my. Intention of coming thither, ordered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-Governor, when I came, to have me to him, which he did; and when he ſaw me at the Door, and after Enquiry heard my Name, he took me by the Hand and led me like a Brother, or rather more like a tender Father, into a Room, ſetting me down by him, and then began to ſay, <hi>I have heard much of you, and deſired to ſee you long, and am glad you are here.</hi> I finding him near me in Spirit, was very open in my Mind to him, and anſwered him with much Clearneſs and Satisfaction. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he aſked, <hi>Whether I thought the Sourneſs in the Minds of the</hi> Preſbyterians <hi>againſt us, was not rather abated?</hi> I told him, <hi>I did believe it was; and if our Friends did but obſerve to walk wiſely, and live up to what they profeſſed, they would overcome it all.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>that was the way, and there was not another comparable to it; and,</hi> as he ſaid, and I believe it was ſo, <hi>he had no other view in ſending for me, but to manifeſt his Reſpecls to me, and to do me any Service that lay in his Power:</hi> I told him, <hi>I was ſenſible of his Love, and wiſhed I could be capable of reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating that which in Gratitude his Kindneſs to me called for:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he deſired no more than when I came that way I would viſit him, if he was living.</hi> I told him, <hi>I intended ſo to do, if ever it was my Lot to come there again.</hi> I then
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:018158_0129_0FA5618DE8230258"/>deſired he would be at the Meeting next Day, <hi>George Keith</hi> propoſing to be there, in all likelihood it would be very large; which he promiſed he would, and accordingly came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> made little Diſturbance in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Meeting, but commanded the Governor <hi>to quiet the</hi> Quakers: A Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Keith, <hi>you ought not to command the Governor, but intreat him;</hi> well then, he intreated the Governor to quiet the <hi>Quakers</hi> that he might be heard; whereupon the Governor, like a Man of Juſtice and Wiſdom, ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>It was not in his Power to quiet the</hi> Quakers; <hi>inaſmuch as the Houſe is theirs, and they have appointed the Meeting, it is but reaſonable they ſhould have their Liberty, and if they be willing, when they have done, you have your Liberty to ſay what you have to ſay to thoſe who will ſtay to hear you:</hi> So the Governor being next me, leaned his Hand upon me, and went away in a ſober Manner. <hi>George</hi> was quiet, and we had a good Meeting, and ſo parted.</p>
               <p>After moſt of the Friends were gone, a Friend and I went to the Meeting-houſe Door, to hear what <hi>George</hi> ſaid; he held his Bible in his Hand, and ſaid it was promiſed, <hi>that the Goſpel ſhould be preached unto every Creature under Heaven; but if it was truly tranſlated, it would be</hi> in every Creature, (<hi>not in every Creature as</hi> Horſe, Cow, &amp;c. <hi>but in every rational Creature of Mankind:</hi>) And then their Meeting broke up in Confuſion.</p>

My next Remove was to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> where I met with <hi>Thomas Story</hi> and <hi>John Rodman; John</hi> deſired <hi>Thomas</hi> and me to be aſſiſtant to him in preparing a Writing againſt <hi>George Keith,</hi> when he came to <hi>Fluſhing</hi> Meeting upon the aſoreſaid Iſland, which Writing was to this Effect, <hi>viz.</hi>

Thus ended this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt a poor Servant of Chriſt, and a <hi>grand Apoſtate,</hi> who appeared to fight againſt Reaſon, Senſe and Conſcience.

               <p>I told <hi>George,</hi> that <hi>I was much aſhamed of his</hi> complimenting <hi>great People;</hi> for I obſerved

               </p>
               <p>This Account carries in it an Admonition to us, and to Friends in future Ages, into whoſe Hands it may come, to beware of letting in the Spirit of <hi>Envy, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Pride of Heart,</hi> which I clearly ſaw was that which, with too much leaning to his <hi>natural Abilities</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> was his Overthrow, he not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord's holy Spirit, the Life and Strength of his faithful People, and the Key of true Knowledge, the good Remembrancer, and Leader into all Truth, which the Lord ſees meet in his wiſdom to open and lead us into; without the Help of which Anointing and holy Spirit, we are apt to be cold and forgetful in our Duties towards God, and alſo in our Love and Duties one to another: but as the Meaſure of this Spirit is faithfully kept to, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, we grow more and more fruitful in every good Work and Word, to the Glory of God and Comfort of our Souls, and, as the Salt of the Earth, help to ſeaſon thoſe who are not ſeaſoned.</p>

When I was in the Yearly-meeting upon <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> there was a Query concerning what Friends might do, in caſe there ſhould be a Lay or Tax laid upon the Inhabitants for building ſome Fortifications, and to provide Men and Arms for the Security of the Iſland? Such a thing being then in Agitation, he, who was one of the chief Friends concerned in Church-Affairs, would have me give an Account what we did in the like Caſe in <hi>England;</hi> for, he ſaid, they in that Country looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but as the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and Friends here in <hi>Old England</hi> as their <hi>Mother,</hi> and they were willing to act conſiſtent with us as far as they could, and would know how we did there in that Matter, whether we could pay to that Tax which was for carrying on a vigorous War againſt <hi>France?</hi> I was unwilling to meddle with it, as I ſaid; but the Meeting waited a conſiderable time for my Anſwer (as one told me) and was not willing to go forward without it; at laſt, when I could not well do otherwiſe, I ſignified to that large Meeting, <hi>That I had heard the Matter debated both in ſuperior and inferior Meetings, and privately, and the moſt general Reſult was this;</hi> Friends did not ſee an effectual Door opened to avoid the Thing, that Tax being mixed with the other Taxes; <hi>although many Friends are not ſo eaſy as they could deſire: Neither have we any further Sway in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than only giving our Voices for ſuch as are concerned therein; therefore, as Things appear to me, there is a great Diſparity between our
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:018158_0134_0FA561932BEA5EE0"/>Circumſtances and yours here; for you have a great Intereſt here, and a great Share in the Government, and perhaps may put ſuch a Thing by in voting, conſidering the Body of Friends, and ſuch as are friendly, whom you have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in; therefore look not for Help from thé</hi> Mother, <hi>wherein ſhe is not capable of helping herſelf, and thereby neglect your own Buſineſs; but mind your own Way in the Truth, and look not out.</hi> Friends appeared well ſatisfied with theſe Diſtinctions, and it gave me ſome Eaſe, in that I had not hurt any.</p>
               <p>During my ſtay in one of the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> a great Weight, more than uſual, ſeized upon my Spirit, as I ſat in a Meeting, and under a Senſe of the ſame my Cries aſcended unto the Lord, the Fountain of all tender Mercies, that he would pleaſe to <hi>ſhew me</hi> what was the Cauſe of that great Power of Darkneſs which did ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Spirit; and it pleaſed the Lord to <hi>ſhew me,</hi> that a Man there had been guilty of ſome <hi>groſs Wickedneſs;</hi> and when it appeared clear to me, to be required of me to expreſs it publickly, it became a very great Excerciſe to me, and ſome Reaſonings I had, before I gave up to make it publick to that large Meeting, of Friends and other People: I laboured under it till towards the Concluſion of the Meeting, but finding my Peace concerned very nearly in the Matter, I ſtood up in the Gallery and ſaid, <hi>Under a Senſe of ſome groſs Wickedneſs committed by ſome Perſon not far from me, hath my Spirit been borne down; which Wickedneſs will in a
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:018158_0135_0FA56194161248A8"/>ſhort Time break forth to the Diſhonour of Truth, and Grief of Friends.</hi> A great Man who ſat in the Gallery by me, ſtarted up and ſeated himſelf upon the Rail of the Gallery, with his Eyes fixed on me, and I faſtned, in the Lord's Dread, my Eyes on him, and ſaid, <hi>We have a common Maxim in</hi> Old England, <hi>Touch a galled Horſe's Back, and he will kick,</hi> and I am of the Opinion <hi>he that kicks is not clear.</hi> He got down as faſt as he could out of my way, for he not only prevented me from the View of the Meeting by ſetting there, but his Uncleanneſs ſtood much in the way of my Service.</p>
               <p>After the Meeting was over, ſeveral worthy Friends expreſſed to me the great Concern they were under, leſt he ſhould cither by Money, or by Subtility, conceal the Sin and Wickedneſs, if ſuch was committed; for I found there was a great Fear and Jealouſy in the Minds of Friends, that ſomething was wrong with the Man, but I was 'till then altogether a Stranger to their Thoughts, and to the State of the Man; yet I adviſed that Friends ſhould have a watchful Eye over him and his Family, for I told Friends, <hi>my Spirit was eaſy in what I had delivered, and I believed the Evil would not be concealed.</hi> So in my Return, his Houſe-keeper had brought forth a Child, and charged him with being the Father of it, which he denyed not: Friends then aſked me, what they ſhould do in the Caſe? I ſaid, <hi>Let the Judgment of Truth go forth againſt all manifeſt Wickedneſs, without reſpect of Perſons, that the ever bleſſed Truth, and ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018158_0136_0FA56196210110F0"/>as live in it, may be kept clear and in good Eſteem before all Men as much as may be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something of the like Exerciſe I met with in a Meeting in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> repeating ſeveral times <hi>what Oppreſſion my Spirit was under, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome yet hidden Wickedneſs, which in a ſhort Time would be brought to light, to the Blemiſh of the Truth, and great Trouble to Friends.</hi> That very Evening, after the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Women little thought on by Friends to be guilty of ſuch a Crime, went to a worthy Friend and told him, <hi>She was the Woman that had done that great Wickedneſs I had ſo much complained of, and had borne ſuch a great Load becauſe thereof;</hi> and, as the honeſt Friend ſaid, ſhe wept bitterly, even in the very Anguiſh of her Soul. He came twelve Miles the next Day to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to acquaint me with the Matter, and aſk my Advice, which I gave to this Effect; <hi>If Friends find upon Enquiry, in the proper Seaſon, that the Woman continues heartily ſorry, and truly penitent for what ſhe hath done, for</hi> Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance, <hi>and if from ſuch a hearty and penitent Senſe</hi> (which is to be felt beyond Words) <hi>ſhe gave forth a Paper againſt her wicked Doings, not ſo much to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate herſelf into Favour, as for the clearing of Truth and Friends, and for the Eaſe and Peace of her own Mind, and took the Blame and Shame to herſelf, then Friends may paſs it by; if not, Friends muſt ſet the Judgment of Truth over manifeſt Wickedneſs,</hi> as before mentioned.</p>

I went to viſit a Meeting in that Part called <hi>North Wales,</hi> which had not been long planted in that Place, where there was a fine ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der People, but few underſtanding <hi>Engliſh, Rowland Ellis</hi> was my Interpreter; a good Meeting it was, and Truth was over all: Some, by the Interpreter, expreſſed their great Satisfaction in our Viſit to that Meeting, which heretofore had not been counted as Friends, but ſince that have been taken Notice of, and grown into good Eſteem with the Body of Friends.</p>
               <p>I found it much my Work to be concerned in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church, which was very low in many Places, yet I found there was a Willingneſs in many Friends Minds to be helped in that needful Affair, for ſurely it is a good Fence, or a Help to keep the Righteous in, and hurtful and wicked Things and Doings out, if the ſame be rightly handled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as it ought to be, in the Love and Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>There was one Thing I had like to have omitted, which happened when I was in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> viz. one <hi>Rogers</hi> came thither <hi>to offer</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>his Gift in the Yearly-meeting amongſt Friends;</hi> but they appearing in a great Strait about him, although he had writ in Behalf of Truth's Principles, and ſuffered Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the taking away his Wife from him, and was not ſo much as ſuffered to come to converſe with his own Son, but under a Guard or Watch which was ſet over him, to hear
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018158_0138_0FA56199CB646D78"/>what paſſed betwixt them, as he told me and ſome other Friends, which Friends ſaid was true; yet, under the Conſideration of the Matter, and Clearneſs of the Man's Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Friends remained in a Strait <hi>what to do;</hi> and deſired that I would take the Matter upon me, and reaſon the Caſe with him, and try if I could perſuade him to be eaſy, and not inſiſt upon any ſuch Thing, as <hi>to promiſe to receive his Gift;</hi> for otherwiſe, he ſaid, <hi>he would go where it would be received.</hi> I ſhewed him, that it was a Thing impracticable among us, and in itſelf unreaſonable, that we ſhould be by any Pre-engagement obliged to receive that which he might call <hi>a Gift,</hi> before we heard it, if he believed he had a Gift, he might ſpeak, and, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>we might judge:</hi> For it was not impoſſible but he, who was a Scholar and a wiſe Man, and had a ſtrong Memory, might have gathered certain Paſſages out of the Bible or other Books, with what other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations he might have ſtored up, and ſpeak of, and call <hi>a Gift,</hi> which we could not receive as <hi>a real Gift of the Miniſtry,</hi> which ſtands <hi>in the Spirit</hi> and <hi>in the Power</hi> and if it be ſuch, it will make way for itſelf; if not, <hi>we cannot receive it.</hi> So he went away, and troubled Friends no more that I heard of.</p>

               <p>When much of the Matters were gone through, I put <hi>William Penn</hi> in mind to enquire of the Interpreter, if he could find ſome Terms or Words that might be intelligible to them, in a religious Senſe, by which he might reach the Underſtandings of the Natives, and inculcate into their Minds a Senſe of the Principles of Truth, ſuch as <hi>Chriſt's manifeſting himſelf to the inward Senſes of the Soul, by his Light, Grace or holy Spirit,</hi> with the Manner <hi>of the Operations and working thereof in the Hearts of the Children of Men, and how it did reprove for Evil, and miniſter Peace and Comfort to the Soul in its Obedience and Well-doing;</hi> or, as near as he could, come to the Subſtance of this in their own Language. <hi>William Penn</hi> much preſſed the Matter upon the Interpreter to do his beſt, in any Terms,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:018158_0141_0FA5619B69B713C0"/>that might reach their Capacities, and anſwer the End intended: But the Interpreter would not, either by reaſon, as he alledged, of <hi>Want of Terms,</hi> or his <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> to meddle in religious Matters, which I know not, but I rather think the latter was the main Reaſon which obſtructed him; therefore we found nothing was like to be done according to our Deſires in this Matter, as the Interpreter was but a dark Man, and, as <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid, <hi>a wrong Man for our preſent Purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid, he underſtood they owned a <hi>ſuperior Power,</hi> and aſked the Interpreter, <hi>What their Notion was of God in their own Way?</hi> The Interpreter ſhewed, by making ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circles on the Ground with his Staff, till he reduced the laſt into a ſmall Circumference, and placed, as he ſaid, by way of Repreſentation, the <hi>great Man</hi> (as they termed him) in the middle Circle, ſo that he could ſee over all the other Circles, which included all the Earth. And we querying, <hi>What they owned as to</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>or a</hi> future State? The Interpreter ſaid, They believed when ſuch died as were guilty of Theft, Swearing, Lying, Whoring, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they went into a very cold Country, where they had neither good fat Veniſon, nor Match Coats, which is what they uſe inſtead of Cloaths to cover them withal, being of one piece in the form of a Blanket or Bed-covering: But thoſe who died clear of the aforeſaid Sins, go into a fine warm Country, where they had good fat Veniſon and good Match-Coats, Things much
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018158_0142_0FA5619C48487BC0"/>valued by theſe Natives. I thought, inaſmuch as theſe poor Creatures had not the Knowledge of God by the Scriptures, as we have who are called, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but what Knowledge they had of the <hi>ſupreme Being</hi> muſt be by an inward Senſation, or by contemplating upon the Works of God in the Creation, or probably from ſome Tradition handed down from Father to Son, by which it appears, they acknowledge a future State of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> the former of which they expreſs by <hi>Warmth, good Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Food,</hi> and the latter by <hi>Nakedneſs, pining Hunger</hi> and <hi>piercing Cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often thought and ſaid, when I was amongſt them, that generally my Spirit was very eaſy, and I did not feel that Power of Darkneſs to oppreſs me, as I had done in many Places among the People called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>William Penn</hi> and they had expreſſed their Satisfaction, both for themſelves and their People, in keeping all their former Articles unviolated, and agreed that if any particular Differences did happen amongſt any of their People, they ſhould not be an Occaſion of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting or creating any War between <hi>William Penn's</hi> People and the <hi>Indians,</hi> but Juſtice ſhould be done in all ſuch Caſes, that all Animoſities might be prevented on all Sides for ever; they went out of the Houſe into an open Place not far from it, to perform their <hi>Cantico</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which was done thus; Firſt, the made a ſmall Fire, and the Men without the Women ſat down about it in a Ring, and whatſoever Object.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018158_0143_0FA5619CF5E34DA8"/>they ſeverally fixed their Eyes on, I did not ſee them move them in all that part of their Worſhip, while they ſang a very melodious Hymn, which affected and tendered the Hearts of many who were Spectators: When they had thus done, they began (as I ſuppoſe is their uſual manner) to beat upon the Ground with little Sticks, or make ſome Motion with ſomething in their Hands, and pauſe a little, till one of the elder Sort ſets forth his Hymn; and that being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Company for a few Minutes, and then a Pauſe; and then the like was done by another, and ſo by a third, and followed by the Company, as at the firſt; which ſeemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to affect them and others. Having done, they roſe up and danced a little about the Fire, and parted with ſome Shouting like a Triumph or Rejoicing.</p>
               <p>I leave <hi>Pennſbury,</hi> but intend, before I leave the <hi>Indians,</hi> to ſay ſomething more concerning that People, which I met with near <hi>Caleb Puſy's</hi> Houſe in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> viz. I being walking in the Wood, eſpied ſeveral Wigwams or Houſes of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and drew towards them, but could not converſe with them; but looking over them in the Love of God, I found it to be my Way, as I apprehended, to look for an Interpreter and go to them again, which I did; and when I came to them, and ſignified that I was come from a far Country, with a Meſſage from the <hi>great Man</hi> above (as they call God) and my Meſſage was to endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the Interpreter expreſſed theſe Things to them in their own Language, they wept, and Tears ran down their naked Bodies, and they ſmote their Hands upon their Breaſts and I perceived ſaid ſomething to the Interpreter: I aſked <hi>what they ſaid?</hi> He told me they ſaid, <hi>all that I had delivered to them was good, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the great Man had ſent me, I could not have told them thoſe Things.</hi> I deſired the Interpreter to aſk them, <hi>how the knew what I had ſaid to them was good?</hi> they replied, and ſmote their Hands on their Breaſts, <hi>the good Man here</hi> (meaning in their Hearts) <hi>told them what I had ſaid was all good.</hi> They manifeſted much Love to me in their Way, and I believe the Love of God is to them, and all People in the Day of their Viſitation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Being weary, having rid a great way that Day, I with my Companion <hi>Richard Orm</hi> took leave of her Huſband and went to our Reſt, and ſaw him no more till the next Day in the Evening, and when he came, I aſked him, <hi>For what Reaſon he left us ſo long, as he knew how uneaſy his Wife was about us, and that we had a great want of him?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he had been giving Notice of the Meeting twenty Miles one

My paſſionate Landlady became more meek and friendly, and received the Truth in the Love of it: We had a good Meeting the next Day, and ſhe ſaid, <hi>If I would ſtay that Night, I ſhould be as welcome as her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but if not, ſhe bleſt the Lord for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the Good ſhe had already received by me,</hi> and parted with me in much Brokenneſs of Heart; and I heard ſhe lived and died in good Unity with Friends. But oh, how glad was her Huſband to ſee that great and ſudden Change wrought in her! it was the Lord's Doings; to him be the Praiſe now and for ever, for he alone is worthy.</p>
               <p>I had many comfortable Meetings in my Travels through theſe Provinces, and good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. We were at a Yearly-meeting at <hi>Third-haven</hi> in <hi>Maryland</hi> upon the Eaſtern Shore, to which Meeting for Worſhip came with <hi>William Penn,</hi> Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> and his Lady with their Retinue, but it was late when they came, and the Strength and Glory of the heavenly Power of the Lord was going off from the Meeting; ſo the Lady was much diſappointed, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>William Penn,</hi> for ſhe told him, <hi>She did not want to hear him, and ſuch as he, for he was a Scholar and a wiſe Man, and ſhe did not queſtion but he could preach; but ſhe wanted to hear ſome of our</hi> Mechanicks <hi>preach, as</hi> Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, Shoe-makers, <hi>and ſuch like</hi> Ruſticks; <hi>for ſhe thought they could not preach to any purpoſe. William Penn</hi> told her, <hi>ſome of theſe were rather the beſt Preachers we had amongſt
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:018158_0149_0FA561A3AAEE6310"/>us;</hi> or near theſe Words. I was a little in their Company, and I thought the Lady to be a notable, wiſe, and withal a courteouſly carriaged Woman. I was alſo in Company with the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> at our Friend <hi>Richard John's</hi> Houſe upon the Weſt Cliffs in <hi>Maryland,</hi> for we both lodged there one Night, and I heard that he had been ſtudious in a Book againſt Friends, called <hi>the Snake,</hi> and Friends greatly deſired he might have the Anſwer called <hi>the Switch,</hi> but knew not how to be ſo free with him as to offer it to him; I told Friends <hi>I would endeavour to make way for it.</hi> Altho' he had ſeemed to be a Man of few Words, yet at a ſuitable Interval I ſaid to him, <hi>I had heard that he had ſeen a Book called</hi> the Snake in the Graſs; he confeſſed <hi>he had.</hi> I deſired <hi>he would accept of</hi> the Anſwer, <hi>and be as ſtudious in it as he had been in</hi> the Snake; which he promiſed <hi>he would,</hi> and took the Book.</p>
               <p>There happened a Paſſage worthy of note, either in this or the preceeding Governor's Time in <hi>Virginia,</hi> as I was credibly informed, which was thus; The Governor wanted a Cooper to mend his Wine, Cider, and Ale Caſks, and ſome told him there was a Workman near, but he was a <hi>Quaker;</hi> he ſaid, if he was a Workman, he made no matter what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; ſo the Quaker, ſuch as he was, was ſent for, and came with his Hat under his Arm: The Governor was ſomewhat at a ſtand to ſee the Man come in after that Manner, and aſked, <hi>If he was the Cooper he had ſent for?</hi> He ſaid,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018158_0150_0FA561A4772A8F00"/>
                  <hi>Yes. Well,</hi> ſaid the Governor, <hi>are not you a</hi> Quaker? <hi>Yes,</hi> replied the Man, <hi>I am ſo called, but I have not been</hi> faithful. He then aſked, <hi>How long have you been called a</hi> Quaker? The poor Man ſaid, <hi>About twenty Years. Alas for you, poor Man!</hi> ſaid the Governor, <hi>I am ſorry for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may clearly ſee, that ſuch who walk moſt up to what they profeſs, are in moſt Eſteem among the more thinking and religious People; and the unfaithful and looſe libertine Profeſſors of the Truth are ſlighted, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be more and more caſt out as the <hi>unſavoury Salt,</hi> which is good for nought in Religion, and is indeed trodden under the Feet of Men; for a great Part of the Men in the World have ſuch an Underſtanding as to know what we profeſs, and alſo what we ſhould do and be in many Things; let us therefore walk wifely before all, and not be <hi>an Occaſion of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> nor <hi>give Offence</hi> either to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> nor to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> that ſo we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be <hi>as a City ſet upon a Hill, which cannot be hid;</hi> nay, that may not deſire to be hid, but rather that the Inhabitants of the Earth might ſee our good Works, and have an Occaſion from thence adminiſtred, <hi>to glorify the Father which is in Heaven.</hi>

               <p>I having it on my Mind to viſit a Meeting up the River called <hi>Perquimus</hi> on the Weſt Side of the great River <hi>Choptank,</hi> and I being on the Eaſt Side, <hi>Henry Hoſier</hi> and ſome more Friends ſet forward with me in a ſmall Boat, not in

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:018158_0152_0FA561A5F8316BF8"/>we had ſeen it in the Day, or ſteered by a Compaſs, neither of which we had the Benefit of for ſeveral Hours.</p>
               <p>Here we went aſhore and made a great Fire under the River's Cliff, and about Midnight the Moon roſe, and it cleared up and froze, and was very cold: My Companions falling aſleep, I turned them over, and pulled them from the Fire as it increaſed, and put them nearer as it failed, but could not keep them awake; I ſought Logs of Wood, and carried them to and minded the Fire, which was work enough for the remaining part of the Night; but Morning being come, we got into our cold icy Boat and ſailed away towards the Meeting. When we were come among Friends, Notice was given of a Stranger being there, and a heavenly and ſweet Meeting it was, ſo that we thought we had a good Reward for all our Trouble, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord now and for ever, for he is worthy: Although he may ſee good to try us, ſometimes one way and ſometimes another, how ſhould we know that we have any Faith, if it be not tried? How ſhall we know that we have any true Love to God, if it never be proved? The Trial of the true Believers Faith is more precious than Gold. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sayings of <hi>Job</hi> came into my Mind, <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: On the left Hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: He hideth himſelf on the right Hand, that I cannot ſee him,</hi> Job xxiii. 8, 9. And then
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018158_0153_0FA561A759B8A7E0"/>in Verſe the 10th, he, like a Man in the true Faith, ſaith, <hi>The Lord knoweth the Way that I take; and when he has tried me, I ſhall come forth as Gold:</hi> And the more vehement that the Fire is, the more it deſtroys the Droſs, and the more pure and weighty the Gold is, which hath paſt through the moſt ſevere Fires.

               <p>I had a Meeting when in <hi>Virginia,</hi> at a Friend's Houſe whoſe Name was <hi>Matthew Jordan,</hi> and ſomething which I ſaid in the Meeting, ſomewhat offended a young Woman a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and not having, as ſhe ſaid, a ſuitable Opportunity while I was there, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me, being buſy in her Maſter's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, (for ſhe was the Friend's Houſe-keeper) ſhe deſired Liberty of her Maſter to go to the next Meeting, that there ſhe might eaſe her Mind to me about the Offence I had given her in the firſt Meeting; (it was ſomething about <hi>Election,</hi> and they told me what it was, but not writing it down, it went from me) and accordingly ſhe came to the Meeting, where the Lord's mighty Power broke in upon us, to the tendring of many Hearts, to Friends mutal Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and it proved a good Day to the aforeſaid young Woman; her heart was as if it had melted within her, and ſhe ſhed many Tears, and I am ſatisfied went from the Meeting in Fear and in great Joy; in <hi>Fear,</hi> how to walk as not to offend Chriſt the <hi>Elect,</hi> which before ſhe could talk of, but now ſhe had met with, and he had

               <p>When ſhe returned to her Maſter's (before mentioned) he aſked her, <hi>If ſhe had got Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?</hi> meaning, had ſhe had any diſcourſe with me and was ſatisfied? She replied, <hi>She was ſatisfied.</hi> Some Time after I met with her in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> plain and Truth-like, but knew not who ſhe was at firſt. The Manner of the Working of the Truth is to humble the Creature, and bring it into Contrition, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Fear, with true Self-denial.</p>
               <p>I come now to mention ſometing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in my going over <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>River,</hi> towards a Yearly-meeting in <hi>Virginia:</hi> Alighting at an Inn by the River-ſide where we refreſhed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there was a poor little Child cried ſo exceedingly, that I was uneaſy to hear it, and aſked the Mother what was the matter? She ſaid, it had cried moſt of the Time ſince it was born, and they were almoſt off their Feet with it, or to that effect. I told her, I believed I could give the Child ſomething which would do good, and ſhe readily agreed to it, and I gave it a little of ſomething then, and ordered her to give it twice more in four or five Days
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:018158_0155_0FA561A82EB6D4F0"/>time: But when I returned, the Child was better, and oh! how glad the poor Woman was to ſee me, and ſpoke more in my Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations than was to my Satisfaction, and was kind to Friends afterward for my ſake.</p>
               <p>Now we came to ferry over the River, being, as I remember, five Horſes and nine People; there was <hi>Jane Pleaſant</hi> a publick Friend, and her Man-ſervant who rid before her upon a great Horſe, and high in Fleſh, and about the Midſt of the River, it being two Miles over, he roſe upon his hind Feet, and flung himſelf upon the Edge or Gunnel of the Boat, half into the River; the Fall of the Horſe, and the Motion of the other Horſes thereupon, cauſed the Boat to make ſuch Sallies that it took in Water, and was very likely to ſink: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could have Time to riſe again, or to make any more Springs, I took ſeveral young Men by the Shoulders, and flung them upon his Neck to keep him down, and told them, as faſt as I could, why I did ſo. Now I had to deal with the Ferry-man, who was about to ſtrip for ſwimming, and ſaid <hi>we ſhould all be drowned; but for his Part he could ſwim;</hi> and was about to leap into the River, <hi>for,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>the Boat would either break or ſink.</hi> I told him, <hi>It was ſoon enough for him to ſwim, when he ſaw the Boat either break or ſink, and if he would not row, then I would:</hi> With much Intreaty he took the Oar again and rowed us to the Shore. But in our imminent Danger I looked over my tender Friends, (for ſo they
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:018158_0156_0FA561A9E832B9C8"/>appeared to me) and thought in my Heart what a Pity it would be, if all theſe were drowned! yet the Thought of my own drowning never entered my Mind, until I was got over the River, which was a Mercy to me, and a great Means to keep out Diſorder and Confuſion, which commonly attend ſudden Surprizes and Frights, or elſe they make People dead-hearted and almoſt ſenſeleſs.</p>
               <p>As I had now an Occaſion to obſerve, as well as in ſome imminent Dangers I had ſeen before, where I happened to be, I find it an excellent thing to be, as much as we can, always ready, and by being frequently thinking upon Death, it is not ſo ſurpriſing when it does come: This is a great Point of true Wiſdom, <hi>to number our Days ſo, as to remember our latter End.</hi> The want of thus contemplating and truly thinking on what Preparation we are in to look Death in the Face, and to appear before the great Judge of both Quick and Dead, was the Cauſe of the Complaint, <hi>Oh! that my People were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter End.</hi> The great Remiſneſs of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations among People, beſpeaks Folly and great Inſenſibility, and that the Heart is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened through an Habit of ſinning; oh! that I might prevail with the Children of Men to awake. Ariſe, you that ſleep in Sin, and are at eaſe therein, that you may come to hear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the Call of the Son of God, that your Souls may not only live here to ſerve God, but alſo may live eternally in Bliſs with him, is the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:018158_0157_0FA561AAAD0BC0E8"/>Deſire of my Soul for the whole Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for my Life has often appeared not dear to me, in Compariſon of the ſaving of the Souls of the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>I have often thought of <hi>Moſes,</hi> how far he went for ſaving of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and how far <hi>Paul</hi> went for the ſaving of his Kinsfolk after the Fleſh; it was a great Demonſtration, that theſe great and good Men had great Faith and Intereſt in the Lord, and alſo a very great Love to his People; and ſuch whoſe Eyes are truly opened, cannot but ſee it is the Love of God, and Love to the Souls of Men, that conſtrains us thus to take our Lives as in our Hands, and labour under many weary Steps, and many Perils by Sea and by Land, and in the Wilderneſs, Cold and ſometimes in Tumults and Noiſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Watchings and Faſtings, that we have been ſometimes Spectacles to Men; but the Lord hath given us Faith and Patience to bear and overcome all, as we have ſingly ſtood in his heavenly Counſel, and been truly devoted to his Will in all Things.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to mention a particular thing which happened to me before I left <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> viz. Knowing that my Landlady, <hi>Samuel Bowne</hi>'s Wife, had a very ſore Breaſt, by which ſhe had much Trouble, and had no leſs than five Tents in it, and ſhe being a ſenſible and a ſerviceable Woman, ſomething came with a Concern upon my Mind to adminiſter unto her Breaſt, with a Belief, <hi>it would heal her:</hi> I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned about it until I had got one Foot into the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:018158_0158_0FA561AB30429D40"/>Stirrup for mounting my Horſe, but I grew uneaſy for being dilatory in doing that which came into my Mind; ſo I went in again and ſaid, <hi>Mary, I am come back to adviſe thee what thou ſhouldſt do, by which, I believe</hi> thou wilt be healed, <hi>although I cannot ſtay to ſee it done. I believe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and intend to follow thy Advice;</hi> but aſked, <hi>what would become of all thoſe Tents?</hi> I told her, <hi>the Poultice would draw them all out and give her Eaſe;</hi> and accordingly I heard it did, for ſhe ſlept twelve Hours immediately after the Time of the Application, and when ſhe awoke the Tents were all drawn out, and ſhe had little further Trouble with it: So it is good to mind Truth and the Workings of it in all Things. I met with the great Doctor (as he was eſteemed) who had it under hand, and he ſaid <hi>I was a bold Fellow:</hi> I ſaid, <hi>it proved well.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>it was well for me it did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something more which I have before omitted occurs to my Memory: When I was in that Part of <hi>Virginia</hi> towards <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> to viſit Friends, a very great Miſt aroſe, and we went wrong, until the Guides were ſo far loſt, that they confeſt, they knew not Eaſt from Weſt, nor on which Hand we had left the Road, although it was in the fore Part of the Day, but neither Wind or Sun to be felt or ſeen; then I told them, <hi>I would try what I could do, if they did but know what Quarter we ſhould go to:</hi> They ſaid, <hi>we ſhould go towards the South;</hi> then I brought out my little Compaſs which I had made before I left <hi>England,</hi> and took it in
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:018158_0159_0FA561ABE8E1D200"/>my Hand and ſteered by it, till we all came into the Road; for that inward Senſe I had did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me, that we were to the Weſtward of the Road, ſo leaning a little to the Eaſtward of the South Point, we came right as before, and when ſo, the Guides much rejoiced, and ſaid, <hi>I was fitter to be Guide in a Wilderneſs Country than they.</hi> My Compaſs was not ſo big as a Tailor's Thimble, which had often been of Uſe to me, and others with me.</p>
               <p>Now the Time came on for my leaving all my near and dear Friends in thoſe Parts, and I embarked for the Iſlands the Sixth of the Ninth Month, 1702, with my Companion <hi>James Bates,</hi> on board of a Sloop, <hi>Samuel Salter</hi> Maſter, for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and we put into <hi>Bermudas</hi> in our way: Soon after we landed, being on the 21ſt of the ſame Month, we were ſent for by Governor <hi>Bennett</hi> to come before him, and being near his Door, a Man came and clapt me on the Shoulder, as we were walking on our way, and ſaid roughly to us, <hi>You muſt go before the Governor,</hi> and ſeemed to haſten us: I replied meekly, <hi>I am willing to go as faſt as I can, but I have been very Sea-ſick, and can go but weakly:</hi> The Man fell from his Roughneſs, and bid us take Time, and carried himſelf very civilly to us, and put us by a Man who was keeping Centry at the Governor's Door with his Muſket on his Arm, and when we were come into a large Room the Man left us, and we ſtaying a while, I began to reaſon in myſelf, <hi>What if the Governor ſhould be a rigid Man and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:018158_0160_0FA561ACAFBBBA00"/>be ſevere to us, and either confine or puniſh us?</hi> But I ſaid in my Heart, <hi>Lord, thou that knoweſt all Things, knoweſt that I have not only offered up my Liberty, but Life alſo, for thy Name and Goſpel's ſake!</hi> and immediately all the Fear and Reaſonings about human Power was taken away from me.</p>
               <p>I being not well, and weary with walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Ship, ſate down to reſt myſelf unbidden, when there came a friendly well carriaged young Woman, who I ſuppoſed to be a Servant, and ſpoke kindly to us; I deſired her to do as much for us as to give us ſomething that was ſmall to drink, for we were very thirſty and had been much out of Health, and were not well recovered ſince we came from the Sea, having had rough Weather: She brought us Wine and Water, and a Thing to mix them in; ſo taking moſt of a Glaſs of Water, and a very little Wine poured into it, I drank and was very well refreſhed. By this Time the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor called us into an upper Room, and as I came near to the Top of the Stairs, going but faintly, for Reaſons before given, the Governor put forth his Hand and reached to take hold of mine, and like a tender Father drew me up, and led me along towards a great Window, and ſtood and looked on me and ſaid, <hi>He believed he knew what I was, and my Buſineſs too.</hi> I replied, <hi>it might be ſo,</hi> and aſked, <hi>if he was the Governor of that Place?</hi> He ſaid <hi>he was,</hi> and bowed his Head. I then ſpoke to him in the Love of God and ſaid, <hi>Thy Countenance beſpeaks
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:018158_0161_0FA561AD71773928"/>Moderation, and the Apoſtle ſaid,</hi> Let your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration appear to all Men, for the Lord is at hand; and it was with me to ſay to him, <hi>The Lord of Heaven and Earth bleſs thee and all thine.</hi> He bade us ſit down, and gave us each a Glaſs of Wine, and enquired <hi>from whence we came?</hi> I told him <hi>my Home was in</hi> Old England, <hi>but it was long ſince I was there; my Companion's was in</hi> Virginia. He wanting to know the Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> I told him, <hi>There was a Merchant belonging to the ſame Ship that we did, who was lately come from</hi> Europe, <hi>and I thought was a Man of Parts and Memory, and well verſed in the Affairs of thoſe Parts of the World, and when we came into this Place he was with us:</hi> The Governor then ſent for him, and when he came, he anſwered his Expectation in reſolving all or moſt of his Queſtions, for the Knowledge of the News appeared to me to be the young Man's Talent. Having done with and diſmiſſed him, he ſaid, <hi>he muſt now have ſome Diſcourſe with us:</hi> Then roſe up all the great Men who were with the Governor, to make way that I might come near him. I ſaid, <hi>If it was the Governor's Mind, I had rather ſit where I was, for I ſate well in the Air, and that ſuited well with my preſent Weakneſs:</hi> So he bade them all ſit down, and they did ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I want to know the Reaſons why you, as a People, where you live, do not aſſiſt the King and Country with Men and Arms, for their and your own Defence and Safety, againſt all that may attempt or endeavour your
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:018158_0162_0FA561B0829BDCA8"/>Hurt?</hi> I replied, <hi>The moſt convincing Reaſons I have to offer to the Governor are, We have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Precept <hi>nor</hi> Example <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>or his</hi> Apoſtle, <hi>to uſe the Sword to hurt one another withal. No,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what then means that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour, when he bade him</hi> that had not a Sword, fell his Cloak or Coat and buy one? I replied, <hi>One of his Diſciples anſwered and ſaid,</hi> Lord, here are two; <hi>Chriſt ſaid</hi> It is enough. <hi>Now how two Swords can be enough to anſwer for a genenal Precept, I leave the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and all theſe Men to judge.</hi> So after a little Pauſe he ſaid, <hi>In caſe you was aſſaulted by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that would break your Houſe, and take what they could get from you; or upon the Highway, and would take your Purſe or Horſe, what would you do in that Caſe?</hi> I replied, <hi>I could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly anſwer what I ſhould do in ſuch a Caſe, becauſe through the Lord's Mercy I was never yet ſo aſſaulted; but it appears moſt likely, that I ſhould endeavour to keep my Houſe from being broken up, and yet withal be tender of</hi> Men's Lives: And as to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:018158_0163_0FA561B137110BC0"/>Lord; <hi>you ſay very well;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he hoped what he had offered had not given any Offence.</hi> I replied, <hi>It was ſo far from that, we were glad he was ſo free with us; yet if he pleaſed to diſmiſs us, we ſhould be willing to be going, for Night came on.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>There were ſome of our Friends would be glad to ſee us:</hi> I replied, <hi>I underſtood there were ſome further on the Iſland that did own us, but how much they were of us I could not tell, for I had not ſeen any of them.</hi> He aſked, whether we had a mind to go by Water or by Land, for he had a Boat, and a couple of Hands ſhould carry us where we would; or if we had a Deſire to ride, he had two Horſes, we might take them and keep them as long as we ſtaid upon the Iſland. I endeavoured to perſuade him to let us go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling himſelf any further, for I was ſenſible of his good Will and Love to us, and having his Countenance, was more than we expected, and as much as we deſired.

<pb n="159" facs="unknown:018158_0164_0FA561B2A39DC858"/>fatigued at Sea, of which I was not yet well. He immediately gave Orders for the Horſes to be brought to the Door, which being done, and we having Notice thereof, I roſe up and made an Offer to go, and the Governor likewiſe roſe up and came and took me by the Hand, and ſo we went down the large Stairs into the great Room where we firſt entered in the Lord's Dread and holy Fear.

               <p>Now coming to take Horſe, I looked out at the Door and ſaw two Horſes, and a Man hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them beyond the Pavement, and the Centry as before in the Street, and the Horſe next the Door, which I ſuppoſed I was to ride on, had a Saddle on the Back of it ſet about with three Rows of ſhining Silver Lace, I thought about two Inches broad each: The Governor holding me by the Hand and looking in my Face, its not unlikely but he might think, as I uſed to ſay, <hi>I looked very ſheepiſhly at it.</hi> He ſaid to me, I am apt to think you are not uſed to ride upon ſuch a Saddle as this; I told him, if he could let me have one more like myſelf (plain) without much Trouble, I ſhould like it the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:018158_0165_0FA561B2B40D4D58"/>better, but if not, I could ride on it, I thought without much Straitneſs, in caſe of Neceſſity. He anſwered, he could not, for Horſes and Saddles too were ſcarce on that Iſland, for the one was that which he rid on, and the other was for his Man; but he ſaid, he would tell me how to prevent all this: If, ſaid he, you get over the Inlet of Water, though he queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it, becauſe the Wind blew very ſtrong in the Mouth or Inlet of the River; but, he ſaid, he ſpoke not this to hinder our taking his Horſes, but if we got over, he ſaid we ſhould come to <hi>Richard Stafford</hi>'s, an old Judge of Life and Death, and might aſk there for the Cover for his Saddle, which ties on with little Straps at each Corner and hides all this, and then it will be like yourſelf; but if the Ferry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays he cannot carry the Horſes over, what Man ſoever you meet, white or black, if capable, tell him he muſt bring me my Horſes, he dares do no other but bring them; and be ſure you take no further Thought for them: And if we met with any thing in his Liberty that might trouble us, let him but know and he would help it, if it lay in his Power, and ſo with his Bleſſing on us, we took leave of him and came to the Water-ſide, but could not get the Horſes over, therefore ſent them back again, and intended to have ſtaid at the Ferry-houſe all Night, but the Boat was about going over as we lighted; and Notice being got ſome way or other to the Judge's Ear, that there were two Strangers on the other Side of the Water,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:018158_0166_0FA561B375D3E458"/>he had ſent a Boat and a couple of Men for us, who ſaid we muſt go, for the Judge ſaid, he could not ſleep until we came; whatſoever the matter is, we know not, ſaid they: So we went, after aſking if they at the Ferry-houſe had been at any Coſt or Trouble on our Account in providing Supper, for as yet we had not eaten any thing ſince we landed; the People ſaid no, they had not done any thing which we ſhould pay for: It grew dark and very ſtormy, and the Sea broke over the Boat, ſo that ſome of us were forced to hold our Coat Laps one to touch another on the Weather Side, to keep out the Breakers of the Waves, that they might not fill the Boat, and we came ſafe over to the Judge's Houſe, and no ſooner got into the Paſſage but his friendly Wife met us, and aſked us, <hi>If we were the Strangers her Husband had ſent for?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>We are Strangers.</hi> She bid us follow her to the Judge, and we did ſo. When we came to him he roſe up, and took the Candle in his Hand and ſaid, <hi>Are you the Strangers that I have ſent for?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Who thou mayſt expect I know not, but we are Strangers.</hi> When he had looked well in my Face, he ſet down the Candle and ſaid, <hi>What a Mercy is this, that the Lord ſhould ſend Men from I know not where, in his Love to viſit me!</hi> and took me in his Arms and kiſſed me; and I ſaid to him, <hi>The Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth bleſs thee;</hi> and we ſhed many Tears and wept together.</p>
               <p>As I entred the Houſe, I felt the Love of God, and his Glory, I thought, ſhone in and filled
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018158_0167_0FA561B432C7E0C0"/>every Room as I paſſed through them, and I ſaid, <hi>Peace be to this Place,</hi> and I felt it was ſo. He enquired of our Travels, and from whence we came, of which we gave him a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; he alſo aſked if I knew any thing of the Family of <hi>Staffords</hi> at <hi>Lahorn</hi> near <hi>Haver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordweſt</hi> in <hi>South Wales?</hi> I told him all I knew about them, both of the Dead and of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; with which he was pleaſed, and ſaid, <hi>He had not heard of them many Years, and that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were his near Kindred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the Judge was ſomewhat troubled with the Gout, I found his uſual Bed-time drew near, and I made an Offer to go away leſt I ſhould diſcommode him, yet he appeared unwilling to part with us; but conſidering his own Ailments and our early Riſing in the Morning, he at length conſented: But before we parted, his Wife aſked leave of him to go with us on the Morrow to the Meeting, to which he readily aſſented, if he was not worſe of his Diſtemper, and then ordered how we ſhould ride, and which Negro ſhould go, not only to help his Wife but us alſo, and take our Horſes when there was occaſion, and do any thing he could for us; and indeed ſo he did, and appeared to me to run on his Feet without much Trouble, being a lively young Man.</p>
               <p>I omitted before, that the Judge aſked, <hi>If we had ſeen the Governor,</hi> and <hi>if he was kind to us?</hi> I told him he was very friendly to us, and ſaid, <hi>If we met with any Trouble in his Liberty that he could help us in, only let him know and he
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:018158_0168_0FA561B4FB65E308"/>would right us.</hi> The Judge ſaid, <hi>It was very well, and he was glad of it.</hi> I perceived the Judge was rather a Moderator of the Governor, he being an ancient wiſe Man, and had lived long as a Judge upon the Iſland, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (it is like) more fully the State of Things there than the Governor could be capable of, he being but a young Man, altho' he appeared to be a wiſe Man, and, as <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid, came of an ancient and honourable Family in <hi>England,</hi> which he knew very well, whoſe Name was <hi>Bennett.</hi> Afterwards I told <hi>William Penn</hi> how it had fared with us on that Iſland, and eſpecially the Kindneſs of the two chief Men in Power there, and <hi>William Penn</hi> wept, and ſaid, <hi>He had not heard any Account of this Nature, that he had been ſo much affected with, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered theſe many Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we left the Judge until the Morning, and got ſome ſmall Refreſhment, it being late, and I had been faint for ſeveral Hours for want of eating, but the Lord's heavenly Power bore me up over all, ſo that at Times I felt no want of any thing: Oh! Renowned over all be the Name of the Mighty God, now and for ever. We went to Bed, and when Morning came, I with my Companion were ſtirring early, having eight Miles to the Meeting, and it being in the latter End of the Ninth Month, we were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be in ſuch Time, that we might give ſome Notice to the People. I was walking in our Lodging Room early, and the Judge's Wife came to the Door and aſked, <hi>if ſhe might ſpeak
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:018158_0169_0FA561B5A82E6850"/>with us?</hi> I ſaid <hi>ſhe might;</hi> then ſhe came in and ſaid, <hi>She had a Meſſage from her Husband to us;</hi> I queried, <hi>what it was,</hi> She ſaid, <hi>He deſired we would come and pray for him before we went away.</hi> I deſired ſhe would favour us ſo much as to lay before her Huſband ſomething which I had to ſay, and ſhe promiſed ſhe would: <hi>Well then, tell the Judge, that if he will ſuffer us to come into his Room, and ſit down and wait upon the Lord, as our Manner is in ſuch a Caſe as this, if it pleaſe the Lord to move us by his Holy Spirit to pray, we may; but if not, let not the Judge take it amiſs, for we are willing to be at the Lord's diſpoſing in all Things.</hi> She went, and I believe, as ſhe ſaid, laid the Matter before him as I had delivered it to her; for ſhe was a Woman of a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and came back again to us in a very little Time: I aſked, <hi>what the Judge ſaid?</hi> She replied, he ſaid, <hi>Let the Men take their own Way, and whether they pray for me or not, I believe they are Men of God:</hi> So after ſome little reſpite, we being brought to the Judge's Bed-ſide, ſat down and waited upon the Lord, who was pleaſed in his Love and by his mighty Power to break in upon us, and alſo opened my Mouth in his Gift of Grace and of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which Gift, ardent and fervent Cries went up to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he would ſend Health and Salvation to the Judge, and alſo to all his Family, and to all People far and near, that all every where might repent, and come to the Knowledge of the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:018158_0170_0FA561B777AFFF28"/>Truth and be ſaved. The Judge wept aloud; and a mighty Viſitation it was to his Family, and eſpecially to himſelf and his tender Wife. We left the Judge in a fine Frame of Spirit, and no doubt near the Kingdom, having his Bleſſing and earneſt Requeſt, that when we could reach his Houſe we would not fail to come to it, for we were very welcome; and I found and felt it ſo, and it was moſtly our Lodgings: His Wife and Foot-Page went with us to all the Meetings, except one, while we were on the Iſland, which was about two Weeks, in which Time we had many good Opportunities among a ſober behaved and well carriaged People, amongſt whom we met with no Oppoſition, but had large quiet Meetings.</p>
               <p>When we were clear, as we thought, of the Iſland, we went to take our ſolid Leaves of the Governor, acknowledging his Civility and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to us Strangers, and I told him and the Judge, <hi>That they would not want their Reward for what they had done to us, and ſuch who ſhould take their Lives as in their Hands, and come in the Love of God to viſit theſe remote Parts of the World, which we durſt not have undertaken if we had not believed it required of us by the Almighty, and our Peace concerned in it, as alſo the Glory of God, and the Good of the Children of Men; theſe are the Motives to thoſe our great Undertakings:</hi> or Words to that Purpoſe. So we parted in much Love with theſe great Men, eſpecially the Judge, with Tears on his Face, as alſo his tender and friendly Wife, who had been very
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:018158_0171_0FA561B8DDD9E438"/>ſerviceable to us in ordering Meetings and making Way for us, and none like her in all the Iſland, that we met withal, ſhe being given up to that Service, for the encouraging Truth and Friends in what ſhe was capable of.</p>
               <p>Being invited to a Friend's Houſe to dine one Day, when we were ſat down at the Table, the Woman of the Houſe deſired <hi>that one of us would ſay Grace;</hi> from which I took an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew her, and ſeveral more in the Company, who appeared not much more grown in the Truth than ſhe, <hi>that ſince we had been a People, we had both believed</hi> (and accordingly practiſed) <hi>that</hi> true Prayer <hi>was not performed without the</hi> Help of the holy Spirit of God, <hi>and no man could pray</hi> aright <hi>and</hi> acceptably <hi>without it; nor was it in Man's Power to have it</hi> when he pleaſed; <hi>therefore it is Man's place to wait upon the Lord for the</hi> pouring forth of this Gift <hi>upon him, and alſo to know whether it</hi> be required of him to pray, <hi>ſo as to be heard by Man, or only to pray</hi> ſecretly, <hi>ſo as to be heard of God, as did</hi> Hannah <hi>and many more have done; which, as they do aright, no doubt, but as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples,</hi> their Father will hear them in ſecret, and reward them openly; or to this Effect: With which they all appeared ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>We then went on board our Veſſel, and ſet ſail with a fair Wind for the Eaſt End of the Iſland in order for <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> but ſoon after we got out to the Mouth of that Inlet where we arrived firſt, the Wind came full againſt us, and we put in there again; and the Maſter, altho' not called one of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:018158_0172_0FA561B9A54E8D68"/>us, ſaid in a friendly manner, <hi>What is the matter now? this is along of you, Mr.</hi> Richardſon (as he was pleaſed to call me, altho' I oft ſhewed my Diſlike to it) <hi>you have ſomething to do yet on the Iſland.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I knew not of any thing;</hi> but he ſeemed poſitive, and withal ſaid, <hi>if the Wind came fair at Midnight he would call if I was willing; if not, he would ſtay as long as I pleaſed.</hi> I ſaid, I knew not of any thing to hinder, but he might call as ſoon as the Wind came fair. So we parted, only giving him an Account, that we intended to go for the Judge's Houſe. It was late in the Evening when we got there, and the Judge was gone to Bed; but his Wife was up, who lifted up her Hands with more than ordinary Surprize, and much Joy, and ſaid, <hi>She was always glad to ſee me, but never more than now:</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Why ſo?</hi> She then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell, how that ſince I went away, there had been a Man with the Judge, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed him againſt me all that ever he could, and ſaid, <hi>He knew me in</hi> England, <hi>and that I was broke, and came into thoſe Parts to preach for a Living.</hi> I aſked, <hi>what her Huſband ſaid to all that?</hi> She ſaid, his Anſwer was to the Man, <hi>that he believed I was no ſuch Perſon, but an honeſt Man;</hi> yet the Accuſer ſeemed very poſitive. I ſaid, <hi>It would be well if this Man could be brought with me to the Judge's Face, that he might he convinced, not only of the Man's Ignorance of us as a People, but of me in particular, and his Envy againſt me be made known;</hi> upon which I opened to her the caſe of ſuch Journeys and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:018158_0173_0FA561BA438CBCB8"/>Services, how we proceeded, and how the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were conſtituted in which we did ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and from whence we had Certificates, from Monthly, Quarterly, or Meetings of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to which we belonged, and from Friends in the ſeveral Provinces and Iſlands where we travelled, if we deſired them, many of which I could ſhew the Judge if Time would admit; but ſhe ſaid, leſt we ſhould be called away in haſte, ſhe craved to ſee ſome of thoſe Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates: I ſhewed her them, beginning at the firſt, wherein Friends of <hi>Kelk,</hi> now <hi>Bridlington</hi> Monthly-meeting in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> to Friends in <hi>America,</hi> ſhewed not only their full Unity with this my preſent Journey, but alſo with my Service for the Truth, and Converſation to the ſame, where I had lived and travelled; and that I had ſettled my outward Affairs to Friends Satisfaction, under many Hands vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly writ.</p>
               <p>When this great and wiſe Woman ſaw this, ſhe ſaid, <hi>it was enough;</hi> but I ſhewed her other Certificates from divers Places, wherein Friends had ſignified ſufficiently their Unity and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with me. I likewiſe informed her, that in caſe any Man, not approved by us as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, did take upon him to impoſe his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any who were Strangers to him, ſuch as knew him took care to acquaint the Churches therewith, if his Intentions could be known, that no Impoſtor might do any hurt: All which ſhe admired, and ſaid <hi>ſhe had never heard ſo much before, neither did ſhe think there
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:018158_0174_0FA561BB06BA4A40"/>had been ſuch excellent Orders in the World amongſt any People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus acquainted her with our Order and Diſcipline, and afterwards informed her of the Cauſe of our unexpected Return, I renewed my Propoſal of having my Accuſer before the Judge; ſhe told me, ſhe had good place with her Huſband, and would endeavour to obtain it: And accordingly, after talking with him, ſhe let me know, that the Judge expreſſed his Readineſs to do me any Service which lay in his Power, and was of Opinion, my Accuſer durſt not face either him or me in that Affair; but that if the Wind continued againſt us, he would try to find him out and bring him, which might be of Service; but if the Wind favoured, ſhe thought I might be eaſy to go; as indeed I was, and the more ſo, conſidering that our Captain <hi>Salter,</hi> who lived near the Judge on the ſame Iſland, had ſhewed a great deal of Patience and good Diſpoſition to us-ward for about two Weeks, yet would gladly be gone; ſo about Mid-night we were called to go on board the Ship, for the Wind was fair, if we were ready; I replied, <hi>we come quickly,</hi> and ſo we did, and took leave of all we ſaw of the Family, and remembered our dear Love, with grateful Acknowledgments to the Judge, for all his Civility and Kindneſſes he had done to us, with Reaſons why we could not ſee him, for he had been afflicted for ſome time with the Gout, and was now fallen into ſome Reſt, and we going very early away, were not at our own Diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:018158_0175_0FA561BBB42B7800"/>
I admired the Lord's good Providence in all this, and there was ſomething of a Reach from the ſame watchful Providence, to order that to be put into my Certificate which did ſo fully remove that Slur this Enemy would have faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon me, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that <hi>I broke in</hi> England, <hi>and could not pay my Debts,</hi> and therefore was come into theſe remote Parts of the World, where I was unknown, <hi>to preach for a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> but the contrary fully appeared, that I was known and well beloved too, and had Effects to diſcharge any juſt Demand upon me, bleſſed be the worthy Name of the Lord now and for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I may ſay ſomething of our Affairs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea in this Voyage: When Captain <hi>Salter</hi> had taken us in Paſſengers at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> it being a time of War, and People ſomewhat affraid of ſhipping Goods, he ſaid he was to have two honeſt <hi>Quakers</hi> Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and he did not fear being taken by Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers nor Pirates. I was troubled at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in us, and told him ſo, and that it was much if the Lord did not ſuffer us to be taken, that he might ſee Men were not to be depended upon, but that we ought to depend upon the Lord alone for Protection and Deliverance: However, in much leſs time than was expected, Goods came, and we were loaded and gone. We had rough Weather before we came to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> (I have given an Account of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas</hi>) eſpecially about the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> we had very high Winds, and I was extreamly
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:018158_0176_0FA561BC8BA13FC8"/>Sea-ſick, and ſo was my Companion, and I could eat little, but was treated with remarkable Civilities by the Captain; for in and about that Latitude there are Fiſh not unlike Herrings, which fly from Wave to Wave, and by dipping their Fins or Wings in the Water, they will fly a great Way, eſpecially when they are chaſed by Fiſhes of Prey, and almoſt every Morning there were of thoſe Fiſhes found on the Ship's Deck; and the Captain oft ſaid, as his manner was, Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> theſe are ſent for you, or for your Breakfaſt, and ſeeing it is ſo, I will dreſs them myſelf, for I know, ſaid he, my Cook is ſo greaſy you can hardly eat of his Cookery, which was very true; and therefore he would waſh his Hands, and lay a clean Napkin on his Arm, and tell me he would dreſs me my Breakfaſt on the beſt Faſhion he could. I aſked him, <hi>why he would put himſelf to ſo much Trouble?</hi> He ſaid, he never waited on a Man in all his Life with ſo much Pleaſure, and if I were going into any Country where he was going, I ſhould not pay any thing for my Paſſage; ſo much Reſpect he ſhewed to me.</p>
               <p>Now it happened in the Courſe of this Voyage, when we were within a few Leagues of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> one Morning early as ſoon as Day appeared, he that was aloft (upon the Watch to look out, as the manner of Mariners is, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Times of Wars and Danger) eſpied a Ship which he and the reſt of our moſt
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:018158_0177_0FA561BD2689A190"/>knowing Men ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Frigate, of conſiderable Strength; however, it was a great Veſſel, and appeared to have a great many Guns: When we firſt ſaw her, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be within Gun-ſhot. But Oh what a Surprize and Fright our Ship's Crew were in! I had not often ſeen the like. Our Veſſel being deep loaded, although a good Sailer, was leſs than that which chaſed us, and to run for it appeared the only way for us to eſcape, hauling as cloſe to the Wind as we could to keep the Sails full; and the Veſſel being ſtiff with its great Burthen, endured Sail well, and indeed they crowded ſo much Sail, that I told them I feared they would bring the Rigging by the board; ſo thus we laboured until Noon, and then our Captain had loſt all his Confidence in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſaid we ſhall be taken, for the Ship has gained upon us for ſeveral Hours, and we have done what we can, and are all ſpent: I walked upon the Main-deck under no ſmall Concern of Mind, and Truth roſe, and I found it open in the Truth, <hi>that we ſhould not be taken:</hi> The Captain ſaid, binding it with ſome Aſſeverations, we ſhall certainly be taken. I ſaid, <hi>No, we ſhall not, unleſs by our Miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</hi> Alas! ſaid he, you are ſuch a Man as I never met withal; do not you ſee the Frigate or <hi>Sallee-man,</hi> for that he called her, is juſt going to fire a Broad-ſide at us, opening the Gun Ports, and laying the Ship broad Side upon us, and levelling at her as well as they can?
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:018158_0178_0FA561C00140E858"/>And indeed our Captain, altho' he was a ſtout Man, yet appeared very ghaſtly and dead-hearted, and ſaid (in a Tone which beſpoke both Affliction and Trouble) to me, Go into my Cabbin, or ſome where under the Deck, for they will fire immediately; and that where I walked I could hardly eſcape either the Shot or the Rigging falling upon me. I ſaid, <hi>they will not ſire; and deſired him to be eaſy, for we ſhould come to no Damage by that Ship.</hi> Well then, he aſked what they ſhould do, for the Enemy was juſt upon us? I ſaid, <hi>I would fetch them a Bottle or two, or more of my beſt Brandy, and they ſhould take as much as might do them good; but have a Care of more, and ply away a while, and you will ſee they will fall back, and we ſhall leave them.</hi> The Captain ſaid, although there was no human Probability of eſcaping, yet for my Sake they would try, and to work they went. I think I never ſaw Men on board of any Ship work like them for ſome Hours, and we ſoon perceived we outſailed them, and by the time it began to be dark we had left them conſiderably.</p>
               <p>Now all Fire and Light was forbidden, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what could not be avoided, and all Noiſe, and a Council was held, to conſult what Way to ſteer, whether the neareſt or moſt common way for the Iſland, or about; for it was reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conclude the Adverſary would way-lay us, if he could, before we came to the Iſland; and the Captain ſaid, what I ſaid in the Caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould be done: After ſome Deliberation I told
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:018158_0179_0FA561C11FF7EA08"/>him, <hi>I was moſt eaſy in ſteering the neareſt Courſe,</hi> which we did, and ſaw our Adverſary no more.</p>
               <p>We came to the Iſland next Day in much Joy, that we had eſcaped ſo imminent a Danger, but I was very ill in a Fever when I landed, which had been growing upon me for ſeveral Days, (this being the Sixth-day of the Week, and 18th of the Tenth Month) I was ſo poorly, that ſeveral thought I muſt die; but I ſtood reſigned in the Will of God, whether to die or live. The Firſt-day being come, I went to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though with great Difficulty, being very weak, where I ſat under more than uſual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, Reaſonings, and Conflict of Spirit for ſome time, about my preſent Condition, which was weak and low, and in my own Apprehenſion, unlikely to be of any Service, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Troubles and Hazards of the Sea and Robbers, and other Jeopardies in coming here, I was now thus diſabled and laid by as uſeleſs. Theſe Things were an Occaſion to me to conſider, whether I had not miſt my Way in ſomething or other? Many particulars were brought to my Mind, whether I had diſcharged myſeif faithfully where I had been? and when I looked back and took a View of my paſt Travels and Services in the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and Diſcipline of the Church, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and whole Converſation, I ſaw nothing but I was clear of the Blood of all Men; as alſo clear and well ſatisfied both as to the Time of my coming, as well as to the Coming itſelf
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:018158_0180_0FA561C1A9184380"/>unto this Iſland. There appeared yet two Things in my way; <hi>Firſt,</hi> if this Place ſhould be my Grave, ſuch as might not watch over me with the beſt Eye may ſay, <hi>If he had gone at the Lord's Command, no doubt but he would have brought him back again;</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> as I had <hi>two little Children in</hi> England, <hi>if I finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Courſe here, they would be left Fatherleſs and Motherleſs,</hi> And I ſaid before the Lord, <hi>Let not my End bring Diſhonour to thy great Name, nor any Blemiſh to the Truth which I have loved, and laboured for the Promotion of from my Childhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I had thus, or to this Purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Lord, I felt great Quietneſs and Reſignation of Mind; and as I thus ſat, a Friend, well thought on by ſeveral, began to ſpeak in the Meeting, and it opened in my Mind, that he was not wholly redeemed from having ſome Thoughts, that <hi>elementary Water</hi> had not yet ended its Service; I mean in Point of <hi>Dipping:</hi> I would have ſhut it out, for the Man appeared a wiſe, zealous Man; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether a Stranger, could not remember I had heard of his Name, yet the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and I thought, for my own Satisfaction I might aſk him the Queſtion: If he was a right ſpirited Friend, he would not be hurt; if he was not, he ſtood in Need of Help, or at leaſt it was high time for Friends to have a more perfect Knowledge of him. So I leave this a while, and return to the other Part of the Meeting, which was very remarkable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="unknown:018158_0181_0FA561C2706F5678"/>
During my ſitting, as before, under much Weakneſs of Body, yet quiet in Mind, the living Virtue or heavenly Power of Chriſt ſprang up in my inward Man, like healing and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling Oil, which ſo effectually helped me every way, that I could ſay feelingly and experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Miracles are not ceaſed;</hi> for I was raiſed beyond my own Expectation, and all others who knew my weak State, to give Teſtimony to the glorious Coming and Manifeſtation of Chriſt in Power, Spirit, Life, Light, and Grace, for the Help, Health, and Salvation of all the Children of Men who receive, believe in, and obey his ſpiritual Knocks, Reproofs, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Calls in the Soul, without any Leſſening to his <hi>Humanity:</hi> Great Cauſe have I, with all the Living, to love, value, honour and reverence the great and mighty Name of him who hath helped and healed, by ſending his eternal Word of living Power into our Hearts.</p>
               <p>Returning with other Friends to my Quarters from this good Meeting (not to be forgotten by me) came the before-mentioned Friend to ſee me; and I having, as I told him, a Deſire to ſpeak privately with him, he replied, there were none there but his good Friends, and I might ſpeak my Mind. I told him, what I had to ſay related chiefly to himſelf, and in ſuch a matter as he might not be willing to have it expoſed; but he would not hear, and ſaid, I might ſpeak it there. I deſired he would not take an Offence at what I had to ſay, for I did ſuppoſe it to be a Secret to all there but himſelf;
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:018158_0182_0FA561C3EA3F8D40"/>and then I ſaid, the matter is, When thou waſt ſpeaking in the Meeting, it ſounded in the Ear of my Soul as if one had ſaid, <hi>This Man</hi> (meaning thee) <hi>is not wholly redeemed out of a Belief in</hi> John's <hi>Miniſtration of Water, as not having done its Work.</hi> Now the Matter is before thee, thou knoweſt whether what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived be true or falſe: In the firſt place I enquire for my own Satisfaction. His Anſwer, if it may be called one, was as followeth; he ſaid, <hi>The Diſciples of Chriſt, when they baptized with Water, knew that it was the Mind of their great Maſter that they ſhould ſo baptize:</hi> I ſaid, I know not that any of the Apoſtles did ever ſay ſo much as thou wouldſt inſinuate; for both by what <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, it appears very natural to be the Mind of Chriſt, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to ſo much as was done by the Apoſtles in that of Water, becauſe of the Peoples Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and no Queſtion but the <hi>Jews</hi> were very much ſettled in the Belief of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's Diſpenſation of Water to Repentance, and alſo of the Circumciſion and Purifying, and many other Things uſed amongſt that People: Now <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Converts were grown ſtronger in the Faith and in the Grace of God, told them, <hi>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> although he did once in Condeſcention circumciſe Timothy, yet told the People at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, that <hi>Neither Circumciſion nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, but a new Creature;
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:018158_0183_0FA561C4B4F0FE68"/>and if they were circumciſed, Chriſt would proſit them nothing;</hi> and he alſo thanks God, <hi>he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized no more than</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>and the Houſhold of</hi> Stephanus; <hi>beſides theſe, he knew not that he had baptized any other, for Chriſt ſent him not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> And I am, as I ſaid to the Friend, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Mind when he ſaid, <hi>The Elements ſhould melt as with ſervent Heat:</hi> If the <hi>Goſpel Power</hi> be not this <hi>fervent Heat,</hi> I know not what is, nor what is able to melt away the <hi>Elements.</hi> But I further ſaid, if he was a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> he ſhould deal plainly and honeſtly with Friends, and tell them what he was, and not preach one thing, and keep ſuch Reſerves to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Friends admired, and ſaid, they had not the leaſt Thought of any ſuch Thing by him; ſo he ſaid, he would not fall out with me. I told him, I was as much for Peace as he was, but at the ſame Time I would have us to mind that we were <hi>ſound in the Faith,</hi> and Preachers of the Goſpel, and not go back again into the <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> for what is all in compariſon of the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I had good Service and great Satisfaction upon this Iſland, although I found Truth ſo low, that it might then be truly ſaid as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, <hi>By whom ſhall</hi> Jacob, or the true Seed, <hi>ariſe,</hi> which is in our Apprehenſions but ſmall, and much preſſed down with the many Things that are hurtful, eſpecially by the Love of Money, Pride, and Forgetfulneſs of God?</p>

                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:018158_0184_0FA561C567B43328"/>
I was invited on board a great tranſport Ship, whereof one <hi>Reed</hi> was Maſter, who remembered me when I was but young, and was travelling to or near <hi>Scarborough;</hi> he was loving to me, and ſeveral Friends who were with me, and I had good Service on board. There was alſo on board a <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant, now a Captain of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſport Soldiers bound for <hi>Jamaica;</hi> he lodged at <hi>John Groves</hi>'s and was a very civil Man, and ſaid, if I would go with Captain <hi>Reed</hi> (who offered, if I was going, to carry me to <hi>Jamaica</hi> free) he would wait on me if I was ſick or ailed any thing; and would gladly have had my Company: I acknowledged both their Generoſity and Civility to me, and ſo I took leave of them, and of the noble Captain <hi>Salter,</hi> who I have had occaſion both to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to love, who took his ſolid leave of me, and wept like a Child, and ſaid openly in the hearing of many, <hi>that he never loved a Man ſo well before, and tho' he did not want Buſineſs, yet for my ſake he would ſerve my Friends what lay in his Power;</hi> or near thoſe Words.</p>
               <p>I find as we live and walk in the Truth, there is an inward Witneſs which God hath placed in the Hearts of Men that is reachable, except in ſuch who are arrived to a great Degree of Hardneſs and Inſenſibility, and ſo have little Senſe or Perceivance of Good, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or in others, which is a deplorable State and much to be lamented. Oh what Grief of Heart and Spirit it hath been to me, to hear and ſee the Wickedneſs of ſome! if ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:018158_0185_0FA561C7ED721820"/>Wickedneſs was as great a Trouble to them who acted it, as it was to me, I have thought they would ſoon grow weary of it.</p>
               <p>Now I left the Iſland, and embarked on board a Ship, <hi>John Griſſith</hi> Maſter, bound for <hi>Briſtol</hi> in <hi>Old England,</hi> and went to Sea with ſome <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships that had put in at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> having a Ship of War or two for their Convoy. After we were got to Sea, they had ſo much drinking and carouſing that we grew weary of ſtaying with them, and after ſome Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Captain, who was a Friend, left them and came ſafe to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Paſſage we had ſome rough Weather near the Tropick which I mentioned before, and the Men and Captain being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered with watching and hard Labour, as I remember, for eight and forty Hours Night and Day, a Calm enſuing, the Captain deſired me to take his Place for his Watch, and mind the Helmſman, and ſee that he made ſtraight Steerage; but alas! he was ſo ſleepy, it was next to impoſſible to keep him awake. I walked on the Deck, and had overmuch Work to mind the Compaſs, and the Helmſman too, for a fine Breeze of Wind came on, and all of a ſudden a very unuſual Fear fell on me, and I looked into the Sea, and beheld it appeared to turn blue, and as far as I could diſcern to Windward, I ſaw white Caps or the Water-freckle; on ſeeing which, through Fear, more than any great Skill, I ſtampt with my Foot as though I would have broke the Deck. Out
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:018158_0186_0FA561C96568F720"/>came the Captain, but what with Fear and Sleep he could ſcarce hit the Door out of the Cabbin; but when he was got upon the Deck, he ſtampt, and called out all his Hands, and bid them lower and furl the Sails with Speed, or elſe we were all dead Men, for here is a Hurricane juſt upon us: And no ſooner was all made ſnug as well could be (as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men phraſe it) but the Wind blew ſo, that we thought it would have turned the Bottom of the Ship upward: The like I never ſaw; and, as the Captain ſaid, we had not one Minute to ſpare of being caſt away, according to all human Probability; and, as the Seamen term it, it was ſuch <hi>Hurry durry thick Weather,</hi> that we could ſcarce ſee any thing a hundred Yards, which violent Weather held for about an Hour, in which time we drove by a Veſſel, and were ſo near her, that I thought I could have flung a Stone aboard: Our Ship's Crew were ſore afraid, and looked upon her to be a Robber; her Rudder was laſhed or tied up, and the Men were all gone off the Deck, but our Mariners were ſo affrighted, that they thought they would ſet ſome ſail and follow us; for no ſooner were we paſt this Ship but the Weather grew better, and away we ran in hazard of bringing the Maſts by the board, but through the divine Providence of him that is Lord over all, both Sea and Land, we eſcaped and came ſafe into <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Maſter lived, and rode there for ſome time, and
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:018158_0187_0FA561CA5D30E298"/>then weighed for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> intending for the Yearly-meeting there.</p>
               <p>We had rough Weather in croſſing the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, before we came into the <hi>Severn,</hi> where our Sailors, being afraid of being preſt, launched the Boat, and ran away into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but four on board to bring the Ship up the River. We ſaw a Pinnace, having in it a Lieutenant with a Crew of preſſed Men, to preſs more if they could find them, and our Maſter called on me, and deſired I would put on my beſt Cloaths and come to him, and ſo I did, and he ſat me on his right Hand: By this time up comes the Lieutenant and aſked for my Men, taking me to be the Maſter; I told him, they had launched the Long-boat and were gone, and we could not hinder them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrongeſt Party; at which he appeared very much enraged, and ſeemed as though he would have ſtruck at me. I told him calmly, he had more need pity than be angry with us, for if there ſhould be a Gale of Wind, we were in great Danger of all periſhing for want of Hands, for I ſhewed him what Force we had, viz. <hi>James Bates,</hi> whom I did not then call my Companion, nor <hi>John Griſſith</hi> Captain, the Cabbin Boy and myſelf were all the Men on board. But he aſked, what for a Man that was who ſat beſide me? I told him, he was a Man ſufficiently ſecured againſt the Preſs: Then the rough Man fell, and ſaid, I looked like an honeſt Man, and he would take my Word and not ſearch for Men: So I ordered a Bottle of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:018158_0188_0FA561CAA923DC40"/>the beſt Liquor on board to be brought, and then the Lieutenant and I parted very friendly.</p>
               <p>I write not this as a Thing I approved, but diſliked; but being taken at unawares, had not time to ſhun it (as before mentioned) unleſs I had expoſed my Friend the Maſter of the Ship; although I neither ſaid nor did, that I know of, any thing worſe than what thou ſeeſt here written; I told the Captain I thought he was a great Coward, and had expoſed me to Danger to ſave himſelf.</p>
               <p>Wind and Weather favouring us, we came in due time to <hi>Briſtol</hi> Yearly-meeting, where I met with <hi>William Edmundſon,</hi> and was truly glad to ſee him with many more at that Place; but my Companion falling ſick, I was made willing to leave him, and travelled to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>John Watſon</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a ſweet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Man he was; we got to <hi>London</hi> Yearly-meeting, where I diſcharged myſelf of what I had upon my Mind, and came away in Peace, and in the feeling of the Love of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Haydock</hi> and I came from <hi>London</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and had Meetings in our way to <hi>York</hi> Yearly-meeting, where I was glad to ſee my Home-Friends, and to enjoy the Love of God once more with them; for this is our principal Crown and Kingdom in this World, to enjoy the favourable Countenance of the Lord, and one another in his living and internal Preſence; and when I looked back upon all the Mercies and Deliverances I had received from the Mighty God of Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:018158_0189_0FA561CB6E97EEC8"/>Seas, and Rivers of Water, whoſe Hand made all, and whoſe Eye and watchful Providence attends all, and is over all, my Soul was filled with Thanks and Praiſes to the great and moſt excellent Name of him who lives for ever, and hath helped my Soul to overcome many ſtrong Temptations, and hath borne up my Head under many deep Afflictions and Tribulations, renowned for ever be his holy Name.</p>
               <p>I came home the 18th of the Fourth Month 1703, and found my Children well; and now I was under a Thoughtfulneſs how to walk and demean myſelf ſo, as that I might be preſerved near the Lord, and in due Reverence and true Fear before him; that inaſmuch as I found there was ſomething of Holineſs unto the Lord imprinted or ingraven upon the fleſhly Table of my Heart, that now in this Time, when I was not ſo particularly and immediately concerned in the like daily Travel on Truth's Account, I might not loſe the Savour, Reliſh and Senſation of heavenly Things. Some will read me here, in this ſhort Survey I have been taking of my preſent State and Thoughtfulneſs, that if I could not make it better, I might not make it worſe, either in doing, or not doing any thing that might prove a hurt to me; for a Veſſel had better be laid by, if it can be ſpared, than uſed to its hurt. Now in this careful and watchful Frame of Mind, I have found Preſervation from time to time to this Day, by retaining the Salt of the Kingdom in the Soul of the inward Man, which is of a preſerving Quality, with
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:018158_0190_0FA561CC2D578B40"/>which the Veſſel is, and can only be kept fit for the Maſter's Uſe: If we loſe this, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoon grows out of Order and unfit for the Maſter's Uſe. Read and conſider theſe Things in Time, while thou haſt the Prize in thy Hand, and Time to do, and receive Good at the Hand of him who is truly full of Good, and is all Good; to him be the Offerings of Praiſe and Renown, now and for ever.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I remained at Home, as my uſual Manner was, I attended Firſt-day, and Week-day, and Monthly-meetings, as alſo Quarterly and other Meetings for the Service of Truth, and viſited many Meetings up and down in the Country, and had good Service and much Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in being given up to the Service of Truth; but did not ſee it convenient (as my Children were well placed) to ſettle to keep a Family, until my Way appeared clear to marry, which did now draw on, and after I had been near ſeven Years a Widower I married <hi>Anne Robinſon,</hi> who deſcended of a ſubſtantial Family at <hi>Hutton</hi> in the <hi>Hole,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Leſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not far from <hi>Kirby-moorſide</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had not been married much above two Years, before my Wife began to appear in the public Work of the Miniſtry, and indeed very comfortably and acceptably to Friends, and ſhe grew in Underſtanding both of the Diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt, and alſo in further Knowledge in the Work of the living Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And about that time it came upon me to viſit Friends in moſt of the Northern Counties
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:018158_0191_0FA561CD1AC2B540"/>in <hi>England;</hi> and ſome ſmall time after my Return, I had a Concern to viſit Friends in ſeveral Parts of the Southern Counties, <hi>Thomas Beedal</hi> being my Companion, who grew in the Truth, and alſo in the Miniſtry: We had many good Meetings in that Journey, good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and great Satisfaction, and I returned Home in Peace.</p>
               <p>Now I may ſay with Sorrow of Heart, the Time drew on apace when my virtuous Wife and I muſt part, and be no longer Meet-helps to one another, which we truly were, and never had either evil Word or evil Thought againſt each other, I am fully ſatisfied; but lived in Peace and true Love one with another, and were glad when we could either one or both ſerve Truth and Friends: Therefore I find it on my Mind, in this Place, to inſert the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Relation concerning her, <hi>viz.</hi>

"After this great Change was wrought in her, it was evident through the remaining Part of her Time, that ſhe was much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved under the Power, Influence, and Guidance of the peaceable, meek and quiet Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and grew daily more and more in the Favour and love of God, and was much beloved of God's People, and indeed of her Relations, Neighbours and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who were not of her Perſuaſion, and walked ſo wiſely and prudently in all her Ways, that ſhe ſought not her own Honour and Intereſt, but the Honour of the Lord, and inward Peace with him, which ſhe had a Regard unto in all her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; ſo that even ſuch who ſought for an Occaſion againſt Truth and the Profeſſors of it, had nothing to ſay againſt her, not even from her Childhood to the Day of her Death, for ſhe was generally beloved and ſpoken well of by all who knew her, and many were deeply and ſorrowfully affected to part with her, both Friends and others; the like hath not often been ſeen in thoſe Parts, and not without ſome Cauſe, for ſhe was a Woman of an upright Life, and exemplary Converſation before all, and gave no Offence to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> nor to the Church of Chriſt; charitable to the Poor, a true Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizer with ſuch as were in Affliction and Diſtreſs, whether in Body or in Mind, which was manifeſted in her frequent Viſits to ſuch, and by other Means clearly demonſtrated:
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:018158_0194_0FA561D084FFFBC8"/>She was a Woman endued with great Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and with a quiet and ſerene Mind, well qualified and fitted to her Huſband's Circumſtances, (whoſe Lot it was often to be abroad in the Service of the Truth) an honourable and a faithful Wife, willing to give up her all for Chriſt and the Goſpel's ſake, counting nothing in this World too near and dear to part with, for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the ever bleſſed Truth, Peace and Salvation of her own Soul, and the Good of others.</p>
               <p>"One Thing is remarkable and worthy of Commemoration, which I inſert as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that others in the like Caſe may not barely and outwardly imitate her, but feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly come up in her heavenly Practice and Experience, under the Influence, Light and Help of God's holy and bleſſed Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> When that worthy Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John Bowſtead,</hi> returned from <hi>London</hi> Yearly-meeting through ſeveral Counties to <hi>York,</hi> and ſo Home with me, not long before my Wife was taken away: and having ſome Diſcourſe with her, he aſked about ſeveral Things of Moment, eſpecially about <hi>her Husband being ſo much from Home,</hi> ſhe gave him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>That inaſmuch as ſhe gave up her Husband cheerfully and freely to ſerve the Lord, and to be ſerviceable to the Church of Chriſt, ſhe did not only ſympathize and feel with him in his moſt adverſe and low State, but partook with him in his beſt Enjoyments, when the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:018158_0195_0FA561D15A52CCD0"/>Power of Truth prevailed over all its Enemies; altho' I am then far from him, yet I partake of the Spoil, or the ſhedding abroad of the good Things of God among his People, as my Heart goes along with the Work of the Lord, and ſuch as are engaged in it; and in all my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Afflictions I am afflicted with him: And one of my main Concerns is, that neither I, nor any Thing in this World, may detain my Husband from doing what the Lord calls for at his Hand; for if any Thing hurt him as to the Truth, what Good can I expect of him?</hi> This <hi>John</hi> much admired, with the deep and weighty Reaſons ſhe gave about the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſcipline of the Church, and concerning the Miniſtry, the like, he ſaid, he had not met with in all his Travels before; yet ſhe was a Woman of few Words, and expreſt much in a little Compaſs: And when ſhe was taken away, oh! the Loſs and Sorrow he expreſſed to me in a Letter concerning her Death.</p>
               <p>"She was very clear in her Underſtanding, had a penetrating and diſcerning Eye, a great and inward Senſe of the State of a Meeting, as alſo of their ſeveral particular States. I cannot at preſent deſcribe to the full all the hidden Virtues of this Handmaid of the Lord, but there were many viſible Fruits of her virtuous Mind, that did appear to the Children of Men, ſome of which were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> She was an affectionate and tender Mother to her Children, yet did correct them
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:018158_0196_0FA561D16DD6C590"/>when Occaſion required, without Paſſion, or the leaſt Appearance of Diſorder of Mind, and ſtill had them in great Subjection; at which I often admired, and thought, ſurely ſhe is come, by the Workings of the holy Spirit, to a greater Dominion over her own Spirit than many who appeared to be her Equals. She was a <hi>true</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>a loving and dutiful Child to her Parents,</hi> a good Neighbour, a faithful Wife, a loving and tender-hearted Dame over her Servants, and overcame them with Love, and was much beloved by them, and alſo feared; they loved her, and were very unwilling to diſoblige or offend her.</p>
               <p>"She appeared and behaved herſelf as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſanctified Veſſel, that was in a good degree fitted and prepared for the great Maſter's Uſe, and often appeared as one that had been ſecretly in ſome Intercourſe with Jeſus Chriſt in Spirit, where his Glory had more particularly ſhone in and over her Soul, not only becauſe of the Gravity and Solidity of her Countenance, but alſo the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humility and Sweetneſs of her Mind and Spirit, Weightineſs of her Converſation, Edification of her Advice, Soundneſs of her Judgment, and Clearneſs of her Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all which made her Company very acceptable while among the Living. Her Heart was often filled with the Love of God, and early raiſed and enabled to ſpeak a Word
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:018158_0197_0FA561D227F45520"/>in Seaſon unto many States and Conditions, whether at home or abroad, in her own Family, amongſt her Neighbours, or in the Church of Chriſt, in Teſtimony to Matters relating to the Worſhip of God, or in Matters relating to Diſcipline, eſpecially in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her own Sex, where ſhe had a great Service, and will be greatly wanted. She had great Care upon her for the good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Youth in Plainneſs of Habit and Language, that they might be preſerved out of the Corruptions of the World in all the Parts thereof; in all which Services ſhe will be much miſſed: Yet we being ſenſible, that her Removal is her great Gain, it helps to alleviate our Sorrow and Loſs, which is great, and will not ſoon be forgotten by many who had the Benefit and Comfort of her good Services. Alſo her watchful and ſolid ſitting in our Meetings for Worſhip was remarkable, with very little Motion that was perceivable; yet when the leaſt Stirrings of Life in her Mind were perceived, in order to bring her forth in Teſtimony, the Meeting was truly glad, and the Living amongſt us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at it, for her Appearance was with the Wiſe, and in the Language of the Holy Spirit; which was a clear Demonſtration that the Work was the Lord's and by and through his Spirit and Power; all which gave her a great Place in the Minds of faithful Friends and Brethren. But ſhe is gone in the Prime
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:018158_0198_0FA561D2F5BFA4C0"/>and Flower of her Age! which ſets before and is a Memento unto us, to ſhew us the Uncertainty of our Time here, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for one certain to come, that Death may not overtake us at unawares before we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it.</p>
               <p>"I come now to the Time of her long Weakneſs, in which ſhe was preſerved in great Patience, Steadineſs and Reſignation of Mind to the Will of God, even unto the End; and ſhe enjoyed much heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Conſolation in the living Preſence of the Lord to her immortal Soul, ſo that when ſhe was aſked, Whether ſhe thought ſhe might recover or not? She mildly replied, <hi>She was afraid to deſire to live; becauſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I believe if it pleaſe the Lord to take me away now, it will be well with me, for I find nothing that lies as a Burden upon my Spirit.</hi> At another Time ſhe ſaid, <hi>As to that little Teſtimony I have been concerned in, this is my Comfort and Satisfaction, that I can truly ſay I did not kindle any ſtrange Fire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not warm myſelf at the Sparks thereof; but what I did in that Matter was, in the Conſtrainings of the Love of God; and when my Cup was full, I a little emptied myſelf among the Lord's People, yet very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my own Weakneſs and Poverty, and often thought myſelf unworthy of the leaſt of the Lord's Mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Many ſavoury Expreſſions ſhe ſpoke that were not written then, and therefore could
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:018158_0199_0FA560D7930B07D0"/>not be remembered; we having ſome Hopes of her Recovery, it rather cauſed an Omiſſion as to ſuch a due Obſervance of what ſhe ſaid as otherwiſe it is like would have been; although ſhe was heard to ſay not long before ſhe fell weak, <hi>She thought her Time would not be long in this World.</hi> I never heard an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming or unſavory Word come from her, let the Provocation thereto be what it would, no, not in the Time of her Health; and in her Weakneſs, ſhe was much ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the luminous and internal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and often ſang Praiſes unto his worthy Name, and appeared as one wholly redeemed from this World, whoſe Heart was ſet upon, and Mind intent, and earneſtly engaged in the Purſuit after Heaven and heavenly Things. Bleſſed be the Lord, ſhe had witneſſed a Part in the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> and over ſuch <hi>the ſecond Death hath no Power;</hi> and no doubt but ſhe lived and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, even unto the End of her Time here, and paſſed away without any Appearance of Struggling or Sorrow, I believe into a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Glory, where her Soul ſhall ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to the Lord God and the Lamb for ever, with all thoſe who have overcome the World, the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, and every Thing the Lord's Controverſy is with, and who have not loved their Lives unto Death, but given up that Life they had in any wrong Thing whatſoever."</p>

               <p>Again, I found it required of me to viſit the South Weſt Parts of <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1717, and I travelled through the Weſt Part of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> into <hi>Weſtmoreland, Lancaſhire, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>An</hi> ACCOUNT <hi>of my</hi> Viſit <hi>to</hi> FRIENDS <hi>in</hi> IRELAND.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1722 it was renewed upon me to go into <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Thoughts of it had been long upon my Mind, but now the Time ſeemed to be fully come, to pay that long thought of Viſit; and <hi>Joſeph Bunting</hi> of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> being my Companion, we went from <hi>Kendal</hi> Yearly-meeting which was a large and good Meeting, and paſſed along to <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> and took ſhipping for <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſtaid their Half-Years Meeting, which was large, and in which the living Power and Preſence of the Lord was felt amongſt us; exalted over all be the mighty Name of the Lord, for thoſe and all his Mercies.</p>
               <p>I had there many good Meetings, and alſo met with ſome hard ones (as is the Lot of ſuch who are called to this Vocation) and the beſt way I have found, when I met with ſuch, is firſt to regard <hi>our Call,</hi> then to mind our <hi>daily Steps</hi> we take in that Vocation into which we are called, and take ſpecial Care to have along with us the <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> of him that hath ſo called us; this is the way fully and
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:018158_0202_0FA560D93293FB98"/>truly to diſcharge ourſelves of that Truſt the Lord hath repoſed in us, to the mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and Edification of the Churches of Chriſt, and alſo to the Peace and Conſolation of our own Souls.</p>
               <p>It is now with me to write the following Remarks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which will not be remote to the State of Friends in many other Places, where there is a right, ſound, living Miniſtry preſerved, and good Diſcipline exerciſed, which moſtly go together: There Truth and Friends are kept generally in good Eſteem, and alſo thriving; but where theſe fail, eſpecially the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> oh! how undue Liberty, and the Faſhions of the World, with many corrupting Things, creep in amongſt the Profeſſors of Truth, even unto the Reproach thereof, and Scandal of thoſe who are ſo prevailed upon; and hearty Sorrow of ſuch as know and feel the Hurt of theſe Things: Oh! what a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance this is to the Progreſs of the ever bleſſed Truth in the Earth; and indeed it hath been in my Mind, that the main Work in this our Day is to ſearch into the Churches, and endeavour to bring them into ſuch a Condition, that it may once more be ſaid, <hi>Follow Chriſt as you have us for Examples;</hi> not only here and there one, but the Believers in general; ſo it will be, when we as a People all ſpeak the ſame Thing, or that which is agreeable, as well in our Practice (ſo often recommended) as in Faith and Doctrine; for I have ever underſtood <hi>Examples</hi> to be more prevalent than <hi>Precept:</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:018158_0203_0FA560DA0096A280"/>but if any amongſt Friends be grown ſo hardy, and ſo unſenſible, as to prefer ſome fooliſh Faſhions, which to me appear to be ſhameful and undecent, it is an evident Demonſtration they are departed too much from the Principles and Practices of our worthy Elders in the Truth; which I fear is the caſe of too many, both in that Nation and in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not any ſay, that I ſmite in the Dark, and do not tell what I mean; for ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars I intend to mention for the Eaſe of my Mind: I have ſeen ſeveral Changes of Faſhions in forty Years Time; our firſt Friends and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Truth came out in the Lord's Work and heavenly Power, <hi>plain,</hi> and generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo for their Time; but alas! how ſoon there appeared an Alteration, in ſome Men eſpecially, when the Weight of Sufferings was over; it then began to appear, and hath from time to time continued to encreaſe ever ſince, among ſome profeſſing Truth with us, not only in <hi>extravagant Wigs,</hi> with much Powder in them, but alſo in <hi>Croſs-pockets, needleſs Capes,</hi> and divers <hi>Cuts</hi> and <hi>Shapes</hi> in their <hi>Cloathing,</hi> in Conformity to the prevailing Faſhions of the Times, as well as in <hi>ſetting up their Hats;</hi> all which appear to be more likely to lead thoſe, who follow them, into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the World again, than into the heavenly Country or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which we profeſs to be preſſing after, and hope to obtain in the End.</p>
               <p>Now, not to let the <hi>Females</hi> paſs without my Obſervation on them: I well remember in my
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:018158_0204_0FA560DACE94CDA8"/>younger Years, eſpecially in great Towns and Cities, I have met with thoſe that profeſſed Truth with us, who have had but very little Coverings on their Heads, and others that have had more ſet up at a conſiderable Diſtance above their Foreheads, and both theſe Sorts perhaps <hi>bare necked.</hi> When I have met with ſuch I have ſaid, What a fair or beautiful Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> wouldſt thou be if thou wouldſt put on Truth and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and put away all theſe fooliſh Faſhions? And in Families, when I have aſked ſome Particulars, what they could ſay for theſe Dreſſes, and being ſo naked, both Neck and Shoulders, I received this Anſwer, or ſometing like it, <hi>That it was good for their Health, to keep their Temples cool, and to learn to be hardy, by expoſing themſelves thus to the Air in their Youth:</hi> But if that was the true Reaſon, I added this Caution to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>; to conſider duly, <hi>if Religion did not, yet the Modeſty of their Sex ſhould, reclaim them from it.</hi> Sometimes, with the Diſlike I ſhewed to theſe Things, I adviſed them, <hi>that they would cover their naked Skin, and no more expoſe themſelves to the Luſt and vain Speculation of the worſt, and great Trouble of their beſt Friends;</hi> and worſt of all, <hi>to the great Hurt of themſelves, and in a manner deſtroying all reaſonable Claim to Chriſt:</hi> For how can our Love to, and Faith in him be true and ſound, when our Practice is ſo remote unto the Practice and Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which they gave and endeavoured to inculcate? <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:018158_0205_0FA560DB8D107B80"/>by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect Will of God,</hi> Rom. xii. 2. <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward Adorning of plaiting the Hair, and of wearing Gold, or of putting on of Apparel: But let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meck and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price: For after this manner in the old Time, the holy Women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves, being in Subjection unto their own Husbands,</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 5. Alas! woe is me, for the Hurt of the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> when I conſider with Regret from whence ſuch are fallen, if ever reſtored out of the Fall.</p>
               <p>If we as a People ſhould follow ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as I have touched upon, certainly we ſhall become an Hiſſing and a Bye-word to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about, who may have heard of us, and what great Things the Lord of Hoſts hath done for us ſince we became a People, as may and has been ſeen and heard in Examples, Words and Writings from our faithful Friends and Brethren (the chief Promulgators of Truth and Righteouſneſs) in their unwearied Labours, Faith and Sufferings for the Cauſe and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt; and what alſo was not leſs remarkable, by their exemplary Lives of Plainneſs, Humility, Sincerity, and Self-denial, with Works of Charity.</p>
               <p>Now, thou that readeſt this, beware that thou doſt not let in any wrong Mind, and in that
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:018158_0206_0FA560DC31C58FD8"/>begin to judge me inſtead of judging thyſelf; for as far as I know, I have but done my Duty: See firſt, that thou doſt thine before thou begins to judge me. Bear this Caution from thy Friend, thou that God hath endued with his Spirit, and wait till this holy Spirit of Truth is upon thee a Spirit of Judgment; as thou abideſt under theſe Qualifications, thou art fit to ſit in Judgment, and judge wrong Things in thyſelf firſt, next in thy Family, and then in the Church of Chriſt; and be unwearied in thy Labours to preſerve, as well as to reſtore, what thou art capable of doing in the Church of Chriſt, from all wrong Ways and Things; for if Corruption and Slackneſs come in, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over the Leader, as well as over thoſe whom God hath raiſed thee up to be a Help unto, then will the Lord deal with both thee and them ſome other Way; for I am ſatisfied the Lord will turn his Hand upon his People in theſe Days, as he did upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> formerly, ſaying, by his Prophet, <hi>He would purge away her Droſs, and take away all her Tin;</hi> not only all groſs Evils, but alſo that which in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may be like Truth, but is not Truth: This was, and will be the Way to <hi>reſtore Judges as at the Firſt, and Counſellors as at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Oh! then ſhall the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſee thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all Kings thy Glory,</hi> ſaid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>Although there is great Occaſion for an Amendment in many, yet there is a bright and heavenly-minded Remnant in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi>

               <p>Here is Work for ſuch as God hath ſet up as Watchmen over his People, to ſee that thoſe do not go on in Bye-ways, who profeſs Truth, and leave the Way of Truth unoccupied by them; here is Work for the true Judges, who have the Spirit of Judgment upon them: And notwithſtanding ſome, here and there, who may be found in the faithful Diſcharge of that Truſt the Lord hath repoſed in them, may meet with ſome Oppoſition from ſuch as are unfaithful, and not willing to be bounded and girded by the Truth, no not ſo much as to an <hi>outward Conſormity</hi> to the Plainneſs and Decency, ſo much and frequently recommended by the Writings, by public Teſtimonies, and alſo in our Meetings for Diſcipline; for it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Branch of our Meetings for Diſcipline,

               <p>It may not be amiſs to give a Hint here, at what Door many have gone out into divers Evils; <hi>firſt,</hi> by being brought by Cuſtom to be in love with <hi>Strong-drink,</hi> and keeping <hi>looſe Company;</hi> for even ſuch have been ſo far a Means to corrupt, and in time to draw away the Mind from that Simplicity and Purity the Lord's People ought to live in, until a Cloud has come over the Underſtanding, and the Senſe

               <p>Now my tender and well beloved Friends, watch againſt and ſtrive to keep out the Enemy that <hi>he enter not;</hi> for what way ſoever he enters and gets Footing, he defiles God's Temple; and before thou witneſſes the Lord to deſtroy him and caſt him out again, thou muſt have many a ſore Combat, and ſome Warfare (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more that thou art aware of) before thou gaineſt all the Ground thou haſt loſt, by giving way to the Adverſary of thy Soul; therefore keep upon thy <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> watch <hi>unto the End, watch and pray continually, that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> ſaid our great Lord unto his Followers: For I have found by Experience, that it is harder to gain what we have loſt, than to keep it while we had it; and to improve our Talents, is not only the way to have them continued, but alſo to have them more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly added unto us; but ſuch as do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what is given unto them, even that which they have been intruſted with ſhall be taken from them: Oh! how deſolate and miſerable
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:018158_0210_0FA560E11FF94998"/>ſuch will be in the Day of Account, when Chriſt, like a great Shepherd, divides the <hi>Sheep</hi> from the <hi>Goats,</hi> and between the <hi>Slothful</hi> and the <hi>Faithful Servants,</hi> between the <hi>wiſe</hi> and the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and between all thoſe who adhered to, obeyed, and followed him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Meaſure of Light and Knowledge received, and thoſe who have rejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the Strivings and Convictions of God's holy Light, and bleſſed Spirit, placed in the Hearts of the Children of Men to enlighten, inſtruct, reprove, comfort, and guide, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the State of every individual Mind, as it is conformable or diſobedient to inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. So is this holy Gift a Witneſs for, or againſt, to accuſe, or excuſe in thy Conſcience, according as thy good or evil Doings are and do prevail in thy Heart and Soul. But this is ſomewhat a Digreſſion from the hiſtorical Part of my Travels; for as I have mentioned before my going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall now ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more particularly thereof.</p>
               <p>We journeyed from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards <hi>Cork,</hi> and had ſeveral Meetings in our Way, as at <hi>Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, Culladine, Wexford, Lambſtown, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Clonmel, Caſhel, Youghall, Cork,</hi> and ſtaid their Province Meeting for <hi>Munſler,</hi> which was a good and large Meeting. I was much out of Order here, by reaſon of a Fever and Ague which held me ſeveral Days, and I was much obliged to my Friends, <hi>John Dobbs, Joſeph IIoare</hi> and his Family, for the great Care they took of me in this my weak State; I was not

               <p>Next we came to <hi>Charleville, Limerick, Roſs,</hi> and from thence to <hi>John Aſhton's, Birr, James Hutchinſon's, Montrath, Mountmeleck, Henry Ridgway's,</hi> and from <hi>Balinakil</hi> to <hi>Montrath</hi> again, and was at their Six-weeks Meeting, which was a heavenly and good Meeting, there being a living Remnant there: Then we came to <hi>Kilconner, Carlow, Ballitouer, John Stephen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, Timahoe, Edenderry,</hi> and went to ſee my good Friend <hi>Thomas Wilſon,</hi> who was ſore troubled with the Gravel; I was much afflicted, and truly ſympathized with him in my Spirit, and <hi>john Barcroft,</hi> that true Man, and I did what we could for our afflicted Brother, and ſo left him and his Family in the Love of God; and went to <hi>Liſmoiny,</hi> the <hi>Moat, Waterſtown, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limurry, Athlone,</hi> and had another Meeting at the <hi>Moat; Oldcaſlle, Ballihays, Coothill, Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhean, Ballihagan, Charlemount, Dumclaudy, Colrain, James Moor's,</hi> the <hi>Grange, Antrim, Lisburn, Hillsborough,</hi> and was at their Province Meeting, which was held at <hi>Ballenderry,</hi> and was alſo at ſome Meetings twice; <hi>Monallen, Turmery, Lurgan, Raſſer-Iſland, Newry,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dublin,</hi> being the 29th of the Fifth Month, 1722, and

For thus it behoveth all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt to do, even the Married as if they were not married; and thoſe that buy any Thing, as if they did not poſſeſs it: This is a Liberty which many are Strangers unto, it is wrought by the Finger of God, it is the Work of God's heavenly Power to looſen Man thus from the Things of this World, and at the ſame Time we are moſt bound unto Chriſt, yet enjoy a comfortable and heavenly Freedom in our Spirits in Chriſt, by our Faith and Obedience unto him, in and through all Trials, Provings and Adverſities: And <hi>dear Friends,</hi> the greater the Croſs, the greater is the Crown and Reward which all thoſe poſſeſs, who do all Things they do with a ſingle Mind, and an upright Heart unto the Lord in all Things, and at all Times.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Children of the Bridegroom</hi> are or ought to be eſpouſed or married to Chriſt, and truly devoted to him, that ſo they may ſtand, as much as may be, diſintangled from all mutable Things, and cleave to and follow him when and whereſoever he calls and leads, and be in Subjection to him, as a virtuous Wife is not only bound, but willingly is ſubject, to her virtuous and preferable Huſband: Thus we may know
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:018158_0214_0FA560E48466BD50"/>and experience Chriſt to become our <hi>holy Head;</hi> and that we may hold unto him, and that we may ſo walk and live, that he may take Delight in his Church, (the Body) to rule in and over it, as we have the State of the true Church and Chriſt repreſented in the moſt excellent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As I was travelling towards <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Brig,</hi> Friends gave me No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there were two great Diſputants, a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt</hi> Miniſter, and a Doctor of <hi>Phyſic,</hi> who were like to go all or moſt of the Way with me, as the Aſſizes were coming on, and would be at me with Arguments about Religion, which I ſoon found true; for we were no ſooner got into a ſuitable Way but they began with me, which I endeavoured to prevent by telling them, I did not look upon myſelf to be
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:018158_0216_0FA560E5F9688C68"/>qualified for <hi>Diſputes;</hi> and withal I obſerved, that ſometimes Diſputants ended in a worſe Underſtanding one of another than when they began, except they minded well to keep good Government; and now as we appeared free and friendly, how we might be when we had ended our Diſpute, was a Queſtion, therefore I had rather they would forbear: But they turned the deaf Ear to all that I ſaid, and nothing would do with them, but a Diſpute we muſt have. I then aſked them what they would ſay? They queried, <hi>Whether all Men were placed in a Station capable of Salvation, yea or nay?</hi> I replied, If I ſhould give my poſitive Thoughts to your Queſtion, we ſhall have Occaſion to go back to treat of the Nature, not only of the upright State Man was in before he fell, but alſo how he fell and alſo in the Fall, how he ſtands as in Relation to his Reſtoration, which brings us to the Queſtion. Although this be not the uſual Way of Diſputants, yet if you will ſubmit to it, it will either anſwer your Queſtion, or ſet it in a clearer Light for an Anſwer. They aſked, <hi>How could that be?</hi> I replied, if it did not, they might ſay ſo. They then ſo far condeſcended as to hear me, and I ſaid, <hi>firſt,</hi> we all agree in this, that Man was made upright; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that he fell from that Uprightneſs; the Queſtion then is, <hi>How? Anſw.</hi> By the Offence or Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the firſt Man <hi>Adam</hi> Sin entered, and Condemnation came upon all who had ſinned. I then queried of the Diſputants, whether they believed that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall did affect all thoſe
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:018158_0217_0FA560E6C6AE28C8"/>who did not hear of it, as well as thoſe who did? For, I ſaid, there were ſome of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that thoſe who had not the explicit or outward Knowledge of the promiſed Seed or Coming of Chriſt, had not the Benefit of his Coming; and except they would firſt allow, that all were affected or hurt by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, then ſuch as were not, remained in Paradiſe to this Day, except they would make the Remedy leſs than the Diſeaſe, the Plaiſter leſs than the Sore, and Chriſt's Coming leſs extenſive than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. I argued, that upon the foot of Reaſon, as well as what we had in plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Chriſt's Coming was as extenſive as the Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> for, <hi>by the Obedience of Chriſt, the Gift of God came upon all unto Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I think, ſaid I, your Queſtion is ſet in a clear Light for an Anſwer, or elſe anſwered; ſo take it at what End you will (laying aſide all Quibbling) I intend to join Iſſue with you, and prove that <hi>all Men are placed in a Station capable of Salvation;</hi> or otherwiſe you muſt leave a great Part of the World in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, or make the Coming of Chriſt leſs exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> I then queried, what they ſaid to all this? They anſwered, <hi>they never heard the like before, and they would not meddle with me, I was too great a Scholar for them.</hi> I ſaid, there was little of Scholarſhip in it; I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I thought, nothing but plain Scripture and ſound Reaſon; and I told them, I had now as good as anſwered their Queſtion, and had given ſeveral Reaſons to back my Anſwer, and as they
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:018158_0218_0FA560E76E3A32B0"/>appeared wiſe, well read Men, and as far as I had gathered, had been principled againſt <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation,</hi> and <hi>univerſal Grace,</hi> for them now to drop the Matter ſo ſlenderly, before me who appeared but like a Child to them, was very ſurprizing: But they replied, <hi>they would not meddle with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then commended them for their good Temper, and the Civility they ſhewed to me, for they were civil to me beyond what I could expect; and they invited me to the Burial of one of their deceaſed Friends, but I could not go, for I was in haſte to get to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> having ſome Buſineſs there that haſtened me. Now at parting with them, my Soul magnified the Lord, under a Senſe of his Goodneſs to me, in that he had opened my Way, and helped me through this Difficulty, with many other Trials and Afflictions I had met with.</p>
               <p>I had at another Time ſome Reaſonings with a <hi>Papiſt</hi> who was my Neighbour, about the <hi>Viſibility</hi> of their Church, and <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> with ſeveral other Things. As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſhewed him, that <hi>the true Church fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe was for Times, Time, and half a Time;</hi> in this State we do not read ſhe had any outward Character as a viſible Church; and that if they derived their Deſcent, it was from ſome falſe Church, and not through the true one. And as to the other, they took too much upon them, more than they could juſtify from Scripture, or clearly demonſtrate from Chriſt or his Apoſtles; for Chriſt never
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:018158_0219_0FA560E85914FD70"/>gave any of them ſuch a Commiſſion, as to <hi>convert Bread and Wine</hi> into <hi>real Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and then to call it <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You, ſaid I, by theſe Notions, deceive yourſelves and your Adherents; for Chriſt ſpoke unto ſuch as you by Parables, becauſe they were carnal, and did not underſtand the Meaning of his Sayings in this Caſe, no more than the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood what Chriſt meant, when he ſpoke of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this Temple</hi> (meaning his Body) which they underſtood was of that Temple at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which they made a great Wonder at, and ſaid, <hi>How can this be that he can deſtroy this Temple, and raiſe it up again in three Days, when it was Forty eight Years in building?</hi> Thus they reaſoned carnally, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (though a Ruler of the <hi>Jews</hi>) did concerning <hi>Regeneration</hi> or the <hi>new Birth;</hi> and as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did, from whence Chriſt ſhould have that living Water, which he ſpoke of, that <hi>ſhould be in Man as a Well of living Water, ſpringing up unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life;</hi> and as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you;</hi> they ſaid, <hi>How can this be, that he can give us his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink?</hi> But this is a ſpiritual Eating and Drinking; even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Out of the Belly of him that believes, ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters; which he ſpake of the Spirit:</hi> In like manner it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation, Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, iſ any Man hear my Voice, and open unto me, I
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:018158_0220_0FA560E8E936EB28"/>will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Here is an Union of Spirits between Chriſt and his faithful Children, and here is an inward Eating and Drinking of the heavenly, ſpiritual and myſtical Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, which carnal Men cannot eat of, neither can the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eye diſcern Chriſt's ſpiritual Body, which he feeds his living and ſpiritual Church withal. When I had reaſoned with the Man to this Effect, he went away ſeemingly not pleaſed, but would not from that Time ever meddle with me any more.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay much here about <hi>Chriſt's being come;</hi> having ſhewed, in a Conference in <hi>New-England,</hi> how he is come to anſwer his Eating and Drinking the Paſſover and laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>He would drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, until he drank it new with them in his Father's Kingdom.</hi> Now he that hath experienced what this Eating and Drinking is, is come beyond the outward Eating and Drinking, <hi>into the Kingdom</hi> which is <hi>within,</hi> which comes not with outward Obſervations, Eatings, Drinkings, nor carnal Ordinances, but the Kingdom of Heaven conſiſts in <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, read this thou that canſt, and learn to underſtand between the Thing that points, and the Thing which is pointed at, and between the Thing ſignifying, and the Thing ſignified, and miſtake not the Shadow for the Subſtance any longer; for it is poſſible a Man may do all the outward Parts, and yet be ignorant of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:018158_0221_0FA560EB8D61B860"/>the Croſs of Chriſt, and of the heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: But if he is come to the End of theſe outſide Things, to the Holy of Holies, ſuch will know what it is to miniſter before the Lord in his Temple, and to ſerve and wait at the holy Altar, and live, and have that pure ſpiritual Life preſerved: For we read not of any <hi>Tithes</hi> that appertain to this ſpiritual Prieſthood, or Goſpel Miniſtry; and what their outward Maintenance was to be, is ſhewed by Chriſt, beyond Contradiction, who ſent them forth. Where they were received (mark that well) <hi>they might eat ſuch Things as were ſet before them,</hi> but were not to take any Thing from them by Force, for that is out of the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Why do People call the Scripture their <hi>Rule of Faith and Manners,</hi> when at the ſame Time they believe and act contrary thereto? for when I had ſome Years before a Debate with the Prieſt of our Pariſh, we meeting at <hi>Sponton,</hi> I being there upon ſome Occaſion, and ſeveral People met together, the Prieſt demanded my Reaſons, <hi>why I did not pay him his Tithe?</hi> I uſed ſome perſuaſive Arguments to put him off, not being willing at that Time to enter into any Debate with him; but the more I ſhewed my Unwillingneſs to it, the more urgent he was upon me: So when I could not ſee how to avoid entering into ſome cloſe Debate with him, I deſired he would not be angry, and he ſaid <hi>he would not;</hi> I then ſhewed in ſeveral Particulars, why <hi>I could not pay him any
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:018158_0222_0FA560EC8B0C56B0"/>Tithe,</hi> becauſe I believed, if he was a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, he ought not to claim any; for, as there was a <hi>Change of the Prieſthood,</hi> there alſo muſt be of Neceſſity a <hi>Change of the Law,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 12. and to pretence to draw any Command or Example from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, out of the New Teſtament, for that Purpoſe, appears to me weak and inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>We had ſome farther Diſcourſe upon the Ground of his Right and Title to Tithes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jure divino,</hi> as they uſed to be formerly claimed, or <hi>Jure humano;</hi> that is, by human Laws, as moſt of the modern Prieſts ſeem to chuſe to fix their Title; I bid him fix his Right for Tithes on which Claim he pleaſed, and I would endeavour to anſwer him as well as I could, but he ſeemed not to fix upon either; whereupon I told him, <hi>That there was no ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Settlement of</hi> Tithes <hi>upon Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> and alſo offered to prove, that he was neither in the Practice of the <hi>Levites,</hi> to whom Tithes were directed to be paid, nor yet in the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe Miniſters whom Chriſt qualified, ordained and ſent forth: <hi>Firſt,</hi> not in the Practice of the <hi>Levites;</hi> becauſe the Tithes due to them, were for their Service and punctual Performance of their Part of the ceremonial Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 21. which if any now claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſeemed to me, that he ſubjected himſelf to the Practice of <hi>burnt Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices, Circumciſion,</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Habits, Waſhings,</hi> &amp;c. (beſides which, the Law which appointed the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:018158_0223_0FA560ECC39DD7A0"/>Tithe to the <hi>Levites,</hi> expreſly forbids them to have any Share or Inheritance in the Land, as appears from <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 20, 23, 24, and <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 1, 2.) which the modern Claimers of Tithe would be loth to be compelled to the Practice of; not to inſiſt on the Law of the <hi>third Year's Tithe,</hi> of which the Widow, the Fatherleſs and the Stranger within their Gates, were to receive a conſiderable Part as their allotted Portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiv. 28, 29. <hi>Secondly,</hi> not in the Practice of thoſe Miniſters Chriſt qualified and ſent forth; for theſe went out by an eſpecial Command from him, without Gold, Silver or Braſs in their Purſes, without two Coats; and ſo intent were they to be in the Execution of their great Duty of preaching the Goſpel, that they were to ſalute no Man by the way, but to go forward on the great Errand they had received in Commiſſion: And when they returned to their Lord he aſked them, <hi>If they lacked any Thing?</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>Nothing;</hi> yet not becauſe they had forced a Maintenance from any, but that the Effect of their Miniſtry among their Hearers had been ſo prevalent, that thoſe who had been convinced by their Doctrine, and turned to the effectual Power of Chriſt in themſelves, had from thence known their Hearts ſo opened, as to adminiſter to all their immediate Neceſſities; and theſe, thus ſent, had only <hi>eat ſuch Things as were ſet before them,</hi> as they were appointed; and where they <hi>had ſown Spirituals,</hi> had only reaped of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals of their Converts for their immediate
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:018158_0224_0FA560ED704ED628"/>Subſiſtance: But though thou ſoweſt not to me of thy <hi>Spirituals,</hi> nor do I believe thee to be one who haſt any thing ſpiritual, which can be of any Benefit to my ſpiritual Part; and though thou eſteemeſt me <hi>as an Heathen Man and a Publican,</hi> and I am excommunicated and cut off from any Church-fellowſhip with thee, (not for any Evil, but as far as I can underſtand, for not coming to what thou calleſt the <hi>Church</hi>) yet thou expecteſt to reap of my Temporals, becauſe the Law of the Land has given thee that Power; which Diſpoſition <hi>to reap where thou haſt not ſown,</hi> and <hi>to gather where thou haſt not ſtrown,</hi> is far from manifeſting a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt farther urged ſome Paſſages out of the New Teſtament, in Vindication of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes, alluding to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. about <hi>ſowing of ſpiritual Things unto us;</hi> that it was <hi>but a ſmall Thing if ſuch received of our carnal Things;</hi> and that <hi>of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Flock, and partaking of the Milk of the Flock;</hi> and <hi>of planting a Vineyard, and eating the Fruit thereof:</hi> All which I endeavoured to obviate, by ſhewing, that he did not ſow his <hi>Spirituals</hi> to us, ſo as that he might be intituled to our carnal Things; neither were we of that <hi>Flock</hi> which he ſhould partake of the Milk of; neither were a <hi>Vineyard</hi> which he had planted, that he might eat of the Fruit thereof. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore I ſaid, as I am a Stranger, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Perſon, and not of thy Children, the Apoſtles, if they wanted or were in any
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:018158_0225_0FA560EED518F488"/>Straits for Neceſſaries, did not apply to Strangers for Help, but to ſuch of their Children as they had been inſtrumental in the Hand of God to plant the true Faith, and ſow the Seed of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in: Now theſe who are thus convinced, and by the Work of God's Power converted, theſe were ſuch who knew ſpiritual Things ſown in them, who I believed were very free to diſtribute (where true Need was) of their temporal Things, eſpecially to ſuch who had been inſtrumental in the Lord's Hand to their coming to the ſaving Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. But I ſhewed the Prieſt, that all this carried no Analogy to what was between him and me, for I, being excommunicated, was but to him <hi>as an heathen Man and a Publican,</hi> and as we never came to hear him, we could not owe him any Acknowledgement, nor could he expect any Thing as a freewill-offering on that Account.</p>
               <p>This Prieſt <hi>Wykes</hi> (for that was his Name) was a ſtrong ſpirited Man, of conſiderable Parts and Learning; and a neighbouring Juſtice of the Peace told me, he was fearful would be very ſevere with me; yet to his Commendation be it ſpoken, he was ever after this Conference very loving, and never gave me any Trouble for thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I may add one Obſervation or two not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our Debate, which were, that <hi>if the Maintenance of the Prieſts was to be wholly withdrawn, or left to the Freedom and Generoſity of the People, many of them would want and
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:018158_0226_0FA560EF06028F18"/>come to Poverty, and be forced to labour with their Hands, which would diſtract or at leaſt impede their Studies.</hi> I anſwered, that with ſuch Miniſters as they were, <hi>this might be the Caſe:</hi> But if all would come truly and rightly to wait on the great Teacher, the Anointing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it would greatly tend to the Advantage of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> for the Almighty, who by his good Spirit is alone able to raiſe up and qualify Goſpel-Miniſters, as he knows the Wants of his People, and their Faith and Truſt in him, would no doubt raiſe up from among them faithful Miniſters; ſuch, who being humble, meek and low in Heart, like him of whom they had learned, would be content to live in Moderation on a little, and to labour in their reſpective Callings, like the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Miniſter of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> working with their Hands that their Miniſtry might not be chargeable, ſuch as <hi>Fiſhermen, Collectors of Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Miniſtry being not their own, but received immediately from the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the Sheep, would not require much Time and Study to pen down, but coming from the Spirit of Truth immediately moving upon the Miniſter's Heart, would be more effectual to reach the Witneſs of Truth in the Hearts of their Hearers than all the laboured Diſcourſes of the moſt ſubtil Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 27th of the ſaid Month we ſet ſail, and had a good Paſſage in the main, excepting that we had one very great Storm, in which we were in Danger of being loſt; our Bolt-ſprit was broke, and the Maſts were in Danger of coming down, yet we were preſerved, and in about eleven Weeks, being the 12th of the Seventh Month, I landed near <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to the great Satisfaction of Friends as well as my ſelf, renowned be the great Name of the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>I have many Times conſidered, that although it was my Place to leave my very near and dear Friends, Children and Relations, who in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Frame of Spirit were much concerned for me, and I for them, yet I met with many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Friends in my Travels, who were very near me in the ever bleſſed Truth; which fails not thoſe who truſt in the Lord, and are faithful, according to the Ability and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which the Lord, hath given to the Children of Men, and are devoted to anſwer the Leadings and Guidance of his Holy Spirit, and willing to bear the Croſs, Burthen, or Yoke, which he ſees good to lay upon his Servants and Handmaids: And I intreat all ſuch who are called unto the Lord's great Work, to give up cheerfully and not grudgingly, and not to look back at what is behind, ſo as to haſten or hinder themſelves in that Work they are called to, leſt they fall ſhort of that <hi>Penny,</hi> or <hi>Crown,</hi> which

               <p>I met with the ſame Juſtice afterwards at <hi>Burlington</hi> in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> he was glad to ſee me, and ſo was I to ſee him, for he was very loving and friendly.

                  </gap>d not done fairly by me; but I deſired to know, what Church he pretended to belong to? He anſwered, <hi>To the Epiſcopal Church.</hi> I then requeſted he would anſwer me one Queſtion before we entered into any farther Debate, and
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:018158_0231_0FA560F2C72F4B60"/>he promiſed he would if he underſtood it. I told him, I heard he was a Scholar, and no doubt but he underſtood how to anſwer it, if he did but conſider the Matter; the Query was this, <hi>Whether the</hi> ſprinkling <hi>a little Water in a Child's Face, would bear the Name</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>yea or nay?</hi> He ſaid, it would not. I anſwered, <hi>Thou haſt made a great Pother and Noiſe about little or nothing; for by thy own Confeſſion thy Church has</hi> no Baptiſm <hi>at all, for I know not of any other Way they uſe but</hi> Sprinkling. He would not enter into any farther Diſcourſe about it, but made uſe of the Words of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> in favour of the Work the Apoſtles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, ſaying, <hi>If this Work be of God it could not be overthrown, but if it was of Man it would come to nought.</hi> I told him, <hi>I was of his Mind; and the Lord hath ſupported me in this and the like Work, now between forty and fifty Years, and if I continued faithful, I had no Doubt at all in my Mind, but he would ſupport and ſtand by me to the End.</hi> And when we parted he ſaid, The Lord of Heaven and Earth bleſs you, for I believe you are an honeſt Man.</p>
               <p>By this we may ſee, that Truth ſometimes comes over Men, and the Witneſs which God hath placed in Men is reached, and Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails many Times beyond our Expectation, or what is by us foreſeen; therefore it is good to keep to the Guidance or Leading of the Spirit of Truth, for it is a bleſſed Remembrancer, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor and true Comforter to all ſuch as truly depend upon him, who ſent the Spirit of Truth
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:018158_0232_0FA560F3AB33A1A0"/>into the Hearts of the Children of Men, to guide them into all the neceſſary Truths which we are to know and practiſe, and conſequently out of all Untruth.</p>
               <p>When we had gone through this Iſland, and viſited Friends there, and in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and had ſome Meetings in our Way, we went to <hi>Nantucket,</hi> where we met with many innocent plain Friends; alſo on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and in many Places in theſe Parts of the Country, we found great Openneſs; in <hi>Boſton</hi> beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and there was ſome Convincement in that Town. We travelled up to <hi>Dover,</hi> and viſited Friends thereabout (which are the moſt remote Parts where Friends inhabit in that Quarter of <hi>New-England</hi>) where I met with a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Prieſt: What his Deſign chiefly was in coming to the Friend's Houſe I know not, but thought it was to ſee, or rather ſpeak with me, for he ſoon began to aſk me ſome Queſtions; firſt, <hi>Whether I was not brought up a Scholar, and had been in ſome of the Colleges where I had my Education?</hi> And alſo, <hi>Whether I had not put on the canonical Gown, and preached according to the Manner of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? I replied, I had not received my Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any College, neither ever put on the canonical Gown, nor preached after the Manner of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He told me, <hi>I had been ſo repreſented to him;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he ſuppoſed I had been at ſome Schools:</hi> I told him, I had been at ſeveral to learn when I was young; and ſaid, I did not know that I had given
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:018158_0233_0FA560F429154DB0"/>Occaſion at any Time, by what I had ſaid, whereby any Man might judge me to be a Scholar. He underſtood I came from <hi>Old England,</hi> and began to aſk ſeveral Queſtions, as <hi>Whether our Friends increaſed or decreaſed?</hi> I anſwered I could not poſitively tell; I thought there was no great Alteration in my Time as to Number, for their Decreaſe in one Part of the Nation, I thought might be made up in their Increaſe in another Part. He alſo aſked me, <hi>How the epiſcopal Miniſters dealt with us about their Tithes?</hi> My Anſwer was thus; As to that Part called the <hi>Praedial Tithes,</hi> they commonly either gather them themſelves or Family, or ſet them to Tenants who take care to fetch them away before us, knowing that we cannot be free to leave them on the Ground, as Hay and Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as to <hi>ſmall Tithes,</hi> there is an<note n="*" place="bottom">The 7th &amp; 8th of <hi>William</hi> the third, Chap. 6. is the Act for Recovery of ſmall Tithes or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. not amounting to above the Yearly Value of forty Shillings, which is common for all People, the Coſt not exceeding ten Shillings, before two or more Juſtices of the Peace, not to go back above two Years.
<p>The 7th &amp; 8th of <hi>William</hi> the third, Chap. 34, which is our Affirmation Act, is the Act for the Recovery of Tithes and Church-rates for any Sum not exceeding ten Pounds from <hi>Quakers</hi> only, before two Juſtices of the Peace, without any Limitation of Time. And by the ſtatute of the firſt of <hi>George</hi> the firſt, Chap. 6. Sect. 2. limited to ten Shillings Coſt. <hi>See the Statutes at large.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> Act of Parliament, called <hi>An Act for the
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:018158_0234_0FA560F6B8C61690"/>more eaſy Recovery of ſmall Tithes, for any Sum not exceeding forty Shillings, and ten Shillings Coſt;</hi> which is by Juſtice's Warrants. This is moſtly thought to be intended to prevent their Procedure by <hi>Exchequer</hi> Proceſs, through which great Havock and Spoil has been made of Friends Goods, and ſometimes their Bodies caſt into Priſon, where ſome have lain a long Time. He aſked, <hi>How our Friends did in</hi> Scotland, <hi>if they increaſed there?</hi> I told him, I heard that they did not increaſe, but ſome of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> were kind to our Friends, and would come to our Meetings, eſpecially if Strangers were at them: And I alſo told him, that Perſecution in our Part of the World was become hateful amongſt moſt ſober People. He ſaid, <hi>It was very well;</hi> and likewiſe mentioned, that <hi>we were refined, and not the People we had been.</hi> I aſked him, wherein he thought we were refined? He anſwered, <hi>in our Principles.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to name one; and he ſaid, George Fox <hi>denied the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> I told him, <hi>George Fox</hi> did own a Reſurrection ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, as we do; but becauſe he and our Friends thought it not ſafe to recede from plain Scripture, nor to comply with the Way many People have of expreſſing it, which we think to be too groſs and carnal, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>ſame Body ſhall riſe,</hi> therefore they have aſſerted we deny the Reſurrection: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be, for it is ſown in Corruption, raiſed in Incorruption, ſown
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:018158_0235_0FA560F7A8D45CB0"/>a natural, raiſed a ſpiritual Body;</hi> with much more that might be added: And how much ſuch a Change maketh a Difference between the preſent and the future in the Reſurrection, between natural and ſpiritual, Corruption and Incorruption, I know not of any finite Creature that is able truly to determine; and therefore I think it is not conſiſtent with Charity, nor true Wiſdom, to differ about ſuch Things which exceed our Comprehenſion. He allowed it <hi>to be better to let them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We parted very friendly, and Friends were glad of the Opportunity, he having the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being a great Scholar and a wiſe Man; but from all that paſſed, they believed he gained no Advantage: However he behaved well; and before we parted, I told him, I thought the greateſt Reaſon why ſome think us refined was this, That formerly People were ſo prejudiced, that whatever was printed or ſaid againſt us, our Principles, Practice and Doctrines, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received and believed, though never ſo much diſguiſed or covered with ſuch Dreſſes as might render us moſt odious, and were by many taken for the Standard of our Belief and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; but of late the Light hath more appeared, and many are grown better diſpoſed towards us, and like wiſe Men, not willing to be impoſed upon any longer, have ſearched for themſelves into the State of the Controverſy between us and our Oppoſers; and our Writings upon peruſal, appearing ſo clear and different from what the Books of thoſe who oppoſed us charged upon
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:018158_0236_0FA560F7F64FAFC0"/>us, cauſed many who read them with a good Deſign, and were willing to be ſet right, to ſay <hi>we were reformed, and not the People that we had been.</hi> The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>he thought there might be much owing to that:</hi> I told him it was undeniable, that there muſt be a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between our Principles, Doctrines and Converſations, truly ſtated and ſet forth in their proper Light, and when they were miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſometimes with all the Art and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Malice that Men were capable of: And this has been the Way our Adverſaries have treated us, almoſt in every thing we have believed, ſaid or writ, although it was very agreeable to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>We returned back by <hi>Salem, Lynn</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> and viſited Friends in our Way, and at <hi>Rhode-Iſland, Long-Iſland</hi> and <hi>New-York;</hi> and we had many good Meetings and ſome large in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> where I had ſome Diſcourſe with a Juſtice of the Peace about <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> but he did not hold it long before he gave up; and I had another at <hi>Allens</hi> Town with a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> which held for ſome Hours, about <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and concerning <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and he alſo ſoon gave up as to the firſt; but when he began about <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> I ſaid, I thought it was the moſt pernicious Doctrine that ever was broached in the World, it did ſo oppoſe the very Nature of God, and his Deſign of creating of Man, which, with all his other Works, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:018158_0237_0FA560F8D41C50C0"/>good and bleſſed; and that Man, as the Crown and Glory of all his Works which he had created, ſhould be deſigned for the moſt miſerable End, was unaccountable; I urged many Scriptures againſt that Doctrine, as alſo the Confuſion they were in about it, as that of their <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, wherein they ſay, <hi>That the Decree is ſo certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, that one cannot be added to the Number of the Elect, or diminiſhed from the Number of the Reprobate;</hi> and yet you tell us, <hi>that God hath ordained the Means to effect his Ends:</hi> I then ſaid, this Suppoſition of a Decree for the Means, as well as the End, ſeems intended to make the Prieſts and their Service neceſſary; but yet if they cannot alter the Decree, what Benefit or Advantage can there be to Men by their Services or Performance? I hope none will think that a Service to Mankind, to ſtrengthen or confirm that Decree if it were in their Power to do it, which I am ſatisfied it is not; becauſe no ſuch Decree was made or is in being; the oppoſite appearing by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which he owned when I urged it) <hi>to wit,</hi> that the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> did affect all; and upon the Parity of Reaſon, the <hi>Coming</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did reach as far; becauſe, <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> he taſted Death <hi>for every Man,</hi> was a <hi>Propitiation for the Sins of all;</hi> and where then wilt thou find a People that is not included? But if thou canſt find in, and prove by plain Scripture, that there is ſuch a People not included in theſe general Aſſertions,

                  </gap>s appeared much ſatisfied, and we parted friendly. He came next Day ſeveral Miles to a Meeting which I had appointed; the Man was counted a wiſe and ſober Man, and was under ſome Convincement, and behaved well.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and had many good Meetings in that Part, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear and willing to return, I took leave of Friends in a loving and tender Frame of Spirit, and embarked on board a Ship, whereof <hi>Samuel Flower</hi> was Maſter, the 1ſt of the Third Month 1733 at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Briſtol</hi> the 18th of the Fourth Month follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was glad we got ſafe to <hi>England,</hi> having been ſeven Weeks in our Paſſage; I got Home on the 6th of the Sixth Month, and was truly thankful to the Lord, who had preſerved me in theſe long Travels and Labours of Love, through many Difficulties; but the Lord's Power is ſufficient to bear up and carry through all, Renowned be his worthy Name over all, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>A remarkable DELIVERANCE which happened to me, being omitted in its proper Place, I think fit to inſert here, which was as follows:</p>
               <p>In the Year 1718 and the Twelfth Month, when <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> was viſiting Friends in our Parts, he lodged with me, and I went with

                  </gap> their Guide to <hi>Whitby,</hi> and ſtaid their Firſt day's Meeting, and Second-day's Preparative Meeting; and on the Third-day I went on with Friends towards <hi>Scarborough,</hi> to have the better Road Home, there having fallen a great deal of Snow while we were at <hi>Whitby,</hi> ſo that it was looked upon impracticable for me to return the ſame Way home that I came, it being a mooriſh, bad Way: But in our Way back, within a Mile or little more from <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> we came to a Brook, which by reaſon of the exceſſive Rain and Snow was higher than ever I had ſeen it, ſo that when we came to ride thro' it, <hi>Henry Levins,</hi> our Guide, firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in, being mounted upon a very ſtrong large Horſe, and got over with ſome Difficulty, and I followed him; but when I came about the middle of the fording Place, it took my Mare off her Feet, and ſomething being in the way, it turned her upon her Broadſide, ſo that I was diſmounted and carried away by the Rapidity of the Stream; but there being a Foot-bridge a little below, about Knee deep under Water, and no Rail either to be a Guide, or to lay a Hand on, and the Water being reduced to a narrow Compaſs, hurried me vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently along, and drove me with my Breaſt againſt the Bridge with ſuch Force, that it very near knocked the Breath out of me; but before I touched the Bridge I happened to hold up my Hand, and <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> ſeeing the Danger I was in, jumped off his Horſe, and ran at a
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:018158_0240_0FA560FBB0EBDD60"/>venture (ſeeing the Water ripple) to hit the Bridge, and juſt caught hold of my Fingers, and held my Head above Water, until <hi>Henry Levins,</hi> who was got over, came to his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>But by the Strength of the Water in my Boot-tops, they being large, and by a Nail (in the Timber under the Bridge) catching hold of my great Coat, which held me faſt, it was impoſſible for one Man to free me, and not without ſome Difficulty for them both to get me out, the Nail holding ſo faſt that it tore out a great Piece of my Coat, Lining and all; but upon <hi>Henry</hi>'s diſmounting, his Horſe ran away to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> (and mine ſwam back to the Company) and when they had got me out, <hi>Henry</hi> ran on foot to get his Horſe, and found him at the Stable Door where he uſed to ſtand, and in the mean Time <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> kept me in Motion by dragging me along, having very little or ſometimes no Hopes of my Recovery. When the Horſe returned, they got me back to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> but I was not ſenſible how, and they had me to <hi>Dorothy Jaques</hi>'s Houſe, and when there, they could perceive my Lips move, but could not hear what I ſaid, until one laid an Ear cloſe to my Mouth, and ſo underſtood that I ſaid, <hi>If they gave me any Thing that was ſtrong, it would carry me off;</hi> which made them very cautious: However, they ſtript me and changed my Shirt, and put me into a warmed Bed, and applied warm Flannel to my
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:018158_0241_0FA560FC7616C570"/>Feet for three Hours together, which I knew nothing of, being then altogether ſenſeleſs.</p>

                  <hi>Iſaac Skelton,</hi> who had been a Companion of mine, in the Service of the Truth, through ſeveral Counties, hearing of this Accident, came immediately and got into Bed to me, and kept me cloſe in his Boſom, which many thought was a great Means to preſerve my Life. <hi>John Dodgſon,</hi> though he intended for the Monthly-meeting, expreſſed ſo great a Concern for me, that he ſaid, <hi>He would either ſee me in a Way of Recovery, or die, before he left me;</hi> yet it pleaſed the Lord, of his infinite Mercy ſo wonderfully to raiſe me up again, as to enable me to be at the Meeting next Day, and alſo to bear ſome Teſtimony, which was very acceptable and comfortable to Friends, as it was alſo to ſee me there beyond their Expectation; but yet I was much troubled with Pain, the fleſhy Part of my Shoulder being rent by the violent hauling me out of the Water.</p>
               <p>In Gratitude, my Soul can do no leſs than praiſe and magnify the Lord for this great Deliverance, and all his other Mercies, who alone is worthy. And I cannot but take Notice of Friends Kindneſs and Goodwill to me, in doing whatſoever they could for me, but more eſpecially my worthy Friend <hi>John Dodgſon,</hi> who hazarded his Life to ſave mine.</p>
