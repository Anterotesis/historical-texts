            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE right education of youth, being a point of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the preſent and ſucceeding generations, it is to be regretted, that the want of proper books for the uſe of ſchools, ſhould have been ſo general a ſubject of complaint; and that very few attempts have been made to ſupply this deficiency, by introducing ſomething on ſuch a plan, as might, beſides improving the underſtandings and morals, inſtructively amuſe the vacant hours of young people, and have a tendency to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the taſk of teaching a more agreeable employment.</p>
            <p>WITH a view to theſe objects, the following Miſcellaneous Compilation is now offered to the public. Moſt of the extracts which compoſe it, were collected ſome years ago, from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of authors, by a perſon who had no other intention, at the time, but that of preſerving them for her own peruſal and amuſement; and who, from motives wholly diſintereſted, has lately, at the requeſt of her friends, conſented to their publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a hope, that if they are favourably received, it may prove an incitement to ſome perſon of greater abilities, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this or a better plan, whereby our ſchools may be furniſhed with a book more deſerving their acceptance.</p>
            <p>IT gives ſome concern to the compiler, that ſhe neglected to diſtinguiſh the different parts, with the names of their authors, at the time they were ſelected, as it is not now in her power to ſupply the omiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:020526_0003_0FAFE0BF78F4B428"/>THE editor has thought it neceſſary to remark, that a few verbal alterations have been made in ſome of the extracts, the better to adapt them to the uſe of the preſent deſign; but as the ſentiments and tenor of the original pieces are not thereby materially changed, it is hoped this freedom will be excuſed by their reſpective authors, to whom not the leaſt injury or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence has been intended.</p>

            <l>What numbers too have clos'd their eyes,</l>
            <l>No more to ſee the light!</l>
            <l>Sound was my ſleep, my dreams were gay,</l>
            <l>How ſhort ſuch time review'd!</l>
            <l>My night ſtole unperceiv'd away;</l>
            <l>I'm like the day renew'd.</l>
            <l>This day thy fav'ring hand be nigh,</l>
            <l>So oft vouchſaf'd before;</l>
            <l>Still may it lead, protect, ſupply,</l>

            <p>THE duties of religion, ſincerely and regularly performed, will always be ſufficient to exalt the meaneſt, and to exerciſe the higheſt underſtanding. That mind will never be vacant, which is frequently recalled by ſtated duties to meditations on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts; nor can any hour be long, which is ſpent in obtaining ſome new qualification for celeſtial happineſs.</p>
            <p>TO love an enemy, is the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of a religion, which is not of man but of God. It could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as a precept, only by him who lived and died to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it by his example.</p>
            <p>IF thou doſt good to man, as an evidence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be exalted from moral to divine; and that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which is the foretaſte of paradiſe, will be thy reward upon earth.</p>

—Thus our bleſſed Saviour opened his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the mount; and from his example we may be aſſured, that humility is the richeſt garment that the ſoul can wear. By this word is to be underſtood, not an abject poorneſs of ſpirit, that would ſtoop to do a mean thing; but ſuch an humble ſenſe of human nature, as ſets the heart and affections right towards God, and gives us every temper that is tender and affectionate towards our fellow creatures. This is the ſoil of all virtues, where every thing that is good and lovely grows.</p>

            <p>INDUSTRY is needful in every condition of life; we cannot, without it, act in any ſtate to the benefit or ſatisfaction of others, or to our own advantage and comfort; it is requiſite for procuring eaſe and ſatisfaction to the mind; and if attended with a good conſcience, ſweetens our enjoyments, and ſeaſons our attainments; and is a guard to innocence, and a bar to temptation.</p>
            <p>A PERSON under the influence and temper of the goſpel, will ſay with gratitude and joy, "I have learned, in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content." In the moſt trying circumſtances, I have a ſure and certain promiſe, that my bread ſhall be given, and my water ſhall be ſure; and if I am not favoured with all the elegancies of life, yet I am confident that the God whom I ſerve, will afford me ſuch temporary ſupplies, as ſhall be moſt conducive to my own happineſs and his glory.</p>
            <p>TRUE religion will ſhew its influence in every part of our conduct; it is like the ſap of a living tree, which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to the moſt diſtant boughs.</p>
            <p>ACTION keeps the ſoul in conſtant health, but idleneſs corrupts and ruſts the mind; for a man of great abilities may by negligence and idleneſs become ſo uſeleſs as to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance to ſociety and a burthen to himſelf.</p>
            <p>HE is the moſt worthy of poſſeſſing riches, who knows beſt how to do without them.</p>
            <p>KEEP no company with a man who is given to detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to hear him patiently, is to partake of his guilt, and prompt him to a continuance in that vice which all good men ſhun him for.</p>

            <p>CIVILITY overacted, is always ſuſpicious. A blaſt of thorns begins in a blaze, and ſoon ends in a ſmoke; but a fire made of proper materials, deſigned to be uſeful and laſting, at its firſt kindling breaks out from a cloud of ſmoke, and grows clearer and brighter as it burns.</p>
            <p>PLUTARCH (in his book of friendſhip) directs us, to "make a trial of our friends, as of our money, and to be equally cautious of chooſing both." Tacitus tells us, that "the longer a friendſhip is contracted, ſo much the ſurer and more firm it is." From this we may collect, that an old friend is always to be moſt valued, the beſt to be loved, and the firſt to be truſted.</p>
            <p>THE duties that are owing to friends, are integrity, love, counſel and aſſiſtance. It is not intimacy, and frequency of converſation, that makes a friend, but a diſintereſted obſervance of theſe duties.</p>

            <p>THERE is nothing more diſagreeable, than continual jeſting. By endeavouring to purchaſe the reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſant, a man loſes the advantage of being thought wiſe.</p>
            <p>IT is ungenerous to give a perſon occaſion to bluſh at his own ignorance in any one thing, who perhaps may excel us in many.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt wiſdom of ſpeech, is to know when, and what, and where to ſpeak; the time, matter and manner. The next to it, is ſilence.</p>
            <p>AS we ſhould never conſtrue that in earneſt, which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in jeſt, ſo we ſhould not ſpeak that in jeſt, which may be conſtrued in earneſt.</p>
            <p>THE talent of turning men into ridicule, and expoſing thoſe we converſe with, is the qualification of little, ungenerous tempers. What an abſurd thing it is to paſs over all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable parts of a man, and fix our attention on his infirmities; to obſerve his imperfections more than his virtues!</p>
            <p>AS, amongſt wiſe men, he is the wiſeſt who thinks he knows leaſt, ſo, amongſt fools, he is the greateſt who thinks he knows moſt.</p>
            <p>THERE is far more ſatisfaction in doing, than receiving good. To relieve the oppreſſed, is the moſt glorious act a man is capable of; it is in ſome meaſure doing the buſineſs of God and Providence; and is attended with a Heavenly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, unknown but to thoſe that are beneficent and liberal.</p>

            <p>THE moſt excellent of all moral virtues, is to have a low eſteem of ourſelves, which has this particular advantage, that it attracts not the envy of others.</p>
            <p>IF a man ſhould forſake a kingdom, and all the world, if he cannot renounce himſelf, he has hardly done any thing.</p>
            <p>WHATSOEVER convenience may be thought to be in falſhood and diſſimulation, it is ſoon over; but the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of it is perpetual, becauſe it brings a man under a continual jealouſy and ſuſpicion; ſo that he is not believed when he ſpeaks truth, nor truſted, when perhaps he means honeſtly.</p>

Let thy law, Almighty! be the rule, and thy glory the conſtant end, of all I do. Let me not build virtue on any notions of honour, but of honour to thy name. Let me not ſink piety in the boaſt of benevolence; my love of God in the love of my fellow-creatures. Can good be of human growth! No—it is thy gift, Almighty, and All-good! Let not thy bounties remove the donor from my thought; nor the love of pleaſures make me forſake the fountain from which they flow. When joys entice, let me aſk their title to my heart: When evils threaten, let me ſee thy mercy ſhining through the cloud, and diſcern the great hazard of having all to my wiſh. In an age of ſuch licentiouſneſs, let me not take comfort from the number of thoſe who do amiſs; an omen rather of public ruin, than of private ſafety. Let the joys of the multitude leſs allure than alarm me; and their danger, not example, determine my choice. In this day of domineering pleaſures, ſo lower my taſte as to make me reliſh the comforts of life. And in this day of diſſipation, O give me thought ſufficient to preſerve me from being ſo deſperate, as in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual flux of things, and as perpetual ſwarm of accidents, to depend on to-morrow; a dependence that is the ruin of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as that is of eternity.

his benevolence hath appointed, in the nature of things, a probability of ſucceſs.

The contemplation of divine mercy and power, and the exerciſe of virtue, are in their own nature ſo far from exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all gladneſs of heart, that they are the principal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſources of it.</p>

            <p>EVERY thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon; and it is the wiſdom of the prudent, ſo to order the duties of their general callings as Chriſtians, and thoſe of their particular callings in the world, as that they may not claſh or interfere.</p>
            <p>IT is related of the pious Philip Henry, that if any aſked his charity, whoſe repreſentation of their caſe he did not like, or who he thought did amiſs to take that courſe, he would firſt give them an alms, and then mildly reprove them; labouring to convince them that they were out of the way of duty; that they could not expect God ſhould bleſs them in it, and would not chide, but reaſon with them. He would ſay, if he ſhould tell them of their faults, and not give them an alms, the reproof would look only like an excuſe to deny his charity, and would be rejected accordingly.</p>
            <p>TO be over ſolicitous after praiſe, to be greedy of it, and eager in purſuing it, and to ſeem in ſome meaſure to beg it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being the character of a great ſoul, is the moſt certain ſign of a vain and light diſpoſition, which feeds upon the wind, and takes the ſhadow for the ſubſtance.</p>

            <p>IF it were only for mere human reaſons, it would turn to a better account, to be patient; nothing defeats the malice of an enemy, like a ſpirit of forbearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be ſo effectually provoking.

Theſe are of higher worth, than all the documents of learning; of dearer price, than all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which can be derived from the moſt refined and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mode of education.</p>
            <p>THE beſt of men, and the beſt of books, can do us good, only ſo far as they turn us from themſelves, and every human comfort, to ſeek and receive every kind of good, from God alone.</p>

            <p>IT is a certain ſign of an ill heart, to be inclined to defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. They who are harmleſs and innocent, can have no gratification that way; but it ever ariſes from a neglect of what is laudable in a man's ſelf, and an impatience of ſeeing it in another.</p>
            <p>TO forbear replying to an unjuſt reproach, and overlook it, with a generous, or (if poſſible) with an entire neglect of it, is one of the moſt heroic acts of a great mind.</p>
            <p>EVERY appearance of amiable ſimplicity, or of honeſt ſhame, nature's haſty conſcience, will be dear to ſenſible hearts; they will carefully cheriſh every ſuch indication in a young fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; for they will perceive, that it is this temper, wiſely culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, which will one day make her enamoured of the lovelineſs of virtue and the beauty of holineſs; from which ſhe will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a taſte for the doctrines of religion, and a ſpirit to perform the duties of it.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:020526_0145_0FAFE557810DC298"/>THE hypocriſy of aſſuming virtues, which are not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the heart, prevents the growth and diſcloſure of thoſe real ones, which it is the great end of education to cultivate.</p>
            <p>GOOD diſpoſitions, of themſelves, will go but a very little way, unleſs they are confirmed into good principles. And this cannot be effected, but by a careful courſe of religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and a patient and laborious cultivation of the moral temper.</p>
            <p>IN the great and univerſal concern of religion, both ſexes, and all ranks, are equally intereſted. The truly catholic ſpirit of Chriſtianity accommodates itſelf, with an aſtoniſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, to the circumſtances of the whole human race.</p>
            <p>LET no miſtaken girl fancy ſhe gives a proof of her wit, by her want of piety; or that a contempt of things ſerious and ſacred, will exalt her underſtanding, or raiſe her character, even in the opinion of the moſt avowed male infidels.</p>
            <p>CICERO ſpoke it as the higheſt commendation of Cato's character, that he embraced philoſophy, not for the ſake of diſputing like a philoſopher, but of living like one. The chief purpoſe of Chriſtian knowledge, is to promote the great end of a Chriſtian life.</p>

An amiable example of which our Saviour affords us in the parable of the good Samaritan, who had a much better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for neglecting the diſtreſſed traveller, than either the prieſt, or the Levite, viz.

            <p>SELFISHNESS may indifferently happen to be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an action, that, in itſelf, is either good or evil, either
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:020526_0148_0FAFE559C611CD70"/>
hurtful or beneficent. But, as far as ſelfiſhneſs, merely, is a motive to any action, it never had, nor can have, any relation to virtue. We muſt ſearch ſomewhat deeper for the root of that tree, which is productive of this divine fruit.</p>
            <p>ALL who would pleaſe the great, muſt be flatterers; but the true province of friendſhip is, to put us in mind of our own faults.</p>
            <p>MEEKNESS makes any condition tolerable and eaſy to be endured. He that meekly bears any ſuffering, takes off the edge of it, that it cannot wound him; whereas he that frets and rages at it, whets it, and makes it much ſharper than it would otherwiſe be.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid of our bleſſed Saviour, that "he was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter; that when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, threatened not." And if he, the Lord of glory, ſuffered thus meekly and unjuſtly from his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with what face can we ever complain of any injury done to us?</p>
            <p>BE very watchful over thine heart, and never ſuffer it to ſeed on the fancy of thy own worth; but whenever any ſuch thought ariſes, beat it down immediately, with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſome of thy follies or ſins, and ſo make this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pride an occaſion of humility.</p>
            <p>NEVER compare thyſelf with thoſe thou thinkeſt more fooliſh or more wicked, that ſo thou mayeſt, like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, extol thyſelf for being better; but if thou wilt compare, do it with the wiſe and godly; and then thou wilt find thou comeſt ſo far ſhort, as may help to pull down thy high eſteem of thyſelf.</p>
            <p>POVERTY is apt to betray a man into envy, riches into arrogance; poverty is too often attended with fraud, vicious compliance, repining, murmur and diſcontent.

            <p>A LITTLE eſteem of one's lelf, hinders a great deal from others; boaſting may gain applauſe from fools, but it puts a wiſe man to the expence of a bluſh.</p>

            <p>NO revenge is more heroic, than that which torments envy by doing good.</p>
            <p>IT is in vain for him to pretend to love either God or man' who loves his money ſo much better, that he will ſee his poor brother (who is a man, and bears the image of God) ſuffer all extremities, rather than part with any thing to relieve him.</p>
            <p>"He that giveth to the poor, lendeth unto the Lord"— and that too on ſolemn promiſe of repayment. "That which he hath given, will he pay him again."

            <p>Innumerable accidents there are, which may, in an inſtant, bring a rich man to beggary: And therefore, what courſe ſo prudent can we take for our wealth, as to put it out of the reach of thoſe accidents, by lending it to God, where we may be ſure to find it ready at our greateſt need, and that too with improvement and increaſe?</p>

            <p>AMONG the antient Romans, it was not the houſe which honoured the maſter, but the maſter the houſe. A cottage with them became as auguſt as a temple, when juſtice, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, probity, ſincerity, and honour, were lodged in it; and how can a houſe be called ſmall, which contains ſo many and ſuch great virtues?</p>

            <p>THE nobility ariſing from birth, is by far inferior to that which proceeds from merit.</p>
            <p>MARCUS Aurelius was averſe to every thing that had the air of pomp and luxury. He lay upon the bare ground; at twelve years old he took the habit of a Philoſopher; he forbore the uſe of guards, the imperial ornaments, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of honour, which were carried before the Caeſars and the Auguſti. Nor was this conduct owing to his ignorance of what was grand and beautiful, but to the juſter and purer taſte he had of both, and to an intimate perſuaſion, that the greateſt glory, and principal duty of man, eſpecially if in power, and eminently conſpicuous, is ſo far to imitate the Deity, as to throw himſelf into a condition of wanting as little as may be for himſelf, and doing all the good to others he is capable of.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhews a greatneſs of ſoul to overlook our own nobility, and not ſuffer it to gain the aſcendant over our actions, we may likewiſe obſerve, that it is no leſs great in ſuch as have raiſed themſelves by merit, not to forget the meanneſs of their extraction, nor be aſhamed of it.</p>
            <p>WE read in the ſcriptures, that Boaz, in the midſt of riches, was laborious, diligent in huſbandry, plain without luxury, delicacy, ſloth or pride. How affable, how obliging and kind to his ſervants! "The Lord be with you," ſays he to his reapers; and they anſwered him, "the Lord bleſs thee." This was the beautiful language of religious antiquity; but how little known in our days.</p>
            <p>How commendable was his behaviour towards Ruth, when he deſires her not to go into any other field to glean, but to abide faſt by his maidens, to eat and drink with them, and the charitable order he gives his reapers to let her glean even among the ſheaves, and to let fall ſome of the handfuls on purpoſe for her that ſhe might gather them up without being aſhamed; teaching us by this wiſe conduct, to ſave thoſe we oblige, the confuſion of receiving, and ourſelves the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vain-glory in giving.</p>

            <p>IT is of the laſt importance to ſeaſon the paſſions of a child with devotion, which ſeldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it.

The fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and ſmothered.</p>
            <p>PURE devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more ſublime ideas, than any that are to be met with in the moſt exalted ſcience; and at the ſame time warms and agitates the ſoul more than ſenſual pleaſure.</p>

            <p>IT behoves us to accuſtom ourſelves to a ſober, modeſt way of ſpeaking, and to avoid all thoſe modes of ſpeech, which border upon, or naturally lead to falſhood.</p>
            <p>BE careful to practiſe nothing which you are aſhamed of; to do nothing for which you need be afraid of the eye or ear of God, and the world, then will you be under no temptation of lying, to conceal what you have done amiſs.</p>

            <p>SINCERITY is firm and ſubſtantial, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hollow or unſound in it; and becauſe it is plain and open, fears no diſcovery; of which the crafty man is always in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>PLUTARCH has written an eſſay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies; and mentions this in particular, "that, by the reproaches caſt upon us we ſee the worſt ſide of ourſelves, and open our eyes to ſeveral blemiſhes and defects in our lives and converſations, which we ſhould not have obſerved without the help of ſuch ill-natured monitors."</p>
            <p>LET us "keep the heart with all diligence, ſeeing out of it are the iſſues of life." Let us account our mind the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant province which is committed to our care; and as we cannot rule events, ſtudy at leaſt to rule ourſelves.</p>
            <p>IT is too common with the young, even when they reſolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to ſet out with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous confidence in themſelves. Truſting to their own abilities, for carrying them ſucceſsfully through life, they are careleſs of applying to God, or of deriving any aſſiſtance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy diſcipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them?"</p>
            <p>Neither human wiſdom, nor human virtue, unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by religion, are equal for the trying ſituations which
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:020526_0174_0FAFE571069D7370"/>
often occur in life. By the ſhock of temptation, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have the moſt virtuous intentions been overthrown! Under the preſſure of diſaſter, how often has the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſunk! Deſtitute of the favour of God, you are in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſituation, with all your boaſted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackleſs deſart, without any guide to conduct them, or any ſhelter to cover them from the gathering ſtorm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not that your happineſs can be independent of him who made you. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, ſeek the protection of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>THE cheerfulneſs of a well-regulated mind, ſprings from a good conſcience, and the favour of Heaven, and is bounded by temperance and reaſon. It makes a man happy in himſelf, and promotes the happineſs of all around him. It is the clear and calm ſunſhine of a mind illuminated by piety and virtue. It crowns all other good diſpoſitions, and comprehends the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral effect which they ought to produce on the heart.</p>
            <p>LET no man raſhly determine, that his unwillingneſs to be pleaſed, is a proof of underſtanding, unleſs his ſuperiority appears from a leſs doubtful evidence; for though peeviſhneſs may ſometimes boaſt its deſcent from learning or from wit, it is much oftener of baſe extraction, the child of vanity and nurſling of ignorance.</p>
            <p>LET the virtuous remember, amidſt all their ſufferings, that though the heart of the good man may bleed, even to death, he will never feel a torment equal to the rendings of remorſe.</p>
            <p>PLATO being told, that he had many enemies who ſpoke ill of him, "It is no matter, ſaid he, I will live ſo that none ſhall believe them." Hearing, at another time, that an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend of his had ſpoken detractingly of him, "I am ſure he would not do it, ſays he, if he had not ſome reaſon for it." This is the ſureſt, as well as the nobleſt way, of drawing the ſting out of a reproach, and the true method of preparing a
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:020526_0175_0FAFE571C8E16060"/>
man for that great and only relief againſt the pains of calumny, a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>JUDGE not of mankind in general from the conduct of a few individuals. There are perſons capable of alleviating all our cares by a friendly participation, and of heightening every ſatisfaction by ſharing them. Cultivate an acquaintance with the truly deſerving, and the painful remembrance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude will ſoon be loſt in the reciprocal endearments of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friendſhip.</p>
            <p>DOST thou aſk a torch to diſcover the brightneſs of the morning? Doſt thou appeal to argument for proofs of divine perfection? Look down to the earth on which thou ſtandeſt, and lift up thine eye to the worlds that roll above thee: Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt ſplendour, abundance and beauty; is not he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them mighty? Thou conſidereſt—is not he who formed thy underſtanding, wiſe? Thou enjoyeſt—is not he who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies thy ſenſes, good?

            <p>RELIGION preſcribes to every miſerable man, the means of bettering his condition; it ſhews him, that the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them; it makes him eaſy here, becauſe it can make him happy hereafter.</p>
            <p>A CONTENTED mind is the greateſt bleſſing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the preſent life his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſes from the ſubduing of his deſires, it will ariſe in the next from the gratification of them.</p>
            <p>EVERY wiſe man will conſider this life only as it may conduce to the happineſs of the other, and cheerfully ſacrifice the pleaſures of a few years to thoſe of an eternity.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER far ſome men may have gone in the ſcience of impartiality, perhaps there is not one of them but would be ſurprized, if he could be ſhewn how much farther he might go.</p>

            <p>THE Providence of Almighty God, has placed you under difficult circumſtances of life, and daily reads you a leſſon in a more particular manner to depend upon him. This you may be aſſured of for your comfort, that you are under God's conſtant and immediate care: And one advantage you enjoy above the rich, in your journey to Heaven, is, that you are not clogged and hindered in your courſe thither, by thoſe manifold incumbrances which lie on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom our Saviour hath ſaid, "That it is very hard for them to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven." Their temptations are proportioned to their abundance; their cares are more and their diſtractions greater; ſo that you have no reaſon to envy them, nor repine at your own condition; and theſe are chiefly your temptations, and againſt theſe you muſt be more particularly watchful. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if you conſider things aright, you will find that your ſtore-houſe is the moſt ſure, your ſupply moſt certain; for you are immediately in the hands of God, of him who feedeth the ravens, and cloatheth the graſs of the field; ſo that you may be much more aſſured that he will cloathe you. Endeavour to be humble, holy, Heavenly minded; always remembering, that he is the pooreſt man, who is poor in grace. Your Saviour had not where to lay his head; let his example ſerve to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile your low condition to you; and let your religious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour under it, be the means to ſanctify it.</p>

            <head>A Soliloquy on Death.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>TO die, is but to take a laſt farewel</l>
               <l>Of life, and all its tranſitory cares;</l>
               <l>To cloſe our eyes and ſhut out day forever.</l>
               <l>Thus much we know: And that this frail exiſtence</l>
               <l>Shall to its ſiſter earth again return,</l>
               <l>To pulverize, and be diſſolv'd to nought.</l>
               <l>To die (however awful ſeems the ſound)</l>
               <l>Is but to lay us peaceful down to reſt,</l>
               <l>Sink into ſleep, and waken in eternity.</l>
               <l>Whence then proceeds this coward fear of death,</l>
               <l>Theſe conſcience-working pangs, that plague us all,</l>
               <l>And make us ſink, e'en to the grave itſelf,</l>
               <l>At the bare mention? Has not that Great Cauſe,</l>
               <l>The Eternal One, whoſe wiſdom cannot err,</l>
               <l>From the beginning of the earlieſt time,</l>
               <l>Declar'd, that man and all his race, ſhould die?</l>
               <l>'Tis the eſſential paſſport that muſt bring</l>
               <l>(No matter when, or how, or ſoon, or late)</l>
               <l>All nature to that never-ending ſtate,</l>
               <l>Which immortality alone can give.</l>

                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:020526_0201_0FAFE492D75432D0"/>The ſoul, then, as inſtructed from above,</l>
               <l>Soon as it quits its lifeleſs, clay-cold corſe,</l>
               <l>Mounts on the borrow'd ſilver plumes of Heav'n,</l>
               <l>Thro' chequ'ring clouds, and ſoars above the ſtars.</l>
               <l>But, oh! who dare enquire its fate decreed?</l>
               <l>For Heav'n that knowledge interdicts to man,</l>
               <l>And ſtupifies the buſy, wand'ring ſenſe,</l>
               <l>That may attempt this ſecret to explore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>GRANT I may ever, at the morning ray,</l>
               <l>Open with pray'r the conſecrated day;</l>
               <l>Tune thy great praiſe, and bid my ſoul ariſe,</l>
               <l>And with the mounting ſun aſcend the ſkies;</l>
               <l>As that advances, let my zeal improve,</l>
               <l>And glow with ardour of conſummate love;</l>
               <l>Nor ceaſe at eve, but with the ſetting ſun</l>
               <l>My endleſs worſhip ſhall be ſtill begun.</l>

            <l>HAVE angels ſinn'd, and ſhall not man beware?</l>
            <l>How ſhall a ſon of earth decline the ſnare?</l>
            <l>Not folded arms, and ſlackneſs of the mind,</l>
