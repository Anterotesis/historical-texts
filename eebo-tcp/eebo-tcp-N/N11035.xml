            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>ADMINISTRATION has now "let ſlip the dogs of war, the helliſh Cerberus, with her three heads, Burgoyne, Howe, and Clinton, is ſailed. The dogmatic gooſe quil of the fallacious Dr. Johnſon, that hireling Quixote of an hireling miniſtry, has promulgated a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſentence of attainder againſt all revolutioniſts in Great-Britain;—Hear it ye Whigs,
<q>
                  <l>"And put in ev'ry honeſt hand a whip,</l>
                  <l>"To laſh the raſcal naked thro' the world."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This pitiful retailer of apologies for miniſterial treachery, has had the impudence to declare with the effrontery of a Sandwich, or a Denbigh, that whoever wiſhes ſucceſs to America is a traitor to his country.</p>
            <p>From this patriotic declaration, I preſume the redoubted Doctor is at length admitted into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana of the miniſtry. He pronounces with as
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013985_0002_0F9259A0B9A6B678"/>much inſolence as if he was aſſured of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to paſs a bill, (they have voices enough to do it,) for declaring a new ſpecies of treaſon, namely, the wiſhing ſucceſs to oppreſſed America. I will venture to ſay, that every revolutioniſt in England, Ireland, and the ſugar colonies, have long ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the pains and penalties of this law in embryo, if ſuch a one there be.</p>
            <p>No Engliſhman can wear two faces: Therefore if his Majeſty, ſhould for the future, ſee as much ill humour and contempt in the faces of his Engliſh and Iriſh ſubjects, as they obſerve in his, he muſt not be ſurpriſed. Bute and Mansfield, will inſtruct him that the aſpects and affections of a people are beneath the notice of a ſovereign who inherits them. But conſcience in the depth of night, will ſpeak another language, that will remind him, that he has rejected the ſupplications of millions in America, that he has at length aſſented to their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he has with an iron tongue and an iron heart, rung the knell of expiring America.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim of our law, (ſays the honeſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Forteſcue) that no man was ever yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or ſentenced by the mouth of the King himſelf:—'tis not ſo now,—the preſent ſovereign has been adviſed to declare preremptorily to his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating citizens of London, that,
<q>he is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to purſue the meaſures which his wiſe parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have recommended.</q> We know that theſe are not conciliating but deſtructive meaſures: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe meaſures America is either to be deſtroyed, or loſt forever to this nation.</p>
            <p>The late royal anſwer to the petition of the city of London, fairly interpreted, would run thus;
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013985_0003_0F9259A1ACEE0788"/>Let it ſpeak the language of deſpotiſm in deſpotic terms, viz.
<q>Slaves, by daring thus to remind us of our oppreſſions in America, you are yourſelves traitors; by this libellous petition you aid and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage rebels. It is the duty of loyal ſubjects paſſively to obey our will. Our will and pleaſure is revenge. This reſolve we think fit to notify by famine and the ſword. Theſe are the lenient meaſures, which our Divan has adviſed, and theſe we will purſue. Your confidence and affection we deſpiſe, we confide alone in the wiſdom of our Divan, by that great council your fancied rights and your deſpicable commerce are wiſely doomed, with our entire concurrence, to deſtruction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how eaſily a deluded chriſtian prince may ſpeak the language of an eaſtern tyrant; for this purpoſe we have fairly cloathed an eaſtern ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in an eaſtern garb; we have given the haughty ſovereign's plain meaning in proper words; we have not (like Lord Mansfield, who penned the vile harrangue) meanly ſuffered the ſentiments of an inſolent mogul to be cramped by the poverty of princely diction.</p>
            <p>Upon Bute's and Mansfield's plans, ſovereigns are divine vicegerents, ſent down from heaven, not in mercy, but in wrath, to indulge their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious luſts, and ſcourge mankind. Let ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, therefore, be conſiſtent with themſelves; let them equally diſdain the fetters of language and humanity—Let them ſpeak daggers to their people and ſalvation to their minions. But can ſuch a prince, conſcious that his parliament has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly ſmuggled, by a mean and execrable ſtrength of the prerogative, (a ſudden diſſolution)
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013985_0004_0F9259A3989507A0"/>for fear of a national aſſociation againſt future treachery; conſcious that the majority of his and his miniſter's great council (it is no national council) are a ſet of hirelings, filched into their ſeats, and corrupted to promote every deſpotic luſt of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded monarch; can ſuch a conſcious prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the doom of millions, not only without emotion, but with compoſed ſtupidity? This is not fortitude, but calloſity of ſoul.</p>
            <p>The whole European world is aſtoniſhed at our perſecution of America, even foreign, and deſpotic princes, upon this occaſion, have different feelings, from the father of that people who are deſtined to deſtruction: Even princes, who can ſend forth ſword and famine by a nod, are aſtoniſhed at our wicked policy, and abhor it; even the natural ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Great-Britain preſume to interfere with our infernal adminiſtration, they will not permit our government (without reproaches, inſults, threats, and animated declarations) to maſſacre mankind: France, under the maſk of humanity, preſumes to make us ſenſible of her great condeſcenſion, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and moderation, in ſuffering American murder to paſs on freely and without controul. She makes us underſtand that ſhe connives at this ſlaughter of our gallant ſubjects, for the ſake of cultivating a good underſtanding with the king of Great-Britain, and the whole Engliſh nation. But when ſhe finds (as ſhe ſhortly may) that this king and kingdom are divided and trying the claim of freedom together in the field with France, who profeſſes ſo much magnanimity and moderation, remain neuter? Her humanity, her honour will not ſuffer her. She will retaliate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013985_0005_0F9259A3D70CE8D0"/>in her government with the like ſtrokes of political humanity. Spain, who has ſo lately felt the force of Engliſh arms, will not permit us to turn them ſo unnaturally againſt ourſelves. She ſpeaks in plainer terms: Let his perſevering maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hear her humane menaces: She tells him bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſhe will not tie up her hands from relieving fellow creatures ſuffering under wanton unprovoked oppreſſion. Alas! blind, infatuated ſovereign.— Canſt thou not diſcern the tendency of this artful Spaniſh declaration? Does not Spain already hold out ſuccour to America? Will not injured and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing people embrace the offer? Will they not rather ſubmit to be aided by an enemy than mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a parent? Will they not ſooner change their names, their laws, their government, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in juſt reſentment, than enjoy theſe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modes, theſe ſounding nothings in a ſtate of ſlavery? Think again, wiſe Sire, before it is too late. Let me aſk thee, thou clement pious ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, are not the people, in whoſe favour Spain hath thus declared, thy fellow creatures alſo? Were they not under the juſt reign of your lamented grandfather, your fellow ſubjects too? Could he ariſe, one honeſt frown from him, would diſperſe your minions, annihilate your pride, blaſt your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable politics, and reſtore peace, commerce, and protection, to the tottering conſtitution of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh empire.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh nation is brave, her pretext for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing is a noble one; tho' merely political, it is to be preferred to that which is tyrannical; it has, at leaſt, a plauſible appearance, for it ſpeaks the language of juſtice, benevolence, and humanity.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:013985_0006_0F9259A48F24D8A8"/>We find neither of theſe ingredients in the rigid anſwer which lately repelled the petition of the city. <hi>Fas eſt et ab hoſte doceri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let Bute and Mansfield, the leaders of an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous adminiſtration, let their great council their parliament (I ſay again it is not the nation's) let the head conſtable of this kingdom (the dupe of all the herd) for once receive inſtructions from an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Spaniards diſtinguiſh juſtly between a ſovereign's right of reducing refractory ſubjects to juſt obedience, and making war upon humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants who petition for their rights. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a difference (and there is a wide one) between juſt reſiſtance and unnatural rebellion. They tell us in manly (to America they are tempting) terms that America ſhall not ſuffer unheared, unpitied, unredreſſed, and innocent. Tho' a venal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt majority, to gratify deſpotic ſpleen, have in a bloody act, ſtiled America rebellious, yet what ſanction can ſuch laws derive from venality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? Laws, to be ſacred and obligatory muſt be conſiſtent with the laws of God, nature, reaſon, found policy and the conſtitution of the kingdom. If they err in theſe reſpects, it is an error in the firſt concoction, they are abſolutely null and void in themſelves, and are no more to be regarded than "the laws of a parcel of drunken porters." I borrow this elegant compariſon from the mouth of a great man, who is, at one and the ſame time, a privy counſellor, a penſioner, a placeman, and a ſpeaker of the houſe of commons. Situations as compatible with that of ſpeaker, as obligatory laws are with venality and corruption.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay that rebellious ſubjects are not to be
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013985_0007_0F9259A92E2F0F20"/>chaſtiſed; but they muſt firſt rebel, all civil chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement beſides, muſt be inflicted by the hand of wiſdom and juſtice, not by the ſcourge of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor. The wanton power that aggreſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, ought not to puniſh, but redreſs. What poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical wiſdom is there in driving a whole territory, a great nation of obedient (tho' not paſſive) ſubjects to deſpair? What wiſdom in looſing or extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? What juſtice in refuſing to hear the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed delinquent before ſhe turned ſupplication into rage.</p>
            <p>America profeſſes all legal, but like the brave anceſtry from whence ſhe ſprings, diſdains paſſive obedience, ſhe honours and revers kings, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes and defies tyrants.</p>
            <p>If ſhe conquers ſhe will continue to ſupport the liberty ſhe wins, if ſhe falls, (believe me ye wretched, ye ſhallow miniſterial politicians!) ſhe will not fall unrevenged, the crowns of France and Spain, will not continue neuter, they will be the providential means of puniſhing our iniquity to America; they will embroil a civil war here, and aſſiſt it there, they will conquer England in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, they will be received there with open arms; in the laſt agonies of American deſpair, they will be received as conquerors, and uſurping tyranny, will be expelled forever.</p>
