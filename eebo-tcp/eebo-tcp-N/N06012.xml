            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>ISAIAH xxi. 11, 12.</bibl>
                  <p>The Burden of <hi>DUMAH.</hi> He calleth to me out of <hi>SEIR,</hi> Watchman, What of the Night? Watchman, What of the Night? The Watchman ſaid, The Morning cometh, and alſo the Night, if ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT may doubtleſs, at firſt View, appear ſtrange to my Brethren, that I have choſen this <hi>obſcure Paſſage</hi> of ſacred Writ for your Entertainment; when it might be expected, that the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Duties;</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> and <hi>Trials</hi> of the miniſterial Office ſhould be explained, or the beſt Method of ſecuring good Diſcipline and ſound Doctrine in the Church, laid open. Theſe Subjects, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels, are highly proper to be inſiſted on, and ſhould gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be the Topics of our Diſcourſe, on ſuch Occaſions as theſe. But, ſome dark Apprehenſions, as to the <hi>Times</hi> into which we are fallen, turned my Mind to this Subject: And as it will lead our Thoughts to the preſent <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Trials;</hi> to the farther <hi>Proſpects</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> relating to the Church of CHRIST, it will, I imagine, when properly explained and applied, be thought not unſuitable for thoſe, who are aſſembled to conſult its Welfare and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>WHAT I ſhall attempt, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> To explain the Woras, and illuſtrate the Propheſy, by ſuch hiſtorical Events, as ſeem to point out the Fulfilment of it, in its primary View.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007628_0003_102D771D700872A0"/>
               <hi>II.</hi> Apply it to the State of the Church in general, and to the Times into which we are fallen, in particular.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>enigmatical Propheſy,</hi> ſeems in its primary View, to denote ſome further Calamity on the IDUMEANS, after the JEWS ſhould be delivered from the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> they were then under; that while the <hi>Morning</hi> aroſe to the one, the <hi>Night</hi> ſhould be continued to the other. It is called the <hi>Burden</hi> of DUMAH, becauſe it brings ſad and dark Tydings, what would prove an heavy Burden, hard to be born. DUMAH here, by a Contraction not unuſual in the ſacred Writings, ſeems evidently to be put for EDOM; and ſo for the Country IDUMEA, where the EDOMITES dwelt. This appears plain, by SEIR's being mentioned as the Place from whence the <hi>Voice</hi> came, which was that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Part of IDUMEA, that lay next to the Land of CANAAN. The SEPTUAGINT therefore well tranſlate it, <hi>To' Horamatees Idumaias,</hi> i. e. the Viſion of IDUMEA. In this <hi>prophetic Scene,</hi> there is one from that Country intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as addreſſing the Prophet in great Earneſtneſs, about the State of the <hi>Night,</hi> or that <hi>State</hi> of Affliction and Oppreſſion, which both the JEWS and IDUMEANS were under. <hi>He calleth</hi> (or there is one that calleth, or crieth) <hi>to me out of</hi> SEIR. The Word muſt be taken <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively,</hi> not denoting a particular Perſon, q. d. <hi>there is a Cry,</hi> or <hi>the Voice of theſe that cry from that Country;</hi> this appears from the Anſwer of the Prophet, <hi>If ye will enquire, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis obſerved that the original Word <hi>Karah,</hi> has an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in it, and denotes the <hi>Cry</hi> of Men in Anguiſh and Diſtreſs, impatiently waiting to ſee the End of their <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and the <hi>Dawn</hi> of the Morning of their Deliverance. This ſhews a Beauty in the <hi>ſcenical Repreſentation;</hi> as the Prophet is on the Watch-Tower among the JEWS, at a great Diſtance from <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> the Voice muſt be loud, in order to be heard. The Queſtion follows, <q>
                  <hi>Watchman, What of the Night,</hi> or from, or concerning the <hi>Night?</hi>
               </q> The Conjecture of COCCEIUS, and ſome other <hi>learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators,</hi> that the <hi>Voice</hi> is directed to GOD the Father, under the Character of <hi>a Watchman,</hi> becauſe he is ſtiled
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007628_0004_102D7712573FA518"/>the <hi>Keeper of</hi> ISRAEL; or to the SON, who is repreſented as the <hi>Shepherd of his People,</hi> I think groundleſs. It is not ſuppoſable, that the <hi>Idumeans</hi> had any ſuch diſtinct Notion of the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>Son,</hi> as to addreſs <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> by this Title.—To apply it to the <hi>Prophet himſelf,</hi> ſeems much more natural; the Prophets being well known by the Character of <hi>Watchmen,</hi> as pointing out the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of their Office: And thus they are frequently ſtiled in <hi>ſacred Writ,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">ISAI, lxii, 6.</note> 
               <hi>I have ſet Watchmen on thy Walls, O</hi> JERU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALEM, <q>
                  <hi>I have made thee,</hi> ſays GOD to EZEKIEL, <hi>a Watchman to the Houſe of</hi> ISRAEL.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">EZEK. iii, 17.</note> The <hi>Character</hi> is taken from thoſe that are ſet to <hi>guard a City,</hi> or on a <hi>Watch-Tower</hi> to deſcry approaching Danger, and give the Signal: And they ought to be Men of <hi>Courage,</hi> that will not be frighted at the Shaking of a Leaf; <hi>faithful,</hi> who will not betray their Truſt; <hi>vigilant,</hi> that will not ſuffer the Enemy to come by Surprize while they are aſleep; <hi>quick ſighted,</hi> to ſpy the Danger; <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>unwearied</hi> in their Attendance on the <hi>Duties</hi> of their Station; and being continually awake, it might be expected could readily give the <hi>Hour</hi> of the <hi>Night.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to ſee how applicable this is, not only to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but to all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, who are ſet as <hi>Watchmen, on the Walls of</hi> GOD's <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> whoſe <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs</hi> it is, to watch over the Heritage of the Lord; to give ſeaſonable, plain and faithful Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints and Sinners. The various remarkable <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> of GOD to his <hi>Church,</hi> were revealed to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> they foretold the <hi>deſolating Judgments</hi> that were brought not only on the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the neighbouring <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> knew ſomething of the Time, Manner and Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>dark Night</hi> they had to paſs through; and ſo might properly be enquired of as to this Matter—<hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, What of the Night?</hi> What have you diſcovered as to the State of the <hi>Night?</hi> How far is it advanced? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains? Do you diſcern any Signs of the <hi>Morning?</hi> Any
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007628_0005_102D771F53784890"/>Signs that the preſent Scene of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> will ſoon be over? The Queſtion is undoubtedly not about a <hi>natural</hi> but <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> Night,—that State of <hi>Calamity</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Idumeans</hi> were under by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> or, that <hi>dark Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> the End of which was then expected, and earneſtly deſired. The <hi>Repetition</hi> of it, repreſents the <hi>Panic</hi> they were in; their <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> or rather their <hi>Impatience,</hi> for an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps ſeem ſtrange at <hi>firſt View,</hi> that the <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means</hi> ſhould make this Inquiry. What had they to do with the <hi>Prophets</hi> or the <hi>divine Oracles?</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">EPM, ii, 12.</note> Who were <hi>Aliens from the Common-Wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Strangers from the Covenant of Promiſe.</hi>—But, the Difficulty will vaniſh, if we conſider that the Scheme of this Propheſy is <hi>emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> and <hi>figurative.</hi> The <hi>Idumeans</hi> are introduced here by the <hi>Prophet,</hi> as breathing after Deliverance under their <hi>Calamities,</hi> and making ſuch anxious Inquiries as it is natural to ſuppoſe a People in their <hi>Situation</hi> would; and hearing that Deliverance was expected by the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> it was natural for them to deſire to know the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of it, in Hopes they alſo might Share in its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.—To this may be added—That the eaſtern Nations had a Veneration for the <hi>Prophets of the</hi> GOD <hi>of</hi> Iſrael, whoſe Fame was ſpread among them. And if we apply it to the then <hi>dark State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> an Enquiry reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more glorious Diſpenſation, in which themſelves, and all the <hi>gentile World</hi> were concerned, comes from them with ſingular Propriety. Some ſuppoſe the Queſtion put by way of <hi>Deriſion,</hi> but I think without Foundation; had that been the Caſe, the <hi>Prophet</hi> would have given them a very different Anſwer. They ſeem to have a Degree of <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> about the Matter, and yet do not enquire with that <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſuch <hi>religious Views</hi> as they ought. This is evident from the <hi>Prophets</hi> reply. <hi>The Morning cometh, and alſo the Night, of ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</hi> (i. e.) The <hi>Morning</hi> will be as dangerous as the <hi>Night,</hi> ſay ſome. Others tranſlate it, the <hi>Morning</hi> cometh, and yet
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007628_0006_102D771423B9F730"/>it is <hi>Night.</hi> i. e. Tho' there be a Deliverance from preſent Calamities, yet it will be but <hi>partial; Light</hi> comes, but <hi>Darkneſs</hi> will be intermixed with it; or according to our Tranſlation, <hi>The Morning cometh, but the Night will ſoon ſucceed.</hi> It may mean, That tho' the <hi>Morning</hi> is coming to the <hi>People of</hi> GOD, it would ſtill be <hi>Night</hi> with the <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to ſee, that as <hi>Night</hi> is put for a State of <hi>Affliction, Day</hi> is a proper Emblem of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort. If ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</hi> The old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation under <hi>Henry the</hi> VIIIth, has it thus, <q>
                  <hi>If ye will enquire indeed, and aſk Queſtions in Earneſt, enquire of</hi> GOD; firſt aſk his Mercy, and then come again, and you ſhall have a more favourable Anſwer,</q> which ſeems not far from the true Meaning.</p>
            <p>As the Queſtion, tho' not put with that Seriouſneſs and Sincerity as it ought, implied a Deſire to know the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of GOD relating to their <hi>preſent</hi> dark and diſmal Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the Anſwer ſeems to be to this Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Since you <hi>Idumeans,</hi> in your diſtreſſed Condition, ſeem to come to yourſelves, expreſs a Deſire of returning to GOD, and knowing his <hi>Will</hi> concerning you, be in earneſt in the Matter, enquire with Hearts ſuitably affected, with the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of divine Providence, with ſincere Deſires to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>comply</hi> with your Duty.

The Sum of what I have ſaid is this: The <hi>neighbouring Notions,</hi> groaning under the ſame Oppreſſion from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Babyloniſh Princes,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, tho' the <hi>peculiar People</hi> of GOD, and favoured with his true <hi>Prophets;</hi> the <hi>Idumeans</hi> are introduced, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the <hi>Duration,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in too careleſs a Manner, with too little Reverence or religious Senſe of the Divine Diſpenſation.

            <p>THIS Interpretation may be illuſtrated by <hi>hiſtorical Events;</hi> either by refering it to the common Calamities that befel the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Idumeans,</hi> with other <hi>neighbouring Nations,</hi> under <hi>Senacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> or to that which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward befel them under the Kings of <hi>Babylon.</hi> If to the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>Morning</hi> that aroſe to the <hi>Jews,</hi> muſt be the <hi>miraculous Deliverance</hi> granted them, by the terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian Army</hi> by an Angel.

            <p>WHILE the <hi>Empire</hi> was in this dreadful Contuſion, by thoſe <hi>barbarous Nations,</hi> groſs Ignorance began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the <hi>Chriſtian World;</hi> for, by the Ravages they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Schools</hi> were diſſipated, <hi>Miniſters</hi> baniſhed, and <hi>Learning</hi> buried. Thoſe who were then on the <hi>Stage,</hi> being ſoon waſted with the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Age;</hi> the riſing Generation grew up in lamentable Ignorance. The moſt indeed of the Rulers of thoſe <hi>barbarous Nations</hi> embraced Chriſtianity; but being very Ignorant, became an eaſy Prey to the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of the corrupt and degenerate <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Day.

Thus <hi>Antichriſt</hi> began to be revealed, and gradually grew up to that <hi>Height</hi> of Wickedneſs, which he afterwards diſcovered; <hi>exalting himſelf above all that is called God.</hi> The Darkneſs of this <hi>Night,</hi> brought on the Church, by Ignorance, Superſtition, and the abominable Corruptions of <hi>Popery,</hi> were greatly increaſed by the <hi>Riſe</hi> of that falſe Prophet and grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who made his Appearance, <hi>A.

            <p>THE Miſeries brought on the Christian Church, by the Spread of this Impostore, were exceeding great. The glorious Light of the Goſpel, which began to be obſcured, with the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeemed as if it would have been wholly extinguiſhed. By <hi>this</hi> they brought ſuch Ignorance and Error, Deceit, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Slavery, where ever they came, that it ſeemed as if the bottomleſs Pit had been opened, and <hi>Salan</hi> an the <hi>Head</hi> of the Powers of Darkneſs, come forth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prophetic Deſcription of the <hi>Riſe</hi> of this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtore, Rev.</hi> ix. 2. <hi>And be opened the bottomleſs Pit, and there aroſe a Smoke out of the Pit, as the Smoke of a great Furnace, and the Sun and Air were darkened by Reaſon of the Smoke of the Pit, and cut of the Smoke Locuſts come,</hi> which fitly enough deſcribes the Milery and Woe, ſtupid Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Superſtition, which every where attended the Progreſſs of the <hi>Mahometan Religion.</hi> The coming up of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> and Deſtruction they make where ever they go, <hi>emphatically repreſents</hi> the amazing and deſtructive Progreſs of the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS dark and diſmal <hi>Night,</hi> brought on the Church by the Riſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> on the one Hand, and the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Impoſtore</hi> on the other, continued for a long Time with but a little glimmering of Goſpel Light, among a few that kept the Faith; Religion and Learning ſeemed likely to be baniſhed from the World. But at the Cloſe of the 15th, and Beginning of the 16th Centuries, the Day began to dawn, by a glorious <hi>Reformation,</hi> which had been attempted, and ſtruggled for, by <hi>Wickliff,</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> in <hi>Frances</hi> and <hi>John Huſs,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> long before; But was now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by <hi>Luther,</hi> under the Protection of the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> with ſurprizing Succeſs, in many Parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> who was joined by <hi>Melancton,</hi> and other noble <hi>Reformers;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007628_0017_102D772E39137340"/>whilſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> at <hi>Geneva, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Farellus,</hi> with a Train of faithful Witneſſes for the Truth, who appeared about this Time, were ſtrenuouſly ſupporting, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly carrying on, (tho' with ſome ſmall Difference, in leſſer Matters) the ſame glorious Cauſe. The Light of the Goſpel ſeemed for a Seaſon to ſhine brighter and brighter, ſpread far and wide in Spite of all the Methods the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> made uſe of, by <hi>Bulls, Decrees of Councils,</hi> and the moſt unheard of <hi>Cruelties,</hi> to ſtop and ſuppreſs it. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority began very faſt to decline. The Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the northern Kingdoms of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> with great Numbers in <hi>France, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> all received the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and diſclaimed any Subjection to the <hi>Kingdom of the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Things appeared like the Beginning of a joyful <hi>Day,</hi> and many were ready to think, the glorious Things ſpoken of <hi>Zion,</hi> in the <hi>latter Days,</hi> were now at Hand. There appeared in many of the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> ſuch a Love to the Truth, and Zeal for practical Godlineſs, as gave a fair Proſpect of a thorough <hi>Reformation;</hi> from all the Corruptions in <hi>Doctrine, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which had crept into the <hi>Church:</hi> But the Event fell far ſhort of the raiſed Hopes of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Friends. In many Places it was carried on chiefly by the civil Magiſtrate, who went no farther than to anſwer their <hi>political Schemes,</hi> and in moſt it was too much a <hi>formal, nominal</hi> Thing, conducted by the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of this <hi>World.</hi> So that it ſoon came to a Stand, and has been for many Years paſt on the Decline, as to the Principles and Practice of <hi>real Religion,</hi> and this ſad Declenſion is growing faſt on the preſent Generation.</p>
            <p>SOME may be ready perhaps by this Time, to put to Me the Queſtion in the Text, <hi>Watchman, what of the Night?</hi> Whereabouts are We? Is it <hi>Night,</hi> or <hi>Day?</hi> What are the Signs of the <hi>Times,</hi> in which we are fallen? What may we look for? To which I anſwer, I am very far from pretending to a Spirit of Propheſy, or any ſuch Inſight into the prophetic Writings, as preciſely to ſix
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007628_0018_102D772FE5B4FFF8"/>the Dates of thoſe <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons,</hi> about which learned and pious Men have ſo widely differed; I may venture however, to affirm, ſome Things that appear <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and modeſtly offer my Thoughts bout others, more <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>uncertain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is, I think, very evident, that the <hi>Night</hi> brought on the Church, by the Deluſions and Superſtition of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſtill continues. Notwithſtanding the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Appearances of the <hi>Morning,</hi> the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and at preſent ſeems to increaſe. <hi>Popery</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receive a great Wound at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> conſidered as a temporal Prince, has, as to his <hi>ſecular Power,</hi> been ever ſince, very much on the Decline, very little Regard being paid him to what formerly was; but this in many, ariſes more from Contempt of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and all <hi>revealed Religion,</hi> than a Diſlike to the Corruptions of <hi>Popery,</hi> or Regard to the Truth; and however, he be declined in ſecular Power, the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> ſtill greatly prevails. The greateſt Part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are <hi>Profeſſedly</hi> of that Communion, and <hi>acknowledge</hi> Subjection to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as their ſpiritual Head; and the corrupt Doctrines of <hi>that</hi> Church, have of late Years very much prevailed in Proteſtant Countries.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Turks,</hi> who, when they defeated the <hi>Saracens,</hi> adopted their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> which they have ever ſince been propagating, by their victorious Arms, (tho' they have been ſomething weakened by their late Wars with the <hi>Germans</hi>) are yet in Poſſeſſion of a conſiderable Part of <hi>Aſia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion formerly flouriſhed. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> have over been profeſſed Enemies to Chriſtianity, and endeavour to root it out wherever they come, and are at preſent, the greateſt <hi>Obſtacle</hi> in the Way of ſpreading the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And how great a Part of the World is yet involved in <hi>heatheniſh Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> When with theſe Things; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſad Declenſions, Corruptions and Diviſions of she <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> we are conſtrained to pronounce it

               <hi>Night.</hi> The Light of the Goſpel does indeed ſhine, but 'tis like twinkling Stars in the Midſt of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SHOULD it now be enquired, What of this <hi>Night?</hi> How far is it advanced? And how much is yet to come? I anſwer, it appears to me, that we are in the <hi>Cloſe</hi> of this dark <hi>Night,</hi> and that the <hi>Morning</hi> cometh. Could we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine when this <hi>Night</hi> began, it would be eaſy to fix on the Time of it's <hi>End;</hi> the <hi>Duration</hi> of it being plainly pointed out in prophetic Writings. The <hi>Beaſt</hi> to whom the <hi>Dragon</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor) gave his <hi>Seat, Authority,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> was to continue <hi>ſpeaking great Things and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,</hi> 42 <hi>Months,</hi> REV. xiii. 2 and 5; which is juſt equal to the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>half Time;</hi> while the <hi>Woman,</hi> i.e. the <hi>Church is drove into the Wilderneſs, and there nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,</hi> REV. xii. 14. During this <hi>Period,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes are to Propheſy in Sackcloth,</hi> or the faithful Meſſengers of CHRIST, are to Labour under Diſcouragements and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which was to continue 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> REV. xi. 3. Theſe ſeveral Numbers in prophetic Stile, taking a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year,</hi> make the ſame Period 1260 Years. So long the perſecuting Power of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> will continue; and while it does, the <hi>Church</hi> will be in a <hi>wilderneſs State,</hi> and the faithful Miniſters of CHRIST will Propheſy in Sackcloth. This perſecuted, oppreſſed, benighted State of the <hi>Church,</hi> will be ſucceeded by thoſe glorious Times, when <hi>Satan</hi> will be confined to the <hi>bottomleſs Pit, that he may no longer deceive the Nations, and when there ſhall be nothing to offend in all God's holy Mount.</hi> But when this <hi>dark State</hi> of the Church ſhall End, or where to fix it's Beginning, is a Matter of Uncertainty, as it ſeems to have come gradually on. ST. PAUL, indeed tell us, <hi>That the wicked one, whoſe coming was to be after the Workings of Satan, with all Power, Signs, and lying Wonders ſhould be revealed, when be that then let or bindered, was taken out of the Way.</hi> By him, that <hi>Let,</hi> the ancient, as well as modern Expoſitors, underſtand, the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> who, as long as he held his <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> prevented the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Nations, with his <hi>lying Wonders.</hi> The ancient

               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> therefore uſed to pray for the Continuance of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that the coming of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> might be delayed. If the Downfal of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> may be reckoned from <hi>Rome</hi>'s being ſacked, and taken by the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the <hi>Northern Nations,</hi> when almoſt the whole <hi>Empire,</hi> was over run and divided among them; when the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> or Kingdoms aroſe, and gave their Power and Strength to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. xvii. 12, 13.</note> the Deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the End of this <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Darkneſs, is near at Hand, <hi>when he ſhall be deſtroyed, by the Breath of</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Mouth, and the Brightneſs of his Coming.</hi> But, tho' this <hi>Night</hi> is evidently far ſpent, and the <hi>Day</hi> draws nigh, yet it appears to me not improbable, that the darkeſt Part of the <hi>Night</hi> yet remains, and that the <hi>glorious Times,</hi> the Church will enjoy in the <hi>latter Day,</hi> will be preceded with a Seaſon of the ſoreſt Calamity and Diſtreſs. It is the Opinion of many learned Divines, that there will be a general. Slaughter of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who have thro' all the dark Ages of <hi>Popery,</hi> born a faithful Teſtimony to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Ways of Chriſt,</hi> a little before the <hi>ſeventh Angel</hi> ſounds his Trumpet, for the utter Deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s Kingdom, juſt when they are about finiſhing their Teſtimony, and conſequently that this Event is future. But as ſome eminent Divines and <hi>One,</hi> for whoſe Judgment I have the higheſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are of a different Opinion, and think it is already paſt, I ſhall offer what I have to ſay on this Head, with all <hi>Humility,</hi> and much <hi>Diffidence</hi> of my own Sentiments, about ſo dark an Event: The Account we have of it is <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 7—13. <hi>And when they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, the Beaſt that aſcends out of the bottomleſs Pit, ſhall make War againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them; and their dead Bodies ſhall lie in the Street of the great City, which ſpiritually is called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>where alſo our Lord was crucified. And they of the People, and Kindreds and Tongues, and Nations, ſhall ſee their dead Bodies three Days and an Half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead Bodies
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007628_0021_102D7735C5CAD578"/>to be put in Graves. And they that dwell upon the Earth, ſhall rejoice over them, and make merry, and ſhall ſend Gifts one to another; becauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them that dwelt on the Earth. And after three Days and an Half, the Spirit of Life from God entered into them: And they ſtood upon their Feet, and great Fear fell upon them, which ſaw them. And they heard a great Voice from Heaven, ſaying unto them, "Come up hither". And they aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Sum of which Paſſage ſeems to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That when theſe faithful Witneſſes who have ſo long propheſied in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> are about concluding their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> there will be a ſevere Perſecution raiſed by the <hi>antichriſtian</hi> Party, whereby all the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, will appear to be <hi>ſilenced</hi> or <hi>ſlain,</hi> and that in the moſt <hi>public, open,</hi> and <hi>ignominious</hi> Manner, ſo that their Enemies ſhall triumph as tho' the Day were their own; but this will continue only for a ſhort Time, <hi>three Days and an Half;</hi> which, if it does not mean <hi>three Years</hi> and an <hi>Half,</hi> taking according to prophetic Stile, a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year;</hi> yet it doubtleſs means, that this Time of their Suffering will be but ſhort, compared to the Time of their <hi>propheſying</hi> in <hi>Sackcloth;</hi> it will be but as a Day to a Year, as that is a <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time,</hi> 1260 <hi>Years.</hi> After this they ſhall not only be reſtored to their former Liberty, but exalted to ſuch a State of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> as they never before enjoyed, and that in the Preſence, and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their Enemies; and the Reaſons which have made it appear to me not improbable that the Church has this diſtreſſing Scene yet to paſs thro', are ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> IT is to be at the Concluſion of their propheſying in Sackcloth, when they have juſt finiſhed their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>When they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimony.</hi> Thus we tranſlate it, which indeed ſeems the moſt natural, genuine Conſtruction of <hi>hotan teleſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſi, cum perfecerint,</hi> when they have about <hi>compleated</hi> or <hi>finiſhed off their</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as the original Word properly ſignifies; at the Cloſe of 1260 Days, when the Period of <hi>Antichriſt's Reign</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007628_0022_102D7737DE65EBE0"/>will be juſt at an End. But, as yet, this Period evidently continues, the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt may, on many Accounts, be ſaid, ſtill to <hi>propheſy</hi> in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> as the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Darkneſs yet remains, and they are carrying on their Work under great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d,</hi> HISTORY affords no paſt Events to which the <hi>ſlaying</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Witneſſes, can well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Some learned Men have, I know, endeavoured to find the Accompliſhment of it, in ſundry <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> bro't on the faithful Witneſſes for the Truth, none of which ſeem fully to anſwer the <hi>prophetic</hi> Deſcription given of that Event. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (Followers of <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) <hi>A. D.</hi> 1160, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with great Severity: 'Tis computed, that not leſs than 80,000 ſealed their Teſtimony to the <hi>Truths of God,</hi> with their Blood. Above a Million of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> (ſo called from their native Country in <hi>Languedoc</hi>) fell a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the ſame glorious Cauſe; but theſe were of too early a Date to anſwer the Deſcription; of too long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and confined to a particular Country; whereas the <hi>ſlaying of the Witneſſes</hi> will be a general Thing; and it is worthy of Remark, that this was in a Country where the Witneſſes have, almoſt ever ſince, propheſied in <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi> as all acquainted with the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> well know. If they were ſlain in that Place, it is hard to ſay, when they roſe, or were exalted. Much leſs can we find this Event accompliſhed, in the ſhort Perſecutions by <hi>Queen</hi> MARY, in <hi>England,</hi> or under the <hi>Duke of Savoy,</hi> in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> which were confined to ſo ſmall a Part of the Church, however exactly they may ſeem to anſwer as to Duration. Many ſevere Perſecutions have been carried on by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in <hi>Hungary, Bohemia,</hi> many Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and repeatedly in <hi>France;</hi> but all theſe were only partial <hi>ſlaying of the Witneſſes.</hi> They were never ſo univerſally cut off, as the Propheſy ſeems to repreſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007628_0023_102D7739AA7D4220"/>
               <hi>3d,</hi> IT would be difficult to ſhow, that there ever has been that <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and glorious <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which is to follow immediately after their <hi>lying dead three Days and an Half.</hi> What like this has happened upon any of the Perſecutions that have yet been on the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches? They are not only to be reſtored to <hi>Life,</hi> but <hi>to aſcend up into Heaven,</hi> i. e. to be exalted to an higher State of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> than they have ever yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; and this is to be in a public, open Manner, in the Preſence, and to the Confuſion of their Enemies. They are to put off their <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and put it on no more. The Reproach of their former ſuffering State, will be wiped away: But the faithful Witneſſes of Chriſt don't ſeem ever yet to have enjoyed any ſuch State of <hi>Honour, Power, Influence</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> as is here repreſented. Something indeed, like this, ſeemed to have happened at the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> when many of the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> were protected and encouraged in their Work, againſt the Attempts of their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Adverſaries; but when we conſider the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they met with, the frequent Perſecutions in many Parts of the <hi>Proteſtant Countries,</hi> the great Diſcouragements one Way or another, under which the faithful Witneſſes of Chriſt have laboured; we cannot but conclude, that the Time of their <hi>propheſying in Sackcloth yet continues.</hi>

            <p>IF the <hi>ſecond Woe,</hi> or <hi>Plague</hi> of the Sixth Trumpet, was brought on the Church, by the pouring out of the <hi>fifth Vial, when a Way was prepared for the Kings of the Eaſt;</hi> or, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſuffered to over-run a conſiderable Part of <hi>Europe;</hi> or, if it be referred to the Deſtruction and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe brought on many Parts of Chriſtendom, by the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens;</hi> I ſay, to which ſoever of theſe <hi>Events</hi> it is referred, 'tis evident, this Woe brought by the <hi>Mahometan Impoſture,</hi> is not yet paſſed away, great Part of the World ſtill groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it; and it is probable, this Woe is to end with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007628_0024_102D773B885D5798"/>the total Deſtruction and Abolition of the <hi>Turkiſh Empire.</hi> Neither does there appear to have been any ſuch <hi>Deſtruction</hi> and <hi>Revolution</hi> in the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Dominions, as is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the <hi>great Earthquake;</hi> the Deſtruction of the <hi>Tenth Part of the City,</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter of 7000 Men of Name;</hi> eſpecially the Time never has yet been, when the Reſt were <hi>affrighted, and gave Glory to God.</hi> They have been grieved, vexed and tormented, at the Progreſs of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the Liberty granted to the faithful Witneſſes; but ſo far have they been from <hi>repenting, and giving Glory to God,</hi> that, on the Contrary, they have been continually venting their Spite and Malice againſt the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and labouring, by all their helliſh Arts, and <hi>popiſh</hi> Rage, to ruin and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5th,</hi> IT has been God's uſual Method to prepare his Church and People for <hi>extraordinary Favours,</hi> by <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Trials,</hi> and in the preſent corrupt State of Things, it ſeems highly proper that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>THE Affairs of <hi>Jacob's Family,</hi> are in the moſt diſtreſſed Situation, before he hears that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was yet alive, and that by him a Door was open for their Relief. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were reduced to the laſt Extremity, in their <hi>Egyptian Bondage,</hi> juſt before their remarkable Deliverance. When was <hi>David</hi> in a greater Strait than at the Burning of <hi>Ziklag,</hi> a little before he was exalted to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The Perſecution of the Church under the <hi>Emperors of Rome,</hi> was by far the moſt <hi>extreme</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> when her Deliverance drew nigh, and ſhe was ready to be exalted under <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The Experience of many Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians can teſtify, that thoſe <hi>Seaſons</hi> in which they have been moſt highly favoured, with ſpecial Communications of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> have been preceded by remarkable <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Perplexity.</hi> That he ſhould therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Church, for thoſe <hi>glorious Things</hi> ſpoken of it in the latter Days, by ſome <hi>extraordinary Trials,</hi> is no improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suppoſition. This Obſervation will be much ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, by conſidering the preſent degenerate State of the <hi>proteſtant Churches,</hi> which is ſuch, that it can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007628_0025_102D773F5E5453F8"/>God ſhould paſs by, without ſome <hi>ſpecial Tokens</hi> of his Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>AND if the <hi>Slaying of the Witneſſes</hi> is not yet paſt, it is probable it may be near at Hand. But however it may be as to that particular <hi>Event,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Reaſons for ſuppoſing this Event already paſt, are ſet in a ſtrong, and clear Light, in that excellent Treatiſe, <hi>An humble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to promote extraordinary Prayer for the Revival of Religion;</hi> which I had not by me when I wrote this Diſcourſe, but on a Review of it ſince, find that ſuch a Seaſon of Trials, as I ſuppoſe the preſent degenerate State of the Church requires, may be expected on the Author's Scheme that the Witneſſes are ſlain; for he ſays, Page 125, <q>'Tis true there is abundant Evidence in Scripture, that there is yet remaining a mighty Conflict between the Church and her Enemies, the moſt violent Struggle of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Adherents, in Oppoſition to true Religion, &amp;c.

               </note> about which I would be far from making any poſitive Concluſions, many Things may make us expect that <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> Times are coming on the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> The dark Cloud that gathers ſo faſt over our <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> ſeems to forebode Diſtreſs and Calamity, to the <hi>proteſtant Churches</hi> in general. The <hi>Britiſh Nation</hi> has been for a long Time the great <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and ſhould it be ſubdued, the other <hi>Proteſtant Powers in Europe</hi> could, by no Means, be a Match for their <hi>antichriſtian Enemies,</hi> when united together; and a Door would open for a diſtreſſing Scene of Perſecution, throughout all the <hi>reformed Churches.</hi> It gives me no Pleaſure to be a Meſſenger of evil Tidings, nor would I make poſitive Aſſertions about <hi>future Events;</hi> yet I muſt ſay, our publick Affairs wear a dark Aſpect. The Nation we are engaged with in War, is numerous, powerful and politic. <hi>France</hi> abounds with Men, and the <hi>King</hi> commands as many as he pleaſes into the Field; on every Occaſion ſhows himſelf ſuperior to our Expectations; and his being an abſolute Monarch gives great Advantage in Point of Secrecy and Diſpatch.</p>
            <p>OUR old Friend and Ally, the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> has joined the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo far as we can judge from her Conduct, deſigns to forſake us, whatever plauſible
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007628_0026_102D773D9021BAF0"/>Pretences, ſhe may make to the Contrary. No other Conſtruction can be put on her joining our <hi>ſworn Enemy,</hi> when at open War with us, in the Manner ſhe has done; No Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> under greater Obligations to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation; almoſt all the Wars we have been engaged in, ſince the Acceſſion of King <hi>William,</hi> have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in Favour of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtrian Louiſbourgh,</hi> that important <hi>Fortreſs,</hi> was given up, that the Places the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had taken from her in <hi>Flanders,</hi> might be reſtored; yet now ſhe has forſaken us at a critical Juncture; and what may we then expect from other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Powers. <hi>Spain</hi> appears waiting for nothing but a favourable Opportunity of declaring againſt us. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> (Elector of Saxony) by a ſtrange Turn of <hi>Politics,</hi> ſeems inclined to eſpouſe the Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> The Connections of the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>two Sicilies</hi> are ſuch, that he will readily join their Confederacy: And perhaps the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> will be obliged to <hi>join</hi> or ſtand <hi>neuter,</hi> in his own Defence. When to this, we add the <hi>Coldneſs,</hi> to ſay no worſe, with which we are treated by ſome of our <hi>Proteſtant Allies;</hi> it gives the Situation of our publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs a <hi>dangerous and threatning</hi> Aſpect. And if we caſt our Eyes on the <hi>Britiſh Colonies</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> Things look ſtill darker. All our Schemes hitherto prove unſucceſsful; our <hi>Enemies,</hi> ſmall and contemptible as their Numbers appeared to us, every where get the Advantage. <hi>Braddock's</hi> mournful Defeat laſt Year, has been attended with a <hi>Train</hi> of deſtructive Conſequences. 'Tis not eaſy to conceive, what we have ſuffered from the <hi>barbarous Natives,</hi> under the <hi>Influence,</hi> and by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French;</hi> ſcarce a Paper from the <hi>Southward</hi> but brings Accounts of new <hi>Depredations</hi> and <hi>Murders.</hi> What ruinous Conſequences may we expect from the <hi>Loſs</hi> of <hi>Oſwego?</hi> What an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is hereby put into the Enemy's Hand; the Lake wholly at their Command, where we have expended ſuch Sums. Our <hi>Shipping, Artillery,</hi> with the other Warlike <hi>Stores</hi> and <hi>Proviſions,</hi> which we had conveyed there with great Coſt and Labour; all fallen into the <hi>Hands</hi> of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007628_0027_102D7740F31F3050"/>Enemy, to be employed againſt us. All the <hi>fine Country</hi> adjacent, loſt; and the few <hi>Indians</hi> that have hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in our <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> will probably forſake us; and thoſe that have remained neuter, join in with the Enemy; for now ſeems verified the Obſervation they made in a late Treaty at <hi>Albany,</hi> "The <hi>French</hi> act like <hi>Men,</hi> build Forts and defend them; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> act like <hi>Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DARK Tidings of late, like <hi>Job</hi>'s Meſſengers, come in thick Succeſſion, one after another. In the Midſt of our Lamentations for the ſad Fate of <hi>Oſwego,</hi> comes the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly News, of <hi>Port-Mahon</hi>'s being taken: The Loſs of a <hi>Fortreſs</hi> ſo important, of ſuch Conſequence to the <hi>Britiſh Trade,</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and which gives ſo much Advantage to the Enemy, muſt be exceeding great, highly aggravated by the diſgraceful Circumſtances which attended it; the Ferment into which it has thrown the Nation, and the laſting Diſhonour done to the <hi>Britiſh Flag.</hi> I ſhall leave it to the <hi>Politicians</hi> of the Day, to point out the Cauſe of thoſe ſore Calamities, and make but one Remark, which muſt be obvious to all ſerious and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons.</p>
            <p>THAT our Misfortunes have come upon us, in ſuch a Manner, as plainly to point out the <hi>Hand of God</hi> therein; and ſhows us, that our Dependance on our own <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> while by our Sins, we engage Heaven againſt us, is as <hi>vain</hi> as it is <hi>ſinful.</hi>—We have been greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to boaſt of our ſuperior Strength by <hi>Sea,</hi> and glory in our <hi>Fleets,</hi> as a ſure <hi>Refuge</hi> in a Time of Danger; but even <hi>they</hi> have failed us, and at a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> when we moſt needed their Help, and ſeemed to have the higheſt Reaſon of Dependance upon them. This might ſerve to cure us of our <hi>Infidelity</hi> and vain <hi>Confidence,</hi> and teach us our entire <hi>Dependance</hi> on <hi>God,</hi> and how great our Danger is, while his <hi>Hand</hi> is ſo evidently ſtretched forth againſt us. Our Expedition to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> will probably again, like the Reſt of our Schemes, prove abortive. Theſe Things, together with our <hi>divided Counſels,</hi> and <hi>dilatory Methods</hi> of proceeding, make the Situation of public Affairs, look
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007628_0028_102D77433A2AC710"/>exceeding dangerous, and may well alarm our Fears, as to what is coming on our <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>—And if we conſider the preſent State of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> will it not tend to increaſe our dark Apprehenſions on this Head. What mournful Declenſions, as to <hi>Doctrine, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> and <hi>practical Godlineſs!</hi> God has evidently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his Spirit;—a ſad Decay, as to <hi>vital Piety,</hi> is almoſt every where lamentably viſible;—A Midnight Security ſeems to have fallen on the Churches;—Both Miniſters and People, Saints and Sinners, <hi>ſlumber</hi> and <hi>ſleep. Iniquity abounds; the Love of many waxes cold.</hi>—Lukewarmneſs and Indifference, in ſpiritual and divine Things; Want of Affection to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Goſpel, are growing faſt on the Profeſſors of this <hi>Age. The Things that remain are juſt ready to die, and our Works are not found perfect before God.</hi>—The Goſpel, and all its Glories, grow more and more contemptible in the Eyes of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and leſs precious in the Eyes of <hi>Saints.</hi>— The Lord's-Day, public Worſhip, and Ordinances of his Houſe, diſregarded and ſlighted;—The Miniſters of the Goſpel treated with Contempt by many, with too much Neglect and Diſregard by all; their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Families</hi> poorly ſupported, their <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> little reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the <hi>importans Meſſages</hi> they bring, undervalued and rejected. How widely different are Things in this Reſpect, from what they were in the Memory of many now alive! How little of that Reverence and Eſteem for the <hi>miniſterial Character,</hi> which was ſo remarkable among our <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> is to be ſeen in our Day, and theſe Things are waxing worſe and worſe. Whether this ariſes from Declenſions among <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> or both, it muſt be eſteemed a <hi>dark Symptom</hi> on the Church. Time would fail me, to ſpeak of the mournful Growth of Infidelity, Profaneneſs, and all kind of abominable Immoralities: And when we conſider theſe Things, have we not Reaſon to fear, that God will purify his <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Furnace,</hi> that they may come forth as <hi>Gold tried</hi> and <hi>refined?</hi> Can we expect, that ſo much <hi>Droſs</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> as is now
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007628_0029_102D77455E972958"/>found among us, will be purged off any other Way? The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Powers may be ſuffered to unite their Strength, to prevail, and carry all before them for a <hi>Seaſon;</hi> to <hi>ſlay,</hi> or <hi>ſilence</hi> the faithful <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt; to <hi>rejoice,</hi> and <hi>ſend Gifts,</hi> as if the Day was their own, and to imagine they have nothing to fear from them, who uſed <hi>to torment them Night and Day.</hi> This, as it will be the laſt Effort of the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and his Adherents, may, probably, be one of the moſt <hi>deſperate Attacks,</hi> he has ever made on the <hi>Reformed Churches. Satan</hi> will ſeem to be looſed from the <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and will come in great Wrath, becauſe his Time is ſhort. But, bleſſed be God, tho' this will be a Time of <hi>great Darkneſs and Diſtreſs,</hi> yet it will ſoon be over. The triumphing of the Enemies of Chriſt, will be ſhort. When they think themſelves moſt ſecure, and that there are none to oppoſe their Deſigns, <hi>ſudden Deſtruction ſhall come upon them, as on a Woman in Travil, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> When the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>myſtical Rome,</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, am no Widow,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſee no Sorrow;</hi> then her Doom draws nigh, <hi>her Plagues ſhall come in one Day; Death, Mourning and Famine; and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">REV. xviii. 7, 8.</note>. Happy ſhall they then be, <hi>who have come out from her, and are not Partakers of her Sin, that they may not receive of her Plagues.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> will not be all at once; yet on the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Witneſſes, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>deadly Wound,</hi> of which he ſhall never be healed, but conſume away by <hi>the Breath of Chriſt's Mouth, and Brightneſs of his Coming.</hi> Such ſudden and awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will then be brought upon <hi>him,</hi> as ſhall affrighten the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the World, and cauſe them to <hi>give Glory to God.</hi> This, with the paſſing away of the <hi>ſecond Woe,</hi> in the Overthrow of the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> will open a Door for that <hi>glorious Spread</hi> of the Goſpel promiſed in the <hi>latter Days.</hi> The <hi>third Woe,</hi> under the ſounding of the ſeventh Angel, which cometh quickly, will iſſue in the final and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007628_0030_102D77473B238AA8"/>complete <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> of all the implacable Enemies of the Church.

               <note n="†" place="bottom">REV. xi. 14, 15.</note>. Then, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> tho' we may be entering on the <hi>darkeſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>gloomy</hi> Part of the <hi>Night,</hi> which has continued ſo long, we may lift up our Heads with Joy, our Salvation draws near.

               <note n="§" place="bottom">ISAI. xxx. 26.</note>. This Day of the Churches Proſperity, is to continue for a <hi>Thouſand Years;</hi> ſome ſuppoſe, prophetically taken, 360,000 Years, that Chriſt may have a longer <hi>Reign,</hi> and greater <hi>Number</hi> of Subjects, than the <hi>Prince</hi> of Darkneſs has had; but this may be accompliſhed in the Space of 1000 Years, (literally taken) of ſuch <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> as the Church will then enjoy, when the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of Mankind will be to much greater, and their <hi>Deſtruction</hi> ſo much leſs than at other Times
<note n="‖" place="bottom">See this particularly illuſtrated in the Treatiſe above mentioned, Page 47 and 48.</note>.

That it ſeems evident by the prophetic Deſcription given of <hi>thoſe Times,</hi> that their Glory will conſiſt in the univerſal Promotion of <hi>true Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>real Religion,</hi> in the Goſpel's having its <hi>genuine Effect</hi> on the Hearts and Lives of Men; ſuch as were before <hi>hateful,</hi> and <hi>hating one another,</hi> will then have Hearts glowing with Love to God, and one another; ſuch as were before the Plagues and Peſts of Society, will then become its Ornament, Delight and Defence; ſuch as were before fierce and ſavage, malicious and revengeful, barbarous and cruel, will then become kind and gentle, courteous and forgiving, meek and humble. The <hi>Lyon</hi> will be turned into the <hi>Lamb:</hi> and <hi>there ſhall be Nothing to offend in God's holy Mount.</hi> When ſupreme Love to God, and undiſſembled Affection to one another, reign, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce univerſal Harmony and Peace.

That the Change muſt begin <hi>here;</hi> that without <hi>this,</hi> all Means muſt prove ineffectual; and that <hi>this</hi> is ſufficient to effect it, might be eaſily proved.

            <p>THO' it be not for us to know the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has reſerved in his own <hi>Power;</hi> yet when he is both by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> giving Intimations of approaching Judgments, we ought, like <hi>Noah,</hi> to be <hi>moved with Fear,</hi> and prepare to meet them. This may eſpecially be expected of us, who are appointed as <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to give warning to others. Tho' we can't pretend to penetrate into the <hi>Council of Heaven,</hi> as to future Events, yet <hi>he that runs, may read</hi> the preſent threatning <hi>Aſpect</hi> of divine Providence; the <hi>loud Calls.</hi> God is giving to the <hi>World,</hi> and to his <hi>Churches,</hi> to prepare to meet him: He ſpeaks once; yea, twice; and that in a moſt ſolemn and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner; tho' few regard him.

Is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Truths,</hi> and <hi>Ways,</hi> dearer to us, than our <hi>Lives?</hi> And can we freely ſacrifice the <hi>latter</hi> in Defence of the <hi>former?</hi> Should we who are <hi>Leaders</hi> in Chriſt's Army, give back, and cowardly <hi>deſert</hi> the <hi>glorious Cauſe</hi> where with we are entruſted, our Guilt and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would be exceeding great.

            <p>WE may, perhaps, in a warm Mood, like <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay, <hi>Tho' all Men forſake thee, yet will not we.</hi> But have we that <hi>Self-denial, Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that would carry us thro' the <hi>fiery Trial,</hi> bear us up under all the Variety of <hi>Tortures,</hi> which the Wit and Malice of our Enemies may invent?

2d. WITH what Pleaſure ſhould we look forward to the joyful Period, when <hi>the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become, the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt;</hi> and how ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhould we long and pray, for the Approach of it?</p>
            <p>THO' many <hi>Trials</hi> may yet await us, and we ſhould be called off from the Stage, before the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of the preſent <hi>Night</hi> be paſt; yet it muſt be a delightful Thought, that the <hi>Morning cometh,</hi> and will uſher in a <hi>glorious Day</hi> to the Church, when the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Truth and Holineſs, Peace and Purity, ſhall univerſally prevail, in Oppoſition to all the Hereſy and Wickedneſs, Tumults and Corruptions, which have hitherto overſpread the Earth; when the Prayers of the Saints in all Ages, for the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of Zion, ſhall be anſwered, and the <hi>glorious Things</hi> ſpoken of her in the ſacred Oracles, be fully accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>WE, indeed, may be laid in the ſilent Duſt, before this <hi>bleſſed Day</hi> appears; but we can now behold it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw the <hi>Day</hi> of Chriſt; and if we are poſſeſſed of the ſame <hi>excellent Spirit,</hi> ſhall rejoice and be exceeding glad.

            <p>FINALLY, Let us be <hi>awakned</hi> in this dark and difficult Day, to a faithful zealous <hi>Diſcharge</hi> of the Duties of our Stations.

What we find to do for <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Hearers, and our bleeding <hi>Country,</hi> we ſhould, in ſuch a Day as this, <hi>do with all our Might.</hi> Allow me in particular, to preſs the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of uniting our moſt vigorous Attempts for a thorough and general <hi>Reformation.</hi> This is what we propoſed in our <hi>Judicatory,</hi> and to which we <hi>unanimouſly agreed,</hi> viz. That we would not only <hi>explain, and warmly preſs in our public Diſcourſes, the Neceſſity of a Reformation, but exert ourſelves in our ſeveral Spheres of Influence, to bring it about.</hi> This is what God is moſt evidently and loudly <hi>calling</hi> us to, in the preſent Day. He has of late been giving extraordinary <hi>Warnings,</hi> of impending Judgments, by mighty <hi>Winds,</hi> proeternatural <hi>Inundations,</hi> and terrible <hi>Earthquakes in divers Places.</hi> The Frame of Nature ſeems to have been caſt into a trembling Diſorder, at the Approach of an <hi>angry God,</hi> and as it were in Aſtoniſhment, ſolemnly to call on the Inhabitants of a guilty World, to <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>return,</hi> before his Wrath comes upon them to the utmoſt.

Will be not be avenged on ſuch a People as this?</hi> Can we expect, that all the <hi>public Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> thrown on his Authority and Government, will be paſſed by without Tokens of his <hi>angry Reſentment,</hi> unleſs Repentance and Reformation prevent.</p>
            <p>IT is well known, that I have not been backward in uſing the little Influence I have, in animating my <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to a vigorous Defence of their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> in the uſe of all proper Means; and I wiſh it were in my Power, to awake in them a greater <hi>Senſe</hi> of the Neceſſity of being alive, and thoroughly engaged in this <hi>Matter.</hi> But I muſt freely declare, I have no Expectations of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> from any of our <hi>Preparations,</hi> tell a Senſe of our <hi>Dependance</hi> on God, and a Diſpoſition to return to him by <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> prevails.
