            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REHOBOAM, whoſe Hiſtory we have in this, and the two preceding Chapters, was a weak and impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Prince; he came to the Throne with a Mind imbued with arbitrary and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Notions and Principles of Government, received from his young and unexperienced Counſellors, to the Rejection of the good and ſolid Advice given him by the grave Senators, who had been long verſed in the Art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and were well acquainted with the wholſom Maxims of Policy: And he ſtands upon Record with the blemiſhed Character of one, <hi>who did evil becauſe he prepared not his heart to ſeek the LORD,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
            <p>By his ill Government, and his other impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practices, he bro't many Calamities upon his People, both as the natural and moral Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof, and the juſt Judgment of Heaven.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005975_0005_10271C64037A8C78"/>
I ſhall not enlarge upon his Hiſtory or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but only take Notice that as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Sins, and the Sins of his People (<hi>becauſe they had tranſgreſſed againſt the LORD,</hi> v.2) the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> came up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and reduced them to great Diſtreſs; which together with the Reproof of the Prophet SHEMAIAH, brought them in ſome meaſure to a Senſe of their Sins and made them humble themſelves before GOD; which very much turned the Courſe of things; <hi>the Wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not deſtroy him altogether.</hi> GOD promiſed likewiſe <hi>that he would not deſtroy this People, but grant them ſome Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that his wrath ſhould on be poured out upon Jeruſalem by the hand of</hi> SHISHAK, v.7.</p>
            <p>NOW it was at this Juncture, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory informs us, <hi>And alſo in Judah things went well.</hi> Theſe are the words which I have choſen for my Text at this Time, and may, I think, be a proper Introduction to a Diſcourſe on the <hi>Welfare</hi> of a Government in general. And though I am not Studied in the Rules of Government or the civil and religious Rights of a People, ſo as to treat this great &amp; weighty Subject, with that Clearneſs that it deſerves, (alas! I find my ſelf very unequal to the Taſk) yet ſince Providence has called me to Speak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this honourable Auditory, I ſhall attempt the Subject, as the moſt proper, I could think of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005975_0006_10271C6598CF41E0"/>
upon this Occaſion; <hi>And alſo in Judah things went well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Method I propoſe is this, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. TO conſider when things may be ſaid to go well with a People; or, attempt to ſhew in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances wherein the Welfare of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. APPLY the whole to the preſent Occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ſhall conſider when things may be ſaid to go well with a People; or attempt to ſhew in ſeveral Inſtances wherein the Welfare of a Government conſiſts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not confine my ſelf to thoſe particular Inſtances mentioned in this Chapter, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Cauſe <hi>of things going well in Judah</hi> at that Time; but conſider the Matter more at large, and endeavour by divine Aſſiſtance, to trace out the Cauſes and Reaſons of the Happineſs &amp; <hi>Welfare</hi> of a Government, from the <hi>Scripture</hi> Account in General, from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Dependance</hi> of things, and the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ONE <hi>thing that has a mighty Influence, to the Welfare of a People or Government, is the, flouriſhing of RELIGION.</hi> As far as Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005975_0007_10271C684FA04E20"/>
Prophaneneſs and Immortality prevail in a Nation or Country, ſo far are they, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Happineſs, and ſo far are they wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; miſerable, &amp; poor, &amp; blind, &amp; naked. '<hi>Tis Righteouſneſs that exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People,</hi> Prov. 14.34. 'Tis a Reproach that can never be wip'd off, but by GOD's forgiving Grace, which attends true Repentance, and an effectual thorough Reformation.</p>
            <p>'TIS then that the almighty GOD returns to a People that had departed from him, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters impending Calamities, delights to do them good, engages his Kind, Allpowerful and Allwiſe Providence for their Defence, their Bleſſedneſs and Glory; and in a word, keeps them as the <hi>Apple of His Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIN has a natural Tendency to depreſs and keep a People low, beſides the terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven which by GOD's poſitve Appointment are entail'd to it. And Piety and Vertue, Faith unfeigned, and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have a native Tendency to pomote the true Interſts of a People, and moreover to engage the Favour of the bleſſed GOD to them, and render them meet for a ſtore of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary Bleſſings. If we did but know and conſider the infinite Plagues and extreme Curſes, temporal and ſpiritual to a Perſon or People, to a Nation or Land, that are wrapt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005975_0008_10271C6A14B865C8"/>
up in the Bowels of Sin, we ſhould fly from it as from Hell, and never reſt impenitent, nor ceaſe begging and pleading at the Throne of Grace, till we had obtained Forgiveneſs thro' the Blood of the Redeemer: And if we did but duly conſider the true Worth &amp; Excellence of Religion, and the innumerable Bleſſings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, both publick and private both for Time and Eternity, we could not but be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of ſo much Beauty and Lovelineſs, we could not but with the greateſt Earneſtneſs ſeek to be poſſeſt of a Pearl of ſuch ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Value, we could not ceaſe <hi>crying after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and lifting up our Voice for Underſtanding until GOD ſhall come and rain down Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon us, and make us an holy People.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore conſiders the proper &amp; genuine Influence of Religion, to the making Men tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and pure, ſincere and upright, patient and forgiving, kind and charitable, meek and humble, pious &amp; devout, and in a word happy themſelves and Bleſſings to one another, muſt acknowlege the Truth of this great Doctrine, that the Welfare of a People or Government, conſiſts very much in the flouriſhing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And whoever conſiders likewiſe the many additional Bleſſings of Heaven, which commonly attend a People when Religion flouriſhes muſt confeſs it a Confirmation of this Truth.</p>

            <p>'TIS happy for a Government, 'tis an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatable Smile of divine Providence upon a People, to be under the Direction &amp; Guidance of <hi>Good Rulers,</hi> and the Reſtraint &amp; Influence

of <hi>good wholſom Laws</hi> conſcientiouſly Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There is not a meer accidental &amp; caſual Dependence of theſe things upon one another but there is a neceſſary and undivided Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the one with the other. GOD denounces his heavy Wo's againſt bad Rulers: <hi>Wo be to the Shepherds of Iſrael, that do feed themſelves, ſhould not the Shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat and ye cloath ye with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flock: the diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthned, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,</hi> Ezek. 34.2, 3.4. And ſuch a State of things is as full of Wo to a People, a fearful deſcription whereof we have in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was among the choice &amp; rich Bleſſings, which GOD promiſed to his People ISRAEL at their final Reſtoration in the latter Days, that Prophet reckons good Rulers, <hi>I will make thy Officers peace and thine exactors Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and as the genuine Conſequence thereof he adds, <hi>Violence ſhall be no more heard in thy Land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but thou ſhalt call thy Walls Salvation and thy Gates Praiſe,</hi> Iſa, 16, 17, 18.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>LOYALTY in a People towards their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers makes a neceſſary Part of the Welfare of a Government.</hi> When Rulers in the Diſcharge of their high and important Truſt, are ſtriving with Heart and Head and Hand, to promote the great Ends of Rule, and Government, the Good and <hi>Welfare</hi> of their People, and are willing <hi>to ſpend and be ſpent,</hi> for the common Weal, what inexcuſable and ſhameful Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to GOD, as well as Blindneſs to their own Intereſts, is it for a People to bite the Hand that thus kindly feeds them? to reproach, miſuſe, and ill-treat thoſe whom GOD has
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005975_0013_10271C795EF16300"/>
placed as guardian Angels to defend them from Evil, and promote their Good? By this Means they counter-work the gracious Deſigns of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, the benevolent, and benificent Schemes of their Rulers and change Bleſſings into Curſes. GOD is graciouſly ſmiling upon them, by ſending them wiſe &amp; faithful Rulers; their Rulers are conſulting &amp; ſtriving to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Welfare; but they undo all by their Diſloyalty and Diſobedience, their ſpeaking evil of, and their Seditions againſt their good Rulers, and their Government and Laws.</p>
            <p>THE great &amp; aggravated Wickedneſs, and Ingratitude of Diſreſpect, Irreverence &amp; Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to civil Rulers, conſiſts in its counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the primary, nay the only Deſign of their Office and Buſineſs. They are appointed <hi>as Miniſters of GOD to their People for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. And ſo long as they keep within the Limits of their Commiſſion and the Deſign of their Office they can have nothing elſe in View, but the good and Welfare of their People. But by our Diſloyalty &amp; Oppoſition we caſt away the publick Bleſſings, which they were heaping upon us, and with raſh Hands pull down upon ourſelves thoſe publick evils, which they were ſtriving to ward off. In ſuch a Caſe oppoſing, reſiſting, &amp; diſobeying the civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, is nothing leſs than Oppoſing the Intereſt and Welfare of the Community, which, beſide
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005975_0014_10271C7D452C3800"/>
the <hi>Damnation</hi> we bring upon ourſelves, tends as far as its Influence reaches to involve the Common-wealth in Ruin. Therefore to ſhew all dutiful Reverence, and Reſpect to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of civil Rulers, to give them an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maintenance, to ſubmit to, and obey them, in the Diſcharge of their Office, is neceſſary, not meerly for their Honour &amp; Glory, but for the Welfare of the Government.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A fixed ſtable MEDIUM OF TRADE, or Money ſettled and fixed at a certain Value is at leaſt highly if not abſolutely neceſſary to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a Government.</hi> The Neceſſity &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a <hi>Medium of Trade</hi> is very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

            <p>THIS is the <hi>Standard,</hi> the <hi>Balance</hi> the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> by which all that we trade &amp; traffick in, is as to the Value, <hi>regulated, weighed,</hi> &amp; <hi>meaſured,</hi> &amp; conſequently if this <hi>Medium of Trade</hi> be of an uncertain changeable Value, ſome times higher and ſome times lower, it comes to paſs that every thing we trade in, is regulated by a falſe <hi>Rule,</hi> weighed in a falſe <hi>Balance,</hi> and meaſured by a falſe <hi>Meaſure</hi>: Such a fluctuating ſinking <hi>medium of Trade</hi> is nothing better, and nothing can be worſe, than <hi>falſe Weights and falſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,

both of them are an abomination to the LORD,</hi> Prov. 2.1. and are publick heavy Grievances to a Government.</p>
            <p>IF People can borrow Money and at the Time of Payment, thro' the depreciating of the Species, diſcharge the Obligation, and keep back the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and a conſiderable Part of the <hi>Principal.</hi> If People can trade &amp; run in Debt, and at the Time of Payment, diſcharge the Debt, and keep a <hi>fifth Part</hi> to themſelves: alas! what a Floodgate is opened for Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Injuſtice, Idleneſs, Profuſeneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, to the enervating Induſtry and Frugality, to the Ruin of our Trade, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures &amp; Huſbandry, to the debauching our Morals, and to the inflaming the Anger of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD againſt our Land.

            <p>NOW ſuch <hi>Liberty</hi> is one of the Corner Stones of the <hi>Welfare</hi> of a People or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; without which they will never arrive to thing great, either in Labour or Learning, in War, or Peace.

When they can have no Security in their Eſtates, Perſons, Poſſeſſions, or religious Rights, but are vexed, gailed, &amp; overborn with heavy &amp; unreaſonable Taxes, &amp; know not how ſoon the fruit of their Labours ſhall be forced out of their Hands, and Bodies &amp; Eſtates, and religous Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively at the Mercy of their tyrannical Maſters,

what Comfort is there in Life? what Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Prudence, Labour and Induſtry? what to induce them to a bold &amp; reſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Country? Such a People muſt of Neceſſity become mean and low. Such Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Tyranny, muſt reduce them and break their Spirits.

            <p>OUR <hi>Rulers</hi> are great Bleſſings, the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Government were deſigned and calculated for the good of the People.

This <hi>populous</hi> &amp; otherwiſe <hi>flouriſhing</hi> Country is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under the Weight of this heavy Calamity, ariſing from the deplorable Condition of our paper Currency. <q>Tis evident to Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our common <hi>Medium of Exchange</hi> is an Inſtrumnet of Injuſtice &amp; Oppreſſion; that which ought to be the Meaſure of the Value of other things, is it ſelf the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of all things. The Extravagance, Intemperance and Injuſtice, which prevails in the Land ariſe in great Meaſure from
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005975_0026_10271C9EF96BF768"/>
hence; and in this Poſture of Affairs, we are in Danger of looſing the very Notion of Right and wrong.</q> Theſe things muſt incenſe the Anger of a juſt and holy GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Land, and by their natural Effect, &amp; the Juſtice of Heaven evidently threaten our being deprived of all our other bleſſings, unleſs ſome timely Remedy Intervene. Therefore in Behalf of this good Land, this pleaſant, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government, which lies bleeding &amp; languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your Feet, I would with humble Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſs it upon you, honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to take the Matter into your moſt ſerious Conſideration; that if poſſible ſome Remedy may be found for this growing ſpreading Evil. Heaven will ſmile upon you, your Country will bleſs you, your Names will be tranſmitted with Honour to future Generations if in your Wiſdom you can ſave us from Ruin, in this critical Juncture.</p>
            <p>I am not Politician enough, nor is it my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſuggeſt <hi>Ways &amp; Means</hi> in this Affair; but thus much I would beg to move, that all proper Care may be taken to prevent the vile and flagicious Practice of counterfeiting our <hi>Bills,</hi> and that ſuch Traitors to their Country, as Preſume to do it, may meet with exemplary Juſtice.</p>
            <p>IT is I know commonly obſerved, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſome of the great Sufferers on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005975_0027_10271CA092E91C38"/>
of the depreciating of our <hi>Money</hi>; and therefore it may be thought that ſelf Intereſt may be the great Motive of their Zeal about this Affair. I can ſpeak for my ſelf; I know not that ever I have ſuffered much in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I have much greater Fears, that thoſe I deal with ſuffer on this Account: And my Conſcience bears me Witneſs, that what I have now ſaid was from a deep Concern for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this Government, of which I have the Honour to be a Member.</p>
            <p>IN the Laſt Place, I would humbly &amp; hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend to your <hi>Honours,</hi> the Cauſe of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is of ſuch great Influence to <hi>things going well</hi> in a Government. Under the Smiles of divine Providence, 'tis by the happy Influence thereof, that <hi>New-England,</hi> from ſuch ſmall Beginnings is become ſuch a flouriſhing Country, to the Joy of her Friends, and the Envy of her Enemies. 'Tis thro' the encouraging, invigorating Influence thereof that our Huſbandry is brought to ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perfection, whereby this Land, from an howling, inhoſpitable Wilderneſs, is become as the <hi>Garden of the LORD,</hi> a fruitful pleaſant Land; 'tis thro' <hi>Liberty</hi> that our Trade and Manufactures are ſo flouriſhing, and that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; Learning, and the military Arts have made ſuch notable Progreſs and Improvement both in Theory and Practice. In a word 'tis
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005975_0028_10271CA4971E26E0"/>
               <hi>Liberty</hi> that crowns the Happineſs, both of Ruler and Subject. Therefore we truſt that you will employ your Wiſdom and Care for the ſecuring and lengthning out this our Tranquility.</p>
            <p>THESE things may it pleaſe your <hi>Honour,</hi> and the honourable <hi>Counſellors,</hi> and <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of this General Aſſembly we would humbly &amp; earneſtly recommend to your Care and Wiſdom. And may the LORD GOD almighty and alwiſe direct &amp; influence you in your ſtudious Endeavours to <hi>make things go well in this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>I would humbly addreſs Diſcourſe to my reverend Fathers and Brethren, the Paſtors of the Church of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. There is no Doubt, my Fathers and Brethren, but the Deſign of our Office &amp; Work is to contribute to the Welfare of the People. And if we are faithful, we may by the Bleſſing of GOD upon our Labours, do much to the <hi>making things go well.</hi> We have ſpecial Opportunities in our Hands to do good to our fellow men and fellow Subjects ; and we are under all imaginable Obligations to <hi>ſpend and be ſpent</hi> therein. And can we think of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Sovereign Authority of him who has commanded us to <hi>feed his Sheep and his Lambs,</hi> can we think of the matchleſs Love, the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005975_0029_10271CA752096A98"/>
aſtoniſhing Grace of him, who has ſhed his Blood to redeem the World, <hi>and has committed to us the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> made us his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to beſeech men in his Name to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD,</hi> can we think of the Honour of our great Lord and Maſter, the divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that Religion we are to recommend, the invaluable Worth and Preciouſneſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, can we I ſay think of theſe things, and after all remain cold or indifferent, in our Intentions &amp; Endeavours of doing good? How can we ſtand before CHRIST, at the laſt, under the aggravated Guilt of Unfaithfulneſs in the ſolemn Charge he has given us? how can we bear up under the Tho'ts of having the Blood of Souls that have periſhed thro' our Neglect, required at our Hands? Can we ever anſwer it before GOD, or our own Conſciences, that when we have ſuch great Opportunities of doing good to the Publick, we let them ſlip, thro' our Idleneſs or Negligence, or by confining all our Thoughts &amp; Deſigns to the narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of ſelf Intereſt? By the LOVE of GOD, by the Blood of CHRIST, by the Worth of Souls, by the Proſpect of that diſtinguiſhing Crown of Glory that CHRIST will beſtow up faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, let us be perſwaded &amp; animated to Faithfulneſs in the great &amp; important. Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs committed to our Charge; let our great Ambition, our earneſt wiſhes and Prayers, our
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005975_0030_10271CA8E5353908"/>
moſt zealous Endeavours be that the GOD of Glory may be glorified among Men, and that <hi>things may go well</hi> in our Land.</p>
            <p>LET us remember that by the Doctrins we preach, and the exemplary Lives we ſhould live, we are to be <hi>the Salt of the Earth and Lights to the World.</hi> Of what great Importance is it that we preach found Doctrin, and recommend it by Solid Arguments, and make it appear that we are in good Earneſt, by living our ſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine we preach to others? There is nothing more ſcandalous than a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a looſe, vicious Life, nor any thing more for the Honour of Religion, than found Doctrin and a good Life in ſuch whoſe Buſineſs it is to teach &amp; recommend Religion to others. How much may we do to diſſwade Men from Vice, and perſwade them to Religion by ſetting forth the Excellency of the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST; by placing the Doctrines, Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings of Chriſtianity in their true Light, and by making it appear in our whole Conduct that we act under the Influence of theſe things our ſelves? This will be of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tendency to promote Faith &amp; Piety, Truth and Vertue among our People. Theſe I know are common Topics; but they can never be made too familiar by frequent Repetitions.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER we may do much, by the Bleſſing of GOD, to the encouraging the Hearts
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005975_0031_10271CABE9AF9D98"/>
and ſtrengthning the Hands of our honourable civil Rulers, by teaching, and inculcating upon our People their great obligations to yield Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Reſpect and Reverence to their Perſons, and all Loyalty, Submiſſion and Obedience to their wholſom Laws and wiſe Government. A Diſloyal ſeditious Miniſter may do much to the ſpreading the pernicious Seeds of Diſloyalty and Sedition among the People; and one who is a good Subject himſelf may do much to the making his People of that Temper and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: Therefore if we deſire, according to our ſolemn Obligations, to contribute <hi>to things go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well in our Land,</hi> let us ſhew ourſelves loyal Subjects, and preſs and urge Loyalty upon our People.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE in as much as we are in a peculiar Senſe Paſtors and Miniſters of the Church of CHRIST, I would humbly propoſe one thing more to your Conſideration, which I can but look upon as a Matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the publick Weal. The Conſtitution of the Churches in this Government is, by the Smiles of divine Providence on the pious Care of our fore Fathers, without Controverſy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently calculated and ſettled; there is a wiſe Proviſion made that particular Churches may mutually help each other, by the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Councils made up of the Elders and Meſſengers, of the Churches, in each particular
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005975_0032_10271CAD8A7DD638"/>
County: but then I would humbly propoſe whether this Help and Aſſiſtance of Churches to each other would not be more extenſive and beneficial, provided there was a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil made up of Elders &amp; Meſſengers from each County in the Government, and thereby our general annual Aſſociation turned into a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral annual Conſociation or Council? this would be a Bond to unite and cement the whole, and would put the Churches of each particular County, under Advantage of affording, that Help and Aſſiſtance to each other, which by their being now ſo much independent of one another, they are in great Meaſure incapable of. Time will not admit, that I enlarge upon the Subject, therefore I would only ſay, that if ſuch a thing was put on Foot and we could have the Countenance of our honourable civil <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature</hi> it might be very conducive to things going well in this Government.</p>
            <p>AND as we tender the welfare of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; the Churches of CHRIST and as we would be faithful to the Souls of our People, it ſtands us in Hand unitedly to endeavour, as far as our Influence reaches, to heal thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that are among us; and to ſtand up for the Peace &amp; Order of the Churches of CHRIST, by not ſuffering our ſelves to be prevailed upon by any ſpecious, plauſible Pretences whatſoever to give Countenance or Encouragement to thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005975_0033_10271CB28E79BBF8"/>
who are ſpreading Enthuſiaſm, and ſowing the ſeeds of Contention and Diſcord in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FINALLY in order that we may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Bleſſings, in the Places in which we live tis neceſſary that we be much in Prayer, and very fructious in the ſacred Scriptures; that we be earneſt in our Prayers for our civil Rulers and the People they govern. We ſhould be inſtant in Prayer that we may have ſuch Rulers as ſhall <hi>be Miniſters of GOD unto us for good</hi>; and that under their Government <hi>we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs &amp; Honeſtly. This is good and acceptable in the ſight of GOD our Saviour,</hi> and has an happy Tendency to make things go well.</p>
            <p>AND that we may ſee our Duty to GOD and Man laid before us in the moſt plain &amp; amiable Light, and preſſed upon us by the moſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, powerful Arguments tis of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that we bend our Thoughts unweariedly to the ſtudy of <hi>ſacred Writ.</hi> There is nothing will fill the Mind with greater Pleaſure, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify us better <hi>to do good</hi> in our Calling, than an exact and accurate Knowlege of <hi>the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> And if a great Part of our Time was ſpent in ſtudying into the true &amp; original Senſe of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as to particlar Texts, and Phraſes, and the general Run of the ſeveral <hi>Books,</hi> its Connexion together, and that general
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005975_0034_10271CB544665F90"/>
Scheme of Religion taught therein, without any Prejudice to Sects &amp; Parties, to the Authority of Men or human <hi>Analogies of Faith,</hi> we ſhould find it of moſt excellent Uſefulneſs to engage our Minds to GOD and Religion, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our Zeal <hi>to do good,</hi> furniſh us with Arguments to recommend Religion to others: There is nothing will diſcountenance Vice and Error ſo much as the genuine Doctrines of the Goſpel placed in their true Light. There is no Doubt but Infidelity on the one Hand, and Enthuſiaſm on the other, and Vice which is the natural Fruit of both, proceed from Ignorance of divine Revelation. Could the Infidel be brought to underſtand the BIBLE in its true Senſe he muſt be forced to reverence that which he now ridicules. Could the Enthuſiaſt but have his Eyes opened to ſee the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, it would neceſſarily reduce him to a ſober Mind; and could the vicious Impenitent be brought to read with Attention and underſtand as he reads he would behold Vice branded with ſuch black &amp; odius Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and Vertue ſhining in ſuch amiable Luſtre and inviting him with ſuch engaging, captivating Charms, that he muſt if he acted like a reaſonable Creature, abhor the one, and be enamour'd of the other, and in the Event caſt himſelf into the Hands of JESUS to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Grace to Pardon and renew him to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005975_0035_10271CB722986260"/>
Therefore I would with the utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity beſeech Miniſters of the Goſpel to ſtudy the Scriptures Day &amp; Night, and ſtrive to raiſe in their People an high Taſte &amp; Reliſh of them: than which nothing would make us more extenſive Bleſſings or qualify us better to do good to the People whom we ſerve, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them in the Ways of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Piety &amp; Vertue; hereby we ſhall be under the moſt happy Advantage of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and influencing them by the ſtrongeſt and moſt effectual Motives <hi>to fear GOD and Honour the King,</hi> and yeild all dutiful Submiſſion and Loyalty to ſubordinate civil Rulers, to the Glory of the great GOD, to the Peace &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Common-wealth, to the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of CHRIST and the Securing for themſelves a Bleſſed Immortality. AMEN.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>And laſtly I would briefly addreſs my ſelf to this Auditory in General.</hi> And I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, there is not one Perſon, in this great Concourſe from the least to the greateſt, but what may do ſomthing to the making <hi>things go well</hi> in this Government. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have a larger Sphere of Action than others, and have greater Talents and Opportunities of doing Service to GOD, and their Country: but there are none of you all, but what may contribute to the Welfare of your Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:005975_0036_10271CB9CE36B3D0"/>HEADS of Families may do much for the good of the Government, by inſtilling Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety &amp; Sobriety, Juſtice and Loyalty into the Minds of thoſe under their Care. Indeed good family Government is of mighty Influence to pave the Way, for an happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in all civil and religious Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; therefore I would in Love and Charity beſeech Heads of Families to conſider whether they would have their Children be ſuch as to be a Scandal to their Houſes, a Reproach to their Country, a Blemiſh to the Chriſtian Name, and at laſt fire Brands of Hell, or on the contrary Bleſſings in their Generation and Heirs to an heavenly glorious Inheritance in the everlaſting Kingdom of CHRIST. Theſe two things you have before you. Look upon your Children; which of them can you ſpare for Infamy and Damnation? which of them can you willngly devote to be an Enemy to GOD, a Traytor to his Country, a Slave to his Luſts and a Subject to the Kingdom of Darkneſs? Oh, let the Love of a Parent determine the Matter! Will you not ſay they are all dear to me as my own Fleſh: I devoted them all to GOD in Baptiſm; I can ſpare none of them, for ſuch an infamous Life, and ſuch a fearful dolorous End. If this be the Caſe, let me by the Love of GOD, and the Love you bear to your Children, beg and intreat of you, to bring them up for GOD,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005975_0037_10271CBFE4CE7858"/>
bring them up for your Country, bring them up for Heaven, otherwiſe their Deſtruction will be laid to your Charge.</p>
            <p>I would moreover add that Children &amp; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may likewiſe prove Benefactors to their Country, by Dutifulneſs to their Parents and Maſters, by their Piety and Vertue, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Prudence.</p>
            <p>I would likewiſe plead the Cauſe of GOD and my Country, with all of every Sort &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, Buſineſs &amp; Employment, Students and Mechanicks, thoſe that are engaged in Huſbandry, Trade or Navigation; you are all of you under Advantage of doing good to your Country, by fixing upon a Life of Piety and Vertue, and living in a Courſe of Honeſty and Integrity, Juſtice, Prudence and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>WHAT happy Times ſhould we have if the Body of our People would unite in doing what they can <hi>to make things go well in the Land</hi>? if we ſhould all unite in a cordial effectual Belief of the great &amp; fundamental Doctrines of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Practice of the ſubſtantial Duties of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in fervent Prayers to GOD and Charity to one another, and a conſcientious Care to be found faithful in our ſeveral Places and Callings. All dark impending Clouds would ſoon ſcatter, <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> in greater ſplendor and Glory <hi>would riſe</hi> upon us, <hi>with Healing in his wings,</hi> Diſpenſing Pardon to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005975_0038_10271CC42A98D8A0"/>
our guilty Land, reſtoring the divine Bleſſings we had forfeited, and give the Angels occaſion to renew their Song, <hi>Glory to GOD in the higheſt and on Earth peace and good will towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now who is there that does not think this a Prize worth contending for? who would not attempt the moſt arduous Taſk for ſo great and comprehenſive a Bleſſing? But when all this may be obtained at the eaſy Rate of living up to the Character of Men, and rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, upon the reaſonable Terms of ſubmitting to the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, of Loving GOD and keeping his Commandments, of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtly, Loving mercy and walking humbly with our GOD,</hi> and finally of obſerving that golden Rule, <hi>As ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to them likewiſe,</hi> how blind are we to our own Happineſs to refuſe it upon ſuch Terms? may GOD make us Wiſe to know the things that belong to our Peace now in this our Day before they are hid from our Eyes. <hi>And now, Brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his Grace, which is able build you up, and give you an Inheritance among, all them that are Sanctified</hi>: And that you may have the Smile of GOD's Providence and the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Grace continually with you <hi>GOD in infinite Mercy grant thro</hi>' JESUS CHRIST.
