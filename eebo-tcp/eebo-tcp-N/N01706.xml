            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS 'tis Man's <hi>Sin, Shame</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> to be eſtrang'd and alienated from God; ſo it's his <hi>duty, honour</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> to return to God, be acquainted with Him, conform'd to His Image and poſſeſs'd of His ſpecial favour in Chriſt. Men conſider'd as Fallen &amp; Apoſtate (as they derive from rebellious Adam) are running away from God, and poſting on in the broad way to deſtruction; but the Son of God was manifeſted to deſtroy the works of the Devil, to reduce ſinful Men, and bring them back to the only Author of their being and bleſſedneſs. He ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, <hi>that He might bring us to God. He gave himſelf for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us to Himſelf for a peculiar People zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works.</hi> And His <hi>Holy Word,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are the grand Means or <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>purifying</hi> Sinners: they're able to make Men wiſe to Salvation, thro' Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. The Scope and tendency of them is, to turn Men from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan
<pb facs="unknown:002024_0003_0FBA810BB81D43D0"/>
unto God. <hi>Sanctify them thro' thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> The <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> does not go without the <hi>Belief of the Truth.</hi> All therefore who enjoy the <hi>Word of God,</hi> ſhould diligently <hi>Read, Hear, Study</hi> the ſame, meditating on it Day and Night: they ſhould endeavour &amp; pray that they may rightly underſtand it, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and continually conform their hearts and lives unto it. All under the Goſpel ſhould do ſo, and the <hi>ſooner</hi> they begin, and the more conſtant and vigorous they are in ſuch a courſe, ſo much the better; ſo much the more 'twill be for God's Glory and their own Advantage. <hi>Young</hi> Ones therefore ſhould be moſt <hi>ſpeedy, hearty,</hi> and alſo <hi>unmoveable</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in conforming to God's holy revealed Will. A ſerious reading the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sermons,</hi> muſt needs be proper to move and quicken them to ſuch a Life. They contain ſuch <hi>ſtrong Arguments, weighty Motives,</hi> lively and <hi>cogent Inculcations of Duty,</hi> plain repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>danger of careleſs ſloth &amp; negligence,</hi> and ſuch <hi>ſuitable Directions</hi>; as that a ſerious, healty, attending to them, and regarding of them, muſt needs be very uſeful and profitable to <hi>all Young Perſons</hi> whatſoever. Indeed a ſerious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate peruſing of them, can't but be profitable to all Perſons whatſoever, even the Oldeſt, and thoſe that have made moſt proficiency in the practice of Piety: here they may find freſh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to bewail their deficiences &amp; ſhort comings, as well as to praiſe the God of all Grace for the great things He has done for their Souls. They're profitable for <hi>Old Sinners,</hi> that by conſidering how they have trifled away their precious Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, abus'd Divine Patience lengthen'd out to

long-ſuffering, practically deſpis'd the <hi>Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings</hi> of the Glorious God, and thereby render'd themſelves grievouſly obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to His moſt terrible Vengeance; they may be mov'd and quicken'd, to the moſt ſpeedy vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous endeavours to get their peace made with God, before their near approaching Death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes them. They're profitable for thoſe who have Young Ones under their Care, that they may be mov'd hereby to do their utmoſt for their ſpiritual good and benefit. But as theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> were more eſpecially deſign'd, for the benefitting of <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> ſo to ſuch I would hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is call'd by ſome, <hi>The Young Man's Practical Catechiſm,</hi> ſet down by way of Queſtion and Anſwer. Others indeed take the whole Verſe to be <hi>one intire</hi> Queſtion, ſtanding thus, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall a Young Man cleanſe his way, to take heed to thy Word?</hi> The Original will admit this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſome Ancient Verſions (as Mr. <hi>Shower</hi> on our Text obſerves) do countenance it. The ſenſe (ſays He) accordingly is, "How ſhall Young Men be purged by Divine Grace, ſo as thereby to be qualify'd for Obedience to (the Word of) God. It is a kind of Prayer (in a Poetic ſtrain) for that Grace, which is neceſſary to holy walking." So <hi>Cleanſing the Way of Youth</hi> is conſidered as a <hi>Means</hi> to promote their practical <hi>conformity</hi> to God's holy <hi>Law.</hi> Pſal. 119.101. <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT moſt Interpreters underſtand the latter Clauſe to be <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and to come in by way of <hi>Reply</hi> to the former; ſo directing Youth to a careful obſervation of God's Word, as a neceſſary and uſeful means to rectify and cleanſe their way. Pſal, 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE may here obſerve, that the Word [<hi>thereto</hi>] is not in the <hi>Original,</hi> but is a <hi>Suppletive</hi> of the <hi>Tranſlators,</hi> and I ſhall preſume to leave it out.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Terms</hi> in the Text are all obvious and eaſy. By [<hi>a Young Man</hi>] is meant Youth <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> altho' ſome interpret it of a "<hi>Child of God, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Early Days,</hi> not any appropriate Sex or Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; Youth <hi>Irreſtrictively,</hi> It is not to be look'd upon as Excluſive of, or in contradiſtinction to other Ages; Elder and Younger are under the Direction of the ſame Rule, and the Obligation of the ſame Law.</p>
            <p>BY [<hi>cleanſing his way</hi>] is meant a rectifying his inward Principles and temper of mind, and a reforming his outward practice and tenor of Life, which are defiled by Sin; a recovering himſelf and cleanſing his way from moral pollution, a breaking off from Sin, the <hi>unclean thing, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth a Man,</hi> a waſhing off this filth with the Tears of Repentance; purifying his Soul in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth. There is indeed another <hi>Purging our Sins,</hi> which ſounds the ſame with <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Juſtification, He is faithful to forgive us our Sins and to cleanſe us, &amp;c. The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all Sin.</hi> But this belongs wholly unto God, <hi>(Who can forgive Sins, ſave God only?)</hi> and is not the Cleanſing intended in our Text. The Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing here ſpoken of relates to the work of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and implies <hi>the Mortification of our Laſts, and the Reformation of our Lives.</hi> In this work <hi>we</hi> are ſubordinate <hi>Agents,</hi> working together with God and in the ſtrength of his Grace. 'Twas <hi>Naamans</hi> pride and folly, when he came to <hi>

            <p>BY [<hi>thy Word</hi>] is meant the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> even <hi>All Scripture that is given by Inſpiration of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002024_0011_0FBA812306C93A78"/>
God.</hi> Indeed the Writings of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are here particularly refer'd to, theſe only, (and that but part of them) being extant in <hi>Davids</hi> time. But the reſt of the Old-Teſtament, and the whole of the New-Teſtament, being Divinely inſpir'd, and profitable to make Men wiſe unto Salvation, they are alſo to be conſidered as imply'd in the <hi>Word</hi> ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>BY [<hi>taking heed</hi>] to the Word of God, is meant a diligent <hi>obſerving</hi> or <hi>keeping</hi> of it. This is the genuine import of the Original Word [<hi>Shamar.</hi>] It is variouſly tranſlated; Sometimes to <hi>obſerve, Gen.</hi> 37.11. His Father <hi>obſerved</hi> the ſaying; So, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. Be courageous, that thou mayſt <hi>obſerve</hi> to do according to all the Law. Sometimes to <hi>take heed to,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>keep</hi>; It is thus diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently rendred in one and the ſame Verſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. I ſaid, I will <hi>take heed to</hi> my ways,—I will <hi>keep</hi> my mouth. So, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.28. I <hi>kept</hi> the matter in my heart. So in the Verſe before our Text, I will <hi>keep</hi> thy Statutes,—and in 17 Verſe— that I may live and <hi>keep</hi> thy Word. Again, Sometimes to <hi>preſerve,</hi> Pſal. 116.6. The Lord <hi>preſerveth</hi> the ſimple. Again, to <hi>mark,</hi> Pſal. 130.3. If thou ſhouldſt <hi>mark</hi> iniquities—</p>
            <p>IF Young Men wou'd Cleanſe their way, they muſt take heed to God's Word, ſollicitouſly ſtudy, critically obſerve, and ſeriouſly ponder it, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply it, and diligently conform to it.</p>

            <p>AGAIN, <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Moral Head</hi> of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, deſcending from him by ordinary Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was our common Proxy or Deputy, and had a power to chuſe &amp; act, not only for himſelf, but for his univerſal Progeny. All Mankind were radically in him as their natural Original, and virtually in him as their Surety, Surrogate, or Vicegerent; By him they were all to ſtand, or in him to fall.</p>
            <p>HERE we muſt note, that <hi>Adam</hi> tho' created in a ſtate of <hi>Innocency,</hi> yet was not fixed in a ſtate of abſolute <hi>impeccability.</hi> Tho' perfect Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002024_0019_0FBA81346C040D18"/>
inconſiſtent with that moral freedom of will, which put him into a ſtate of mutability, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to the efficacy of ſinful temptations, and render'd him capable of rewards &amp; puniſhments.</p>
            <p>AND accordingly it pleaſed God to treat him, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> in a <hi>Faederal</hi> way; entering into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Adam, as ſtanding in a publick capacity and perſonating all his Deſcendents, wherein He promiſed Life, and threatned Death. And beſides the invariable <hi>moral</hi> Law, internal and ſubjective to his reaſonable nature, it pleaſed God to make trial of Adams obedience by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>poſitive</hi> external Prohibition, in a matter of pure indifference antecedently to the Divine Precept, but becoming obligatory meerly by the will of the Lawgiver. This prohibition was, that he ſhou'd <hi>not eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> Gen. 2.16. And this ſpecial Command was of the ſame obligation, &amp; guarded with the ſame Sanctions, as the Eternal Law of Creation. The <hi>giving</hi> of it, was a mark of <hi>Sovereign</hi> Dominion, and the <hi>obſerving</hi> of it would have been a reaſonable Service, &amp; moſt <hi>refin'd</hi> obedience.</p>
            <p>BUT Adam (to the juſt aſtoniſhment of Heaven and Earth) thro' unaccountable careleſneſs was decoy'd by the inſinuating Tempter into rebellion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruin. Being drawn by Satans Lures, he ſtrangely revolted from God, leap'd the boundaries of the Divine Law, and brake thro' all reſtraints and preſervatives, and did voluntarily eat of the forbidden Fruit. Now this rebellious tranſgreſſion in its nature contain'd a violation of the whole Law, an entire renunciation of God, &amp; embracing the Creature as the chief Good, and Satan as the beſt Maſter. Hence the habit of Original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002024_0020_0FBA8135DF5A9C80"/>
was loſt, &amp; all moral excellencies effaced and extinguiſht, and an univerſal permanent corruption and foul deformity introduced, by a judicial act of God as a part of the Curſe, and puniſhment of the firſt Sin. And now this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal corruption and degeneracy, conſider'd as a puniſhment, is <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> derived from Adam, and "falls under the ordination of divine Juſtice". It is not only a fatal Legacy left us by our Firſt Parents, but a <hi>Divine Curſe</hi> entailed upon us. All Mankind were legally Parties in the faederal tranſaction with Adam in innocency, and were underſtood to be virtually Accomplices in his Rebellion; hence his tranſgreſſion was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate and meerly perſonal, but a common Guilt, a Sin of the whole Nature and univerſal Race; And the Puniſhment has a proportionable extent and adaquate comprehenſion. Hence <hi>Spiritual Death</hi> which is one part of the Curſe, and the wages of Sin, is the unavoidable Lot of all the Children of Adam, thro' the righteous Judgment of God. Our Firſt Parents ſinned and are not, and we have born their iniquity; God viſits the iniquity of the Father upon the Children from Generation to Generation. All the unhappy Deſcendents of Adam do taſte the ſowre fruits of his Apoſtacy, and inherit the foul impurity of his Nature; and that <hi>juſtly,</hi> without any breach upon the Laws of common Equity: For, That which is allowable and unrebukable in the Gods of the Earth, is much more ſo in the Great GOD of Heaven, whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all, and a Scepter of righteouſneſs is the Scepter of His Kingdom. There can be no colour of pretence to impeach the Government of Injuſtice barely

for permitting Children to ſuffer ſuch Evils, as are but the puniſhment of their Fathers Sins, wiſely and juſtly allotted to them by the Laws, which they are ſubject unto. The Publick Authority is not ſatisfy'd (for inſtance) with the puniſhment of <hi>Treaſon</hi> in the ſingle Perſon of the Rebel alone, but his Eſtate is confiſcated, his Dignities forfeited, his Blood ſtain'd, and nothing but ignominy and poverty deſcends to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Heirs, by virtue of ſome humane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And after this, what can we object, what room have we to diſpute the Divine Juſtice in the communication of Original Sin, to the Poſterity of Adam, ſince they, being in his Loins as their Parent, and in his Covenant as their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, are intereſted in the guilt of his firſt Tranſgreſſion? Being thus <hi>entitul'd</hi> to the Penalty, it is <hi>juſtly inflicted</hi> upon them. Therefore with the Apoſtle we muſt believe with our hearts, and confeſs with our mouths, That <hi>in Adam all die, By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned. By the offence of one, judgment came upon all Men to condemnation, and by one Man's diſobedience, many were made Sinners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. Rom. 5.12, 18, 9. We muſt every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the Pſalmiſt, (Pſal. 51.5.) <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> All Mankind agree in their native pravity, "whatſoever difference there may be in their Climates, Colours", and outward Circumſtances. This Spiritual Death not only reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but it is an Epidemical Plague, that reaches all Men to the lateſt period of the World.</p>

'Tis <hi>Luſt</hi> in the heart <hi>that conceiveth and bringeth forth Sin,</hi> Jam. 1.15. All ſinful tho'ts, words and deeds are the iſſue and product of our corrupt nature.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>THIS Corruption ſtains and defiles every Age of Life.</hi> It is a principle that is always ſtirring, never ſtill; a Fountain ever flowing, and foaming out impurities.

There is no Period of Humane Life, wherein any can ſay, <hi>I am pure from Sin,</hi> (Prov. 20.9.) The root of bitterneſs ſhoots out, and the corrupt Tree brings forth fruit in every Seaſon.

Pure Religion is founded in a pure Heart. We muſt <hi>purify our Souls</hi> in obeying the Truth—(1 Pet. 1.22.) If the Fountain be muddy all the Streams muſt needs partake of the infection. The Rule is, (Mat. 23.26.) <hi>Cleanſe firſt that which is within, that the outſide may be clean alſo.</hi> Unregenerate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is but <hi>the Leaven of the Phariſees, which is</hi> vile <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> We are ſtill in the ſtate of carnal nature, and are but <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> unleſs all the powers of our Souls are waſhed in the Laver of ſpiritual Regeneration.

            <p>THUS "the <hi>Extent</hi> of this purifying is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the outward and inward Man, from ſinful inclinations and vitious acts; and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> of it muſt be, 'till we are cleanſed from <hi>every ſpot, and become glorious in Holineſs</hi>". Progreſs and Perſeverance in this work is an invariable Character of Sincerity, and "the Crown of Chriſtianity". We read, (Job. 17.9.) <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that bath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> We have not only that Precept, (Iſai. 1.16, 7.) <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well:</hi> but alſo that, (1 Tim. 5.22.) <hi>Keep thy ſelf pure;—Continue in the way of well doing.</hi> The days of our Purification indeed muſt run parallel with the days of Life.</p>
            <p>QUES. II. <hi>WHY</hi> do's it concern Men <hi>in their Youth</hi> thus to Cleanſe their Way? To clear this Head, let us conſider the following Particulars.</p>

Straight is the Gate; With Men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible!</hi> Thus the <hi>Work</hi> is made greater and more difficult by delays. Moreover, <hi>in Youth our advantages are greater; then</hi> we have <hi>ſpecial</hi> Helps, Opportunities and Conveniencies. If we <hi>now</hi> begin our work, we have in an ordinary way <hi>more Time</hi> before us to do it in. And <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtriving with us; the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord moſt forward to come to the <hi>Pool,</hi> and <hi>move the Waters</hi> of healing; And <hi>Youth</hi> is the <hi>Age of Diſcipline,</hi> moſt capable of Inſtruction, moſt flexible to Convictions, moſt ſuſceptible of Impreſſions. Now the Underſtanding is ordinarily moſt ready and perceptive, the Will moſt obſequious, the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Paſſions moſt governable, the Memory moſt deeply receptive as well as ſtrongly reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and all the Faculties of Life moſt apt and able for Service and Employment. For <hi>Youth</hi> is the Age of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> (as well as tractableneſs,) the Morning of our day, the Excellency of our ſtrength, the Spring of Life, moſt <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> diſpos'd to Action, and admirable at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Now the Faculties of Soul and Body are in their prime, moſt capable of bearing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and doing the duties, that attend the work of Sanctification.—Is it not beſotting <hi>folly</hi> then, to <hi>defer</hi> cleanſing our ways, and <hi>let ſlip</hi> this <hi>Golden</hi> Opportunity, and make that the task of drooping Sickneſs, or ſupine tottering Age, which demands the moſt ſanguine Efforts of ſprightly Health and active Youth? But further, <hi>Youth</hi> is more under the checks of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the reſtraints of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> which are a good <hi>Barrier</hi> to ſecure us <hi>againſt</hi> Sin, and a mighty

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>AND now what a forceable Argument is this to engage Men in their Youth to cleanſe their ways?

Religion will contribute to your Advancement. <hi>The diligent Hand maketh rich</hi>; and Religion tends to promote Induſtry: <hi>The Bleſſing of the Lord mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rich</hi>; and the promiſe of this, is only to the Righteous, to them who <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God,</hi> and ſeek this World <hi>after a Godly ſort.</hi> Further, to be conſcientious, upright, and honeſt, is the way to <hi>find favour and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the ſight of Men</hi>; By undiſguis'd hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and unaffected piety Men ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all thinking ſober People; every one will be ready to pay reſpect to them, to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, and put them into buſineſs and employment, &amp;c. becauſe they are <hi>true Men, the faithful in the Land.</hi> All which Articles conſpire to promote the Poor among the Brethren. <hi>Or,</hi> art thou <hi>Rich in this Worlds Goods</hi>?

In all the admirable Volumes of the Celebrated <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophers, there is not the leaſt hint, or tittle of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Salvation</hi> thro' Him. "The work of Redemption is not engraven on the work of Creation, nor of Providence". Apoſtate Man's <hi>Salvation</hi> is not a Thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inferr'd from the Being and general Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, <hi>of which He never left Himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſs.</hi> (Act. 14.17.) The Heathen World had but a very weak and wavering apprehenſion of the Mercy of God. And the <hi>Method</hi> of this Salvation, is myſterious, and ſublime, above the flight of humane reaſon, how highly ſoever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and no doubt it was a ſurprize to <hi>the Angels of Light</hi> and <hi>the Spirits of Darkneſs,</hi> that the <hi>Only begotten Son of God</hi> ſhou'd aſſume our Nature and therein be <hi>obedient</hi> even <hi>to the curſed Death of the

Croſs</hi>; and that in <hi>Chriſt crucify'd</hi> God ſhou'd be <hi>reconciling the World unto Himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes.</hi> This way of Reconciliation is above the ken of the moſt penetrating natural underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; is <hi>brought to Light</hi> only in the <hi>Goſpel of Peace.</hi> And without this, it might have remain'd a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for ever. Chriſt is the Light of the World, and the Word of God is the only Teleſcope to diſcover this great Luminary to the World. <hi>Fleſh and Blood cou'd never have revealed</hi> Chriſt <hi>unto us,</hi> (Mat. 16.17.)</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>
               <hi>WITHOUT Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> (Heb. 11.6.) <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> (Rom. 14.23.) "By Faith Chriſtians may derive a worthineſs and virtue to their meaneſt performances,"—but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vital efficacy of this Grace all their glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties are but <hi>dead works,</hi> &amp; lifeleſs ſhadows, unacceptable to God, and unavailable to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But now without the Scriptures, we ſhou'd be entirely at a loſs, as to this ſuper-natural Grace. Hence it is ſaid, Joh. 20.31. <hi>Theſe are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:002024_0111_0FBA792A5C215EC8"/>
the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life thro' his name.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of Faith is only reveal'd in the Scripture, and ſo the <hi>ground</hi> of Faith depends on the Scripture. True Faith is built on the Teſtimony of God, and is reſolv'd into the authority and veracity of God ſpeaking in His Word. But how ſhall any one believe, without knowing the teſtimony that is given? How is it poſſible for any to believe aright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Redeemer, either as to matter or manner, without revelation?—and this is to be found no where but in the written Word, or <hi>Bible,</hi> (Rom. 10.14, 17.) This is the alone adaequate Rule and Foundation of Faith; and that Faith (whatever it relates to) is not <hi>Divine,</hi> but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Humane,</hi> which ariſes barely from natural Light.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, As to the Grace of filial <hi>Fear,</hi> we ſhou'd alſo be at a loſs without the Scriptures. We may indeed be ſtruck with a trembling <hi>horror,</hi> and ſervile <hi>dread</hi> of God, from ſome amazing diſplays of His terrible Greatneſs, and awful Holineſs in the works of Creation and Providence; but that is no <hi>gratious</hi> paſſion, which is only tormenting to ſenſe, and throws the mind into a ſtorm and confuſion It is only the Scriptures that bring to light thoſe ingenuous conſiderations, that are proper and apt ſo to temper and purify this affection, as to render it an <hi>acceptable reverence, and godly fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, As to the Grace of <hi>Love</hi>; in this we ſhou'd be very defective without the knowledge of the Scriptures. Love is the generous principle of willing obedience to God, the ſubſtance of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Religion, &amp; the perfective character of moral Vertues. Now the writings of the wiſeſt Heathen ſay
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002024_0112_0FBA792C884E1558"/>
little or nothing of this affection. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only recommend, and enjoin this Principle; and they only furniſh us with ſuitable and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excitations to enliven and actuate it. Love has a great many incentives from the Goodneſs of God Eſſential, Creating, and Providential; But this Grace "never breaths like it ſelf", 'till animated and warmed by motives of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> ſtrain. Unleſs the <hi>Love of God in Christ conſtrain us</hi> and inflame our affections, <hi>when we thus judge that Chriſt by the grace of God taſted Death for every man,</hi> our Love is not genuine, &amp; true; but where is the Love of God in Chriſt revealed, ſave in the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, THE knowlege of the Scriptures is neceſſary to the conſtitution of a regular <hi>Hope.</hi> As Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are the Baſis of Hope; But theſe are revealed in the Scriptures only. It is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AGAIN, As to the <hi>Parts</hi> of Duty, what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable loſs ſhou'd be at without the conduct of Scripture-Light? The whole World indeed, <hi>even the People that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Word does not ſhine. Every one walketh <hi>in the way of his God, in the way of his own heart, and in the ſight of his own eyes. There are that follow after lying vanities, and do ſervice to them, that are by nature no God's.</hi> (Gal. 4.8.) There are <hi>that know God, but glorify Him not as God, being vain in their imaginations.</hi> (Rom. 1.21.)</p>
            <p>AS for the <hi>Poſitive</hi> Inſtitutions of the Worſhip of God, <hi>(agreeable to what One obſerves)</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting immediately from His arbitrary &amp; abſolute Will, Hence ſuch as are ſtrangers to the written Word, muſt undoubtedly be unacquainted with their nature, number, ends &amp; uſes. And for want of a careful regard to the Word of God, what fopperies and follies do ſuch, as enjoy it, many times bring into the Worſhip of God? What <hi>vain Oblations</hi> do they offer, and what <hi>corrupt things do they Sacrifice to the Lord,</hi> who take their meaſures from a luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant Invention, and not from divine Revelation?</p>
            <p>AND then, as to thoſe Duties that are <hi>Moral,</hi> of immutable reaſon, and perpetual obligation, the Word of God is a moſt neceſſary &amp; ſufficient Guide unto us. It gives us a complete Syſtem of natural Religion &amp; moral Vertues, ſuch as the beſt Maſters of Morality in the Heathen World cou'd never afford. <hi>Their</hi> pureſt Ethicks were ſtain'd with impure mixtures, with corrupt Precepts, or falſe permiſſions; &amp; the greateſt Length that ever any attain'd by the help of their moſt excellent rules, was only a negative purity, moral honeſty, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial civility, juſtice, kindneſs and honor; all which is vaſtly ſhort of our juſt obligations. The <hi>School of Nature</hi> was never ſo illuminated, as to be able to teach us our univerſal Duty. But the <hi>Word</hi> of God "ſets before us a Rule of Life
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002024_0114_0FBA793064DD9B58"/>
pure and perſpicuous, in nothing ſuperfluous or defective, but comprehending the entire duty of Man". <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> (Pſal. 19.7.) The Scripture contains <hi>all the Ordinances, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord.</hi> It tells us <hi>what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God</hi>; It ſhews us <hi>what is good, and what the Lord our God doth require of us,</hi> and that in it's full latitude, and extent. It deſcribes all thoſe works of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> (which more immediately reſpect the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>our ſelves</hi>) and all thoſe works of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> (which do principally reſpect our carriage towards our <hi>Neighbour</hi> (and all thoſe works of <hi>Piety,</hi> (that chiefly reſpect our behaviour towards <hi>God)</hi> which general Heads comprize the ſum of our Duty, and are the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of that Holineſs, which is the appointed condition of Salvation. The Precepts of the Word extend to the <hi>whole Man,</hi> direct all the Powers of the Soul, and preſide over the ſenſes and members of the Body. They reach to <hi>all Caſes,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and inſtruct us how to behave our ſelves in every ſtation and relation, in every ſtate and condition of Life. The Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſcribes the moſt perfect Law &amp; conſummate indefective Rule to <hi>order our Converſation</hi> by, that ever the World heard of. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> therefore are they, and <hi>highly favour'd of the Lord,</hi> unto whom <hi>He has written the great things of his Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, The Word of God ſtates the true <hi>Ends,</hi> which ſhou'd influence &amp; governs us in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in order to their rectitude. Purity of intention is a neceſſary qualification, yea, the very Life &amp; Soul of a good work. And be an act never ſo ſpecious and

commendable for the ſubſtance and manner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be directed to a right end, the beauty of it is ſpoiled and the reward forfeited. A wrong end is <hi>a dead fly in the pretious ointment</hi>; This <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts</hi> &amp; <hi>vatiates</hi> our beſt performances. A great part of our Duty then lies in fixing right aims, and propoſing regular ends. Now there are inferior and ſubordinate ends, as the real felicity of our own Souls, and the true Good of our Neighbours, and there is alſo a principal, or ultimate end, as the Glory of God, to which our actions ſhou'd be directed. Our duty is not perfect, unleſs we therein aſpire after the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> as our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme end. Nothing is more reaſonable, than that <hi>we do all for the Glory of God</hi>; ſeeing we <hi>derive</hi> all our powers and enjoyments <hi>from</hi> Him, we ſhou'd <hi>improve</hi> all <hi>for</hi> Him; "we do all <hi>by</hi> Him, therefore we ſhou'd do all <hi>to</hi> Him": Beſides, this is the ſame end, which God Himſelf acts for; Hence it muſt needs be the beſt &amp; higheſt, and challenges the priority of all other ends in our intentions.</p>

As for the Pagan Philoſophers, they were moſt notoriouſly deficient in this matter. In their moſt <hi>refined Morals,</hi> they never mentioned it. They chiefly recommended vertue, only as the way to honor and eaſe in the World, or a means of pleaſure, and internal Peace; And the utmoſt pitch they
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002024_0116_0FBA793589638C98"/>
ever came to, was to propoſe the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the amiable rectitude and inherient excellency of virtue: But this is ſtill too low and mean a motive. "For Vertue is but a Ray of the Deity", and we are not perfect in any good work, "unleſs it be finally referr'd to His Glory who is the Principle and Pattern of it". It is then the diſtinguiſhing character of God's Word, It's peculiar dignity above all humane Writings, that it directs our performances to the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy end, the Glory of God.— Thus the Word of God, directs us into the way of Holineſs. It is a <hi>Light to the paths of righteouſneſs, The way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring Men, though fools, ſhall not err therein.</hi> (Iſai. 35.8.) To enjoy the Word is then a great mercy and benefit to a People. <hi>What advantage hath the</hi> Chriſtian? <hi>much every way: chiefly becauſe that unto them are committed the Oracles of God,</hi> (Rom. 3.1, 2.) Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation, and as for his judgments they have not known them.

And thus the Word operates <hi>objectively</hi> in the work of Sanctification.</p>

God for Sanctification. The Petition of our Saviour, (Joh. 17.7.) <hi>Sanctify them thro' thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> ſeems to intimate more than a bare objective relation to this work; it both <hi>ſhows</hi> us our ſpots, and <hi>cleanſes</hi> 'em. It is a Seed: Seed tho' ſmall, is active. 'Tis a Glaſs, that not only repreſents the Image of God, but <hi>by the Spirit changeth us into it,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. How powerful is that Word, which changeth a Beaſt into a Man, a Devil into an Angel, a Clod of Earth into a Star of Heaven! 'Tis above the power of all moral Philoſophy, and the Political Government ef the beſt States. It's power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the <hi>Subjects</hi> it hath been inſtrumental to change, (Hearts full of the filthieſt luſts, have thereby been transform'd into Veſſels of purity.) And in the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of it's operation (How have Troops of unmaſter'd Luſts fled at the Voice of the Goſpel-Trumpet, like a Flock of frightned Birds, and left their long poſſeſſed Manſion!) and <hi>one part,</hi> one particle of the Word hath wrought wonders many times.— A ſingle ſentence, one plain Scripture has kill'd a Man's Sins, and erected an Heavenly Trophy in a Soul; which ſhews the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious virtue of the Word, acting more vigorouſly than all humane Reaſon in the World. This the experience of every Age can teſtify. Tho' the Word be not a natural Inſtrument to work neceſſarily, yet it is liken'd to natural Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are active under the efficiency of the Agent, which manages them. And an <hi>Activity</hi> ſeems to be aſcrib'd to it by Scripture-<hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors</hi>

A few of which if we now conſider, they will clearly repreſent the effective influence

and active power of the Word to Cleanſe our Way.</p>
            <p>THE Word is compared to <hi>Light</hi>; which is of an undefilable quality in it ſelf, and a purifying influence as to other things: Hence it is call'd the <hi>refining pot of Nature</hi>; The World wou'd be an unwholeſome Peſt-houſe without it. Light and Purity go together. Where the Word truly irradiates the dark mind, it alſo purges the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Conſcience.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It is likened to an <hi>Hammer,</hi> (Jer. 23.29) The Word often breaks in pieces the <hi>hard hearts</hi> of Men, theſe rocks within us; it beats down the neſt of filthy Luſts in the Soul: It drives home convictions, <hi>reproofs, &amp; inſtructions in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and faſtens good impreſſions on the Conſcience, <hi>as Nails in a ſure place.</hi> Hence while <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd his Hearers <hi>were pricked in their hearts,</hi> Act. 2.37.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It is likned unto <hi>Fire</hi>; (Jer. 20.9.— 23.29. Luk. 12.49.)

            <p>AGAIN, To <hi>Milk</hi> (Heb. 5.13. 1 Pet. 2.2.) which has a clarifying, cleanſing property, apply'd out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and a reſtorative, corroborating vertue, taken inwardly: Even ſo <hi>the Commandment of the Lord is pure, the Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the Soul,</hi> (Pſal. 19.7, 8.)</p>

            <p>THE Word is particularly compared to <hi>Rain,</hi> (Deut. 32.2.) <hi>Showers</hi> of Rain ſerve (among other things) to cleanſe our Streets; the ſweeping ſtreams carry off the filth and dirt, that we may walk and keep our feet clean.

Even ſo the <hi>Waters of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> ſometimes come in an impetuous manner, and powerfully bear down our filthy Luſts and cleanſe our ways: and ſometimes the ſmall droppings of the Word gently diſtill, and ſo lay our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which otherwiſe the wind of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wou'd blow up to defile us, and to blind our eyes, and ſtop us in our courſe, or turn us out of the path, and run us upon boggs, and into ſloughs and miles.—It might be further obſerved here, that <hi>Rain</hi>-water is the moſt cleanſing, if we uſe it to waſh our ſelves with; in this the <hi>Word</hi> is like unto it.</p>

efficacy. The Dogmatical, or Doctrinal part of Scripture, or thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> that are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, have a rational tendency, and moral influence to promote our holy living. 'Twas the reproach of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Theology, that on many accounts it was the inſtrument of vice; it aſcribed not only the weak paſſion, but odious vices of Men to the God's, repreſenting <hi>Jupiter</hi> as an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, <hi>Bacchus</hi> as a Drunkard, &amp;c. And many of their ſacred Myſteries, as well as ſolemn Ceremonies, (as one obſerves) <hi>were of ſuch a Nature, that instead of refining and elevating, they rather corrupted and debaſed their Votaries,</hi> and immerſt them in all thoſe abominable pollutions, which ſober Nature abhorr'd, and which render'd 'em more vile than than the filthieſt Brutes. But now the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Truths, and Myſteries in the Word of God, have a proper influence towards the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualizing and purifying of us, and perfecting our Natures. The Apoſtle calls the Doctrine of the Goſpel a <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> (2 Tim. 1.3.) <hi>Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Words,</hi> (1 Tim. 6.3.) i.e. pure and incorrupt in themſelves, &amp; tending to prevent ſpiritual diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or reſtore to the Soul it's ſpiritual health: <hi>and a Doctrine according to Godlineſs,</hi> i.e. tending to the advancement of practical Piety. So the Apoſtle ſtyles it, (Tit. 1.1.) <hi>The Truth which is after Godlineſs,</hi> i. e. productive of Godlineſs. "Luſts grow from Error and Deceit; hence they are call'd <hi>Lusts of Deceit:</hi> and Holineſs grows up from Truth; hence it is call'd, <hi>The Holineſs of Truth.</hi> (Eph. 4.22.4.) This is the triumphal Chariot, wherein Chriſt rides Majeſtically to the conqueſt of Hearts. Pſal. 45.4. <hi>And in thy Majesty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth or</hi> upon thy Truth".

Here we have repreſented to us the dignity of the Divine Image, and our preſent capacity or ſuſceptibleneſs of it, &amp; this tends to fire us with a generous ambition of aſſimilation to God. Here we have an account of the guilt, and filth and miſery of our natural eſtate, and this tends to check the tumor of pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, and to make us low in our own Eyes: Here we are taught the vileneſs, deformity and malignity of Sin, that it is loathſome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to God, and injurious to our own Souls,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002024_0123_0FBA79472CC27730"/>
and this tends to incenſe us againſt Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our penitential ſorrow for it: Here we have the infinite advantages, and ineffable beauties of holineſs diſplayed, and this tends to enamour us with Religion: Here we are told the vanity of the World, which tends to take off our thot's and affections from things below: and here Life and Immortality are brought to Light, and the Glories of the future ſtate emblazoned, which has a happy tendency to make us <hi>ſet our affections on Things above, and labour for the Meat which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth not</hi>; and here the Terrors of Death, and the Horrors of Hell beneath are ſet before us, which tends to quicken us to <hi>flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> and to <hi>lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi> And the great Goſpel-Doctrines, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> that <hi>He gave Himſelf to redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> and <hi>to deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and to bring us into the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Sons of God, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Truths are a means to create in us an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and indignation againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> (which was the meritorious and procuring cauſe of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, and which in the Croſs of Chriſt appears ſo exceeding ſinful, &amp; exceeding hurtful,) and tends to excite our deſires and endeavours to obtain that <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> which is the bleſſed purchaſe of Chriſt's Death, and to get our <hi>Conſciences purged from dead works by his Blood,</hi> and <hi>the Old Man</hi> in us <hi>crucify'd with Him,</hi> and <hi>the Body of Sin deſtroy'd by His Croſs.</hi>—The Myſtery of Chriſt is call'd the Myſtery of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> (1 Tim. 3.16.) partly and principally becauſe it tends to encourage and enforce the practice of Piety. Hence the Apoſtle puts theſe two things

together, <hi>growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, (2 Pet. 3.18.) So (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2, 3.) He ſpeaks of <hi>Grace being multiply'd thro' the knowledge</hi> of God and of Jeſus our Lord, and ſays, that <hi>all things are given to us,</hi> that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to life and godlineſs,</hi> (i.e. that tend to cheriſh the life of Godlineſs, or promote holy Living) <hi>thro' the knowledge of Him that hath called us to Glory and Vertue.</hi> And <hi>in a Word,</hi> there is no Myſtery in Scripture, that is like the <hi>Tree of Knowlege; only pleaſant to the Eye, and a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe</hi>; but every myſtery, if purſued in its juſt and genuine conſequences, is to us as the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> from whence we may gather the fruits of righteouſneſs. There is no Doctrine of natural or revealed Religion ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and ſpeculative, but ſome practical appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be made of it. Some Articles at <hi>first</hi> view indeed ſeem to be altogetheri ſipid &amp; barren, as to Piety and Devotion, and to receive their end in Theory; but "as the Licoriſh ſtick, at firſt, looks like any Weed, but chew it and you ſuck ſweetneſs; ſo thoſe <hi>Mysteries,</hi> that ſeem to be moſt contemplative &amp; remote from practice", have a vein of Piety running thro' 'em and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching them, and a ſacred vertue may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from 'em, to promote vital practical God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, &amp; cheriſh the true ſpirit of Devotion.

There is a viſible ſtamp of Divinity upon them, and a mighty evidence, and force of reaſon &amp; majeſty ſhining in them; There is an unparallel'd ſtrain of Rhetorick in the Word, (<hi>The Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi>) far above the art and inſinuations of the moſt celebrated Orators.

Scripture-Truths come recommended with all the motives of credibility, and adorned with the Authority and majeſty of God, and are wiſely calculated to convey information to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and conviction to the Mind, to awe us into a belief of them, and to make good impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Conſcience, and influence the practic Powers. Hence it is ſaid, (Pſal. 19.7.) <hi>The Doctrine of the Lord is perfect, reſtoring the Soul</hi>; [as the Margin of ſome of your Bibles renders it.]</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Word have a cleanſing efficacy. Conſider here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY <hi>oblige to the moſt exact and exalted purity.</hi> The Word of God gives us a moſt <hi>strict,</hi> as well as <hi>ſure</hi> rule of Life.

The Goſpel ſupplys the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:002024_0126_0FBA7952006FCD18"/>
defects of the Jewiſh Law, and corrects the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Heathen Philoſophy. It forbids all Sin of every denomination &amp; degree; It ſtrictly enjoins univerſal Holineſs, and commands that we labour after the moſt critical &amp; conſummate obedience in all inſtances of duty. 'Tis true indeed, that perſonal complete obedience, <hi>as the Condition of the Covenant, or Term of Salvation,</hi> is not expected nor demanded under the Goſpel, which makes allowance for our infirmities and ſhort-comings; if <hi>that</hi> had remain'd, we muſt have periſh't for ever: But notwithſtanding, the Law, <hi>as a Rule,</hi> obliges without abating at all of it's bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, or contracting it's genuine extent.— There are not in the Word of God any impure indulgences, it gives no countenance to Sin in the leaſt. It prohibits not only <hi>outward</hi> groſs acts of pollution and ſenſuality; but all <hi>inward</hi> irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of thou't, and carnality of affection: It requires the real and internal mortification of every Luſt, every favourite-Luſt, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>The Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119.96. It reaches to the whole Man &amp; to our whole behaviour under all circumſtances: And <hi>the Law is ſpiritual,</hi> (Rom. 7.14.) exceeding ſpiritual, and very pure. It commands us to abandon every evil way, to ſtifle Sin in it's very firſt inviſible conception in the heart, to fly the inſtruments or occaſions of it, to abſtain from all appearances of evil, and approaches to it: In a Word, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looks like Sin, or leads unto it, is to be dreaded and avoided, as interfering with pure Religion: it forbids even a <hi>luſtful tho't,</hi> and a <hi>covetous deſire</hi>; it lays a reſtraint on the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd motions of the Soul, and corrects thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

THE Precepts of the Word carry in them <hi>the moſt Sacred and Sovereign Authority.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> God, ſhines in them with the ſtrongeſt light, which gives them the moſt awing and governing authority over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men, &amp; on this depends their cleanſing efficacy.—Under the notion of <hi>were Rules,</hi> the Precepts of the Word only <hi>direct</hi> us to cleanſe our way; and conſider'd as <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Rules they are apt to <hi>perſwade</hi>: but conſider'd as the <hi>will of God,</hi> our King and Judge, they carry with them a tranſcendent <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> and <hi>conſtrain</hi> us to univerſal Purity.— <hi>Authority</hi> it is, that gives <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> to any Rules or Conſtitutions.

They bear the moſt palpable and indelible impreſſes of a Divine Authority. Here are viſible the bright footſteps of infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs and Goodneſs. The Precepts of the Word are an authentic Copy of the Divine Perfections and an uncounterfeit Inſtrument of God's revealed Will. They bear the royal Stamp, and carry in them ſuch an unconteſtible and irreſiſtible <hi>Authority,</hi> as produces (at leaſt) an <hi>intellectual</hi> veneration and ſubmiſſion in the moſt harden'd Rebels. <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power.</hi> Surely every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of <hi>God,</hi> the King of Kings, muſt come armed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable authority and majeſty: and who is <hi>able to reſiſt the wiſdom and ſpirit of power,</hi> which breaths in His univerſal Law?

It is the chief and ſovereign Law, &amp; it carries a <hi>moſt Kingly Power, Grandour</hi> and <hi>Auguſt Majeſty,</hi> that when it <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> every atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind cannot but hear the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> which ſtrikes with awe &amp; commands reverence. And this is the peculiar advantage of the Divine Law, which gives it ſuperior influence above all other Laws. This <hi>magnifies it, and makes it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,</hi> and powerful. The dread Majeſty of God, ſo conſpicuous in the Divine Precepts, gives them a far more exceeding imperative authority and impreſſive power.</p>
            <p>NOW (to conclude this Head) Do the Precepts of the Word aim at ſuch <hi>high Purity,</hi> and do they carry in them ſuch unconteſtible <hi>Reaſon</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them, &amp; ſuch uncontrollable <hi>Authority</hi> to enforce them: Then they are extremely fitted to make their own way into the hearts of Men; &amp; where they find ſuitable entertainment, will be an efficacious means to cleanſe our way. They are of ſuch a <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>complexion,</hi> and ſo <hi>qualify'd,</hi> as that they are very apt to draw Men's regards, and win us over to the obſervance of them; and <hi>as many as walk according to theſe Rules,</hi> muſt needs <hi>be undefiled in the way, and without rebuke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. THE <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Word have a cleanſing efficacy. The wiſe Legiſlator has ſeen meet to annex a <hi>minatory</hi> Sanction to His Law;
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:002024_0134_0FBA7961AF8B6EB8"/>
to be a Guardian of it's Authority and Honor, to be a <hi>Terror to Evil-Doers,</hi> and a diſſuaſive from <hi>Sin</hi> which is the <hi>Tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> And the Divine Threatnings are every way fitted to ſubſerve the deſigned end.</p>
            <p>THIS I'll endeavour to clear under the following Concluſions. —</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>FEAR is a Paſſion, rooted in the Nature of Man.</hi> An Averſion to Miſery is natural to every one. No Man is <hi>made without fear.</hi> — The Report of the Underſtanding is the Rule of the Will, in all regular motions of the Soul. What that repreſents as evil, and apprehends as future, this abhors and flies from. — Hence, The Threatnings of the Word which are meſſages of Evil to guilty Sinners, are a proper medium to uſe with them to reſtrain them from Sin, inaſmuch as they addreſs one of the Paſſions of humane Nature, and are a juſt Alarm to the Fears of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>FEAR is the moſt powerful Principle of Action.</hi> Hope &amp; Fear are the two great ſprings of motion in humane nature. But <hi>Fear</hi> is the <hi>more violent</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Paſſion, "Uſually the fear of Evil more deeply and ſtrongly affects, than the hope of Good". And Fear is alſo more <hi>eaſily touch't.</hi> It is eaſier of acceſs, as well as more impetuous in exerciſe. It has a <hi>quicker,</hi> as well as <hi>deeper,</hi> reſentment. Fear is a tender, a zealous, and reſtleſs Paſſion. When <hi>ſtruck</hi> with an object, it is more ſpeedy and preſſing in its flight, than Hope, when drawn by an object, is in it's purſuit. "Therefore Laws are ſecur'd by Puniſhments, not by Rewards". Hence the Threatnings of the Word are a moſt ſuitable Argument to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:002024_0135_0FBA7963F5A801F8"/>
on Mankind, in that they are apt to work upon one of the <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt powerful</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Paſſions of Humanity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THE Divine Threatnings are completely fitted to be the moſt forceable excitations to Fear.</hi> They are every way excellently calculated to work <hi>powerfully, moſt</hi> powerfully, on the Fears of Men.</p>
            <p>This will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF we conſider the <hi>Cleanneſs</hi> and <hi>Plainneſs</hi> of them. They are as full and expreſs as poſſible. They are not given in <hi>dark hints:</hi> But are drawn in the <hi>cleareſt Colours.</hi> We have <hi>fair</hi> warning, <hi>ſufficient</hi> notice of our danger, &amp; there is no room left for <hi>Doubts,</hi> that ſhou'd weaken the impreſſion or leſſon the terror of the Threatning. The Law of God <hi>Thunders</hi> out the dire Anathema, that, unleſs we ſtop our Ears, we cannot but <hi>hear the Words of the Curſe</hi>: It <hi>lightens</hi> and <hi>flaſhes</hi> in our face, that unleſs we wilfully ſhut our Eyes, we cannot but ſee our fearful doom. — Now this is a great advantage to the Divine Threatnings. For the motive of Fear is an apparition of ſome Evil. And the clearer the report of danger is, ſo much the higher does our fear riſe in proportion. Hence the Divine Threatnings, ſpeaking ſo <hi>plainly,</hi> do ſpeak the more <hi>ſenſibly,</hi> and the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reach the Fears of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we conſider the <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>inflexible Truth</hi> of them. The Evils, they denounce, are undoubted Realities: and the Comminations themſelves are plainly revealed, and are <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with the ſtrongeſt Motives of Credibility.</hi> They are delivered in the moſt preremptory Terms imaginable, and we've the higheſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their certainty. The <hi>God of Truth (whoſe
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:002024_0136_0FBA7969EEB83098"/>
words endure forever</hi>) has <hi>revealed</hi> them <hi>from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and hath added <hi>an Oath for confirmation,</hi> which <hi>is an end of all ſtrife. Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto</hi> Sinners <hi>the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an Oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have</hi> a <hi>ſtrong</hi> perſwaſion, &amp; that there might be no room to diſpute or queſtion the Execution of His Threatnings. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly are the Divine Menaces introduc'd with the ſolemn Preface—<hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>— and, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord</hi>—? And how awfully do's the Lord <hi>ſwear in His Wrath</hi> againſt the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sinner, where He ſaith, <hi>As I live, ſurely mine Oath, that He hath deſpiſed, even it will I recompence on his own head.</hi>— And this is one great Advantage to the Divine Threatnings, and gives them great power over Men's Fears. For the juſt Object of Fear is <hi>Evil apprehended as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The immediate ground of Fear is the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> of an approaching Evil. 'Tis the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of danger, that moves fear: and the ſtronger the apprehenſion of an Evil is, the ſtronger is the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt it. Hence the Divine Threatnings, giving us ſuch <hi>full aſſurance</hi> and convincing evidence of the real futurity of the unſeen Plagues &amp; Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Wicked, muſt needs have a mighty force, to awaken and actuate the Fears of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF we conſider the ſuperlative <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of them. The Threatned Evils are great, exceeding great, beyond expreſſion, and above all conception. The Threatnings addreſs us with a moſt formidable ſcene of Miſeries, ſuch as <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard of.</hi> Sinners are
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:002024_0137_0FBA796B4AB3F5B0"/>
threaten'd with extreme and everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, —a puniſhment, as intollerable as the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God cou'd <hi>invent</hi>; as ſevere, as the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God cou'd <hi>excite</hi> Him unto; as heavy, as the <hi>Power</hi> of God can <hi>inflict</hi>; and <hi>who knoweth the Power of His Anger? Strong is the Lord that judgeth, mighty in ſtrength, wiſe in heart, and glorious in holineſs.</hi> —The Divine Threatnings denounce <hi>infinite</hi> Evils, the moſt dreadful &amp; devouring, which the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt atlas muſt tremble &amp; ſink under, &amp; the weight whereof the moſt hardy Sinner has not patience nor power to endure.—The Scripture repreſents to us the <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment</hi> under a variety of Names, that ſpeak terror &amp; amazement to every conſidering Soul. It is deſcribed by <hi>Death</hi>; by <hi>Slaughter</hi>; by <hi>Perdition and Deſtruction</hi>; by a <hi>Loſs of the Soul</hi>; by a <hi>Deſtruction of Soul and Body in Hell</hi>; by <hi>Departing from God</hi>; by being <hi>caſt into utter darkneſs</hi>; by <hi>Dwelling with devouring Fire and everlaſting Burnings</hi>; and (which is the Sum of all) by <hi>abiding under the Wrath of God</hi>; and finally (which is the effect of all) by <hi>wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> and <hi>being in torments day &amp; night, for ever and ever.</hi> The threatned Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably exceeds all the terrors of ſenſe. The <hi>Sufferings of the preſent time,</hi> in their full Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and higheſt Degree, <hi>are not worthy to be compared with the</hi> miſery to be inflicted on the Damned. It is <hi>worſe than Death</hi>; it infinitely outweighs the utmoſt evils we can imagine, and infinitely out-reaches our moſt unbounded fears. <hi>Even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.— "One ſpark of God's Wrath firing the Conſcience, is more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, than the moſt fearful Evils in the World",
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002024_0138_0FBA796D050C05D0"/>
to affect, and excite the fears of Men. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The Damnation of Hell</hi> is infinitely terrible. <hi>The Sinners in Zion</hi> may well be <hi>afraid, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſurprize the Hypocrite,</hi> when they think of the <hi>Fire and Brimeſtone, and the horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,</hi> that will be <hi>the Portion of their Cup.</hi>—The expected Evil muſt be look'd upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the degree of Fear is ordinarily correſpondent to the apprehended bigneſs and weight of the object. Therefore the Divine Threatnings which are charg'd with Evils of ſuch an huge bulk and tremendous aſpect, and which make ſo big a Thunder, muſt needs (if they be duly conſider'd and attended to) work moſt prevalently on the paſſion of Fear, &amp; raiſe it to the higheſt pitch. <hi>Deſtruction from God</hi> muſt needs be <hi>a Terror to us. Our fleſh</hi> may well <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for fear of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, THE <hi>imminent danger</hi> Sinners are <hi>daily</hi> in of the <hi>Execution</hi> of the Divine Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings upon them. The wicked &amp; impenitent are every day obnoxious to revenging Juſtice. Black Clouds of Divine Wrath <hi>hover</hi> over <hi>their heads,</hi> and threaten bitter deſolations; and who knows how <hi>ſoon</hi> Almighty Vengeance may like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>ſurprize</hi> careleſs Sinners, <hi>and in a moment utterly conſume them? When they are ſaying, peace and ſafety; then ſudden deſtruction</hi> may <hi>come upon them, and overtake them as a thief,</hi> and they <hi>ſhall not eſcape,</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.3, 4.) God in His long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waits to be gracious; but His patience will ſooner or later have had <hi>its perfect work,</hi> &amp; His
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:002024_0139_0FBA796E8BA31870"/>
Threatnings will ſurely one day have their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete accompliſhment on rebellious Sinners. <hi>The Viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie: tho' it tarry, it will ſurely come, it will not tarry,</hi> (Hab. 2.3.) And, for ought any one knows, the appointed time of <hi>forbearance</hi> may be juſt <hi>expiring</hi>; and the time of <hi>vengeance</hi> may be <hi>haſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> upon him, even the ſad time when Juſtice ſhall triumph in the ſudden execution of the Curſes, written againſt the Ungodly.— Hence, the Divine Threatnings muſt needs deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch the Spirits of every conſidering Sinner. For as the bigger the Evil, the greater the Terror: ſo the <hi>nigher</hi> an Evil approaches, the <hi>higher</hi> our dread riſes in proportion. Apprehended nearneſs gives us a quicker and ſtronger reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of danger. It is then a great advantage to the Divine Threatnings, that the Scripture leaves the particular time of their Execution uncertain, and in general repreſents it as <hi>near at hand, even at the Door.</hi> And it expoſes the mad preſumption of that evil Servant, that ſaith — <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming.</hi> It tells us the fearful danger there is in <hi>putting far from us the evil Day,</hi> and warns us not to flatter our ſelves with the vain hopes of a long indulgence; and <hi>exhorts</hi> us to <hi>flee from the wrath to come,</hi> and <hi>ſo much the more, becauſe the day approacheth.</hi> The Word of God repreſents Sinners, as ſtanding on the very <hi>brink</hi> of miſery, as hanging over the <hi>mouth of the pit,</hi> and being <hi>in danger of Hell-fire.</hi>—And is not this matter of <hi>trembling</hi> conſideration? What <hi>more fearful</hi> Leſſon of horror cou'd be read to ſecure Sinners to awaken them? This redoubles the terror of the Threatning.—We read, that <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:002024_0140_0FBA79700CFD16A8"/>
aſleep in the embraces of his beloved <hi>Delilah,</hi> awoke immediately on that cry,—<hi>The Philiſtines be upon thee, Sampſon.</hi> But that is a more <hi>dreadful ſound, —The Wrath of God is upon thee, Sinner, and the pains of Hell, and the horrors of an Everlaſting Darkneſs, are getting hold upon thee!</hi>—And ſurely if Men are not deaf, they can't ſleep out theſe terrible Claps of Thunder, it muſt needs ſtartle their Conſciences, and <hi>put them in fear,</hi> chill their Luſts, and awaken very careful thot's how they may eſcape the impending Evils. "Do but <hi>believe,</hi> and you muſt <hi>tremble,</hi> were you a Devil". God hangs the Sinner over the flames of Hell, and cauſes the devouring Fire to ſparkle and flaſh in his Eyes; and if this doth not daunt and ſcare him, what can God do more to terrify the audacious Wretch?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider; THE Divine Threatnings <hi>are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Sinners Provocations.</hi> There is an exact harmony or correſpondence between our Guilt and Doom. All the impenitent are under the condemning Sentence of the Law,—a Sentence big with frightful horrors. But ſome do not Sin under ſo eaſy circumſtances as others, their Sins are loaded with peculiar aggravations; as being committed againſt clearer Light, more endearing Love, and ſtronger Bonds, longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in, and oftner repeated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as theſe things and the like, do enhance their Guilt, ſo they do entitle Sinners to a <hi>greater Damnation,</hi> and fill their Sentence with more heavy and ghaſdy woes. By every Sin addition is made to the number of our deſerved ſtripes, &amp; the weight of our future puniſhment. And thus the ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And where will ye leave your glory?</hi>—Thus do's the Lord, who might inſtantly in Juſtice let fly at Sinners, mercifully ſtoop to debate with them, &amp; to argue the caſe with bleeding bowels.

            <p n="4">4ly. <hi>FEAR is a very ſtrong Diſsuaſive from Sin, and the ordinary initial Motive to Religion.</hi> It is the <hi>foundation of Repentance from dead works,</hi> and <hi>of Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Conviction of Guilt, and Fear of the Wrath of God, are the firſt ſteps to Converſion, and the ground-work of Reformation. Sinners generally will not be bro't to Repentance, nor entertain a ſerious tho't of Heaven, till they meet with a rough Sea, and an horrible Tempeſt; 'till they are ſtormed with
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:002024_0143_0FBA7976B751D5B0"/>
black and diſmal terrors, they will never quit the embraces of their beloved Luſts; 'Till tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on the rack of a wounded Conſcience, they will not confeſs &amp; give glory to God; 'Till they are bro't to a ſenſe of their danger &amp; periſhing condition, they will not be perſwaded to repair to the Great Phyſician; 'Till ſtung with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of God, they will not look to the brazen Serpent; they will not fly to the City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, 'till driven by the Avenger of Blood. Sin will not be a burthen, nor Chriſt pretious to them, 'till Deſtruction from God be a terror to 'em. But when the Divine Threatnings ſtrike a dread upon the Conſcience, and awaken an affecting ſenſe of Danger, This tends to produce a flight from the ways of wickedneſs, &amp; a diſpoſition &amp; application unto ſerious Godlineſs. The preſſures of fear are a damp to the pleaſures of Sin, and tend to make the bond of iniquity to be the gall of bitterneſs to us. Prevailing fear tends to embitter Sin and to cool the heat of Luſt, to check the power of corruptions within, and to diſarm, controll and conquer temptations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; For as the Wiſe Man obſerves, (Prov. 1.17.) <hi>Surely in vain is the net ſpread in the ſight of any bird</hi>: perceiving the ſnare, it will fly the bait. And when Men <hi>know</hi> and feel <hi>the terrors of the Lord,</hi> This tends to put them upon <hi>working out their Salvation with fear &amp; trembling.</hi> When they are <hi>afraid of his Judgment,</hi> this incline them to <hi>hearken to reproof,</hi> &amp; and <hi>receive inſtruction,</hi> to <hi>learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>break off from their ſins by repentance.</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tells us, Pro. 166. <hi>By the fear of the Lord, Mende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Evil.</hi> So (Ch. 8.13.) <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.</hi> The Pſalmiſt obſerves, (Pſ. 19.9.) <hi>The fear

the Lord is clean,</hi> (as in it's own nature, ſo) in it's effects. It is preliminary and introductory to pure Religion. It is a ſtrong curb of reſtraint, to keep us back from the ſoul ways of Sin; and a ſharp ſpur of conſtraint, to excite us to obedience, and quicken us in the way of righteouſneſs. Fear will put the Sinner upon Expoſtulating, with tempted <hi>Joſeph, — How can I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi>—and upon enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the trembling <hi>Jaylor,—What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>— It will put the Sinner upon conſidering with the repenting Prodigal,—<hi>How many hired Servants of my Father have bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger:</hi> and upon reſolving with him,—<hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son; make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi>— Repentance ordinarily takes it's <hi>firſt riſe</hi> from a ſenſe of the guilt, miſery and danger of a natural ſtate. Legal Terrors <hi>open the ear to</hi> the Spirit's <hi>diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>prepare the way of the Lord.</hi> When a Man ſees <hi>Evil purſuing</hi> him, and his <hi>heart meditates terror,</hi> how willing will he be to hearken to any probable Methods of <hi>Eſcape,</hi> and how welcome the views of ſome ſure <hi>Sanctuary</hi> at hand, to retreat unto? So, the Sinner, when <hi>warned of God, and mov'd with fear</hi> at the dreadful reports of Wrath in the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, how does this diſpoſe him to entertain the bleſſed reports of Mercy, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the offers of Life in the Promiſes of the Goſpel? The Terrors of Everlaſting Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to receive the <hi>glad Tidings of Salvation</hi> by Chriſt, and to <hi>fly for refuge to lay hold on the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:002024_0145_0FBA797FE9FC7D48"/>
hope ſet before him.</hi>
               <q>The fear of Hell at firſt diſpoſes us for the love of Heaven: to eſcape the one, we fly to the other. Were it not for the Torments of Hell,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> Fol. pag. 227.</note> (which are more eaſily conceiv'd by us, whilſt we are cloathed with Fleſh, than Coeleſtial Joys, and therefore more ſtrongly affect us) Heaven wou'd be neglected, and be as empty of Saints, as 'tis full of Glory. To awaken us out of the deep lethargy of ſenſual Luſts, (the moſt pleaſant muſick is ineffectual,) nothing leſs is requiſite than cutting &amp; ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</q>.
Sinners will "break thro' the hedge of the Law, unleſs they feel thoſe wounding Thorns, the fearful Threatnings in it". The fear of God is <hi>the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> piece of the <hi>Armour of Light,</hi> the <hi>commencing eſſay</hi> of repentance, and <hi>initiative</hi> to holineſs of Life. The <hi>Spirit of bondage to fear,</hi> which comes in by the application of the Threatnings, prepares the way for the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> which comes in by the application of the Promiſes. <hi>The Law is a Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt,</hi> (Gal. 3.24.) And when Legal Terrors are ballanc'd &amp; brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd with Evangelical Hopes, we ſhall riſe to a bleſſed perfection in holineſs. <hi>Fear alone</hi> is not of ſufficient efficacy to cleanſe our way: Hence God hath added many gracious <hi>Promiſes</hi> in His Word, to work upon us by the principle of <hi>Hope.</hi> Which leads me to another Head.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Word have a cleanſing efficacy. It has pleaſed the Great Lawgiver to annex (not only a minatory, but alſo) a <hi>Promiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to His Law, which is every way fitted to draw forth our Hope, to endear and ſacilitate our
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:002024_0146_0FBA7982C94B45C0"/>
duty, and excite to obedience. The great deſign and manifeſt tendency of the Divine Promiſes is to allure and engage us to cleanſe our way. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, (2 Pet. 1, 4.) That they <hi>are given to us, that by theſe we might be partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> i. e. transform'd into the image of Divine purity. And another Apoſtle uſes them as an argument or incentive unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, (Rom. 12.1, 2.) <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your ſelves a living ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, holy, acceptable unto God; and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your mind.</hi> So likewiſe (2 Cor. 7.1.) <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit.</hi> q. d. Having ſuch <hi>a price in our hands to get wiſdom, the wiſdom that is pure,</hi> having ſuch a bleſſed motive and means to animate and aſſiſt, induce and enable us to cleanſe our ways, as the Promiſes. Let us improve our happy advantage. — Theſe Scriptures plainly ſhow, that the <hi>end &amp; office, &amp; proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Divine Promiſes is to make us pure and holy.</hi>—And this is the Point, which I am now to <hi>illustrate.</hi> And here a very large Field of Diſcourſe opens before us: But I ſhall content my ſelf with theſe following Hints.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THE Promiſes have a purifying influence upon us, <hi>from the kind &amp; quality of the ſubject-matter, or Things offered in them.</hi> The Goods contained in the Promiſes are—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>INFALLIBLY Real.</hi> They are not ſome illuſory and imaginary Things, the <hi>ſhadows of a Dream,</hi> and the wild viſions of luxuriant fancy that have no Being like <hi>the lying Vanities</hi> (which our <hi>deceitful Luſts</hi> do often promiſe us: but they
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:002024_0147_0FBA7984D641F7B0"/>
are ſubſtantial realities, <hi>bro't to light by the Goſpel</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, who as He purchas'd them by His Death, ſo <hi>he has given aſſurance to all Men</hi> of the certainty and truth of them <hi>by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead.</hi> Now this thought lays a ſure <hi>foundation</hi> for Deſire and Hope; &amp; obliges us to cleanſe our ways from a principle of ſelf-love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ABSOLUTELY <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> The Contents of the Divine Promiſes are not indifferent and inſignificant matters, of little or no concern to us, which we may be without or enjoy, and our caſe be much the ſame: No; but they are of infinite weight and indiſpenſable neceſſity, the true foundation of humane felicity, <hi>the One Thing needful,</hi> upon which our <hi>All</hi> depends; To miſs of which is utter ruin, but the enjoyment is our making for ever.—Now this Conſideration has a mighty tendency to kindle deſires, &amp; awaken endeavours to ſecure an intereſt in the bleſſed Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SUPERLATIVELY <hi>Excellent.</hi> Hence the Promiſes are call'd <hi>exceeding great and pretious Promiſes.</hi> (2 Cor. 7.1.) The Bleſſings, treaſur'd up in them, are the moſt ſublime and valuable; <hi>Better than Thouſands of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; more ſweet alſo than honey, and the honey-comb:</hi> unſpeakably preferrible to the whole confluence of earthly Beatitudes; every way proportionable to our various neceſſities, equal to our cravings, and adaequate to our capacities, enough to ſatisfy our deſires, ſatiate our hopes, and complete our happineſs. Hence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are ſuited to attract our affection &amp; tempt our ambition.—In every Man there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:002024_0148_0FBA7985B329A030"/>
thirſt after felicity, altho' we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue various objects according to our different reſentments of happineſs; and when the object is conſider'd as attainable, this begets hope, and hope produces endeavour. Hope is an operative and induſtrious Principle; 'tis the grand incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and inſtrument of active diligence; and it draws forth the practic Powers and invigorates our endeavours in <hi>proportion</hi> to the apprehended <hi>worth</hi> and importance of the deſir'd Good. The greater and more excellent the object hoped for, the ſtronger influence will the hope of it have upon us, and the more powerfully will it wing and animate our endeavours, and draw us to uſe the means of obtaining it.— Now the Divine Promiſes engage the higheſt ſatisfactions, and propound the moſt deſireable objects of Hope: and hence they muſt needs (if duly realiz'd and conſider'd) have a very attractive influence on Men; for they addreſs in the moſt <hi>powerful</hi> manner to the fundamental principle of ſelf-love, which breeds inſatiable <hi>Deſires</hi> to promote our own happineſs, and to the praedominant paſſion of Hope, which produces indefatigable <hi>Induſtry</hi> in the purſuit thereof. And thoſe muſt be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men,</hi> and diveſted of humanity, whom a belief of the Promiſes of God hath no influence upon, to induce 'em to ſerious Religion, which entitles to the higheſt happineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>SPIRITUAL and Rational.</hi> The Goods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Promiſes <hi>are not carnal but ſpiritual</hi>; They are not the ſordid traſh of this vain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing World, viſible, material and ſenſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, <hi>Proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> only ſuited to pamper the <hi>Body:</hi> But they are ghoſtly, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:002024_0149_0FBA7987AFCA0628"/>
ſupernatural, Angelical felicities. They are <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Things,</hi> (Eph. 1.3.) Manna from Heaven, fitted to refreſh and raviſh, to feaſt and ſolace the <hi>Soul,</hi> the great Soul of Man.— Indeed the <hi>Body</hi> is not utterly overlook'd. The Promiſes ſecure <hi>external Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi> to the Godly in ordinary caſes. <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath the promiſe of the Life that now is,</hi> (1 Tim. 4.8.) So we read, (Mat. 6.33.) <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added to you.</hi> What Things? We are told in the foregoing verſe; <hi>All theſe Things</hi> which <hi>your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of.</hi> Bread to eat and Raiment to put on.— But this proviſion for the Body is made with a remote view to the <hi>Soul,</hi> to eaſe and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date that. And the <hi>Capital</hi> Promiſes relate <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> to the <hi>Soul:</hi> Theſe are ſpiritual, in that the Goods they tender are of a ſpiritual nature, and the Recipient is the Spirit of Man.</p>
            <p>NOW this <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the Promiſes doth tend by a ſort of natural efficacy to diſpoſe and engage Men to <hi>walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle obſerves, (1 Joh. 3.3.) <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> If a Man have a firm belief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, a realizing view of the ſpirituality of the Goods promiſed, and any hope to obtain them, he muſt needs be concerned to get his vitiated appetite purged and his carnal mind ſpiritualiz'd, that he may be a meet ſubject of theſe refin'd and immaculate fruitions.</p>
            <p>THUS I've argued from the Nature &amp; Quality of the Promiſes <hi>in general.</hi> I might now illuſtrate the Truth before us by an induction of <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>; And ſay,—</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:002024_0150_0FBA7988B1278EA0"/>1. THE Promiſe of <hi>Pardon</hi> does manifeſtly and mightlly tend to animate and excite us to cleanſe our ways. By this Promiſe the great impediments &amp; diſcouragements to Repentance are removed. Hereby our <hi>Unbelief is helped,</hi> and ſuſpicious diffidence concerning God's reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to Sinners ſuperſeded. The <hi>uncovenanted Goodneſs</hi> of God wou'd have been but a very uncertain foundation of Hope, and a very weak inducement to Repentance. But now the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Pardon is a firm ground of Hope, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging motive to Repentance. And ſuch a Promiſe the Word of God ſets before us. The Goſpel <hi>ſets forth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for Sin, and Preaches remiſſion of Sins thro' his Blood</hi>; and it proclames the Name of God, <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſlow to anger, ready to forgive</hi>; and abounds with Promiſes of Pardon. Hence, the Goſpel is call'd the <hi>Goſpel of Peace, the Word of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> &amp;c.— Now by the Promiſe of Pardon, Sinners have their doubts reſolved &amp; their fears relieved touching the Divine Mercy: And this greatly tends
<q>to overcome our guilty diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God. For while terrible apprehenſions of the Deity poſſeſs the heart, 'tis frozen with a ſtony rigor, which the hope of Mercy only can diſſolve</q>.
Deſpair chills and cools all eſſays to repent, and hardens Men in the love and practice of Sin. A hopeleſs mind and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temper are common Companions. Faith and Hope are the root and principle of Repentance and Obedience. The proſpect of recovering the loſt favour of God ſtrongly invites Sinners to cleanſe their ways. — Beſides the Promiſe of
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:002024_0151_0FBA798B11EEAED8"/>
Pardon is ſuch an endearing expreſſion of God's Love and Good-will unto ſelf-ruin'd Man, as moſt powerfully <hi>leadeth to Repentance:</hi> This is a mighty diſſuaſive from Sin, and a forceable perſwaſive unto Duty. A believing view of the free Grace and rich mercy of God in the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, tends to beget in us kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentings and remorſe for Sin, to warm &amp; ſoften our hearts, and diſſolve them into a current of penitential tears and religious affections.— To conſider how we have forfeited the favour of God; To conſider, that we may now obtain a Pardon, that the moſt heinous Sins, and the chief of Sinners may obtain mercy of the Lord; To conſider, that God offers freely and irreverſibly to beſtow pardoning mercy on us, <hi>on us,</hi> who indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably need it, and are infinitely unworthy of it,—ſurely, if there be any principle of Honor, any ſpark of ingenuity, or gratitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in us, we muſt be <hi>drawn by theſe hands of Love</hi> and perſwaded <hi>by the Mercies of God to preſent our Bodies a living ſacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What can be more welcome to a condemned Criminal than a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? God offers this to an obnoxious World. Surely theſe glad Tidings of great joy ſhou'd not only check our deſponding fears, but melt our congeal'd affections, excite in us Repentance towards God, raviſh our love, and inſpire our Souls with flaming deſires, and firm reſolutions, in all things to obey and pleaſe a God, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Goodneſs and plenteous in Mercy. And ſurely if the conſideration of the Promiſe of Pardoning Mercy has not this effect upon us, we muſt be baſe and ungrateful to the laſt degree,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:002024_0152_0FBA798C8AAA2210"/>
and have hearts more inſenſible than the Rocks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Promiſe <hi>of the Holy Spirit</hi> is another very engaging motive to cleanſe our ways. The Word of God promiſes us the Spirit of Grace to be our Teacher, Guide, Sanctifier and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. And what good News muſt this needs be to a loſt and diſconſolate, periſhing World, a World that lyes in wickedneſs, and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! What a ſuitable and needful Bleſſing is the Spirit of God? <hi>Thro' the ſupply of the Spirit,</hi> we who are naturally <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> ſhall be enabled to <hi>perfect holineſs,</hi> and <hi>to work out our Salvation.</hi> But without the Divine Spirit we muſt have languiſht in fruitleſs attempts, and <hi>periſht</hi> for ever <hi>in our corruption.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is able to revive and recover us out of our natural ſtate of carnality. The moſt happy conſtitution of Body and the moſt excellent natural temper of mind, with the moſt perfect rules of living, the higheſt motives and the beſt patterns are not ſufficient Reſtoratives. There is no principle of recovery in our degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Nature, and as well may a dead Carcaſe revive and act of it ſelf, or the lifeleſs Clay form it ſelf into a Veſſel of Honor, as Apoſtate Man by his own ſingle efforts, or with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal confederacy of Creature aids, ſanctify himſelf and perform <hi>obedience unto righteouſneſs.</hi> If we have not ſome ſuperior Power to <hi>help our infirmities,</hi> we muſt for ever deſpair of <hi>poſſeſſing our Veſſel in ſanctification and honor.</hi>— Now the Promiſe of God offers the Holy Spirit, whoſe <hi>Grace is ſufficient for us,</hi> a perfect Salve for our impotence. So that the conſideration of our own inability, or of the powerful oppoſition of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:002024_0153_0FBA798EFB48F8B0"/>
our conſpiring Adverſaries, need not damp nor diſcourage our endeavours to <hi>do the will of God,</hi> and to <hi>make our calling and election ſure.</hi> The Spirit, who is promis'd us, is a <hi>Spirit of might and power,</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and of <hi>Grace</hi>; every way more able and willing to help us, than our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to hinder us.—Now to conſider, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupernatural influences we muſt neceſſarily and unavoidably periſh; To conſider, that the Divine Spirit is offer'd to us, and that by His effectual energy we ſhall be <hi>able to do all things,</hi> ſhall be fortify'd againſt all Difficulties, and furniſht unto all Duties; and <hi>by the power of His might</hi> we ſhall be enabled to <hi>purify our Souls in obeying the Truth</hi> unto the end.— What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive conſiderations are theſe? What powerful incentives to <hi>provoke us to Good Works?</hi> What can tend more to elevate our drooping ſpirits, to enliven and actuate our diligence, and make us to excite and exert our ſelves (with a due dependence on the Holy Spirit) in the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Luſts, &amp; the purification of our Lives?</p>
            <p n="3">3 THE Promiſe of <hi>Heaven</hi> is likewiſe a powerful motive to cleanſe our way. <hi>This is the Promiſe, which God hath promiſed us, even Eternal Life</hi> (1 Joh. 2.25.) an happineſs becoming His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſufficiency to confer, and us to ſeek after: a pure and perfect Bleſſedneſs. "So glorious and attractive (<hi>ſays One</hi>) that if duly conſider'd, no Man can poſſibly refuſe it". — This Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>Great,</hi> Unſearchably Great. None can comprehend the juſt <hi>meaſure,</hi> the exact <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>weight</hi> of the Treaſures and Glories of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They <hi>paſs underſtanding.</hi> And this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tends to daſh all enticements to Sin, and to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:002024_0154_0FBA799088D19568"/>
animate us (againſt all intervening difficulties) in the purſuit of this glorious Prize.— And it is <hi>Holy,</hi> as well as Great: Pure and Spiritual. It is what <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit.</hi> Our Bodies muſt be ſpiritualiz'd and our Souls pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd, in order to a capacity for and enjoyment of it. Now what a ſovereign attractive muſt this conſideration be unto holineſs? And how will the ſerious contemplation of Heaven by a kind of natural influence ſpiritualize our tho'ts and purify our affections? They, that have a belief and hope of Heaven, will deſire to <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate</hi> their expected Bleſſedneſs; and therefore will the often <hi>looking at the things that are unſeen and eternal:</hi> and by thus <hi>having their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Holy</hi> Heaven, by thus <hi>beholding the Glory of the Lord,</hi> they will be gradually <hi>changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we ſee in ſome meaſure, how the <hi>Promiſes</hi> have a cleanſing efficacy in reſpect of the <hi>Subject-matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THE Promiſes have a cleanſing efficacy <hi>from the Tenor and Manner of their Conſtitution and Propoſal.</hi> Here it may ſuffice to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY are <hi>Deliver'd in the fulleſt and cleareſt Terms.</hi> "They are not wrapt up in Clouds and dark <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> Inſinuations, wherein Men muſt exerciſe their <hi>Sagacity</hi> as well as their Faith". But they ſhine out with the cleareſt Light, and we all <hi>with open face behold</hi> in them, <hi>as in a Glaſs, the great Things, which God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> Here the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of pure Religion lye fair &amp; open to proſpect. The Meſſages of Peace are moſt plain, expreſs and explicit, &amp; give us a true conception &amp; full convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:002024_0155_0FBA7994E27BFCD8"/>
of thoſe glorious unſeen Realities, of which ſuch as enjoy not Goſpel-revelation can have but very looſe &amp; obſcure apprehenſions. And this gives the Promiſes of the Word an attractive influence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY are <hi>Confirmed with the moſt inviolable Securities.</hi> If the Promiſes were doubtful or uncertain, the encouragement to ſeek an intereſt in them wou'd be but weak and faint: But they are ſtable as the Ordinances of Heaven. They are ratify'd with the ſtrongeſt aſſurances. They are <hi>ſure Words of Prophecy,</hi> moſt evident and certain, <hi>proceeding out of the mouth of God, the God of Truth,</hi> and ſealed by an <hi>Oath, to ſhew the immutability of his counſel,</hi> (Heb. 6.17.) Now this is an excellent character that muſt needs greatly recommend them to us, and <hi>beget us to a lively hope. This World's Goods</hi> are <hi>uncertain Riches:</hi> But the Bleſſings offered in the Promiſes are <hi>ſure Mercies.</hi> And what more proſſing incentive to Religion, than this? It is the Apoſtle's choſen Argument, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.)

            <p n="3">3. THEY are <hi>altogether free, gracious and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous.</hi> They are the pure reſult of free Grace and ſovereign Mercy. As to the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contained in the Promiſes, it is owing to the rich Love and mere Mercy of God, that they are obtainable. The Redemption by Chriſt was the production of free Good-will, and moſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſelf-moving Grace.

Nay, He might without any impeachment of His Juſtice have cauſed His fury to reſt upon the whole race of ſinful Man, and have puniſh'd as with ſwift deſtruction, and that without remedy, as He did the whole Crew of Apoſtate Angels, who immediately on their revolt were clapt in Chains, and are reſerv'd as Priſoners of Juſtice unto the day of Perdition. Nay, the Righteouſneſs &amp; Holineſs of God <hi>demanded</hi> this, and <hi>call'd for Vengeance</hi> to conſume us utterly: But <hi>Mercy rejoyced over Judgment,</hi> and triumph'd over our Unworthineſs, and provided <hi>a Saviour</hi> for us; <hi>in and thro' whom God is reconciling the World unto Himſelf,</hi> and magnifying His Mercy towards Penitent Sinners, without any detriment to His Juſtice, or defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Purity. Here is Love, unmerited, unasked, unforced; Love without Example and beyond Expreſſion! Love which we are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to conceive of, as we were unworthy to be the objects of! And ſurely this Love of God (if duly conſider'd) muſt <hi>conſtrain us,</hi> muſt ſtrongly and ſweetly draw our hearts, &amp; warm our cold affections, and kindle in our Souls a flaming Love; Love ſincere and pure, which will be in us a perpetual ſpring of obedience, and a living principle of undefiled Religion. But, as the Love of God, His great and free Love, is ſeen in the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> procured for us and offered to us: So it is ſeen alſo in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is a further inſtance of His Free Grace, that He ſhou'd <hi>make Promiſe</hi> of the Bleſſings unto us, That He ſhou'd not only invite us, but indent with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>make an everlaſting Covenant in all things well ordered and ſure</hi>; Here is free

What an obliging and endearing method of Grace is this! And how does the conſideration of God's free and generous Goodneſs in His Promiſes tend to conquer the Sinners obſtinacy, and melt him into grateful Reſentments, and work up his heart to a kindly Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

We muſt uſe well the advantages we at preſent enjoy, as ever we expect to have more and better given us. For ſo runs the Promiſe, (Luk. 19.26.) <hi>Unto every one which hath</hi> (improved what He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received,) <hi>ſhall be given</hi> (increaſe of Grace:) <hi>and from him that hath</hi> (i. e. improveth) <hi>not, even that be hath ſhall be taken from him.</hi>—Laſtly, As to the Promiſe of <hi>Heaven</hi> and Eternal Life; How plainly and peremptorily are we told, that <hi>Except a Man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and that only the <hi>pure in heart ſhall ſee God?</hi> It is not more certain that Chriſt is the only Saviour, than that He is the <hi>Author of Salvation to</hi> none but <hi>them that obey Him.</hi> Theſe Conſiderations are of excellent efficacy to daſh the vain preſumption of careleſs Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, to arm and antidote us againſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to reſtrain from Sin and quicken unto Duty.
<q>The Conditionality of the Promiſes is a circumſtance, which gives life to all the reſt, and makes them operative towards the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a good Life. It is a great advantage to the Promiſes, that God has linkt our <hi>hopes</hi> and our <hi>duty</hi> together. And indeed when we conſider the infinite diſproportion between the <hi>Reward</hi> and our <hi>Service</hi>; we muſt reſolve, that he had no other deſign in making His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes Conditional, than to engage us by our <hi>Intereſt</hi> to that holineſs unto which he ſaw our <hi>Inclinations</hi> did not bind us; that it was

Thus, (Iſa. 55.1, 2, &amp;c.) <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, Come ye to the waters, and be that hath no money: Come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfyeth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf in fatneſs. Incline your ear and come unto me; hear and your Soul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> So, (Iſai. 1.18, 9.) <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, tho' your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow,— If ye be willing and obedient.</hi>— So alſo, (Prov. 1.22, 3.) <hi>How long will fools hate knowlege?

               <note place="margin">This Subject is fully handled by a Worthy Writer, in a Treatiſe Entituled, <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Holy Scriptures.</hi> Chap. 2. To which I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader.</note> and for <hi>particular</hi> Saints in times of danger or diſtreſs.— The Narratives of thoſe, and other things, which the Scriptures preſent us with, are very inſtructive and a moſt profitable improvement may be made of them. They have a very propitious aſpect upon holy Living. They were written for our ſpiritual profit, &amp; are <hi>good to the uſe of edifying, to miniſter Grace</hi> unto us. Thus the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, (Rom. 15.4.) <hi>Whatſoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were written for our Learning.</hi> So, (1 Cor. 10.11.) <hi>All theſe things happen'd unto them for Enſamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> And agreably we are told, (2 Pet. 2.6. &amp; Jude ver. 7.) That the Judgments executed on the wicked Sodomites <hi>are ſet forth for an example unto thoſe that ſhould after live ungodly.</hi> And on the other hand, the Apoſtle Paul tells us, (1 Tim. 1.16.) <hi>For this end I obtained mercy, that in me, the firſt</hi> or <hi>chief</hi> Sinner, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew ſorth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter believe on Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. THE <hi>Examples</hi> of pure Religion, upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-record have a cleanſing efficacy. Example is the moſt powerful attractive to Practice. It affords ſuperior Light to direct, and carries in it a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charm to perſwade. Good Examples teach us our Duty with a much fuller emphaſis, than bare Precepts. Example is moſt compendious, moſt pleaſant &amp; efficacious method of inſtruction. It is moſt informing and affecting. It ſpeaks moſt
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:002024_0163_0FBA79B26AD020F8"/>
convincingly and ſtrikes us moſt ſenſibly. The holy Lives of the Saints are a ſilent and moſt effectual reproof of Sinners, and greatly tend to cover them with ſhame. And they are a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incentive to the Penitent; they tend to cheriſh their hopes, by repreſenting their Duty as practicable, &amp; they tend alſo to tempt their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, &amp; provoke them to a laudable Emulation.</p>
            <p>NOW the Word of God furniſhes us with the beſt and brighteſt Patterns of Holineſs. There is the grand Example of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is eminently recommended to our regards. This is a moſt <hi>perfect, full,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> Example, affording complete, univerſal and unerring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.—And it is alſo moſt <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,</hi> excellently accommodated to our preſent imperfect ſtate, and to the different circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and capacities of Men, <hi>making our way ſtraight before our face, and leading us in a plain path.</hi>— And it is cloathed with ſuch reſpects, as can't but powerfully perſwade us to imitation. 'Tis the Precedent of Him, who is our <hi>Sovereign</hi>; and carries a binding force with it, &amp; challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges our conformity thereunto as matter of <hi>Duty.</hi> Again, It is the Preſident of One, who is the <hi>Chief among Ten Thouſand</hi>; and invites us to ſtudy a reſemblance from the motive of <hi>Honour.</hi> And moreover, 'Tis the Example of Him, who is our compaſſionate <hi>Saviour, who ſubſiſting in the former nature of God, thought it not uſurpation to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant; and being found in faſhion as a Man, He humbled Himſelf and became obedient unto Death</hi>; &amp; this to <hi>purchaſe</hi> Heaven and Happineſs for us, (Sinners
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:002024_0164_0FBA79B3A43E2320"/>
and Enemies againſt Him,) and to <hi>leave us an Example,</hi> to lead us in the way thereunto. Now what an endearing and unparallel'd inſtance of Condeſcenſion, Kindneſs and Mercy is here? And how ſhou'd we be induced from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous principles of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps, and imitate the virtues of our deareſt Friend, and moſt generous Benefactor.</p>
            <p>BUT further, beſides the perfect Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we have the Examples of the <hi>Saints</hi>; which tho' imperfect, yet are not ſuperſeded by the former: But alſo have their ſingular uſe in the Chriſtian Life, even as the Stars are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>profitable to direct</hi> as well as the Sun. Hence we are call'd upon, not only to <hi>look unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> and to <hi>conſider Him:</hi> but alſo to be <hi>Followers of them who thro' faith and patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> And indeed, tho' the Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of it's perfect <hi>purity</hi> is more ſure to direct us: yet on ſome accounts the Examples of the <hi>Saints</hi> (they being <hi>Men of like paſſions with us,</hi> of like moral infirmities, and not only <hi>in all points tempted like as we are,</hi> even as Chriſt was, but alſo, as <hi>He</hi> was not, ſometimes overcome by the power of Temptations and <hi>overtaken with faults,</hi>) may ſeem more ſuited to encourage us. They ſeem to come nearer, and to be more equal and level to us. And for this reaſon, The Lives of many Holy Men are written and regiſtred in the ſacred Pages; And we are bidden to <hi>follow them as they followed Chriſt</hi>; to obſerve their Vertues and take Example by them, as well as to obſerve their Falls and take warning from them.</p>
            <p>SO that, (we ſee) if there be any force in
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:002024_0165_0FBA79B5099093F0"/>
Example to tempt and allure us unto holy Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Word of God muſt needs have a very powerful influence upon us.</p>
            <p>THUS I've (in ſome meaſure) made it appear, that the Word of God <hi>in it's own nature as a Means,</hi> is excellently fitted and greatly tends to purify our way: and have conſider'd the whole Frame of the Word, and ſhewn how all the parts of it do admirably conſpire and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize in promoting our Sanctification.— <hi>Which was the Second Thing.</hi> Paſs we now to the Laſt Particular, which is—</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>THE Word is the choſen Inſtrument of the Holy Spirit, and is ordinarily accompany'd with His Influence.</hi> The Word has a perfect natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity and aptitude, &amp; an inſtrumental cauſality, to cleanſe and ſanctify us. It has ſo much and no more <hi>in it ſelf.</hi> But <hi>over</hi> and <hi>above</hi> what virtue the Word carries in it's own nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly conſider'd, there is an additional co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating influence of the Divine Spirit. Indeed what Help we have by the Word itſelf is <hi>the fruit of the Spirit</hi>; but <hi>this</hi> is not <hi>the whole</hi> of the Spirit's influence in the work of Sanctification. Beſides this, There is an internal agency of the Holy Spirit upon the Heart, a ſecret Divine Power, which accompanying the Word, gives life and efficacy thereunto.</p>
            <p>THERE is a <hi>Common Grace,</hi> or general aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit, always attending the Word, and diſpenſed to all, tho' not in an equal degree, and proportion, which has a tendency to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and is ſufficient to take off the idle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>ſpiritual impotence,</hi> and renders all thoſe
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:002024_0166_0FBA79B6DE790E50"/>
inexcuſable, that under the Goſpel remain carnal and diſobedient. Hence ſuch are ſaid to <hi>receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> and <hi>to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND there is a more <hi>Special Grace,</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Aſſiſtence, accompanying the Word unto the Souls of ſome, <hi>which worketh effectually in them,</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>ordinarily</hi> ſuch as have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved former and leſſer Aſſiſtences. Thoſe who are humbly and diligently uſing the Means, praying for the Spirit, concurring with His holy Motions, and abandoning their evil ways, it is the uſual method of the Spirit, to derive unto them higher and more peculiar Aſſiſtences, to <hi>create in them a clean heart,</hi> and <hi>make them Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> to <hi>make them perfect in every good work, to do the will of God, working in them that which is well pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> This is the ſtanding method of the Spirit's proceeding with thoſe, who enjoy the Means of Grace, from which He doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily vary. Indeed "the Apoſtle Paul, before his Converſion, was ſo far from being under any preparatory diſpoſition, that he was employing his ſtrength to deſtroy the Faith of Chriſt, at that time, when he was effectually call'd by him". But this is an <hi>extraordinarry</hi> inſtance, to ſhew the ſovereignty and power of Divine Grace. And they that take encouragement from it to neglect and ſlight the uſe of Means, under a ſhew of waiting for the Spirit, and do <hi>magnify</hi> this, and <hi>nullify</hi> that, are Men of ſtrange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and do caſt a foul indignity on the wiſe appointments of Heaven, and offer violence to the eſtabliſht method of Grace.—The Word and Spirit (in ordinary caſes) have a concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:002024_0167_0FBA79BD3383B6B0"/>
tho' not equal, Agency in our Converſion and Sanctification; The Spirit as the Efficient, the Word as the Inſtrument. The Spirit ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily works <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> the Word. Hence, we find <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth</hi> put together, (2 Theſ. 2.13.) Hence, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is call'd, <hi>The Miniſtration of the Spirit, The Sword of the Spirit, The Law of the Spirit of Life, The Power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Hence, when the Goſpel comes <hi>in power,</hi> it is ſaid to come <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (1 Theſ. 1.5.) Hence, The Saints are ſaid to <hi>purify their Souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit,</hi> (1 Pet. 1.22.) and to be <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by the miniſters of Chriſt, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God</hi>; and <hi>beholding</hi> in the Word <hi>as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, to be changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> (1 Cor. 3.3, 18.) Hence, The Apoſtle makes that appeal to the Galatians, <hi>Received ye the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> by the works of the Law, or <hi>by the hearing of Faith?</hi> (Gal. 3.2.)—Theſe Scriptures make it ſufficiently evident, that the Word is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſtrument of the ſanctifying Spirit, and accompany'd with His ſacred Preſence. It is the Chariot in which He rides forth conquering and to conquer; The Wings, by which He deſcends into the Soul; the Channel in which He conveys the waters of Purification. And we have a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21.) that the Word and Spirit ſhall always be concomitant.</p>
            <p>THUS I've ſomewhat largely Diſcours'd on the <hi>Firſt Article</hi> propos'd to conſideration, which was, that <hi>The Word of God has a cleanſing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> I proceed now to ſay ſomething very briefly to—</p>

               <pb n="161" facs="unknown:002024_0168_0FBA79C658CAAA18"/>Artic. II. Which is this; namely, <hi>IF we take heed to the Word of God, we ſhall experience it's cleanſing efficacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE I might premiſe; That, If ever we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Word of God ſhou'd cleanſe us, we muſt neceſſarily <hi>take heed</hi> unto it. The Word indeed is a means of Sanctification, &amp; a moſt fit &amp; powerful means; but we can never reap any ſaving benefit from it, without a due regard to it, &amp; improvement of it. Therefore the Young Man in order to <hi>cleanſe his way,</hi> is directed in our Text, to <hi>take heed</hi> to the Word of God. We muſt <hi>obſerve</hi> it <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> as the Original imports. We muſt carefully <hi>mark it, and ſet our heart to it.</hi> We muſt <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> for knowlege, as for <hi>precious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and muſt <hi>hide it in our hearts,</hi> and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as a Treaſure. We muſt <hi>incline our ear to wiſdom and apply our heart to underſtanding.</hi> We muſt <hi>meditate in the Law of God day and night,</hi> and <hi>have reſpect to all his ways.</hi> We muſt receive and reverence the Word, <hi>as the Word of God:</hi> We muſt acknowledge it's authority, yield our ſelves up to the power, and acquaint our ſelves with the contents of it. We muſt be much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the <hi>Word Written,</hi> and frequent in attending on the <hi>Word Preacht:</hi> We muſt <hi>take heed</hi> alſo <hi>how we hear</hi> and how we read.</p>
            <p>WE muſt take heed to the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Word, as the Standard of our Faith, and <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words, in ſaith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> So likewiſe we muſt take heed to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Word, as the Directory of our practice, and obſerve them as Sailors do the Compaſs whereby they ſteer; We muſt inform our ſelves of the Rule, and conform our ſelves
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:002024_0169_0FBA79C8C52FD5C8"/>
unto it. Again, We muſt take heed to the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> to learn our danger and quicken us to avoid it, as the Traveller is circumſpect and careful to ſpy and ſhun Praecipes, Sloughs and By-paths. Again, We muſt take heed to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> to learn our happineſs, and animate us to purſue it, as the Racer locks to the Prize that is ſet before him: And further, we muſt take heed to the <hi>Examples</hi> in the Word to imitate them, as a <hi>Painter</hi> looks on the Object, as the Writer obſerves his Copy, or the Workman his Pattern. <hi>In ſhort,</hi> We muſt take heed to the <hi>whole</hi> Word of God. We muſt <hi>ſet our hearts to all things whatſoever it teſtifies unto us,</hi> (Deut. 32.46.)</p>
            <p>WE muſt take heed to the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> of the holy Word, keep that in our eye, affect our hearts with it, and always uſe the <hi>means</hi> with ſerious views to the bleſſed <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, We muſt take heed to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> by whoſe Inſpiration the Word was written, and by whoſe Bleſſing it is ſucceeded; we muſt realize the neceſſity of His preſence with the Word, we muſt implore His ſpecial Influence to accompany it, rely on His powerful Grace to render it efficacious, lay our Souls open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, obſerve His workings in us, cheriſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and improve every good impreſſion He makes on us by the Word at any time.</p>
            <p>AND if we thus take heed to the Word, we ſhall find it an <hi>effectual</hi> method to cleanſe our way. This Truth is evident as from other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſo eſpecially from <hi>the Promiſe of God,</hi> and <hi>the Experience of the Saints.</hi>—The <hi>Promiſe</hi> is unto ſuch. Thus we read, (1 Jam. 1.25.) <hi>Whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:002024_0170_0FBA79CB75E9A2C0"/>
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> So, (Mar. 4.24.) <hi>Take heed to what ye hear: And unto you that hear ſhall more be given.</hi> So (Iſai. 55.1.) <hi>Hear, and your Soul ſhall live.</hi> — Theſe bleſſed Promiſes unto thoſe that hear, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and take heed to the Word, are a ſufficient ground of aſſurance, that ſuch ſhall not <hi>fail of the Grace of God.</hi>— And the univerſal <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> is an abundant confirmation of this Truth. 'Twas in this way they all <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world</hi>; they <hi>purify'd their Souls in obeying the Truth.</hi> To which of the Saints wilt thou turn? If we appeal to <hi>the Saints in Light,</hi> they will with one voice tell us, that <hi>by obſerving the Word of God</hi> they were <hi>made meet</hi> for their Inheritance. If we enquire of <hi>the Saints that are in the Earth,</hi> they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>By the Word I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer. The Word have I hid in my heart that I might not ſin againſt God. Salvation is far from the wicked, for they ſeek not his ſtatutes. But my heart ſtandeth in awe of his word. I have hoped for his ſalvation and done his commandments. I will never forget his precepts, for his word hath quicken'd me. I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek his precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OBSERVING the Word is then a moſt ſure and infallible method of cleanſing. <hi>The Word of the Lord is try'd.</hi> It is a means, that never <hi>has</hi> fail'd ſuch as have diligently improv'd it; and this is ſufficient Argument, <hi>it never will.</hi> And <hi>as many as take heed unto the Word of God,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>undefiled in the way,</hi> and <hi>alſo do no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Whoſoever is born again, not of corruptible
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:002024_0171_0FBA79CE137D78B0"/>
ſeed but incorruptible, by the word of God, he doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin,</hi> (1 Pet. 1.23. &amp; 1 Joh. 3.9. compa.)</p>
            <p>THESE few Hints may ſuffice for this Laſt Article.</p>
            <p>AND thus I've finiſht the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Handling of the Text, and in ſome ſort cleared the Three Points propos'd to be ſpoken to; Namely, <hi>That the way of Youth is naturally defiled: That it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns Perſons in their Youth to get their way Cleanſed:</hi> And Laſtly, <hi>That if Young Men</hi> (or any others) <hi>duly obſerve the Word of God, they take a moſt direct and effectual method to cleanſe, and keep, their way from ſinful defilements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I proceed to make ſome brief APPLICATION of theſe Things diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>USE. I. IS the way of Youth defiled, <hi>What ground of Self-abaſement is here?</hi> How ſhould this ſhame and humble us? How ſhou'd it correct the vanity and mortify the levity of Young Men, to conſider their <hi>natural depravation &amp; contracted defilements?</hi> Conſider this, ye that forget God; and <hi>Be not high-minded, but be ye clothed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> Pride not your ſelves in any Privileges of Birth or Education, in any accompliſhments of Body or Mind, in any temporal enjoyments or external advantages of Life, and the like; for ſo long as your <hi>way is defiled,</hi> this tarniſhes the glory of all, and ſheds a fatal taint into all the Bleſſing you enjoy, renders your Perſons odious in the Eyes of the Holy God, and expoſes you to all the Curſes which His infinite Wiſdom can invent, or His infinite Power inflict, <hi>which is ſhame and terror enough.</hi> It is owing to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:002024_0172_0FBA79CF466FE748"/>
and inconſideration of theſe things, that ſo many Young Men, as well as others, are <hi>vainly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fft up by their fleſhly mind,</hi> and walk in the luſt of <hi>Pride.</hi> They wou'd rate Themſelves and their Accompliſhments a little lower, did they but conſider what black &amp; filthy feet theſe proud Plumes walk upon; or what roots of bitterneſs they are, which bear theſe gawdy flowers, what corrupt Trees they are, which bear theſe painted fruits. Our original Corruption and actual Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are ſufficient matter of humiliation to us, and a juſt allay of ſwelling arrogance. We may well bemoan our ſelves as <hi>wretched Men,</hi> 'till we are <hi>deliver'd from the Body of this Death,</hi> however happy we may be as to Bodily or Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Endowments, or Worldly Enjoyments. And we ſhould temper the tho'ts of the one, by ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reflections on the other, to make us lowly in our own Eyes, and to keep us from <hi>thinking more highly of our ſelves, than we ought to think.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>THESE Things afford matter for a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: But it is the Application of the <hi>Laſt Prepoſition,</hi> that I intend to ſpeak <hi>moſt</hi> and yet but briefly unto. Let us therefore come to—</p>
            <p>USE. III. IS the Word, if duly obſerved, ſuch an effectual means to cleanſe our way? <hi>Hence,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WE have one very good Argument for the Divinity of the Word.</hi> It is no mean Argument, that the Word Written is of Divine Inſpiration, and the Word Preacht of Divine Inſtitution, That they are inſtrumental of the moſt Divine Effects, the moſt Honorary to God, and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Man; ſuch Effects as all the Philoſophy of the ſageſt humane Writers cou'd never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. By the Word, Dead Souls are quicken'd, Hard Hearts ſoften'd, Defiled Conſciences purged, and the whole Spirit, Soul, and Body ſanctify'd, <hi>turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>— Surely, Here is the Wiſdom and the Power of God. Theſe illuſtrious Effects and Triumphs of the Word, evidence it to be the <hi>Word of God, &amp; not the Word of Man.</hi> And he muſt be ſtrangely blind &amp; ſtupid, that does not in theſe Things read it's Divine Authority and Original.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HENCE, <hi>It is an invaluable Privilege to enjoy the Word, &amp; what beſpeaks our thankful Praiſes.</hi> To have the <hi>Scriptures to ſearch,</hi> and <hi>the Word Preached</hi> to hear, is a <hi>Great</hi> Favour of God; a Bleſſing that cannot be ſufficiently valu'd. 'Tis the greateſt outward Privilege. The Apoſtle declares the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had <hi>manifold peculiar Advantages</hi> in the enjoyment of the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. (Rom. 3.1, 2.) And our Saviour tells His
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:002024_0175_0FBA79D5C43AB7C8"/>
Diſciples, what a great Bleſſing they enjoy'd in the Goſpel, how much greater than they of old; (Luk. 10.23, 4.) <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee the things that ye ſee.</hi> For <hi>I tell you, that many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear and have not heard them.</hi> We that enjoy the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> are <hi>highly favoured</hi> indeed. Unto ſuch may well be apply'd that (in Deut. 32.29.) <hi>Happy art thou; who is like unto Thee, O People ſaved by the Lord?</hi> Dignify'd &amp; bleſſed even <hi>above</hi> the <hi>darling</hi> Saints in the Old Teſtament-Times; how <hi>much more</hi> then above the Great Ones in the Earth, who have not the Word? Verily, To live under the Light of the Glorious Goſpel, tho' in the meaneſt Cottage or Hovel, is a greater Happineſs, a <hi>goodlier Heritage,</hi> than without it to live in King's Palaces and the high Places of the Earth. How then ſhould we prize the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and be thankful for the Word of Life!</p>
            <p>AND it is a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Favour, as well as <hi>Great.</hi> For there be many Perſons, yea Nations in the World, who have the ſame neceſſity and occaſion for the Word as we, and we as they, and they are Originally no more unworthy than our ſelves, and as capable of the Benefits of the Goſpel, and yet are deſtitute of the Word, and are left to the guidance of Nature's faint confuſed Light, and have no better Inſtructors than the Sun, Moon and Stars; while we have a <hi>more ſure word of Prophecy, which is as a ſhining Light,</hi> and have <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> to <hi>feed us with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> and to <hi>teach us the good knowlege of the Lord.</hi> In this caſe we muſt ſay, (as in, Rom. 3.9.) <hi>What then? are we better than they? no, in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wiſe.</hi> And as in Luk. 10.21. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, &amp; haſt revealed them unto babes: Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> The uncontrollable Liberty and unaccountable Sovereignty of God is to be ſeen and own'd in this conduct of Divine Providence. And ſurely a Favour, ſo incomparably great and ineffably gracious, as the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, is what challenges the higheſt gratitude. O Let us ever be fill'd with admiring th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t's and the moſt thankful reſentments of the great and diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Goodneſs of God unto us a giving us His Word. The Pſalmiſt admoniſhes us of this our duty; Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, He hath not dealt ſo with</hi> every <hi>Nation.— Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>—And Let us adore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Forbearance of God towards us, and His ſovereign Grace, in <hi>continuing</hi> to us His Word, notwithſtanding the viſible contemt ſhown unto it by multitudes among us, and the innumerable Forfeitures we have made of this Privilege. There are many <hi>Places</hi> in the World, where the Word was once ſent and <hi>prevailed mightily,</hi> but having abus'd their liberty, and <hi>rebell'd againſt the Light, The Candleſtick</hi> was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aſtoniſhing is the Patience of God towards a ſinful Land!—And further, Many <hi>Perſons,</hi> who once enjoy'd the warm Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of the Goſpel, are laid in their cold Graves, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

beyond all hope and help, while we are ſpared. O the unmerited Goodneſs and wonderful Long-ſuffering of God us-ward! Surely, ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Mercy deſerves and demands ſpecial returns of Gratitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HENCE, <hi>We learn the Reaſon and Motive of that Oppoſition which the Word of God meets with from Satan.</hi> The Word of God is a Well of Salvation, a Fountain of Truth and Purity. It has a powerful Efficacy to <hi>turn Men from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light,</hi> from Sin to Sanctity, and <hi>is able to make them wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> It inſtructs thoſe, whom Satan wou'd have remain ignorant; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts thoſe whom He wou'd have abide in their Sins; it ſanctifies thoſe, whom He wou'd fain defile; and comforts thoſe, whom He wou'd have to be diſconſolate. And thus it croſſes his deſigns, and thwarts his intereſts, clouds the glory and weakens the nerves of his Government, leſſens the number of his Subjects, and threatens the the deſtruction of his Kingdom. — And this is the ground of his ſpite and ſpleen, malice and malignity againſt the Word. Hence it is, that <hi>the God of this World,</hi> whoſe Kingdom lyes in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; wickedneſs, ſets himſelf to oppoſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel &amp; blaſt the endeavours of Miniſters, &amp; by many ſubtil ſtratagems &amp; with indefatigable induſtry labours to undermine and invalidate the Word, to bring it into contemt, to foment prejudices againſt it, and bar it's good Entertainment, to ſtifle Convictions and damp pious Affections kindled in any awaken'd Soul, and to enliven and enrage the Corruptions, that have been chill'd and cool'd, by the Word. That wicked One endeavours to rob us of the good Seed, to ſhake

            </p>
            <p>I Shall now ſhut up all with that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (Phil. 2.15, 16.) <hi>Be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation; among whom ſhine ye as Lights in the World: Holding forth the word of Life; that I may rejoyce in the Day of Chriſt, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</hi>
