         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN preſenting the following work of <hi>COUSTOS'S</hi> Sufferings to the public, it may be remarked that few publications have received ſo extenſive a patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from the fraternity as the preſent, and none held in more eſtimation, as is fully evinced by the reſpectable liſt of ſubſcribers annexed to the Engliſh copy, prefaced with a dedication to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the duke of Cumberland, the then Grand Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This proving the character and merit of the narrative, has induced the publiſher to preſume it will be equally acceptable to the craft on this ſide the Atlantic, particularly as maſonry flouriſhes in this country in a manner hitherto unequalled in the hiſtory of cur noble order. A work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well authenticated muſt be conſidered as a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable tract—which for the honour of humanity it is firmly hoped, the like ſcenes will again be never repeated.</p>
            <p>An original attempt to arrange in order the different domeſtic lodges, will appear obviouſly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to effect with accuracy; but ſo far as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:031999_0004_0FF09B5FF8BCA0B0"/>has admitted, no attention has been withheld.<note n="*" place="bottom">The editor here begs leave to preſent his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to John Abrams <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Grand ſecretary for New-York, for his very polite aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the accompliſhment of this part of the work.</note> Foreign lodges are enumerated from the lateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons calender that could be procured.</p>
            <p>The ſongs, it is preſumed, will prove an acceptable pocket companion to our meetings, and if they have a tendency in promoting recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pleaſure, the wiſhes of the editor will be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply gratified.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>I CAN juſtly affirm, that it was not vanity that induced me to publiſh the following accurate and faithful relation of my ſufferings in the Inquiſition of Liſbon. A ſtrong deſire to juſtify myſelf with regard to the falſe accuſations brought by that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal againſt me; as well as againſt the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Free-Maſons, of which I have the honour to be a member, were the chief motives for my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the pen. To this I will add, that I was very willing the whole world ſhould receive all the lights and informations I was capable of giving it, concerning the ſhocking injuſtice, and the horrid cruelties exerciſed in the pretended holy office. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who live in countries where this tribunal is had in abomination, will, from the peruſal of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets, have freſh cauſe to bleſs providence, for not fixing their abode among the Spaniards, the Portugueze, or the Italians.</p>
            <p>Such of my readers as may happen to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in countries where this barbarous tribunal is eſtabliſhed, will here find very ſalutary inſtructions for their conduct; and, conſequently, be leſs liable to fall into the hands of the unrelenting Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who, ſpite of all the precautions taken by
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:031999_0006_0FF09B0D70D47148"/>them, may yet have the ſad misfortune to become their innocent victims, will here be taught to avoid the ſnares laid, in order to aggravate the charge brought againſt them. Theſe ſnares ought the more to be guarded againſt, as they are but too often ſpread by the Inquiſitors, merely to give a ſpecious air of juſtice and equity to their iniquitous proſecutions.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, I ſhall firſt give an impartial relation of my own proſecution and ſufferings, on account of my being a Free-Maſon. I ſhall add, for the ſatisfaction of the curious, a ſuccinct hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the pretended holy office; its origin; its eſtabliſhment in France, Italy, Spain and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal; the manner how it graſped, by inſenſible degrees, the ſupreme authority now exerciſed by it, not only againſt thoſe conſidered by it as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, but even againſt Roman Catholics; how priſoners are proceeded againſt; the tortures inflicted on them, in order to extort a confeſſion: the execution of perſons ſentenced to die; with an accurate deſcription of the <hi>Auto da Fé,</hi> or gaol delivery, as we may term it; together with the ſufferings of many perſons who fell victims to this tribunal. I likewiſe will add a plan of the houſe of the Inquiſition at Liſbon, in which I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſixteen months, and whence I was removed to the galley, as it is called, in that city. I will
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:031999_0007_0FF09AEB2BA07500"/>deſcribe this Portugueze galley; and the manner how priſoners are lodged and treated in both thoſe places.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a compariſon between the methods employed by the primitive church, in order to ſuppreſs hereſy, and convert heretics; and thoſe now made uſe of by the Inquiſitors (under the cloak of religion) indiſcriminately towards all mankind, for the ſame purpoſe, as they pretend. I ſhall relate what I myſelf was eye-witneſs of; and will annex the remarks of many ill-fated Roman Catholics, who, as well as myſelf, were the innocent victims to this dreadful tribunal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall think it a happineſs,—if the relation which I now offer ſhould be found of uſe to the public; and ſhall conſider it as a ſtill greater, in caſe it may help to open the eyes of thoſe, who, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by an indiſcreet, or rather blind zeal, think it a meritorious work, in the ſight of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to perſecute all perſons whoſe religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples differ from theirs.</p>
            <p>In order to give the reader all the proof poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the nature of the thing, that I have really undergone the tortures mentioned in the following account of my ſufferings, I ſhewed the marks ſtill remaining on my arms and legs, to Dr. Hoad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Cary, ſurgeons:
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031999_0008_0FF09B63D2020BE0"/>and I think myſelf particularly obliged to theſe gentlemen, for the leave they have given me to aſſure the public, they were quite ſatisfied that the marks muſt have been the effect of very great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and that, in their ſituation, they correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond exactly to the deſcription of the torture.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE SUFFERINGS OF JOHN COUSTOS, IN THE INQUISITION AT LISBON.</head>
            <p>I AM a native of Berne in Switzerland, and a lapidary by profeſſion. In 1716, my father came, with his whole family, to London; and as he propoſed to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in England, he got himſelf naturalized there.</p>
            <p>After living twenty-two years in that city, I went, at the ſolicitation of a friend, to Paris, in order to work in the galleries of the Louvre. Five years after I left this capital, and removed to Liſbon, in hopes of finding an opportunity of going to Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, where I flattered myſelf that I ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:031999_0010_0FF09B0F91C95070"/>make my fortune. But the king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, whom I addreſſed in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain permiſſion for this purpoſe, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of my profeſſion, and the ſkill I might have in diamonds, &amp;c. his majeſty, by the advice of his council, refuſed my petition, upon the ſuppoſition that it would be no way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> proper to ſend a foreigner, who was a lapidary, into a country aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with immenſe treaſures, whoſe value the government endeavours, by all means poſſible, to conceal, even from the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was waiting for an anſwer from court, to my petition, I got acquainted with ſeveral ſubſtantial jewellers, and other perſons of credit, in Liſbon; who made me the kindeſt and moſt generous offers, in caſe I would reſide among them, which I accepted, after having loſt all hopes of going to Braſil. I now was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the above mentioned city, equally to the ſatisfaction of my friends, my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, and myſelf; having a proſpect of gaining wherewithal, not only to ſupport my family with decency, but alſo to lay up a competency for old age, could I but have eſcaped the cruel hands of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:031999_0011_0FF09B3377E1F438"/>
I muſt obſerve, by the way, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor have uſurped ſo formidable a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Spain and Portugal, that the monarchs of thoſe kingdoms are no more, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, than as their chief ſubjects. Thoſe tyrants do not ſcruple to encroach ſo far on the privilege of kings, as to ſtop, by their own authority at the poſt-office, the letters of all whom they take it into their heads to ſuſpect. In this manner I myſelf was ſerved, a year before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors had ordered me to be ſeized; the deſign of which, I ſuppoſe, was to ſee, whether among the letters of my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſome mention would not be made of Free-Maſonry; I paſſing for one of the moſt zealous members of that art, which they reſolved to perſecute, upon pretence that enormous crimes were committed by its profeſſors. However, though the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did not find, by one of my intercepted letters, that Free-Maſonry either ſtruck at the Romiſh religion, or tended to diſturb the government; ſtill they were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but reſolved to ſet every engine at work, in order to diſcover the myſteries and ſecrets of Maſonry. For this purpoſe, they concluded that it would be proper to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031999_0012_0FF09AC5AF31D920"/>ſeize one of the chief Free-Maſons in Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon; and accordingly I was pitched upon, as being the maſter of a lodge; they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe-caſt their eye on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> warden, an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend of mine, Mr. Alexander James Mouton, a diamond cutter, born in Paris, and a Romaniſt. He had been ſettled ſix years, before his ſeizure, at Liſbon, in which city he was a houſe-keeper; and where his integrity, ſkill, and behaviour were ſuch, as gained him the approbation of all to whom he was known.</p>
            <p>The reader is to be informed, that our lodges, in Liſbon, were not kept at taverns, &amp;c. but alternately at the private houſes of choſen friends. In theſe we uſed to dine together, and practiſe the ſecrets of Free-Maſonry.</p>
            <p>As we did not know that our art was forbid in Portugal, we were ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the barbarous zeal of a lady, who declared, at confeſſion, that we were Free-Maſons; that is, in her opinion, monſters in nature, who perpetrated the moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crimes. This diſcovery immediately put the vigilant officers of the Inquiſition upon the ſcent after us: on which occaſion my friend Mr. Mouton fell the firſt victim, he being ſeized in manner following.</p>

A jeweller and goldſmith, who was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar of the holy office, ſent a friend, (a Free-Maſon alſo) to Mr. Mouton; upon pretence that he wanted to ſpeak with him, about mending a diamond weighing four carrats. They agreed upon the price; but as this was merely an artifice, in order for our familiar to know the perſon of the ſaid Mouton, he put him off for two days; upon pretence that he muſt firſt enquire of the owner of the diamond, whether he approved of the price ſettled between them.</p>
            <p>I happened to be at that time with Mr. Mouton; a circumſtance which gave the higheſt joy to the jeweller; finding that he had got a ſight, at one and the ſame time, of the very two Free-Maſons whom the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors were determined to ſeize.</p>
            <p>At our taking leave, he deſired us to come together, at the time appointed, to which we both agreed. The jeweller then made his report to the Inquiſitors, who ordered him to ſeize us, when we ſhould return about the diamond in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Two days being elapſed, and my buſineſs not permitting me to accompany Mr. Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, he went alone to the jeweller, to fetch the diamond, which was computed to be worth an hundred moidores. The firſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031999_0014_0FF09AC7943BA830"/>queſtion the jeweller aſked, after the uſual compliments, was, "Where is your friend Couſtos?"—As this jeweller had before ſhown me ſome precious ſtones, which he pretended I ſhould go to work upon, Mr. Mouton, imagining he was deſirous of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them inſtantly into my hands, replied: <q>That I was upon 'Change; and that, if he thought proper, he would go and fetch me.</q> However, as this familiar, and five ſubaltern officers of the Inquiſition, who were along with him, were afraid of loſing half their prey; they inveigled Mr. Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton into the back ſhop, upon pretence of aſking his opinion concerning certain rough diamonds. After ſeveral ſigns and words had paſſed between them, the oldeſt of the company riſing up, ſaid, he had ſomething particular to communicate to Mr. Mouton; upon which he took him behind the curtain; when, enquiring his name and ſirname, he told him that he was his priſoner, in the king's name.</p>
            <p>Being ſenſible that he had not committed any crime for which he could incur his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze majeſty's diſpleaſure, he gave up his ſword the moment it was demanded of him. Immediately ſeveral truſty officers of the Inquiſition, called familiars, fell upon
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031999_0015_0FF09B19E64FEC20"/>him to prevent his eſcaping; they then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him not to make the leaſt noiſe, and began to ſearch him. This being done, and finding he had no weapons, they aſked whether he was deſirous of knowing in whoſe name he had been ſeized? Mr. Mouton anſwered in the affirmative: <q>We ſeize you (ſaid they) in the name of the Inquiſition; and, in its name, we forbid you to ſpeak, or murmur ever ſo little.</q> Saying theſe words, a door at the bottom of the jeweller's ſhop, and which looked into a narrow bye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, being opened; the priſoner, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a commiſſary of the holy office, was thrown into a ſmall chaiſe, where he was ſo cloſely ſhut up, (it being noon day,) that no one could ſee him. This precaution was uſed to prevent his friends from getting the leaſt information concerning his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and conſequently from uſing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to procure his liberty.</p>
            <p>Being come to the priſon of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they threw him into a dungeon, and there left him alone; without indulging him the ſatisfaction they had promiſed, which was, to let him ſpeak, immediately upon his arrival, to the preſident of the holy office; to know from him, the reaſon of his detainer. On the contrary, they were ſo cruel to Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031999_0016_0FF09AC9AF157780"/>Mouton's reputation, as to ſpread a report he was gone off with the diamond above-mentioned. But how greatly were every one of his friends ſurpriſed and ſhocked at this ſlander! As we all entertained the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt idea of his probity, none of us would give credit to this vile report; whence we unanimouſly agreed, after duly weighing this matter, to go in a body to the jeweller, who was the owner of the diamond, and offer him the full payment of it; firmly perſuaded, that nothing but the moſt fatal and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident could have made him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear thus ſuddenly, without giving ſome of his friends notice of it. However, the jeweller refuſed our offer in the politeſt manner; aſſuring us at the ſame time, that the owner of the diamond was ſo wealthy a man, that the loſs of it would be but a triſle to him.</p>
            <p>But as truth frequently breaks through all the veils with which falſehood endeavours to cloud her; this generoſity in perſons to whom we were, in a great meaſure, ſtrangers, made us ſuſpect ſome iniquitous, dark act. Our conjecture appeared but too well grounded, from the ſevere perſecution that was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſed againſt the Free-Maſons; I myſelf being ſeized four days after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:031999_0017_0FF09B4C0846D9C8"/>
I perhaps ſhould have eſcaped their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs paws, had I not been betrayed, in the moſt barbarous manner, by a Portugueze friend of mine, as I falſely ſuppoſed him to be; and whom the holy office had ordered to watch me narrowly. This man ſeeing me in a coffee-houſe, the 5th of March, 1742-3, between nine and ten at night; went and gave notice thereof to nine officers of the Inquiſition, who were lying in wait for me, with a chaiſe, near that place.</p>
            <p>I was in the utmoſt confuſion, when, at my going out of the coffee-houſe with two friends, the above officers ſeized me only. Their pretence for this was, that I had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my word for the diamond which Mr. Mouton had run away with: that I muſt certainly be his accomplice, ſince I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my friends to offer to pay for the diamond; all which (added they) I muſt have done in no other view than to conceal my villany. It was to no purpoſe that I alledged a thouſand things in my own juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. Immediately the wretches took away my ſword; hand-cuffed me; forced me into a chaiſe drawn by two mules; and in this condition I was hurried away to the priſon of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>But, ſpite of theſe ſeverities, and their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031999_0018_0FF09AB386D48130"/>commanding me not to open my lips, I yet called aloud to one of my friends (Mr. Richard) who had been at the coffee-houſe with me, and was a Free-Maſon; conjuring him to give notice to all the reſt of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and friends, of my being ſeized by command of the holy office, in order that they might avoid the misfortune which had befallen me, by going voluntarily to the Inquiſitors, and accuſing themſelves.</p>
            <p>I muſt take notice, that the Inquiſitors very ſeldom cauſe a perſon to be ſeized in broad day light, except they are almoſt ſure that he will make no noiſe nor reſiſtance. This is a circumſtance they obſerve very ſtrictly, as is evident from the manner in which they took Mr. Mouton. Farther, they frequently make uſe of the king's name and authority on theſe occaſions, to ſeize and diſarm the pretended criminal, who is afraid to diſobey the orders he hears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. But as darkneſs befriends deeds of villany, the Inquiſitors, for this reaſon, uſually cauſe their victims to be ſecured in the night.</p>
            <p>The Portugueze, and many foreigners, are ſo apprehenſive of the ſiniſter accidents which often happen at Liſbon in the night-time, eſpecially to a perſon who ventures
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031999_0019_0FF09ADE0FCBDE78"/>out alone, that few are found in the ſtreets of this city at a late hour.</p>
            <p>I imagined myſelf ſo ſecure in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my friends, that I ſhould not have been afraid of reſiſting the officers in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had the former lent me their aſſiſtance. But unhappily for me, they were ſtruck with ſuch a ſudden panic, that every one of them fled; leaving me to the mercy of nine wretches, who fell upon me in an inſtant.</p>
            <p>They then forced me to the priſon of the Inquiſition, where I was delivered up to one of the officers of this pretended holy place. This officer preſently calling four ſubalterns, or guards, theſe took me to an apartment, till ſuch time as notice ſhould be given to the preſident of my being catched in their ſnare.</p>
            <p>A little after, the above-mentioned officer coming again, bid the guards ſearch me; and take away all the gold, ſilver, papers, knives, ſciſſors, buckles, &amp;c. I might have about me. They then led me to a lonely dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, expreſsly forbidding me to ſpeak loud, or knock at the walls; but that, in caſe I wanted any thing, to beat againſt the door, with a padlock, that hung on the outward door; and which I could reach, by thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my arm through the iron grates. It
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031999_0020_0FF09AABD32E4B28"/>was then that, ſtruck with all the horrors of a place of which I had heard and read ſuch baleful deſcriptions, I plunged at once into the blackeſt melancholy; eſpecially when I reflected on the dire conſequences with which my confinement might very poſſibly be attended.</p>
            <p>I paſſed a whole day and two nights in theſe terrors, which are the more difficult to deſcribe, as they were heightened at every little interval, by the complaints, the diſmal cries, and hollow groans (echoing through this dreadful manſion) of ſeveral other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, my neighbours; and which the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſilence of the night made infinitely more ſhocking. It was now that time ſeemed to have loſt all motion, and theſe threeſcore hours appeared to me like ſo many years.</p>
            <p>However, afterwards calling to mind, that grief would only aggravate my cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I endeavoured to arm my ſoul with patience; and habituate myſelf, as well as I could, to woe. Accordingly I rouſed my ſpirits; and baniſhing for a few moments, theſe dreadfully mournful ideas, I began to reflect ſeriouſly, on the methods how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate myſelf from this labyrinth of horrors. My conſciouſneſs that I had not committed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031999_0021_0FF09B3635648C70"/>any crime which could juſtly merit death, would now and then ſoften my pang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; but immediately after, dreadful thoughts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>-ſpread my mind, when I imagined to myſelf the crying injuſtice of which the tribunal that was to judge me, is accuſed. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that, being a proteſtant, I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably feel, in its utmoſt rigours, all that rage and barbarous zeal could infuſe in the breaſt of monks; who cruelly gloried, in committing to the flames, great numbers of ill-fated victims, whoſe only crime was their differing from them in religious opinions; or rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orthily of human nature; and had, in the utmoſt deteſtation, theſe Romiſh barbarities, which are not to be paralleled in any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Theſe apprehenſions, together with the reflections which reaſon ſuggeſted to me, viz. that it would be highly incumbent on me to calm the tumult of my ſpirits, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to prevent my falling into the ſnares which my judges would not fail to ſpread round me; either by giving them an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of pronouncing me guilty, or by forcing me to apoſtatize from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in which I was born; theſe things,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031999_0022_0FF09AB52761D150"/>I ſay, worked ſo ſtrongly on my mind, that, from this moment, I devoted my whole thoughts to the means of my juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This I made ſo fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ar to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I was perſuaded neither the partiality of my judges, nor the dreadful ideas I had entertained of their cruelty, could intimidate me, when I ſhould be brought before them; which I according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was, in a few days, after having been ſhaved, and had my hair cut by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>I now was led, bare-headed, to the preſident and four Inquiſitors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>o, upon my co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe queſtions were; my Chriſtian and ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names; thoſe of my parents; the place of my birth, my profeſſion, religion, and how long I had reſided in Liſbon. This being done, they addreſſed me as follows: — <q>Son, you have offended and ſpoke injuriouſly of the holy office, as we know from very good hands; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we exhort you to make a confeſſion of, and to accuſe yourſelf of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031999_0023_0FF09AB7D0FABDA0"/>crimes you may have committed, from the time you was capable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between good and evil, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment. In doing this, you will excite the compaſſion of this tribunal, which is ever merciful and kind to thoſe who ſpeak the truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen they thought proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, that the diamond mentioned in the former pages, was only a pretence they had employed, in order to get an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeizing me. I now beſought them, <q>To let me know the true cauſe of my impriſonment; that, having been born and educated in the proteſtant religion, I had been taught, from my infancy, not to confeſs myſelf to men, but to God, who, as he only can ſee into the inmoſt receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the human heart, knows the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or inſincerity of the ſinner's repentance, who confeſſed to him; and being his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it was he only could abſolve him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reader will naturally ſuppoſe, that they were no ways ſatisfied with my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; — <q>They declaring, that it would be indiſpenſably neceſſary for me to confeſs myſelf, what religion ſoever I might be of; otherwiſe, that a confeſſion would be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031999_0024_0FF09AE1024BA968"/>forced from me, by the expedients the holy office employed for that purpoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this I replied, <q>That I had never ſpoke in my life againſt the Romiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that I had behaved in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ever ſince my living at Liſbon, that I could not be juſtly accuſed of ſaying or doing any thing contrary to the laws of the kingdom, either as to ſpirituals or temporals; that I had alſo imagined the holy office took cognizance of none but thoſe perſons who were guilty of ſacrilege, blaſphemy, and ſuch like crimes, whoſe delight is to depreciate and ridicule the myſteries received in the Romiſh church, but of which I was no ways guilty.</q>—They then remanded me back to my dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, after exhorting me to examine my conſcience.</p>
            <p>Three days after, they ſent for me, to interrogate me a ſecond time. The firſt queſtion they aſked was; <q>Whether I had carefully looked into my conſcience, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to their injunction.' I replied, That after carefully reviewing all the paſt tranſactions of my life, I did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my having ſaid or done any thing that could juſtly give offence to the holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; that from my moſt tender youth,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031999_0025_0FF09AEF0AC10958"/>my parents, who had been forced to quit France for their religion; and who knew, by ſad experience, how highly it concerns every one that values his eaſe, never to converſe on religious ſubjects, in certain countries; that my parents, (I ſay) had adviſed me never to engage in diſputes of this kind, ſince they uſually embittered the minds of the contending parties, rather than reconciled them; farther, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a ſociety, compoſed of perſons of different religions; one of the laws of which ſociety expreſsly forbid its members ever to diſpute on thoſe ſubjects upon a conſiderable penalty.</q> As the Inquiſitors confounded the word ſociety with that of religion; I aſſured them, <q>that this ſociety could be conſidered as a religious one, no otherwiſe than as it obliged its ſeveral members to live together in charity and brotherly love, how widely ſoever they might differ in religious principles. They then enquired, how this ſociety was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</q> —I replied,—<q>That if they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to be ſeized, becauſe I was one of its members, I would readily tell them its name; I thinking myſelf not a little honoured in belonging to a ſociety, which boaſted ſeveral Chriſtian kings, princes,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031999_0026_0FF09AE2A6F6D2B0"/>and perſons of the higheſt quality among its members; and that I had been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in company with ſome of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as one of their brethren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then one of the Inquiſitors aſked me, <q>Whether the name of this ſociety was a ſecret?</q> I anſwered, <q>that it was not; that I could tell it them in French or Engliſh, but was not able to tranſlate it into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze.</q> Then all of them fixing, on a ſudden, their eyes attentively on me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, alternately, the words Free-Maſon, or Franc-Macon. From this inſtant I was firmly perſuaded, that I had been impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſolely on account of Maſonry.</p>
            <p>They afterwards aſked, <q>What were the conſtitutions of this ſociety.</q> I then ſet before them, as well as I could, <q>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient traditions relating to this noble art, of which (I told them) James VI. king of Scotland,<note n="*" place="bottom">The conſtitutions of the Free-Maſons, &amp;c. for the uſe of the lodges, by Dr. Anderſon, page 38, London, 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031999_0027_0FF09B27C52A47E8"/>regard for this honourable ſociety, on account of the ſtrong proofs its members had ever given of their fidelity and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment; that thoſe monarchs eſtabliſhed the cuſtom among the brethren, of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whenever they drank, <hi>God preſerve the king and the brotherhood:</hi> that this example was ſoon followed by the Scotch nobility and the clergy, who had ſo high an eſteem for the brotherhood, that moſt of them entered into the ſociety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That it appeared from other traditions, that the kings of Scotland had frequently been grand maſters of the Free-Maſons; and that, when the kings were not ſuch, the ſociety were impowered to elect, as grand maſter, one of the nobles of the country, who had a penſion from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; and received, at his election, a gift from every Free-Maſon in Scotland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I likewiſe told them; <q>That queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, aſcending the throne of England, at a time that the kingdom was greatly divided by factions and claſhing intereſts; and taking umbrage at the various aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of great numbers of her ſubjects, as not knowing the deſigns of thoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſhe reſolved to ſuppreſs the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031999_0028_0FF09ABA755E4EC8"/>of the Free-Maſons; however, that, before her Majeſty proceeded to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, ſhe commanded ſome of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to enter into this ſociety, among whom was the archbiſhop of Canterbury, primate of her kingdom: that theſe, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queen's orders, gave her ſo very advantageous a character, of the fidelity of the Free-Maſons, as removed, at once, all her majeſty's ſuſpicions and political fears: ſo that the ſociety have, ever ſince that time, enjoyed in Great-Britain, and the places ſubject to it, all the liberty they could wiſh for, and which they have never once abuſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They afterwards enquired, <q>What was the tendency of this ſociety?—I replied: Every Free-Maſon is obliged, at his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to take an oath, on the holy goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that he will be faithful to the king; and never enter into any plot or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt his ſacred perſon, or againſt the country where he reſides: and that he will pay obedience to the magiſtrates appointed by the monarch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I next declared, <q>That charity was the foundation, and the ſoul, as it were, of the ſociety; as it linked together the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral individuals of it, by the tye of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031999_0029_0FF09B0497A9ADA0"/>love; and made it an indiſpenſable duty to aſſiſt, in the moſt charitable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without diſtinction of religion, all ſuch neceſſitous perſons as were found true objects of compaſſion.</q>—It was then they called me liar; declaring, <q>that it was impoſſible this ſociety ſhould profeſs the practice of ſuch good maxims, and yet be ſo very jealous of its ſecrets as to exclude women from it.</q> The judicious reader will perceive, at once, the weakneſs of this inference, which perhaps would be found but too true, were it applied to the inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecrecy obſerved by this pretended holy office, in all its actions.</p>
            <p>They preſently gave orders for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed into another deep dungeon; the deſign of which, I ſuppoſe, was to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify me completely; and here I continued ſeven weeks. It will be naturally ſuppoſed, that I now was overwhelmed with grief. I will confeſs, that I then gave myſelf up entirely for loſt; and had no reſource left but in the Almighty, whoſe aid I implored continually with the utmoſt fervency.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay in this miſerable dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, I was taken three times before the Inquiſitors. The firſt thing they made me do was, to ſwear on the bible, that I would
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031999_0030_0FF09AE4C1DA26D0"/>not reveal the ſecrets of the Inquiſition; but declare the truth with regard to all ſuch queſtions as they ſhould put to me: they added, <q>That it was their firm opinion that Maſonry could not be founded on ſuch good principles as I, in my former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, had affirmed; and that, if this ſociety of Free-Maſons was ſo virtuous as I pretended, there was no occaſion of their concealing, ſo very induſtriouſly, the ſecrets of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I told them, <q>That as ſecrecy<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the principal parts that makes a man be deemed wife, is his intelligent ſtrength and ability to cover and conceal ſuch honeſt ſecrets as are committed to him, as well as his own ſerious affairs. And whoever will peruſe ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hiſtory, ſhall find a great number of virtuous attempts (in peace and war) that never reached their deſigned ends, through defect of ſecret conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet, beſides ſuch unhappy prevention, infinite evils have thereby enſued. But before all other examples, let us conſider that which excels all the reſt derived even from God himſelf. Who ſo eſpecially preſerves his own ſecrets to himſelf, never letting any man know what ſhould happen on the morrow; nor could the wiſe men in ages paſt, divine what ſhould befall us in this age: whereby we may readily diſcern that God himſelf is well pleaſed with ſecrecy. And although (for man's good) the Lord has been pleaſed to reveal ſome things, yet it is impoſſible at any time to change or alter his determination, in regard whereof the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend wiſe men of ancient times, evermore affected to perform their intentions ſecretly.
<p>The Athenians had a ſtatue of braſs, which they bowed to; the figure was made without a tongue, to declare ſecrecy thereby.</p>
                     <p>The ſervants of Plancus are much commended, becauſe no torment could make them confeſs the ſecret which their maſter entruſted them with.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the ſervant of Cato the orator was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly tormented, but nothing could make him reveal the ſecrets of his maſter.</p>
                     <p>Ariſtothe was demanded what thing appeared moſt difficult to him; he anſwered, to be ſecret and ſilent.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe St. Ambroſe, in his offices, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among the principal foundations of virtue, the patient gift of ſilence.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe king Solomon ſays in his proverbs, that a king ought not to drink wine, becauſe drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an enemy to ſecrecy; and, in his opinion, he is not worthy to reign that cannot keep his own ſecrets; he furthermore ſays, that he which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſecrets is a traitor, and he which conceals them is a faithful brother: he likewiſe ſays, that he that refraineth his tongue, keeps his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I am of opinion, that if ſecrecy and ſilence be duly conſidered, they will be found moſt neceſſary to qualify a man for any buſineſs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: if this be granted, I am confident that no man will dare to diſpute that Free-Maſons are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all other men, in concealing their ſecrets, from time immemorial; which the power of gold, that of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031999_0031_0FF09B2D4F97E1E0"/>excited curioſity, this prompted great numbers, of perſons to enter into this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; that all the monies given by mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, at their admiſſion therein, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in works of charity: that by the ſecrets which the ſeveral members practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a true Maſon inſtantly knew whether
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031999_0032_0FF09ABC0FFD1038"/>a ſtranger, who would introduce himſelf into a lodge, was really a Free-Maſon; that, was it not for ſuch precautions, this ſociety would form confuſed aſſemblies of all ſorts of people, who, as they were not obliged to pay obedience to the orders of the maſter of the lodge, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently would be impoſſible to keep them within the bounds of that decorum and good manners, which are exactly obſerved, upon certain penalties, by all Free-Maſons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the reaſon why women were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this ſociety, was, to take away all occaſion for calumny and reproach, which would have been unavoidable, had they been admitted into it. Farther, that ſince women had, in general, been always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031999_0033_0FF09B448EBBC638"/>as not very well qualified to keep a ſecret; the founders of the ſociety of Free-Maſons, by their excluſion of the other ſex, thereby gave a ſignal proof of their prudence and wiſdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They then inſiſted upon my revealing to them the ſecrets of this art.— <q>The oath (ſays I) taken by me at my admiſſion, never to divulge them directly or indirectly, will not permit me to do it: conſcience forbids me; and I therefore hope your lordſhips are too equitable to uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.' They declared, 'That my oath was as nothing in their preſence, and that they would abſolve me from it.—Your lordſhips (continued I) are very gracious; but as I am firmly perſuaded, that it is not in the power of any being upon earth to free me from my oath, I am firmly determined never to violate it.</q> This was more than enough to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me back to my dungeon, where, a few days after, I fell ſick.</p>
            <p>A phyſician was then ſent, who finding me exceedingly ill, made a report thereof to the Inquiſitors. Theſe, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of it, immediately gave orders for my being removed from this frightful dungeon, into another, which admitted
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031999_0034_0FF09B4A64490060"/>ſome glimmerings of day light. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, at the ſame time, another priſoner to look after me during my ſickneſs, which, very happily, was not of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Being recovered, I was again taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inquiſitors, who aſked me ſeveral new queſtions with regard to the ſecrets of Maſonry; <q>and whether, ſince my abode in Liſbon, I had received any Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze into the ſociety?'—I replied, 'that I had not: that it was true, indeed, that Don Emanuel de Souſa, Lord of Callia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and captain of the German Guards, hearing that the perſon was at Liſbon, who had made the Duke de Villeroy a Free-Maſon by order of the French king Lewis XV. Don Emanuel had deſired Mr. de Chavigny, at that time miniſter of France at the Portugueze court, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for me: but that, upon my being told that the king of Portugal would not permit any of his ſubjects to be Free-Maſons, I had deſired two of the brethren to wait on Mr. de Calliaris above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and acquaint him with my fears; and to aſſure him, at the ſame time, that, in caſe he could obtain the king's leave, I was ready to receive him into the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031999_0035_0FF09B4682C52AE0"/>I being reſolved not to do any thing which might draw upon me the indignation of his Portugueze majeſty: that Mr. de Calliaris having a very ſtrong deſire to enter into our ſociety, declared, that there was nothing in what I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with regard to his majeſty's prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; it being (added this nobleman) unworthy of the regal dignity, to concern itſelf with ſuch trifles. However, being certain that I ſpoke from very good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and knowing that Mr. de Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aris was a nobleman of great oeconomy: I found no other expedient, to diſengage myſelf from him, than by aſking fifty moidores for his reception; a demand which, I was perſuaded, would ſoon leſſen, or rather ſuppreſs at once, the violent deſire he might have to enter into the ſociety of Free-Maſons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this one of the Inquiſitors ſaid:— <q>That it was not only true that his Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze majeſty had forbid any of his ſubjects to be made Free-Maſons; but that there had been fixed up, five years before, upon the doors of all the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Liſbon, an order from his holineſs, ſtrictly enjoining the Portugueze in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031999_0036_0FF09B3D482A1E50"/>not to enter into this ſociety; and even excommunicated all ſuch as were then, or ſhould afterwards become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it.</q>—Here I beſought them to conſider, <q>that if I had committed any offence in practiſing Maſonry at Liſbon, it was merely through ignorance; I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſided but two years in Portugal: that, farther, the circumſtance juſt now mentioned by them, entirely deſtroyed the charge brought againſt me, viz. of my being the perſon who had introduced Free-Maſonry in Portugal.</q>—They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>that as I was one of the moſt zealous partizans of this ſociety, I could not but have heard, during my abode in Liſbon, the orders iſſued by the holy father.' I ſilenced them by 'the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon I made between myſelf and a traveller, (a foreigner) who, going to their capital city, and ſpying two roads leading to it, one of which was expreſsly forbid (upon pain of the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to ſtrangers, though without any indication or tokens being ſet up for this purpoſe; that this ſtranger, I ſay, ſhould thereby ſtrike accidentally, merely thro' ignorance, into the forbidden road.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:031999_0037_0FF09B5733859340"/>
They afterwards charged me with <q>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away Roman Catholics, of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reſiding in Liſbon.</q> I repreſented to them, <q>that Roman Catholics muſt ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be informed of the pope's injunction than I, who was a proteſtant: that I was firmly of opinion, that the ſevere orders iſſued by the Roman pontiff, had not a little prompted many to enter among the Free-Maſons: that a man, who was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a heretic, was no ways quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to win over perſons who conſidered him as ſuch: that a Free-Maſon, who profeſſed the Romiſh religion, was, I preſumed, the only man fit to ſeduce and draw away others of the ſame perſuaſion with himſelf; to get into their confidence; and remove ſucceſsfully ſuch ſcruples as might ariſe in their minds, both with regard to the injurious reports ſpread concerning Maſonry, and to the pope's excommunication; of which a vile heretic entertained an idea far different from that of the Romaniſts.</q>—They then ſent me back to my dungeon.</p>
            <p>Being again ordered to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inquiſitors, they inſiſted upon my letting them into the ſecrets of Maſonry; threatening me, in caſe I did not comply.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031999_0038_0FF09A9910397528"/>—I perſiſted, as before, <q>in refuſing to break my oath; and beſought them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to write, or give orders for writing, to his Portugueze majeſty's miniſters both at London and Paris; to know from them, whether any thing was ever done in the aſſemblies of the Free-Maſons, repugnant to decency and morality; to the dictates of the Romiſh faith; or to the obedience which every good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an owes to the injunctions of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in whoſe dominions he lives.</q> I obſerved farther, <q>that the king of France, who is the eldeſt ſon of the church, and deſpotic in his dominions, would not have bid his favourite enter into a ſociety proſcribed by mother-church; had he not been firmly perſuaded that nothing was tranſacted in their meetings, contrary to the ſtate, to religion, and to the church.</q> I afterwards referred them to Mr. Dogood, an Engliſhman, who was born a Roman Catholic and a Free-Maſon. —This gentleman had travelled with, and was greatly beloved by Don Pedro Antonio, the king's favourite; and who (I obſerved farther) <q>having ſettled a lodge in Liſbon fifteen years before, could acquaint them, in caſe he thought proper, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031999_0039_0FF09B41F3B401F8"/>and ſecrets of Maſonry.</q>—The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors commanded me to be taken back to my diſmal abode.</p>
            <p>Appearing again before them, they did not once mention the ſecrets of Maſonry; but took notice that I, in one of my exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations, had ſaid, <q>that it was a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on Free-Maſons to aſſiſt the needy;</q> upon which they aſked, <q>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had ever relieved a poor object?</q>— I named to them a lying-in woman, a Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, who being reduced to the extremes of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and hearing that the Free-Maſons were very liberal of their alms, ſhe addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed herſelf to me, and I gave her a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore. I added, <q>that the convent of the Franciſcans having been burnt down, the fathers made a gathering; and I gave them, upon the exchange, three quarters of a moidore.</q> I declared farther, <q>that a poor Roman Catholic, who had a large family, and could get no work; being in the utmoſt diſtreſs, had been recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to me, by ſome Free-Maſons; with a requeſt that we would make a purſe, among ourſelves, in order to ſet him up again, and thereby enable him to ſupport his family: that accordingly we raiſed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031999_0040_0FF09B814CE14978"/>among ſeven of us who were Free-Maſons, ten moidores; which money I myſelf put into his hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They then aſked me, <q>whether I had given my own money in alms?' I replied, that theſe aroſe from the forfeits of ſuch Free-Maſons as had not attended proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meetings of the brotherhood.' What are the faults (ſaid they) committed by your Brother-Maſons, which occaſion their being fined? Thoſe who take the name of God in vain, pay the quarter of a moidore; ſuch as utter any other oath, or pronounce obſcene words, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeit a new cruſade;<note n="*" place="bottom">A new cruſade is 2 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> ſterling.</note> all who are turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or refuſe to obey the orders of the maſter of the lodge, are likewiſe fined.</q> They remanded me back to my dungeon, having firſt enquired the name and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral perſons hinted at a little higher; on which occaſion I aſſured them, <q>that the laſt mentioned was not a Free-Maſon; and that the Brethren aſſiſted, indiſcriminately, all ſorts of people, provided they were real objects of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:031999_0041_0FF09B2A4672C990"/>
I naturally concluded, from the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Inquiſitors, at my being brought before them four days after, that they had enquired into the truth of the ſeveral particulars related before. They now did not ſay a word concerning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry, but began to work with different engines.</p>
            <p>They then employed all the powers of their rhetoric to prove, <q>that it became me to conſider my impriſonment, by order of the holy office, as an effect of the goodneſs of God; who (added they) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring me to a ſerious way of thinking; and, by this means, lead me into the paths of truth, in order that I might labour efficaciouſly at the ſalvation of my ſoul. That I ought to know that Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid to St. Peter; <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">St. Matthew.</note> whence it was my duty to obey the injunctions of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he being St. Peter's ſucceſſor.</q>— I replied with ſpirit and reſolution, <q>that I did not acknowledge the Roman pontiff, either as ſucceſſor to St. Peter, or as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031999_0042_0FF09B07552F0110"/>infallible: that I relied entirely, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to doctrine, on the Holy ſcriptures, theſe being the ſole guide of our faith: I beſought them to let me enjoy, undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the privileges allowed the Engliſh in Portugal: that I was reſolved to live and die in the communion of the church of England: and that therefore all the pains they might take to make a convert of me, would be ineffectual.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the repeated declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by me, that I would never change my religion, the Inquiſitors were as urgent as ever. Encouraged by the apoſtacy of one of my Brother-Maſons, they flattered themſelves with the hopes of prevailing on me to imitate him; and, for this purpoſe, offered to ſend ſome Engliſh friars to me, who (they ſaid) would inſtruct me; and ſo fully open my eyes, that I ſhould have a diſtinct view of my wretched condition, which (they declared) was the more deplorable, as I was now wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of its danger.</p>
            <p>Finding me ſtill immoveable, and that there was no poſſibility of their making the leaſt impreſſion on me; the indulgence which they ſeemed to ſhow at the beginning of my examination, was ſuddenly changed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031999_0043_0FF09AE6DCF9FFD0"/>to fury; they venting the moſt injurious expreſſions; <q>calling me heretic, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was damned.</q> Here I could not forbear replying, <q>that I was no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; but would prove, on the contrary, that they themſelves were in an error.</q> and now, raiſing their voice; <q>take care (cried they, with a tone of authority) what you ſay.' 'I advance nothing, (replied I) but what I am able to prove. Do you believe (continues I) that the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as found in the New Teſtament are true?</q>—They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the affirmative. <q>But what inference (ſaid they) do you draw from thence?' 'Be ſo good (adds I) as to let me have a bible, and I will inform you concerning this.</q> I then laid before them the paſſage where our Saviour ſays thus: <hi>Search the ſcriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">St. John's goſpel. v. 39.</note>. Likewiſe the following: <hi>We alſo have a more ſure word of propheſy; whereunto ye do well that you take heed *;</hi> 
               <q>and yet (ſays I) both the pope and your lordſhips forbid the peruſal of them; and thereby act in direct oppoſition to the<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Epiſt. St. Peter, i. 19.</note>

To this the Inquiſitors replied, that I ought to call to mind, 'that our Saviour ſays to St. Peter, (and in his name, to all the popes his ſucceſſors) <hi>I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">St. Mathew, xvi. 19.</note>. 'That none but a heretic, like myſelf, would dare to diſpute the authority and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the pope, who is Chriſt's vicar here below: that the reaſon of not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the peruſal of this book was, to to prevent the common people from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the obſcure paſſages contained therein, contrary to their true ſenſe; as was daily the practice of ſchiſmatics and heretics like myſelf.</q> I ſhall omit the other controverſial points that afterwards occurred, all which I anſwered to the beſt of my ſlender abilities.</p>
            <p>One thing I can aſſure my reader is, that the Inquiſitors were not able to alter, in any manner, the firm reſolution I had taken, to live and die a proteſtant: on the contrary, I can affirm, that their remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031999_0045_0FF09ADBEA676860"/>and even menaces, ſerved only to ſtrengthen my reſiſtance; and furniſh me abundant proofs to refute, with vigour, all the arguments offered by them.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, that I owe this wholly to the divine goodneſs, which graciouſly condeſcended to ſupport me under theſe violent trials, and enabled me to perſevere to the end; for this I return unfeigned thanks to the Almighty; and hope to give, during the remainder of my life, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing teſtimonies of the ſtrong impreſſion which thoſe trials made on my mind, by devoting myſelf ſincerely to the duties of religion.</p>
            <p>I was ordered back, by the Inquiſitors, to my diſmal abode; after they had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me, <q>that if I turned Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic, it would be of great advantage to my cauſe; otherwiſe that I perhaps might repent of my obſtinacy when it was too late.</q> I replied, in a reſpectful manner, that I could not accept of their offers.</p>
            <p>A few days after, I was again brought before the preſident of the holy office, who ſaid, <q>that the proctor would read, in preſence of the court, the heads of the indictment or charge brought againſt me.</q> The Inquiſitors now offered me a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031999_0046_0FF09AD45FD0A740"/>in caſe I deſired one, to plead my cauſe.</p>
            <p>Being ſenſible that the perſon whom they would ſend me for this purpoſe, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Inquiſitor, I choſe rather to make my own defence, in the beſt manner I could. <q>I therefore deſired that leave might be granted me to deliver my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in writing;</q> but this they refuſed, ſaying, <q>that the holy office did not allow  priſoners the uſe of pen, ink, and paper.</q> I then begged they would permit me to dictate my juſtification, in their preſence, to any perſon whom they ſhould appoint; which favour was granted to me.</p>
            <p>The heads of the charge or indictment brought againſt me, were; '<hi>That I had infringed the pope's orders, by my belonging to the ſect of the Free-Maſons; this ſect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horrid compound of ſacrilege, ſodomy, and many other abominable crimes: of which the inviolable ſecrecy obſerved therein, and the excluſion of women, were but too manifeſt indications: a circumſtance that gave the higheſt offence to the whole kingdom: and the ſaid Couſtos having refuſed to diſcover, to the Inquiſitors, the true tendency <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors then gave me the above heads, ordering me to ſign them, which I abſolutely refuſed. They thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to be taken back to my dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, without permitting me to ſay a ſingle word in my juſtification.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I was remanded back to my uſual ſcene of woe, without being able to gueſs what impreſſion my defence might have made on my judges. A few days after I was brought before his eminence Cardinal da Cunha, Inquiſitor and director general of all the Inquiſitions dependent on the Portugueze monarchy.</p>
            <p>The preſident, directing himſelf to me, declared, <q>that the holy tribunal was aſſembled, purpoſely to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my cauſe: that I therefore ſhould examine my own m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd; and ſee whether I had no other arguments to offer in my juſtification.'—I replied, 'that I had none; but relied wholly on their rectitude and equity,</q> Having ſpoke theſe words, they ſent me back to my ſad abode, and judged me among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the preſident ſent for me again; when being brought before him, he ordered a paper, containing part of my ſentence, to be read. I thereby was doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer the tortures employed by the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031999_0054_0FF09B677ACDBDD0"/>holy office, for refuſing to tell the truth, (as they falſely affirmed;) for my not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecrets of Maſonry, with the true tendency and purpoſe of the meetings of the Brethren.</p>
            <p>I hereupon was inſtantly conveyed to the torture-room, built in form of a ſquare tower, where no light appeared, but what two candles gave: and to prevent the dreadful cries and ſhocking groans of the unhappy victims from reaching the ears of the other priſoners, the doors are lined with a ſort of quilt.</p>
            <p>The reader will naturally ſuppoſe that I muſt be ſeized with horror, when, at my entering this infernal place, I ſaw myſelf, on a ſudden, ſurrounded by ſix wretches, who, after preparing the tortures, ſtripped me naked, (all to linen drawers); when, laying me on my back, they began to lay hold of every part of my body. Firſt, they put round my neck an iron collar, which was faſtened to the ſcaffold; they then fixed a ring to each foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and this being done, they ſtretched my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mbs with all their might. They next wound two ropes round each arm, and two round each thigh, which ropes paſſed under the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, through holes made for that purpoſe
<pb facs="unknown:031999_0055_0FF09B6A341AAF20"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:031999_0056_0FF09B54AB29A6F0"/>and were all drawn tight, at the ſame time, by four men, upon a ſignal made for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The reader will believe that my pains muſt be intolerable, when I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that theſe ropes, which were of the ſize of one's little finger, pierced through my fleſh quite to the bone; making the blood guſh out at the eight different places that were thus bound. As I perſiſted in refuſing to diſcover any more than what has been ſeen in the interrogatories above; the ropes were thus drawn together four different times. At my ſide ſtood a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and a ſurgeon, who often felt my temples, to judge of the danger I might be in; by which means my tortures were ſuſpended, at intervals, that I might have an opportunity of recovering myſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was thus ſuffering they were ſo barbarouſly unjuſt as to declare, that, were I to die under the torture, I ſhould be guilty, by my obſtinacy, of ſelf-murder. In fine, the laſt time the ropes were drawn tight, I grew ſo exceedingly weak, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the bloods circulation being ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the pains I endured, that I fainted quite away; inſomuch that I was carried
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031999_0057_0FF09B6C99E23C68"/>back to my dungeon, without my once perceiving it.</p>
            <p>Theſe barbarians finding that the tortures above deſcribed could not extort any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery from me; but that, the more they made me ſuffer, the more fervently I addreſſed my ſupplications, for patience, to heaven; they were ſo inhuman, ſix weeks after, as to expoſe me to another kind of torture, more grievous, if poſſible, than the former. They made me ſtretch my arms in ſuch a manner, that the palms of my hands were turned outward; when, by the help of a rope that faſtened them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the wriſt, and which they turned by an engine; they drew them gently nearer to one another behind, in ſuch a manner that the back of each hand touched, and ſtood exactly parallel one to the other; whereby both my ſhoulders were diſlocated, and a conſiderable quantity of blood iſſued from my mouth. This torture was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated thrice; after which I was again taken to my dungeon, and put into the hands of phyſicians and ſurgeons, who, in ſetting my bones, put me to exquiſite pain.</p>
            <p>Two months after, being a little recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I was again conveyed to the torture
<pb facs="unknown:031999_0058_0FF09B6E3358BAC8"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:031999_0059_0FF09B7335652C98"/>room; and there made to undergo another kind of puniſhment twice. The reader may judge of its horror, from the following deſcription thereof.</p>
            <p>The torturers turned twice round my body a thick iron chain, which, croſſing upon my ſtomach, terminated afterwards at my wriſts. They next ſet my back againſt a thick board, at each extremity whereof was a pulley, thro' which there run a rope, that catched the ends of the chains at my wriſts. The tormentors then ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ropes, by means of a roller, preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or bruiſed my ſtomach, in proportion as the ropes were drawn tighter. They tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me on this occaſion, to ſuch a degree, that my wriſts and ſhoulders were put out of joint.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeons, however, ſet them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after; but the barbarians not having yet ſatiated their cruelty, made me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go this torture a ſecond time, which I did with freſh pains, though with equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and reſolution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have but too much reaſon to fear, that I ſhall feel the ſad effects of this cruelty ſo long as I live; I being ſeized from time to time with thrilling pains, with which I never was afflicted, till I had the misfortune to fall into the mercileſs and bloody hands of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors.</p>

            <p>As I had ſuffered greatly in my body, by the tortures inflicted on me in the priſon of the Inquiſition, of which the reader has ſeen a very imperfect, though faithful nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, in the foregoing ſheets; I was quite unfit to go about the painful labour that was immediately allotted me, viz. the carrying water (an hundred pounds weight) to the priſons of the city. But the fears I was under, of being expoſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity of the guards or overſeers who accompany the galley ſlaves, cauſed me to exert myſelf ſo far beyond my ſtrength, that, twelve days after, I fell grievouſly ſick. I then was ſent to the Infirmary, where I continued two months. During my abode in this place, I was often viſited by the Iriſh friars belonging to the convent of Corpo Santo, who offered to get my
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031999_0063_0FF09B00A4A1D2A8"/>releaſe, provided I would turn Roman Catholic. I aſſured them, that all their endeavours would be fruitleſs; I expecting my enlargement from the Almighty alone, who, if He, in his profound wiſdom thought proper, would point out other expedients for my obtaining it, than my becoming an apoſtate.</p>
            <p>Being unable, after this, to go through the toils to which I had been ſentenced, I was excuſed, by my amply rewarding the overſeers. It was now that I had full leiſure, to reflect ſeriouſly on the means of obtaining my liberty; and, for this purpoſe, deſired a friend to write to my brother-in-law, Mr. Barbu, to inform him of my deplorable ſtate; and to intreat him, humbly to addreſs the Earl of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington, in my favour; my brother-in-law having the honour to live in his lordſhip's family. This nobleman, whoſe humanity and generoſity have been the theme of infinitely abler pens than mine, was ſo good as to declare, that he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure my freedom. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his lordſhip ſpoke to his grace the duke of Newcaſtle, one of the principal ſecretaries of ſtate; in order to ſupplicate 'for leave, from our Sovereign, that his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031999_0064_0FF09B3F9BB16E88"/>miniſter at Liſbon might demand me, as a ſubject of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, ever attentive to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of his ſubjects, and deſirous of relieving them in all their misfortunes, was ſo gracious as to interpoſe in my favour. Accordingly his commands being diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mr. Compton, the Britiſh miniſter at Liſbon, that gentleman demanded my liberty of the king of Portugal, in his Britannic majeſty's name; which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I obtained the latter end of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1744. The perſon who came and freed me from the galley, by order of the Inquiſitors, took me before them. The preſident then told me, that Cardinal da Cunha had given orders for my being releaſed. At the ſame time, he bid me return to the holy office in three or four days.</p>
            <p>I could perceive, during this interval, that I was followed by the ſpies of the Inquiſition, who kept a watchful eye over my behaviour, and the places I frequented I waited upon our envoy, as likewiſe upon our conſul, whom I informed of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which had been laid upon me at the Inquiſition; and thoſe gentlemen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to obey them. They cautioned
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031999_0065_0FF097D368B11958"/>me, however, to take a friend with me, in order to give them notice in caſe I ſhould be ſeized again. I accordingly returned to the Inquiſitors five days after, when the preſident declared; <q>that the tribunal would not permit me to continue any longer in Portugal; and therefore that I muſt name the city and kingdom whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I intended to retire.'—' As my family, (replied I) is now in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I deſign to go thither as ſoon as poſſible.</q> They then bid me embark in the firſt ſhip that ſhould ſail for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; adding, that the inſtant I had found one, I muſt inform them of the day and hour I intended to go on board, together with the captain's name, and that of his ſhip.</p>
            <p>A report prevailed ſome days after, that one of the perſons ſeized by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for Free-Maſonry, and who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his liberty by turning Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, had been ſo indiſcreet as to divulge the cruelties exerciſed in this tribunal.</p>
            <p>I now imagined that prudence required me to ſecure myſelf from a ſecond perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. As there was, at this time, no Engliſh ſhip in the port of Liſbon, I wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Mr. Vantil, the reſident of Her
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031999_0066_0FF09AF8CB083FD0"/>and beſought him to ſpeak to the Dutch admiral to admit me on board his fleet. The reſident, touched with my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, hinted my requeſt to the admiral, who generouſly complied with it. I then went, together with a friend, and informed the Inquiſitor, that I deſigned to embark for England, in the Damietta, commanded by vice admiral Cornelius Sereiver, who was to ſail in a few days. Upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor's enquiring the exact time when I intended to go on board; I replied, at nine o'clock the next morning. He then bid me come to him preciſely at that hour; adding, that he would ſend ſome officers of the Inquiſition to ſee me on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
            <p>Theſe orders giving me great uneaſineſs, I waited upon the ſeveral gentlemen above mentioned; when telling them the injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid upon me, they adviſed me to act very cautiouſly on this occaſion. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it would be ſafeſt for me to go on board immediately, without giving any notice of it to the Inquiſitors. We lay at anchor, after this, near three weeks before Liſbon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:031999_0067_0FF09ACC379B65B8"/>
The Inquiſitor no ſooner found that I failed coming to him at the time appointed, in order to be conducted to the ſhip, than he ſent out about thirty ſpies. Nine of theſe coming to enquire after me, at the houſe where I uſed to lodge, ſearched it from top to bottom; examining every trunk, cheſt of drawers and cloſet. But their endeavours to find me being fruitleſs, ſome officers of the Inquiſition getting into a boat, rowed ſeveral times round the three Dutch men of war lying at anchor: Theſe officers imagined, that if I was on board, and conſequently in a place of ſecurity, I ſhould not be afraid of ſhowing myſelf; a circumſtance that would have put an end to their ſearch, which coſt them ſome pains and expence. As I did not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their curioſity, and we weighed anchor a few days after, I know not whether they continued it.</p>
            <p>Their ſearch was ſo open, both at the houſe where I lodged, as well as at other places, that I was ſoon informed of it; at which I ſhould have been delighted, had not my joy been damped by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I was under, left my dear friend, Mr. Mouton, the companion of my ſufferings and tortures, merely on account of Free-Maſonry,

Speaking concerning him to the admiral, he, with the utmoſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, gave me leave to ſend for him on board. He coming accordingly next day, was received, with great ſatisfaction, by the whole ſhip's company, eſpecially by myſelf, I having a peculiar eſteem for him, which I ſhall ever entertain.</p>
            <p>We ſet ſail two days after. We had occaſion to obſerve, during our whole voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the true pleaſure which a generous mind feels, in doing a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mane action, and in protecting the unhappy. This was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſpicuous in the admiral, he ordering the utmoſt care to be taken of us, all the time we were on board his ſhip; he ſometimes condeſcending to admit us to his table, when he would talk to us with the utmoſt familiarity. This diſtinction won us the civility of every perſon in the ſhip, which continued till our arrival at Portſmouth, where we landed; without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been put to a farthing expence during the whole voyage.</p>
            <p>All theſe favours, ſo generouſly beſtowed by the admiral, call aloud for the ſtrongeſt acknowledgments of gratitude.</p>

To conclude, I arrived in London the 15th of December 1744, after a long and dangerous voyage.</p>
            <p>I here return thanks, with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of my ſoul, to the Almighty, for his having ſo viſibly protected me from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal band of friars, who employed the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tortures mentioned in the former pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in order to force me to apoſtatize from my holy religion.</p>

            <head>ORIGIN OF THE INQUISITION, AND <hi>Its</hi> ESTABLISHMENT <hi>in various Countries.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Roman pontiffs employed every expedient, and ſet every engine at work (among which none has ſerved their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe better than religion) in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their authority. Pretending to be the ſucceſſors of St. Peter, they aſcribed to themſelves characteriſtics of holineſs ſuperior even to that of the apoſtles; and were ſo extravagant as even to boaſt their being infallible. Monarchs, infatuated with this pretended ſanctity of the popes, whom they conſidered as deities upon earth, and diſpenſers of celeſtial bleſſings; ſtrove to rival one another in beſtowing territories, &amp;c. upon theſe pontiffs, in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031999_0071_0FF09B128ED1EE18"/>hopes of obtaining their favour; adding ſuch extenſive privileges, that theſe pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs became, at laſt, the arbiters of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads, who did not diſcover, till it was too late, that they themſelves were become ſlaves to the papal authority.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe princes being oppreſſed with the weight of their chains, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of throwing them off, reſiſted the will of the holy father, and thereupon were declared heretics, and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nor did theſe popes ſtop here; for, if theſe kings perſiſted in their obſtinacy, they were dethroned, and their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given to others, who readily offered to pay the obedience claimed by the ſee of Rome.</p>
            <p>The emperors, jealous to ſee the Roman pontiffs, and their adherents, extend their authority ſo far beyond its juſt limits; did all that lay in their power to reſtrain and reduce it within narrower bounds. About the middle of the XIth. century, there broke out violent conteſts between them, which raged above fifty years.</p>
            <p>The emperors and popes being thus exaſperated againſt each other, no longer acted in concert, in order to ſuppreſs hereſy; ſo that theſe commotions gave
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031999_0072_0FF09AB0101E6378"/>occaſion to the ſtarting up of ſeveral new hereſiarchs. Hitherto the latter had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only the myſteries; but now, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the myſteries, they attacked morality and diſcipline, and eſpecially the papal authority. This was more than ſufficient to open the eyes of the court of Rome, with regard to the danger which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it, in caſe a ſpeedy remedy ſhould not be found, in order to check theſe heretics, before the contagion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come general; under favour of the diſputes ſubſiſting between the emperor and the pope.</p>
            <p>But as theſe heretics, or rather enemies of the pontifical authority of Rome, were exceedingly numerous; not to mention their being ſupported, clandeſtinely, by kings; the popes were forced, at firſt, to wink at, and even tolerate thoſe heretics, till ſuch time as an opportunity might offer, for ſuppreſſing, or rather rooting them out. For this reaſon, the Roman pontiffs now contented themſelves with writing often to the princes, magiſtrates and biſhops; exhorting them to exert their utmoſt endeavours, in order to extirpate the enemies of the ſee of Rome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, princes and magiſtrates took little
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031999_0073_0FF09A9E7A2CEDD8"/>pains to check them; whether it were that they did not care to ſacrifice a ſet of people who were of ſo much uſe to them, in order for reſtraining the papal authority, and increaſing their own; or, whether they did not think them ſo criminal as the popes pretended; or whether politics, which often vary according to times and intereſts, cauſed them to conſider theſe heretics as perſons whom it was incumbent on them to tolerate, for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>The biſhops, either through indolence, or becauſe they were not ſtrong enough to oppoſe the ſtream, were equally unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whereby heretics became ſo powerful, that, at length, they were able to make head againſt the ſee of Rome.</p>
            <p>The Arnaldiſts,<note n="*" place="bottom">So called from Arnaldus of Breſcia, an heretic in the twelfth century. He inveighed againſt the temporalities of the church; and even againſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's ſupper. This hereſiarch, after exciting many troubles in Breſcia and Rome, was hanged in the latter city, anno 1155, and his aſhes thrown into the Tiber. The followers of Anthony Arnauld (the Janſeniſts) were alſo named Arnaldiſts.</note> who were among theſe, reduced the popes to the greateſt diſtreſſes;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031999_0074_0FF09B0231F50060"/>they forcing them, more than once, to quit Rome, and to ſeek an aſylum elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in order to ſecure themſelves from their fury.</p>
            <p>The Waldenſes and Albigenſes, (people of France) riſing up after them, were no leſs enemies to the authority uſurped by the Roman pontiff, nor leſs zealous in attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: and the protection indulged thoſe people by Raymond Count de Toulouſe, and by Counts de Foix and de Comminges, cauſed them to be ſtill more enterpriſing and more formidable.</p>
            <p>Pope Innocent III. a man of great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and fortunate in his enterprizes, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſign of promulgating a cruſade<note n="*" place="bottom">The cruſades were military expeditions, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt the infidels, and firſt preached by Peter the hermit. Though the glory of God was the pretended motive for them; yet many wert merely out of venal views, and others through fear of being reproached with cowardice. Such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to enliſt among the cruſaders, diſtinguiſhed themſelves, from other people, by wearing croſſes of different colours, on their clothes, according to their nation: the croſſes of the Engliſh being white; of the French, red; of the Germans, black. &amp;c. Eight cruſades were undertaken for the conqueſt of the Holy Land; the firſt anno 1095, in the council of Clermont; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A hiſtory, in French, of the cruſade againſt the Albigenſes, was publiſhed at Roan, in 1703. About the middle of the 12th century, a cruſade of Saxons was eſtabliſhed againſt the heathens of the north.— Religion was as much a faſhion, in theſe dark times, as clothes, &amp;c.</note>

For this purpoſe, he ſent into Languedoc, miſſionaries, at whoſe head were Dominic, a native of Old Caſtle, who had lately founded an order of friars, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from his name; together with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Peter of Chateauneuf (as he is termed by the Romaniſts) who was butchered at Toulouſe, anno 1200. And now the pope, reſolving to employ temporal weapons againſt them, publiſhed a cruſade, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indulgences were granted to all ſuch as ſhould take up arms, or furniſh monies, &amp;c. for aſſiſting this enterprize againſt the Mahommedans; for thus he called thoſe people, to enflame ſtill more the cruſaders againſt them.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Innocent having been a famous lawyer, he, by a quirk, pronounced theſe heretics to be Mahommedans, viz. becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On this occaſion ſeveral cities were taken, and the moſt ſhocking cruelties practiſed; numberleſs multitudes of the inhabitants being put to the ſword, without diſtinction of age or ſex. Counts de Foix, de Comminges, and de Beziers, afterwards followed the example of Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund. Count Simon de Montfort, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the church, ſignalized himſelf but too much at the head of theſe cruſaders.</p>
            <p>The origin of the Inquiſition is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, by Fleury, in his eccleſiaſtical hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. <q>In 1198, Innocent III. ſent into the ſouthern provinces of France, two Ciſtercian monks, Reinier and Gui, to convert the Manichees, with which thoſe parts ſwarmed; to excommunicate the obſtinate; and to command the lords to conſiſcate the poſſeſſions of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; to baniſh them, and puniſh them with ſeverity: impowering, at the ſame time, Reinier to force the lords likewiſe; to excommunicate them, and put their lands under ſequeſtration.—
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031999_0077_0FF09B1ED60FF300"/>Theſe commiſſioners, thus ſent againſt the heretics, were afterwards called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors.</q> The Jeſuits of Trevoux obſerve, that <q>the council of Narbonne, held in 1235, and that of Beziers in 1246, gave the Dominicans (Inquiſitors) in the provinces of Arles, of Aix, of Embrum, and Vienne, a rule or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, conſiſting of thirty-ſeven articles; and theſe were the baſis of the procedures which have been obſerved, ſince that time, in the tribunals of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some imagine, that they find the origin of the Inquiſition, in a conſtitution made by pope Lucius, in the council of Verona, anno 1184; becauſe that he commands biſhops to examine perſonally, or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, people ſuſpected, of hereſy; diſtinguiſhes the various degrees of perſons ſuſpected, convicted, penitent, or relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for all whom different puniſhments are enacted; and that, after the church has employed, againſt criminals, ſpiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, it delivers them over to the ſecular arm, in order for corporeal puniſhments to be inflicted on them; experience having ſhown, (ſays my Romiſh author) that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chriſtians, and particularly the new
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031999_0078_0FF09B2EF56D2790"/>heretics of this age, little regarded eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſures, and deſpiſed theſe ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual puniſhments. What bleſſed times were theſe, when ignorance, ſuperſtition, and tyranny ſwayed the earth!</p>

               <head>Dawn of the <hi>INQUISITION</hi> in <hi>FRANCE,</hi> with the farther conteſts between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Popes.</head>
               <p>THIS open war againſt the Albigenſes and Waldenſes, was followed by the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of the Inquiſition, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the deſtruction of the unhappy people in queſtion. It had been founded, a little before, by pope Innocent III. under the direction of Dominic, upon whom the title of ſaint was beſtowed.</p>
               <p>This pope, reflecting that, what open force ſoever might be exerted againſt them, ſtill vaſt numbers would carry on their worſhip in private, thought it neceſſary to eſtabliſh a ſtanding and perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; that is, a tribunal compoſed of men, whoſe ſole occupation ſhould be the ſearching after, and puniſhing heretics.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031999_0079_0FF09B16459F3D50"/>This tribunal was named, 'The Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,' and Dominic was the firſt Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor.</p>
               <p>Dominic having been ſent, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to Toulouſe, to convert the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, took up his reſidence at the houſe of a nobleman of this city, infected with hereſy. However, our miſſionary found means to bring him back to the church; after which the nobleman devoted his houſe, with his family, to St. Dominic and his order. The tribunal of the Inquiſition was eſtabliſhed in this place, which is ſtill called, 'The houſe of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.'</p>
               <p>It may hence be concluded, that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic was the firſt Inquiſitor, and Toulouſe the firſt city where the Inquiſition was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Some ſay that this was in 1208, and others in 1212, or 1215; but whichſoever may be the true aera, is of no great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>Theſe Inquiſitors had, at firſt no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tribunal, their function being only to enquire or ſearch after heretics (whence the former received their name;) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into their number, ſtrength and riches; which being done, they made a report thereof to the biſhops, who, as yet,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031999_0080_0FF09AE89CE3A910"/>were the only perſons authorized to take cognizance of ſpiritual matters. On theſe occaſions, the Inquiſitors uſed to urge the prelates to excommunicate and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all heretics who ſhould be impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>Pope Innocent being wholly diſſatisfied with the indolence of the biſhops, and their officials (judges) whoſe zeal he thought much too lukewarm againſt heretics; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he perceived, in the Dominican and Franciſcan friars, whoſe orders were but lately founded, all the qualities requiſite for directing this new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The monks of thoſe orders were fired with an implicit and boundleſs zeal for the court of Rome, and wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its intereſts. They had full leiſure to purſue that glorious work, as this would be their only buſineſs. They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the dregs of the people; and had no kindred, as it were, or any other tie which might check the rigours of this tribunal; they were ſevere and inflexible; the ſolitude and auſtere life profeſſed by them, and of which they ſeemed already tired; the meanneſs of their dreſs and monaſteries, ſo widely different from their preſent ſtate; and eſpecially the humility
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031999_0081_0FF09B24730D7928"/>and mendicant life to which they, perhaps, had too heedleſsly devoted themſelves; theſe things, I ſay, rendered them exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fit for the office in queſtion, which, (in the opinion of the pontiffs) would ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the aſperity of their vows, and ſooth their ambition, ſome ſeeds whereof were ſtill left in their minds. The Roman pope having thus made ſure of a ſet of people, ſo firmly devoted to his ſervice, and ſo admirably well qualified to exerciſe an employment, whoſe chief characteriſtics are extreme ſeverity and cruelty; ſought for every opportunity to encreaſe their authority, by appointing them a particular tribunal, where they were to ſit, hear, and pronounce ſentence againſt hereſies and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, as judges delegated by him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting his perſon.</p>
               <p>This pope firſt enlarged their authority, by empowering them to beſtow indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, to publiſh cruſades, and to excite nations and princes to join the cruſaders, and march forth in order to extirpate hereſy.</p>
               <p>In 1244, the emperor Frederic II. increaſed their power much more, by publiſhing four edicts in Pavia. He therein declared himſelf protector of the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031999_0082_0FF09AF70F376E78"/>Inquiſitors; decreed, that the clergy ſhould take cognizance of hereſy, and the lay judges proſecute heretics, after that the former had heard them. He likewiſe enacted, that all obſtinate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics ſhould be burnt; and ſuch as repented, impriſoned for life. The reaſon why Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric teſtified ſo much zeal for the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion was, in order to deſtroy the report which the popes, with whom he had been engaged in violent conteſts, ſpread, throughout all the courts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom, viz. that he intended to renounce the Chriſtian religion, and turn Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan. This, very probably, induced him to exert himſelf with greater ſeverity againſt the heretics, than any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; he being the firſt emperor who ſentenced to death all heretics without diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Here follows what other authors ſay, concerning the riſe of the Inquiſition in France. Du Cange tells us, that the Inquiſitors were eſtabliſhed in this country about the year 1229, againſt the Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the council of Toulouſe; which Inquiſitors were choſen from among the Dominicans; and ſome were appointed under Francis I. againſt the Lutherans;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031999_0083_0FF09B1852814630"/>and eſtabliſhed, by a bull of pope Clement VII. in 1225. Though the tribunal of the Inquiſition was never ſettled in France, after the ſame manner as in Spain and Italy, yet Inquiſitors were delegated to France, during many years, by the pope; to preſerve the purity of doctrine, and keep the people obedient to the church. Twelve years after the death of St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic, pope Gregory IX. named two friars of the ſame order, anno 1233, to exerciſe the like functions; and this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical commiſſion was perpetuated, not only in the convent of Toulouſe, but extended to ſeveral other convents in the kingdom. One of the commiſſioners, nominated in the cauſe of the Templars, was the Inquiſitor general in France. We find by <hi>l'hiſtoire de la Pucelle d'Orleans</hi> [the maid of Orleans] that, anno 1430, John Magiſtri, vicegerent [ſubſtitute] of John Goverant, Inquiſitor of the faith, was one of her judges; that 35 years after, John Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hal (who was an Inquiſitor) and ſome prelates, deputed by pope Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus, declared her innocent. It does not appear that there were, from this time till the reign of Francis I. any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors (of this ſort) in France; whether
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031999_0084_0FF09ACEB82FB678"/>it were that the popes did not think them neceſſary, in an age when errors were in a great meaſure rooted up; or that the then reigning princes, being more jealous of the regal authority than their predeceſſors, would not ſuffer any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement (as this ſeemed to be) of the liberties of the Gallican church. See father Bouhours' life of St. Ignatius, Book II. This author obſerves farther, that, under Francis I. Matthew Ori, was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by pope Clement VII. to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Inquiſitor, on occaſion of the hereſies of Germany.—There are now no footſteps of the Inquiſition left in France, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Inquiſition would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into this kingdom under Francis II. had not the excellent Mighel de l'Hoſpital, chancellor of France, ſtrongly oppoſed that deſign. <q>When the paſſing the edict of the Inquiſition of Spain came before Chancellor de l'Hoſpital; as he knew that the members of the privy council and the parliaments had conſented to it, he drew up another
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031999_0085_0FF09B4F27EC7968"/>edict, in which he tempered matters ſo happily, and gave ſuch excellent reaſons for this, that even the Guiſes, though ſtrong advocates for the tribunal in queſtion, approved his opinion; and even brought over the Spaniſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the ſame way of thinking, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that theſe were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that France ſhould be modelled and governed as Spain was.</q> This was done in May, 1560, in the town of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morantin.<note n="*" place="bottom">La Planche, Hiſtoire de Francois II. p. 36.</note>

               <p>The conduct of the Inquiſitors, were circumſtances which ſtrongly induced the republic of Venice to refuſe admiſſion to that tribunal in its territories. The only topic of diſcourſe, in all places, was the diſorders and ſeditions cauſed by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as well as the imprudent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Inquiſitors: for theſe zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots would, upon any caprice, publiſh cruſades againſt the heretics; when the cruſaders in queſtion, who had been drawn together on a ſudden, inſtead of aſſiſting the cauſe of religion, only revenged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their enemies; and ſeized the poſſeſſions of a numberleſs multitude of innocent perſons, upon the falſe pretence
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031999_0087_0FF09B799E18D580"/>of their being heretics. Milan and Parma were very near ruined by the ſeditions raiſed in them on theſe occaſions; and nothing was heard, all over Italy, but bitter complaints againſt the Inquiſition and the Inquiſitors. The ſenate of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, who underſtood their intereſt as well as any body of men in the world, took advantage of the diſorders above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to juſtify their conſtant refuſal of this tribunal.</p>
               <p>However, pope Nicholas IV. being no ways diſheartened at all the fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts made by his predeceſſors, renewed them; when the ſenate perceiving that they, in caſe they perſiſted in their refuſal, would, at laſt, be forced to admit an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition dependant on that of Rome: they eſtabliſhed one by their own authority, compoſed of both eccleſiaſtical and lay judges. This Inquiſition has its own laws, which differ from thoſe of the tribunals of this kind ſettled in Italy, and is far leſs rigorous. The utmoſt precautions were taken by thoſe who eſtabliſhed this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to prevent ſuch diſorders as had broke out in all other places where it had been admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:031999_0088_0FF09AC0C8E3C990"/>
The ſenate having thus taken the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to admit the Inquiſition, an act or inſtrument for that purpoſe, was drawn up the 4th of Aug. 1289, in the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic manner, and ſent to the pope. Though the pontiff was not pleaſed with the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications introduced by the ſenate, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs expreſſed, in outward ſhow, his approbation of the inſtrument preſented to him; and ratified it by a bull dated the 28th of Auguſt above-mentioned; in hopes that the Venetians might afterwards be prevailed upon to comply with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the court of Rome, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they have not yet done. On the contrary, this ſage republic, ſo far from repealing the old laws, eſtabliſhes new ones, whenever it is apprehenſive that the court of Rome intends to leſſen its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by enlarging that of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How glorious it is for this republic, to ſee, in its territories, the tribunal of the Inquiſition, ſubject to the ordinances and laws which the ſenate formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and ſtill preſcribe to it; at a time that this tribunal governs and commands; in the moſt deſpotic manner, in all the other ſtates where it was received without reſtriction; and is now become the moſt
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031999_0089_0FF09AA5045494E0"/>formidable, the moſt dreadful, and moſt cruel tribunal in the univerſe; inſomuch that even kings themſelves are not ſecure from its proſecutions, at leaſt from its reſentment!</p>
               <p>With regard to the kingdom of Naples, the Inquiſition has never been received there. This was owing, at firſt, to the almoſt perpetual diſſentions which reigned between the Neapolitan kings and the Roman pontiffs. From the time that the Spaniſh monarchs have poſſeſſed that kingdom, how great a harmony ſoever might ſubſiſt between them and the court of Rome, yet things have always conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on the ſame foot, and this from a ſingular circumſtance, viz. that the popes themſelves oppoſed it; and for this reaſon, becauſe the kings of Spain inſiſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, that the Neapolitan Inquiſitors ought to be dependant on the Inquiſitor General of Spain, and not on the general Inquiſition of Rome, as the popes aſſerted. This the latter would never conſent to; and from this argument, that as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples held, of the ſee of Rome. and not of Spain; the Inquiſition ſhould conſequently hold likewiſe of the pope. But as theſe two courts were never able
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031999_0090_0FF09B7C044DFD60"/>to agree about this matter, the Neapolitan biſhops have always enjoyed the privilege of judging heretics. However the pope may, in certain caſes, depute commiſſaries to Naples, to judge of heretical matters; but this happens ſeldom or never. In 1544, Don Pedro, of. Toledo, viceroy of Naples under the emperor Charles V. endeavoured to ſettle the Inquiſition in that kingdom; but the people mutinying his deſign was defeated.</p>

               <p>THOUGH the Inquiſition had been ſtrongly oppoſed in France and Germany, it yet gained footing in Spain; the kings of Arragon admitting it into the ſeveral ſtates dependant on their crown. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were uſed, but to no purpoſe, to force it into the weſtern parts of Europe; the people oppoſing it with the utmoſt vigour, whereby it loſt a conſiderable part of its power in the kingdom of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon; till Ferdinand, king of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031999_0091_0FF09A9BEB01A8A8"/>and Iſabella of Caſtile, uniting under one monarchy, by their marriage, almoſt all the Spaniſh dominions; reſtored the tribunal in queſtion to its priſtine authority in Arragon, and afterwards in all Spain, which was not properly brought under the yoke of the Inquiſition, till about the year 1484.</p>
               <p>The court of Rome was indebted for this to John de Torquemada, a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. This friar, who was confeſſor to Iſabella, had made her promiſe, before ſhe came to the throne, that, in caſe ſhe ſhould be raiſed to it, ſhe would uſe all poſſible methods to extirpate heretics and infidels. As ſhe afterwards was queen, and brought the kingdom of Caſtile, by way of dower, to Ferdinand; they finding themſelves exceedingly powerful, reſolved to conquer the kingdom of Granada, and to drive back the Moors into Barbary. The Moors were accordingly ſubdued; and all the territories poſſeſſed by them in Spain ſeized, ſo that prodigious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them were forced to return into Africa. Nevertheleſs, great numbers ſtill continued in Spain; a circumſtance owing to their having poſſeſſions or wives in this
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031999_0092_0FF09B7EB9CF1A50"/>country, or their being ſettled in traffic there.</p>
               <p>As Ferdinand and Iſabella conſidered that, in caſe they ſhould baniſh theſe Moors from Spain, they thereby would depopulate the countries conquered by them; their majeſties conſented that they, as well as the Jews, ſhould continue in it, provided they would turn Chriſtians; upon which thoſe people, finding that all reſiſtance would be vain, embraced the Chriſtian religion, in outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>But now Torquemada aſſuring the queen, that this diſſimulation would be of infinite prejudice both to the church and ſtate, was urgent with her to perform the promiſe ſhe had made him, viz. of proſecuting the infidels and heretics as ſoon as ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſhould be ſeated on the throne. He enforced his entreaties with all the arguments which falſe politics and falſe religion could ſuggeſt; concluding, that the beſt expedient would be, to introduce and ſettle the Inquiſition under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their majeſties. In a word, the queen, after many ſolicitations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to uſe her utmoſt endeavours to get the kings conſent; which ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031999_0093_0FF09AA94E791400"/>obtaining, their majeſties demanded and procured, from pope Sixtus IV. anno 1478, bulls<note n="*" place="bottom">Bulls are properly letters, with a leaden ſeal, iſſued out of the chancery of Rome; and anſwer to the letters patent, edicts, &amp;c. publiſhed by order of temporal princes.

               <p>Torquemada had been of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervice to the ſee of Rome, that it was natural he ſhould be rewarded by it; the pope raiſing him to the purple. He afterwards was appointed by Ferdinand and Iſabella, Inquiſitor General of the whole monarchy of Spain; and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the functions of his employment, ſo much to their expectation, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, in 14 years, above 100,000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 6000 of whom were ſentenced to the flames.</p>
               <p>Matters were afterwards carried to ſuch a height, by the barbarous zeal of princes, that Philip II. king of Spain, eſtabliſhed the Inquiſition even on board of ſhips of war. This bigotted monarch, would,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031999_0094_0FF09ABDC1972E48"/>doubtleſs, have introduced it into the ſkies, had it been in his power. In 1571, he fitted out a fleet called the Invincible, commanded by Don John of Auſtria; and, as it had been found neceſſary to employ ſailors of all nations, Philip fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a mixture of religions would corrupt the Romiſh faith, conſulted pope Pius V. on this occaſion; when the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſent one of the Inquiſitors of Spain, who had been appointed by the Inquiſitor General of that monarchy, as Inquiſitor of the fleet; with power to preſide in the ſeveral tribunals; and ſolemnize Auto da Fés in all places they might put into.— The firſt Auto da Fé was held in the city of Meſſina, where various puniſhments were inflicted on many perſons.</p>

               <p>THE account of the manner in which the Inquiſition was brought into Portugal, ſeems a little fabulous; however, we ſhall give it in few words.</p>
               <p>This tribunal is ſaid to have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the artifice of John Peres de Saavedra, a native of Corduba, or Jaen, in Spain. We are told that he, having found the ſecret to counterfeit apoſtolical letters, amaſſed, by that means, about thirty thouſand ducats, which were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him in order to bring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition into Portugal, and that in manner following. He aſſumed the character of Cardinal Legate from the ſee of Rome; when forming his houſhold, of one hundred and fifty domeſtics, he was received, in the above-mentioned quality, at Seville, and very homo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eably lodged in the archiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal palace. Advancing after this, towards the frontiers of Portugal, he diſpatched one of his ſecretaries to the king, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with his arrival; and to preſent him with fictitious letters from the emperor, the king of Spain, the pope, and ſeveral
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031999_0096_0FF09B9F86FCCD98"/>other princes both eccleſiaſtical and ſecular; who all intreated his majeſty to ſavour the legate's pious deſigns. The king, overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this legation, ſent a lord of his court to compliment him, and attend him to the royal palace, where he reſided about three months. The mock legate having ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his deſigns, by laying the foundation of the Inquiſition, took leave of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and departed, greatly ſatisfied with his atchievement: but, unluckily for himſelf, he was diſcovered on the confines of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and known to have been formerly a domeſtic of a Portugueze nobleman. He was then ſeized, and ſentenced ten years to the gallies, where he continued a very long time, till, at laſt, he was releaſed from thence anno 1556, by a brief from pope Paul IV. This pontiff, who uſed to call the Inquiſition, the grand ſpring of the papacy, wanted to ſee him.</p>
               <p>We are told, that the Inquiſition of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, was copied from that of Spain, and introduced in the former, anno 1535. But Mr. de la Neuville, in his hiſtory of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, tom. I. page 59, declares, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition was introduced there anno 1557, under John III. and ſettled in the cities of Liſbon, Coimbra and Evora.</p>

               <head>Attempts made to introduce the Inquiſition into England.</head>
               <p>ENDEAVOURS were uſed to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Inquiſition here, under the reign of queen Mary, ſiſter to queen Elizabeth. <q>The juſtices of peace (ſays biſhop Burnet) were now every where ſo ſlack in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of heretics, that it ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to find out other tools. So the courts of Inquiſition were thought on. Theſe were ſet up firſt in France againſt the Albigenſes, and afterwards in Spain,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031999_0098_0FF09C118BCB68C0"/>for diſcovering the. Moors; and were now turned upon the heretics. Their power was uncontroulable; they ſeized on any thing they pleaſed, upon ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, or preſumptions as lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. They managed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in ſecret, and put their priſoners to ſuch ſorts of torture, as they thought fit for extorting confeſſions or diſcoveries from them. At this time [in 1557] both the pope and king Philip, tho' they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in other things, agreed in this, that they were the only ſure means for extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating hereſy. So, as a ſtep to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up, a commiſſion was given to Bonner, and twenty more, the greateſt part lay men, to ſearch all over England for all ſuſpected of hereſy, that did not hear maſs, go in proceſſions, or take holy bread or holy water: they were authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, three being a quorum, to proceed either by preſentments, or other politic ways: they were to deliver all they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to their ordinaries; and were to uſe all ſuch means as they could invent; which was left to their diſcretions and conſciences, for executing their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Many other commiſſions, ſubaltern
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031999_0099_0FF09C56C6D8E248"/>to theirs, were iſſued out for ſeveral counties and dioceſes. This was looked on as ſuch an advance towards an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that all concluded it would follow ere long. The burnings were carried on vigorouſly in ſome places, and but coldly in moſt parts; for the diſlike of them grew to be almoſt univerſal.</q>

               <p>We find (by biſhop Burnet) that previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the perſecution under queen Mary, hinted at above, there were conſultations concerning the methods to proceed againſt heretics. Cardinal Pool had been ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear ſome favour to them formerly, but he took great care to avoid all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of being any more blamed for this: and indeed he lived in that diſtruſt of all the Engliſh, that he opened his thoughts to very few, for his chief confidents were two Italians who came over with him, Priuli and Ormaneto. Secretary Cecil,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031999_0101_0FF09C3CB0326CB8"/>who in matters of religion complied with the preſent time, was obſerved to have more of his favour than any Engliſhman had. Pool was an enemy to all ſevere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; he thought churchmen ſhould have the tenderneſs of a father, and the care of a ſhepherd; and ought to reduce, but not devour the ſtray ſheep. He had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that cruelty rather inſlamed than cured that diſtemper. He thought the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſurer way, was to begin with an effectual reformation of the manners of the clergy, ſince it was the ſcandal given by their ill conduct and ignorance, that was the chief cauſe of the growth of hereſy; ſo he concluded, that if a primitive diſcipline ſhould be revived, the nation would, by degrees, lay down their prejudices, and might, in time, be gained by gentle methods. Gardiner, on the other hand, being of an abject and cruel temper himſelf, thought the ſtrict execution of the laws againſt the Lollards, was that to which they ought chiefly to truſt. If the preachers were made public examples, he concluded the people would be eaſily reclaimed; for he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was viſible, if king Henry had executed the act of the ſix articles vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all would have ſubmitted. He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031999_0102_0FF09BFAE244FAD0"/>a reformation of the clergy was a good thing, but all times would not bear it.—If they ſhould proceed ſeverely againſt ſcandalous churchmen, the heretics would take advantage from that, to defame the church the more, and raiſe a clamoun againſt all clergymen. The queen was for joining both theſe councils together; and intended to proceed, at the ſame time, both againſt ſcandalous churchmen and heretics.<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, ubi ſupra, 269, 270, 271.</note> In the courſe of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, endeavours were uſed, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parties, to urge the queen to continue them, and to diſſuade her from theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities. <q>At this time (ſays biſhop Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) a petition was printed beyond ſea, by which the reformers addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the queen; they ſet before her the danger of her being carried by a blind zeal, to deſtroy the members of Chriſt, as St. Paul had done before his converſion. They remembered her of Cranmer's interpoſing to preſerve her life in her father's time. They cited many paſſages out of the books of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, Bonner and Tonſtall, by which
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031999_0103_0FF09C5BD2DC3770"/>ſhe might ſee that they were not acted [actuated] by true principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but were turned as their fears or intereſt led them. They ſhowed her how contrary perſecution was to the ſpirit of the goſpel; that Chriſtians tolerated Jews; and that the Turks, notwithſtanding the barbarity of their tempers, and the cruelty of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet tolerated Chriſtians. They remembered her, that the firſt law for burning in England, was made by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry IV. as a reward to the biſhops, who had helped him to depoſe Richard II. and ſo to mount the throne. They repreſented to her, that God had truſted her with the ſword, which ſhe ought to employ for the protection of her people, and was not to abandon them to the cruelty of ſuch wolves. The petition alſo turned to the nobility, and the reſt of the nation; and the danger of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh yoke, and a bloody Inquiſition were ſet before them.—Upon this the popiſh authors writ ſeveral books in juſtification of theſe proceedings. They obſerved, that the Jews were commanded to put blaſphemers to death; and ſaid the heretics blaſphemed the body of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031999_0104_0FF09C4BA4010A80"/>Chriſt, and called it only a piece of bread. It became Chriſtians to be more zealous for the true religion, than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were for the falſe. St. Peter, by a divine power, ſtruck Ananias and Sapphira dead. Chriſt, in the parable, ſaid, <hi>Compel them to enter in.</hi> St. Paul ſaid, <hi>I would they were out off that trouble you,</hi> St. Auſtin was once againſt all ſeverities in ſuch caſes, but changed his mind, when he ſaw the good effect which ſome baniſhments and fines had on the Donatiſts. That on which they inſiſted moſt, was, the burning of the anabaptiſts in king Edward's time. So they were now fortified in their cruel intentions; and reſolved to ſpare none, of what age, ſex or condition ſoever they might be.<note n="*" place="bottom">Idem. P. 276, 277.</note>

            <head>A DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF THE INQUISITION, AND <hi>Of the ſeveral things appertaining to it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE are, in the dominions of the king of Portugal, four Inquiſitions, viz. at Liſbon, Coimbra, Evora and Goa, in the Eaſt Indies. The juriſdiction of the laſt mentioned extends over all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries poſſeſſed by his Portugueze majeſty on the other ſide of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe four Inquiſitions, there is a ſupreme council held in Liſbon, to which all the other Portugueze Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſubordinate. This tribunal conſiſts
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031999_0108_0FF09C629F8A4F70"/>of an Inquiſitor General, who is appointed by the king, and confirmed by the pope. He is empowered to nominate the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors in all the countries dependant on the crown of Portugal. Under him are five counſellors, a fiſcal proctor,<note n="*" place="bottom">Proctor is well known to be much the ſame, in eccleſiaſtical courts, as an attorney is in lay ones. His buſineſs is to ſee that the church diſcipline be maintained: and to bring to puniſhment the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Fiſcal ſignifies properly what belongs to the exchequer, or king's treaſury; here it is ſaid to employ a proctor, who, for the ſake of, and in the name of the public, is to proſecute delinquents with regard to matters eccleſiaſtical.
<p>The author of the Relation of the Inquiſition of Goa, p. 89, &amp; ſeq. Paris, 1688, 12mo. writes as follows concerning the officers of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There are at Goa two Inquiſitors: the firſt called Inquiſitor mor [I ſuppoſe this ſhould be mayor] or the great Inquiſitor, is always a ſecular prieſt; and the ſecond a Dominican friar. There likewiſe are officers called depudatos. Theſe are numerous, and of all religious orders. They aſſiſt at the judgment of priſoners, and the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of their proſecutions; but never come to the tribunal, unleſs ſent for by the Inquiſitors. There are other officers ſtiled Calificadores, who examine ſuch propoſitions as are looked upon to be contrary to the purity of doctrine. Theſe do not aſſiſt at the judgments, they only making their report with regard to actions committed. There alſo is a proctor, an attorney, and advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or counſellors for ſuch priſoners as may deſire them. However, theſe counſellors are rather their betrayers than defenders; their chief endeavours being only to draw their ſecrets out of them. Beſides, though there were no reaſon to ſuſpect their fidelity, yet their favour would be of little benefit to the priſoners; theſe counſellors being never allowed to ſpeak to them, except before the judges, or ſome perſons depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the latter, in order to be preſent at theſe conferences.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There are other officers of the Inquiſition, called familiars, who are, as it were, the ſerjeants or bailiffs of this tribunal. Perſons of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, not excepting dukes and princes, glory in being familiars. Theſe are employed in ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons impeached; and the uſual rule is, to ſend a familiar of the ſame rank or condition with the perſon who is to be ſeized. Theſe officers have no ſalary, they thinking it honour ſufficient to ſerve ſo holy a tribunal. They wear a medal, on which the arms of the Inquiſition is engraved. They go alone to ſeize a priſoner; and, when ſuch a one is told that the Inquiſitors have ſent for him, he is obliged to follow the familiar inſtantly; for, were he to make the leaſt reſiſtance, every one would aſſiſt the above officer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There likewiſe are ſecretaries, apparitors call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meirinhos, an alcayde or goaler; and guards or attendants to look after the priſoners, carry them food and other things neceſſary</q>
                  </p>
               </note> a ſecretary
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031999_0109_0FF09BF373E3AD18"/>of the king's bed chamber, two ſecretaries of the council, an alcayde or goaler, a receiver, two reporters, two qualificators, and a great number of ſubaltern officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:031999_0110_0FF09C370E2425D0"/>
This ſupreme council has an unlimited authority over all the Inquiſitors of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal; they not being permitted to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize an Auto da Fé without its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. This is the only tribunal of the Inquiſition, from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. It may enact new laws at pleaſure. It determines all ſuits or conteſts ariſing between the Inquiſitors. It puniſhes the miniſters and officers of the Inquiſition. All appeals are made to it. In fine, the authority of this tribunal is ſo great, that there is ſcarce any one but trembles at its bare name; and even the king himſelf does not dare to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>We obſerved that, beſides the ſupreme council, there are four other tribunals of the Inquiſition. Each of them is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of three Inquiſitors or judges, a fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proctor, two ſecretaries, a judge, a receiver, and a ſecretary of confiſcated poſſeſſions, aſſeſſors, counſellors, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, phyſicians and ſurgeons, a gaoler, a meſſenger, door-keepers, familiars, and viſitors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:031999_0111_0FF09C0489A7D510"/>
There are, in the Romiſh church, two ſorts of judges in matters of faith. The firſt are ſo by virtue of the employment with which they are inveſted; ſuch is the pope and the biſhops, who, immediately after their conſecration, are ſuppoſed to receive, from heaven, a right and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute juriſdiction over heretics.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of judges, are thoſe delegated by the pope, who ſets himſelf up as ſupreme judge in matters of faith; and gives the judges in queſtion an entire juriſdiction over all heretics and apoſtates. Theſe are called apoſtolical Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>This employment is of ſuch eminence, that thoſe who are raiſed to it have the fame title with biſhops: and Clement IV. to do them the greater honour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their power, freed them from the juriſdiction of the biſhops where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; making them dependant only on the General Inquiſitor of the kingdom. They likewiſe may publiſh edicts againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; heighten their puniſhment; excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or take off the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſuch as have incurred it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe are dying.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors may ſeize a heretic, though he ſhould have ſled for refuge into
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031999_0112_0FF09C59E31FED98"/>a church; which the biſhop muſt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on any pretence whatſoever; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that gives the Inquiſitors greater power than is enjoyed by the kings of the countries where the Inquiſition is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>No prelate, or legate from the ſee of Rome, can pronounce ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſuſpenſion or interdict, againſt the Inquiſitors and their ſecretaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs order from the pope; to prevent, as is pretended, the affairs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from being injured, and heretics from going unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors may forbid the ſecular judges to proſecute any perſon, even in a proſecution carried on, at firſt, by their order.</p>
            <p>Any perſon who ſhall kill, or employ another to kill, abuſe or beat an Inquiſitor and official of the Inquiſition, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to the ſecular arm, in order to be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Pope Urban IV. granted them likewiſe the privilege of abſolving one another, and their aſſiſtants, with regard to any faults committed by them, ariſing from human frailty; and for which they may have incurred the ſentence of excommunication.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031999_0113_0FF09BFF424F2408"/>They, farther, may grant an indulgence of twenty or forty days, (as they may think proper) to perſons whom they ſhall think penitent.</p>
            <p>They are impowered to abſolve all friars, companions, and notaries of the Inquiſition, from the penance which may have been enjoined them during three years; provided ſuch had endeavoured ſincerely, and perſonally aided and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proſecution of heretics, and of all who favour, defend or conceal them. And if any of the perſons in queſtion ſhould die in the purſuit of ſo pious (as it is ſtrangely termed) a work, the Inquiſitors may give them full abſolution, after ſuch perſons ſhall have made a confeſſion of all their ſins.</p>
            <p>To theſe privileges we ſhall add ſuch as relate more immediately to the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of perſons impeached. All affairs relating to the pretended holy office, are managed by the Inquiſitors, who, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the denunciations, informations, and accuſations, brought againſt all ſorts of perſons; iſſue their orders for citing, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, impriſoning, and laying in irons, thoſe who are accuſed.</p>

            <p>The Inquiſitors receive the confeſſions and depoſitions of thoſe perſons, and appoint the various tortures, in order for extorting from them whatever they deſire ſhould be confeſſed. In fine, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn definitively, all who have the ſad fate to be their priſoners, without any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeal whatſoever. The Inquiſitors may, for their own eaſe, appoint perſons to aſſiſt as judges, in their names, in caſe of ſickneſs or abſence; and theſe are allowed much the ſame prerogatives with thoſe who eſtabliſhed them; and can be removed by none but the Inquiſitors by whom they were nominated. They likewiſe may
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031999_0115_0FF09C20CCBDCF70"/>appoint more aſſiſtants or commiſſaries, proportionably to the cities or towns in the provinces dependant on this tribunal.— There muſt be one commiſſary at leaſt, in every town.</p>
            <p>The ſecond officer of the Inquiſition is the fiſcal proctor. This man, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations made againſt perſons, receives the depoſitions of the witneſſes; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes the Inquiſitors, in order for their being ſeized and impriſoned. In a word, he is their accuſer, and pleads againſt them, after their being taken up. The ſecretaries keep an exact regiſter of the priſoners from the time of their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of the principle articles of the indictment; with the names of the witneſſes who ſwore againſt them. In a word, they write down the proceedings in all cauſes, and the defence made by the priſoner. They likewiſe regiſter all the orders given by the executor, and other officers of the tribunal in queſtion. All writings muſt be carefully locked up, to prevent their being peruſed by any perſons except thoſe acquainted with the ſecrets of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The judge of the goods and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels confiſcated, is judge between the fiſc or exchequer, and private perſons, in all
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031999_0116_0FF09C4A15C11F50"/>cauſes relating to the effects of priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>The receiver is to take exact care of the confiſcated poſſeſſions; muſt ſell them, and apply the monies purſuant to the orders given him. He likewiſe muſt be preſent, when the executor, and the other officers, ſequeſter the poſſeſſions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; which is not done without an expreſs command from the Inquiſitor. The ſecretary of the ſequeſtrations, takes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n exact inventory of all the effects belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the priſoners ſound in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or in the hands of other perſons, who, ſhould they alienate the leaſt part of them, would be expoſed to the utmoſt rigours of this tribunal. All the effects and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions belonging to the priſoners, are lodged with the receiver of the ſequeſtrations; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an exact inventory, ſigned by the executor, who, as well as the ſecretary, has a copy thereof.</p>
            <p>The duties of the executor, is to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the orders of the Inquiſitors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to take criminals, and go in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them, if they are at a diſtance; to look carefully after them, when in their hands; and even to fetter them, &amp;c. in order to convey them, with the greates
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031999_0117_0FF09C13382630F8"/>ſecurity, to the priſons of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The familiars are the bailiffs or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles of the Inquiſition. Though this is a moſt ignominious employment in all other criminal courts, it yet is looked upon as ſo honourable in the Inquiſition, that every nobleman in Portugal is a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of this tribunal. It is not ſurpriſing, that perſons of the higheſt quality ſhould be ſolicitous for this poſt, ſince the pope has granted, to theſe familiars, the like plenary indulgencies as the council of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran gave to ſuch perſons as ſhould go to the ſuccour of the holy land againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. They are the ſatellites of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors; they attending on them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them if neceſſary, againſt the inſults of heretics. They accompany the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whenever he goes to ſeize criminals; and muſt obey all orders given them by the chief officers of the Inquiſition. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral privileges are allowed them, eſpecially the carrying arms; but they are ordered to uſe thoſe with diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Aſſeſſors and counſellors are perſons ſkilled in the canon and civil law. The Inquiſitors conſult them in all difficult points, but follow their opinions no farther
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031999_0118_0FF09C5D60C1D958"/>than they think proper. They commonly make uſe of thoſe perſons to give the greater weight to their ſentences, by the ſpecious precautions they take; but in no other view than to impoſe on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>The viſitor is a perſon appointed by the Inquiſitor General, to inſpect all the towns, cities and provinces where commiſſaries are eſtabliſhed. They muſt inform him of the care which theſe commiſſaries take in ſearching after heretics; and make a report thereof, in order that he, with his council, may uſe ſuch meaſures as may be thought fitting: the viſitor muſt pay the moſt exact obedience to the inſtructions of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: he is forbid to lodge at the houſes of thoſe over whoſe conduct he is to have an eye; to receive the leaſt preſent from them, or any one ſent in their name. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe viſitors is always in proportion to that of the towns, and the extent of the provinces where the Inquiſition is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral officers of this tribunal muſt make oath, before the Inquiſitors, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge faithfully the duties of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not to divulge the moſt minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relating to the Inquiſition of its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031999_0119_0FF09C15EF668580"/>on any pretence whatſoever, upon pain of being turned out, and puniſhed with the utmoſt ſeverity. The Inquiſitors admit of no excuſe on theſe occaſions; ſecrecy being the ſoul, as it were, and the mighty ſupport of this tribunal.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe ſeveral officers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, the popes have likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, by their bulls, magiſtrates in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to give all the aſſiſtance in their power, not only to the Inquiſitors; but likewiſe to their various ſubaltern officers, who may ſtand in need thereof, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their employments, upon pain of their being ſubject to eccleſiaſtical puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors being, as was obſerved, judges delegated by the pope, for enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into matters of faith, and for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereſy; they, upon this ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, are impowered to proſecute all ſorts of friars, of what rank or condition ſoever, either in their own names, by the ſupreme council of the kingdom, or by the pope. 'Tis ſo much the intereſt of the Roman pontiff to ſupport the Inquiſitors, that he exerts his whole authority for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſome examples whereof will be given hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:031999_0120_0FF09C680CAC33A0"/>
In ſine, they may proſecute indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, any layman infected with hereſy, not excepting princes or kings. However, the Inquiſitors, to ſecure themſelves from any ill conſequences which might attend their attacking perſons in ſuch exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſult the pope on theſe occaſions, and proceed as he may direct. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution is not uſed out of reſpect to perſons of high eminence and crowned heads; but, for fear leſt a ſevere treatment ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate them, and cauſe them to oppoſe the Inquiſition in places where it is poor, and not powerfully eſtabliſhed. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would be exempt from the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this tribunal, how great ſoever his privileges might otherwiſe be, ſhould he preſume to ſpeak contemptuouſly of this tribunal; this being an infinitely worſe crime than the moſt pernicious hereſy.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031999_0122_0FF09C3898D88CC8"/>authority, and his ſuperiority over general councils; as likewiſe ſuch as ſpeak, teach or write any thing contrary to the papal deciſions, on what occaſion ſoever, are looked upon as heretics.</p>
               <p>A ſuſpicion of hereſy, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe, is ſtill more extenſive; for to incur ſuch ſuſpicion, it is enough that a perſon only ſtarts ſome propoſition which may offend the hearers; or does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach thoſe who advance any ſuch. That perſon is likewiſe ſuſpected of hereſy, who contemns, inſults or mutilates any images. Likewiſe all thoſe who read books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Inquiſition, or who lend them to others.</p>
               <p>That perſon alſo incurs a ſuſpicion of hereſy, who deviates from the ordinary cuſtoms relating to religion, practiſed by the Romaniſts; ſuch as letting a year paſs, without going to confeſſion and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the eating meat on fiſh days; or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to go to maſs at the times enjoined by the church.</p>
               <p>Thoſe alſo are ſuſpected of hereſy, who, being in holy orders, repeat ſuch ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſhould not be repeated; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to enter into the marriage ſtate; or marry two or more wives.</p>
               <p>

In ſine, ſuch incur a ſuſpicion of hereſy, as go but once, to the ſermons of heretics, or to any other of their public exerciſes. Likewiſe thoſe who neglect to appear before the Inquiſitors, when ſummoned; or procure abſolution, the ſame year they were excommunicated. Alſo, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting a friendſhip with heretics; the lodging ſuch; the making them preſents, or even viſiting them; eſpecially the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their being impriſoned in the Inquiſition; the furniſhing them with opportunities of eſcaping, though induced thereto by the ſtrongeſt ties of blood, of gratitude or pity. This article is carried to ſuch lengths by the Inquiſitors, that perſons are not only forbid to ſave here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, but are obliged to diſcover them, though a father, brother, huſband, or wife; and this upon pain of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; of incurring a ſuſpicion of hereſy; and of being obnoxious to the rigours of the tribunal in queſtion, as fautors or abettors of hereſy. How unnatural, how cruel is ſuch an injunction! Theſe conſtitute the third caſe, ſubject to the judgment of the Inquiſition. Under the name of fautors, are comprehended all who favour, defend, or give advice or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031999_0124_0FF09C2C4FC143A0"/>of what kind ſoever, to thoſe whom the Inquiſitors have begun to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute.</p>
               <p>Thoſe likewiſe become obnoxious, who, knowing perſons to be heretics, or to have eſcaped out of the priſons of the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or who, upon their being cited to appear, refuſe to obey the ſummons; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, or give them advice or aſſiſtance in order for their eſcaping; likewiſe ſuch as moleſt, by threats or otherwiſe, the agents of this tribunal in the execution of their office; or who, tho' they do not obſtruct it themſelves, aid or abet ſuch as oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>Under the name of ſautors of hereſy, are alſo included thoſe who ſpeak, without permiſſion, to the priſoners; or who write to them, either to give them advice, or merely to comfort them. Such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon, by money or otherwiſe, witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be ſilent, or to favour the priſoners in their depoſitions; or who conceal, burn, or get poſſeſſion in what manner ſoever, of papers which may be of uſe in convicting perſons accuſed.</p>
               <p>The fourth caſe ſubject to the judgment of the Inquiſition, includes magicians, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, ſoothſayers, and ſuch like, of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031999_0125_0FF09BE978269E58"/>whom there are ſuppoſed to be (very idly ſure) more in Italy than in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Italian women being ſtrangely curious and credulous. We ſhall not ſpecify the various accuſations brought on thoſe occaſions; they conſiſting of ridiculous ſuperſtitions, ariſing from a heated imagination and blind credulity, rather than from a depraved will and a corrupt heart. We will only obſerve, that, among the ſeveral caſes ſubject to the Inquiſition, none ſill its priſons with a greater number of women of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Blaſphemy, (the fifth caſe) though very common, and one of the greateſt crimes, yet the Inquiſitors do not take cognizance of it, except it contains ſome hereſy. We ſhall forbear giving inſtance thereof here, it being much better for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nkind, that ſuch things ſhould be buried in obliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
               <p>Though neither Jews, Mahomedans, or ſuch like, are ſubject to the Inquiſition, in many things, they yet are obnoxious to it, in all the caſes above-mentioned; thoſe crimes not being tolerated in Jews and Mahomedans, &amp;c. more than in Chriſtian.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031999_0126_0FF09C5517C914B0"/>Farther, the above-mentioned become ſubject to the Inquiſition, if they aſſert, write, or publiſh any particulars contrary to the Romiſh communion. Thus, for inſtance, ſhould a Jew or Mahomedan deny the trinity, or a providence, he would be puniſhed as an heretic; as alſo, was he to hinder a perſon profeſſing any of thoſe religions from turning Chriſtian; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a Romaniſt to theirs, or favour ſuch a deſign.</p>
               <p>Jews are not allowed to vend, publiſh, or even keep the Talmud; or any book, which ſpeaks contemptuouſly of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, or is prohibited by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
               <p>In fine; Jews are not permitted to have Chriſtian nurſes, or to do any thing in contempt of the Romiſh religion. The Inquiſitors take cognizance of all ſuch caſes; and puniſhes offenders in them with the utmoſt ſeverity; ſo that the dread of this obliges thoſe unhappy people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come converts to popery. However, ſuch a converſion does not make them better men. Theſe are always diſtinguiſhed by the title of new Chriſtians, a name which is ſo much deteſted, that the old Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians can ſeldom be prevailed upon to
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031999_0127_0FF09C2EB7F2DC58"/>marry among the new, though the families of the latter had been Chriſtians from their great grandfathers. The utter abhorrence in which theſe new converts are held, makes them unite more cloſely one with the other, in order to perform mutual ſervices, which they could not expect from the old Chriſtians: but this very union is commonly the ſource of their misfortunes. To illuſtrate this, I need but obſerve that, if a new Chriſtian, who is ſincerely ſuch, happens to contract a very ſtrict intimacy with other new Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, this alone would be ſufficient to make him ſuſpected of practiſing Jewiſh ceremonies with them, in ſecret. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this ſuſpicion, ſuch perſon is ſeized by order of the holy office; and accuſed, by the depoſition of ſome perſon, of being a Jew. Being conſcious of his innocence, he ſlatters himſelf that nothing will be eaſier for him than to prove it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly; whence he makes no difficulty to comply with the cuſtom eſtabliſhed by the Inquiſitors, viz. of giving in immediately a complete inventory of all his effects, &amp;c. upon the firm perſuaſion that they will be reſtored to him, the inſtant he ſhall have juſtified himſelf. But he is miſtaken; for,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031999_0128_0FF09C3A30091E80"/>preſently after he has given in ſuch inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Inquiſitors ſeize his effects, and ſell them publicly by auction. The bare accuſation pronounces him guilty; and he has no other way to eſcape the flames, than by making a confeſſion, conformably to the articles of the indictment. As his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, the witneſſes, and himſelf, are not brought face to face, his innocence is of no ſervice. His riches prove his ruin, thoſe being certainly ſeized; and his life would inevitably fall a ſacrifice, ſhould he not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf a relapſed Jew, though he had always been a zealous Romaniſt.</p>
               <p>The ſixth and laſt caſe ſubject to the judgment of the Inquiſition, is of thoſe who reſiſt its officers, or any way oppoſe its juriſdiction. As one of the chief max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of this tribunal is to ſtrike terror, and to awe ſuch as are ſubject to it; it puniſhes with the utmoſt ſeverity all who offend its agents and officers. On theſe occaſions, the ſlighteſt fault is conſidered as a heinous crime. Neither birth, employment, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or rank, can protect. To threaten ever ſo little the loweſt officer belonging to the Inquiſition, its informers, or witneſſes, would be puniſhed with the extremelt rigour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:031999_0129_0FF09C0675E12AC8"/>
Such are the caſes which ſubject a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Inquiſition; and there are four ways, by which ſuch a one uſually, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo. Firſt, by common fame, which declares him to be guilty of one or more of the crimes ſpecified above: ſecondly, by the depoſition of witneſſes, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach him: thirdly, by his being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt by the ſpies of the Inquiſition, who are diſperſed every where: laſtly, by the confeſſion of the priſoner, who accuſes himſelf, in hopes of being treated with greater humanity, than if he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed againſt by others.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to the manner of proſecuting a perſon impeached; and this, ſometimes, upon the ſlighteſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Firſt, he is ſummoned, three ſeveral times, to appear before the Inquiſitors; when, if through fear or contempt, he ſhould neglect to do this, he would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and ſentenced, proviſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to pay a conſiderable fine; after which, ſhould he be ſeized, a more ſevere ſentence would inevitably be paſſed upon him.</p>
               <p>The ſafeſt courſe therefore, for a perſon impeached, is, to obey the firſt ſummons. The longer he delays on this occaſion, the more criminal he makes himſelf, in the eye
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031999_0130_0FF09BE514B642E8"/>of the Inquiſitors, though he ſhould really be innocent. To diſobey the command of the Inquiſitors, is ever conſidered by them as a crime. They always look upon delays to be certain indications of guilt, as ſhowing a dread to appear before the judges. When, therefore, a perſon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this ſad extremity, nothing can ſecure him from the moſt rigorous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a voluntary and perpetual exile: nothing is forgot by the Inquiſitors; time cannot obliterate any crime; and preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a thing unknown to them.</p>
               <p>It frequently happens, that the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, either from their conſidering the crime of which a perſon ſtands impeached, as enormous, and that they have ſufficient evidence againſt him: or from their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that he may eſcape; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately iſſue their orders, without firſt ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſummons, for his being ſeized, in any place whatſoever. When this is the caſe, no aſylum or privilege can ſtop, a ſingle moment, the proſecution, nor abate its rigours. The Inquiſitors give an order, under their own hands, to the executor, who takes a ſufficient number of familiars along with him, to prevent a reſcue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:031999_0131_0FF09C1B5708C250"/>
Words could ſcarce deſcribe the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a man under theſe circumſtances. He, perhaps, is ſeized, when in company with his friends, and ſurrounded by his family; a father by his ſon's ſide; a ſon by that of his father, and a wife in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with her huſband. No perſon is allowed to make the leaſt reſiſtance, or even to ſpeak a ſingle word in favour of the priſoner; who is not indulged a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reſpite to ſettle his moſt important affairs.</p>
               <p>Hence the reader may judge, of the continual apprehenſions with which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, inhabiting countries where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition is eſtabliſhed, muſt neceſſarily be filled; ſince, in order to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it, one friend is obliged to ſacrifice another; ſons their parents; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents their children; huſbands their wives, and wives their huſbands, by accuſing them to the pretended holy office. How horrid a ſource have we here of perfidy and inhumanity! What kind of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt that be, whence gratitude, love, and a mutual forbearance with regard to human frailties, are baniſhed! What muſt that tribunal be, which obliges parents, not only to eraſe from their minds the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031999_0132_0FF09C3064E1C1D8"/>remembrance of their own children; to extinguiſh all the ſenſations of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection, which nature inſpires for them; but even to extend their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitiy ſo far, as to force them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their accuſers, and conſequently the cauſe of the cruelties inflicted on them.</p>
               <p>What idea ought we to form to ourſelves of a tribunal, which obliges children, not only to ſtifle every ſoft impulſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, love and reſpect due to thoſe who gave them birth; but even forces them, upon the moſt rigorous penalties, to be ſpies over their parents; and to diſcover to the mercileſs Inquiſitors, the crimes, the errors, and even the little lapſes to which human frailty ſo often urges: in a word, a tribunal which will not permit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, when impriſoned in its horrid dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to give each other the ſuccours, or to perform the duties which religion enjoins. What diſorder and confuſion muſt ſuch a conduct give riſe to, in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly-loving family! An expreſſion, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in itſelf, and perhaps but too true, ſhall, from an indiſcreet zeal, or a panic fear, give infinite uneaſineſs to a family; ſhall ruin it intirely; and, at laſt, cauſe one or more of its members to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031999_0133_0FF09BA63792FD60"/>ſad victims of the moſt barbarous of all tribunals.</p>
               <p>What diſtractions muſt neceſſarily break out, in a family where the huſband and wife are at variance, and the children looſe and wicked! Will ſuch children ſcruple to ſacrifice a father who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reſtrain them by his exhortations. by reproaches or paternal corrections? Alas, no! theſe will plunder his houſe, to ſupport themſelves in their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and riot; and afterwards deliver up their unhappy parent to all the horrors of a tribunal, whoſe proceedings are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the blackeſt injuſtice.</p>
               <p>A riotous huſband, or a looſe wife, have likewiſe an eaſy opportunity, by means of the proſecutions in queſtion, to rid themſelves of any one who is a check to their vices, by delivering up him or her to the rigours of the Inquiſition. Every deteſtable expedient, ſuch as falſe oaths and teſtimonies, are employed, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, to ſacrifice an innocent perſon. Very juſtly, therefore, might an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous French author, a Romaniſt, write thus (ſpeaking of the various courts in Lima:)</p>

               <p>When a perſon is once impriſoned by the Inquiſitors, his treatment is ſtill more cruel. He is thoroughly ſearched, to diſcover, if poſſible, any books or papers which may ſerve to convict him; or ſome inſtrument he may employ to put an end to his life, in order to eſcape the torture, &amp;c. Of this there are but too many ſad examples; and ſome priſoners have been ſo raſh, as to daſh their brains out againſt the wall, upon their being unprovided with ſciſſars, a knife, a rope, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>After a priſoner has been carefully ſearched; and that his money, papers,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031999_0135_0FF09BD464A96428"/>buckles, rings, &amp;c. have been taken from him, he is conveyed to a dungeon, the bare ſight of which muſt fill him with horror. Torn from his family and his friends, who are not allowed acceſs to, or even to ſend him one conſolatory letter; or to take the leaſt ſtep in his favour, in order to prove his innocence; he ſees himſelf inſtantly abandoned to his inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible judges, to his melancholy, to his deſpair; and even often to his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies, quite uncertain of his fate. Innocence, on ſuch an occaſion, is as a weak reed, nothing being eaſier than to ruin an innocent perſon.</p>
               <p>Being come to priſon, the Inquiſitor, attended by the officers of this mock holy tribunal, goes to the priſoner's abode; and there cauſes an exact inventory to be taken of all his papers, effects, and of every thing found in his houſe. They frequently ſeize all the priſoners other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; at leaſt the greateſt part of them, to pay themſelves the fine to which he may be ſentenced; for very few eſcape out of the Inquiſition without being half ruined, unleſs they happen to be very wealthy indeed.</p>
               <p>The houſe of the Inquiſition in Liſhon.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031999_0136_0FF09BC6AC617340"/>is a very ſpacious edifice. There are four courts, each about forty foot ſquare, round which are galleries (in the dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory form) two ſtories high. In theſe galleries are the cells or priſons, being about three hundred. Thoſe on the ground-floor are alloted for the vileſt of criminals (as they are termed;) and are ſo many frightful dungeons, all of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, arched over, and very gloomy. The cells on the firſt floor are filled with leſs guilty perſons; and women are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lodged in thoſe of the ſecond ſtory. Theſe ſeveral galleries are hid from view, both within and without, by a wall above fifty feet high; and built a few feet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the cells, which darkens them exceedingly. The houſe in queſtion is of ſo great an extent, and contains ſo vaſt a variety of turnings, that I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a priſoner could ſcarce find his way out, unleſs he was well acquainted with its windings; ſo that this horridly ſpacious priſon may be compared to Daedalus's labyrinth.</p>

               <p>The furniture of theſe miſerable dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons is, a ſtraw bed, a blanket, ſheets, and ſometimes a mattreſs. The priſoner has likewiſe a frame of wood about ſix feet

They are quite inflexible; for when once a perſon has the misfortune to be their priſoner, he is not only forbid all correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with his family and friends, (as was obſerved before) but even to make the leaſt noiſe, to complain, ſigh, addreſs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aloud, to ſings pſalms or hymns.— Theſe are capital crimes, for which the guards or attendants of the Inquiſition, who are ever walking up and down the paſſages, firſt reprove him ſeverely; but if he happens to make any noiſe a ſecond time, they open his cell, beat him ſeverely; and this, not only to puniſh the priſoner
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031999_0140_0FF09C02624A4A30"/>himſelf, but likewiſe to intimidate others, who, by reaſon of the horrid ſilence which reigns, and the proximity of the cells, hear the blows and cries of the wretched victim. I ſhall here give an inſtance of this barbarity, atteſted by ſeveral perſons. A priſoner having a violent cough, one of the guards came and ordered him not to make a noiſe; he replied, that it was not in his power to forbear; when his cough increaſing, he was commanded, a ſecond time, to be ſilent; but this being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſtripped the poor creature naked, and beat him ſo unmercifully, that his cough grew worſe; and the blows being again repeated, he died ſoon after.</p>
               <p>By this ſilence which the guards or keepers force priſoners to keep, they not only deny them every little conſolation, but prevent ſuch as are neighbours from making the leaſt acquaintance; for, the inſtant this ſhould be found, they would be removed to other cells.</p>
               <p>They never lodge two priſoners in the ſame cell; to prevent, (as the Inquiſitors pretend) their conſulting together, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſuppreſs or conceal the truth, or to baffle the interrogatories; but the chief
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031999_0141_0FF09B945B97BC68"/>motive for keeping thoſe unhappy perſons apart, is to extort from them, by the dread ſolitude of their confinement, a confeſſion of whatever the Inquiſitors may require from them.</p>
               <p>However, on ſome occaſions, two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dged together in the ſame cell; as, for inſtance, when a huſband and wife are impriſoned for the like crime; and that there is no room to ſuſpect, that one of them will prevent the other from freely confeſſing the ſeveral articles of which he or ſhe may ſtand indicted. When a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is ſick, a companion is given him, in order to aſſiſt him as he is told. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when the Inquiſitors have not been able to prevail with a priſoner to plead guilty, and that there are no, proofs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convict him; they then ſend him a companion, who has been taught his leſſon beforehand, by the officers of the Inquiſition; and this companion art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully glides into the confidence of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; wins his friendſhip; and inveighs ſtrongly againſt the Inquiſitors; accuſes them of injuſtice, cruelty and barbarity; and, inſenſibly, cauſes the unhappy victim to join his reproaches, againſt the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors and the Inquiſition. This is a black
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031999_0142_0FF09BCA0642CC68"/>and unpardonable crime; and ſhould the priſoner fall inadvertently into this trap, he would be inevitably undone; for then his companion immediately deſires to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to audience; appears as a witneſs againſt him; and is no longer his fellow priſoner.</p>
               <p>A day or two after a priſoner is brought into his cell, his hair is cut off, and his bead ſhaved. On theſe occaſions no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is made in age, ſex, or birth. He then is ordered to tell his name, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and to make a diſcovery of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is worth in the world. To induce him to do this the more readily, the Inquiſitor promiſes, that, if he be really innocent, the ſeveral things diſcloſed by him will be carefully reſtored; but that, ſhould any effects, &amp;c. concealed by him, be afterwards found, they all will be conſiſcated, though he may be cleared. As moſt of the Portugueze are ſo weak, as to be firmly per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, theſe
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031999_0143_0FF09B8C91360180"/>hapleſs perſons are impoſed upon; for thoſe who have the ſad fortune to fall into the mercileſs hands of the iniquitous judges, are inſtantly bereaved of all their poſſeſſions. In caſe they plead their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence with regard to the crimes of which they ſtand accuſed, and yet ſhould be convicted by the witneſſes who ſwore againſt them, they then would be ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as guilty, and their whole poſſeſſions confiſcated. If priſoners, in order to eſcape the torture, and in hopes of being ſooner ſet at liberty, own the crime or crimes of which they are impeached, they then are pronounced guilty by their own confeſſion; and the public, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, think their effects, &amp;c. juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated. If ſuch priſoners come forth as repentant criminals, who had accuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves voluntarily, they yet dare not plead their innocence; ſince they thereby would run the hazard of being impriſoned again, and ſentenced, not only as hypocritical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents; but likewiſe as wretches who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Inquiſitors of injuſtice; ſo that, what courſe ſoever theſe perſons might take, they would certainly loſe all ſuch poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to them, as the Inquiſitors had ſeized.</p>

Sometimes a priſoner paſſes ſeveral months in his cell, without hearing a ſingle word of his being brought to trial; without his knowing the crime of which he ſtands impeached, or a ſingle witneſs who ſwore againſt him. At laſt the gaoler tells him, as of his own accord, that it will be proper for him to ſue to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to audience. He then is conducted, for the firſt time, bare-headed to the judges; an under gaoler walking firſt, himſelf next, and laſtly the gaoler. Being come to one of the doors of the Inquiſition, the firſt mentioned knocks thrice; upon which the door is opened by one of the attendants on, or porter of the Inquiſition. The priſoner, &amp;c. are then commanded to ſtay in this anti-chamber, until the porter has knocked three times at the door of the great hall of the Inquiſition. This is done in order to give the Inquiſitors time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for, and to receive the priſoner; that is, for him to diſmiſs all perſons to whom he may be giving audience; thereby to prevent the priſoners from ſeeing, or being ſeen, by them.</p>
               <p>Every thing being ready, purſuant to the orders given for that purpoſe, the judge who preſides in the great hall, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031999_0145_0FF09C6D8F910BE0"/>by a little bell; upon which the porter of the hall in queſtion opens the door. The priſoner then enters, guarded by the two officers before-mentioned; when theſe, advancing towards the table, give the priſoner a ſtool; after which they retire, bending the knee.</p>
               <p>Then the preſident bids the priſoner kneel; ordering him at the ſame time, to lay his right hand on a book, which is ſhut. He then addreſſes theſe words to him: <q>will you promiſe to conceal the ſecrets of the holy office, and to ſpeak the truth?</q>—The priſoner anſwering in the affirmative, the preſident commands him to ſit down; and afterwards aſks him a great variety of queſtions with regard to all ſuch crimes, as may be committed, cognizable by the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>The ſecretary writes down very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, the ſeveral interrogatories and anſwers; which being done, he rings the little bell, when the priſoner is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to his cell, in the ſame manner as he had been brought from it; but not till after he has been exhorted, to recollect all the ſins he may have committed, ever
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031999_0146_0FF09B8A412390A0"/>ſince his being come to years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By my ſufferings and examination the reader will ſee how priſoners are examined, and the methods made uſe of to make them accuſe themſelves, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Inquiſitors do not confine their power merely to the living, or to thoſe who die in their priſons. They even proſecute ſuch as died many years before their being indicted; cauſe their bodies to be dug up, and burn their bones in the Auto da Fé. The Inquiſitors likewiſe confiſcate their poſſeſſions, of which they do not ſcruple to diſpoſſeſs their heirs, not excepting even their children. It is certain that nothing can be caſier than to condemn bones, as theſe are unable to defend themſelves; but ſuch proceedings will not be wondered at, when the reader is aſſured, that ſuch of the living as become victims to the Inquiſitors, are not better heard in their own juſtification than if they were really dead.</p>

The dead perſons were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly cited by two edicts, and various witneſſes brought againſt them. When no one would undertake their defence, they were condemned for contumacy; [ridiculous cruelty!] and on the ſame day ſentence was pronounced before the whole univerſity; by which their bodies were ordered to be dug up, and delivered to the queen's officers. An order was afterwards ſent, from her majeſty, for inflicting the puniſhment. In fine, Feb. 6, the bodies were dug up; when a large ſtake being fixed in the ground, in the market-place, the bodies were tied to it. After this the cheſts or coffins, with the bodies in them, were ſet up; being faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides, and bound to the poſt with a long iron chain. The pile being fired, a great number of proteſtant books were thrown into it, and theſe were ſoon conſumed.

               <p>HERE follows a ſuccinct deſcription of one ſolemnized at Madrid, in 1682.</p>
               <p>The officers of the Inquiſition, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by trumpets, kettle-drums, and their banner, marched. May 30, 1682, in cavalcade to the palace of the great ſquare; where they declared, by proclamation, that on the 30th of June, the ſentences of the priſoners condemned to the flames, and to other puniſhments, would be put in execution. There had not been a ſpectacle of this kind, in Madrid, during forty years before, for which reaſon it was expected, by the inhabitants, with as much impatience as though it had been the merrieſt holiday. The 30th of June being come, numberleſs multitudes of people appeared, as ſplendidly dreſſed as for a royal wedding. In the great ſquare was raiſed a high ſcaffold: into this ſquare, from ſeven in the morning, till nine at night, came criminals of both ſexes; all the Inquiſitions in the kingdom having
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031999_0150_0FF09BBF9E583428"/>ſent their priſoners to Madrid. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and ſentences were read aloud. There were twenty Jews, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and one Renegado Mahommedan, who were all burnt. Fifty Jews and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes having never been impriſoned before, and repenting of their crimes, were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to a long impriſonment, and to wear a yellow ſcapulary. Ten more, indicted for bigamy, witchcraft, and other crimes, were ſentenced to be whipt, and afterwards ſent to the gallies; theſe wore large paſte-board caps on their heads, with inſcriptions on them; having halters about their necks and torches in their hands.</p>
               <p>The whole court was preſent: the king, the queen, the embaſſadors, courtiers, and numberleſs multitudes of people.— The Inquiſitor's chair was placed in a ſort of tribunal, far above that of the king. The unhappy victims were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſo near to the place where the king ſtood, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031999_0151_0FF09C24D51A9680"/>them when they were faſt bound with thick cords; the reſt of the criminals being conducted by the familiars, or common ſervants of the Inquiſition. Several friars, both learned and ignorant, argued with great vehemence, to convince theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy creatures of the truth of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion. Some of thoſe criminals (Jews) were perfectly well ſkilled in their religion: and made the moſt ſurpriſing replies, and that without the leaſt emotion. Among them was a maiden of exquiſite beauty, and but ſeventeen years of age; who being on the ſame ſide with the queen, addreſſed her, in hopes of obtaining her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as follows; <q>Great queen! will not your royal preſence be of ſome ſervice to me in my miſerable condition? have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my youth; and conſider that I profeſs a religion which I imbibed from my infancy.</q> The queen turned away her eyes, and though ſhe ſeemed greatly to pity her diſtreſs, yet ſhe did not dare to ſpeak a word in her behalf.</p>
               <p>Now maſs began, in the midſt of which the prieſt came from the altar, and ſeated himſelf in a chair prepared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The chief Inquiſitor deſcended from the amphitheatre, dreſſed in his
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031999_0152_0FF09BAD361CCC68"/>cope, and having a mitre on his head; when, after bowing to the altar, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the king's balcony; went up to it by the ſtairs, at the end of the ſcaffold; attended by ſome officers of the Inquiſition, carrying the croſs and the goſpels; with a book containing the oath by which the kings of Spain oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to protect the catholic faith; to extirpate heretics; and to ſupport, with all their power, the proſecutions of the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>The king ſtanding up, bareheaded, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, on one ſide, the conſtable of Caſtile, who held the royal ſword lifted, ſwore to maintain the oath, which was read by a counſellor of the royal council. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty continued his poſture till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor returned to his place; when a ſecretary of the Inquiſition mounted a ſort of pulpit, and read the like oath, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering it to the counſellors and the whole aſſembly. Maſs began about twelve, and did not end till nine at night, becauſe of the ſentences of the ſeveral criminals: they being all read, aloud, one after another. The intrepidity with which thoſe hapleſs priſoners ſuffered death was very aſtoniſhing. Some threw themſelves into

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031999_0156_0FF09BD89B253800"/>them, that they leave them to the devil, who is ſtanding at their elbow to receive their ſouls, and carry them with him into the flames of hell-ſire, ſo ſoon as they are out of their bodies. Upon this a great ſhout is raiſed; and as ſoon as the Jeſuits are got off the ladder, the cry is; let the dogs beards be made; which is done by thruſting flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furzes faſtened to a long pole, againſt their faces. And this inhumanity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly continued until their faces are burnt to a coal; and is always accompanied with ſuch loud acclamations of joy, as are not to be heard upon any other occaſion; a bull feaſt, or a farce, being dull entertainments, to the uſing a profeſſed heretic thus inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely.</p>
               <p>The profeſſed beards being thus made, or trimmed, as they call it in jollity; fire is ſet to the furze, which is at the bottom of the ſtake, and above which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed are chained ſo high, that the top of the ſlame ſeldom reaches higher than the ſeat they ſit on; and if there happens to be a wind, to which that place is much expoſed, it ſeldom reaches ſo high as their knees. So that if there is a calm, the profeſſed are commonly dead in about half an hour after the furze is ſet on ſire; but
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031999_0157_0FF097DBAA428EC8"/>if the weather is windy, they are not, after that, dead in an hour and half, or two hours; and ſo are really roaſted and not burnt to death. But though, out of hell, there cannot poſſibly be a more lamentable ſpectacle than this, being joined with the ſufferers (ſo long as they are able to ſpeak) cries, viz. Miſerecordia por amor de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, "Mercy for the love of God;" yet it is beheld by people of both ſexes, and all ages, with ſuch tranſports of joy and ſatisfaction, as are not, on any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be met with.—Thus far Doctor Geddes, who obſerves, p. 450, (a very remarkable circumſtance,) <q>That this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human joy is not the effect of natural cruelty, but ariſes from the ſpirit of their religion; a proof of which is, that all public malefactors, except heretics, are no where more tenderly lamented than by the Portugueze; and even when there is nothing in the manner of their deaths that appear inhuman or cruel.</q>

               <head>The Solemnization of the <hi>Auto da Fé</hi> in which <hi>JOHN COUSTOS</hi> had the ill fate to walk.</head>
               <p>A FORTNIGHT before the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of this Auto da Fé, notice was given in all the churches, that it would be celebrated on Sunday the 21ſt June 1744. At the ſame time, all who intended to be ſpectators thereof, were exhorted not to ridicule the priſoners, but rather pray to God for their converſion. On Saturday the 20th of the month above-mentioned, we were all ordered to get ready by next morning; and, at the ſame time, a band was given to each of us, and old black cloathes to ſuch as had none.</p>
               <p>Thoſe accuſed of Judaiſm, and who, through fear of the torture, confeſſed their being ſuch, were diſtinguiſhed by large ſcapularies called ſan benidos. This is a piece of yellow ſtuff, about two ells long; and in the middle of which a hole is made, to put the head through: on it were ſowed ſtripes of red ſtuff, and this falls behind and before, in form of a St. Andrew's croſs. Thoſe who are condemned for
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031999_0159_0FF09BEE9C6A94F8"/>ſorcery, magic, and ſuch like, wear the ſame kind of ſcapulary deſcribed above. They are diſtinguiſhed only by wearing a paſteboard cap, about a foot and half high, on which devils and flames are painted; and, at the bottom, the word WIZARD is writ in large characters.</p>
               <p>I muſt obſerve, that all ſuch perſons as are not ſentenced to die, carry a lighted yellow wax taper in their hands. I was the only perſon to whom one was not given, on account of my being an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate proteſtant.</p>
               <p>The relapſed Jews, and ſuch heretical Roman Catholies, as are ſentenced to die for refuſing to confeſs the crimes whereof they are accuſed, are dreſſed in grey ſamaras, much ſhorter than the fan benidos above-mentioned. The face of the perſon who wears it, is copied (before and behind) from the life, ſtanding on ſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands; with flames curling upwards, and devils round it, at the bottom of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara, their names and ſurnames are writ.</p>
               <p>Blaſphemers are dreſſed as above, and diſtinguiſhed only by a gag in their months.</p>

                  </gap> being thus habited, the proceſſion opened with the Dominican
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031999_0160_0FF09BB413E2E1A0"/>Friars, preceded by the banner of their order. Afterwards came the banner and crucifix of the Inquiſition, which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the criminals, each whereof walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between two familiars, who were to be anſwerable, for them, and bring back to priſon, ſuch as were not to be executed, after the proceſſion was ended.</p>
               <p>The accompanying priſoners on theſe diſmal occaſions is thought ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that ſuch as attend, to execution, theſe unhappy victims, and even lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, are always the firſt noblemen in the kingdom; who are ſo proud of acting in this character, that they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that honour for any other that ſhould be offered them, ſo cruelly blind is their zeal.</p>
               <p>Next came the jewiſh converts, followed by ſuch as were indicted for witchcraft and magic, and had confeſſed their crimes.</p>
               <p>The proceſſion cloſed with the unhappy wretches who were ſentenced to the flames.</p>
               <p>The march then began, when the whole proceſſion walked round the court of the chief Inquiſitor's palace, in preſence of the king, the royal family, and the whole court, who were come thither for this purpoſe. The priſoners being all gone through the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031999_0161_0FF09BDB6A788B18"/>court juſt mentioned, proceeded along one of the ſides of Rocio Square; and went down Odreyros-Street; when, returning by Eſcudeyros-Street, and up another ſide of Rocio-Square, they came, at laſt, to St. Dominick's church, which was hung, from top to bottom, with red and yellow tapeſtry.</p>
               <p>Before the high altar was built an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre, with a pretty conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſteps, in order to ſeat all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and their attendant familiars. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite was raiſed another greater altar, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the romiſh faſhion, on which was placed a crucifix ſurrounded with ſeveral lighted tapers, and maſs books. To the right of this was a pulpit, and to the left, a galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, magnificently adorned, for the king, the royal family, the great men of the kingdom, and the foreign miniſters, to ſit in. To the right of this gallery was, a long one, for the Inquiſitors; and between theſe two galleries, a room, whither the Inquiſitors retire to hear the confeſſions of thoſe who, terrified at the horrors of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending death, may be prompted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs what they had before perſiſted in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they ſometimes gladly ſnatching this
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031999_0162_0FF09BBA11F98448"/>laſt moment allowed them to eſcape a cruel exit.</p>
               <p>Every perſon being thus ſeated in the church, the preacher aſcended the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, whence he made a panegyric on the Inquiſition; exhorted ſuch priſoners as were not ſentenced to die, to make good uſe of the clemency indulged them, by ſincerely renouncing that inſtant, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and crimes of which they ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed. Then directing himſelf to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who were to be burnt, he exhorted them to make a good uſe of the little time left them by making a ſincere confeſſion of their crimes, and thereby avoiding a cruel death.</p>
               <p>During the ſermon, the priſoners have ſome refreſhments; the open air having a very ſtrong effect on moſt, and the length of the march fatiguing them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. On this occaſion dry fruits are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, and as much water as they can drink.</p>
               <p>The preacher being come from the pulpit, ſome prieſts belonging to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition aſcend it ſucceſſively, to read the trial of each priſoner, who was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the time holding a lighted taper.
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031999_0163_0FF09C1D9820FC98"/>Each priſoner, after hearing it returned to his place. This laſted till ten at night.</p>
               <p>The trials of all the priſoners not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to die, being read, the preſident of the Inquiſition, dreſt in his ſacerdotal veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, appeared with a book in his hand; after which five or ſix prieſts, in ſurplices, tapped, with a ſort of wands, the heads and ſhoulders of the priſoners in queſtion: ſaying certain prayers uſed in the Romiſh church, when the excommunication is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
               <p>Then another prieſt went up into the pulpit, to read the trials of the ill-fated perſons ſentenced to the flames; after which theſe ſad victims were delivered up to the ſecular power, whoſe officers take them to the Relacaon,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſenate-houſe, or court of judicature.</note> whither the king comes. Thus the Inquiſition, to conceal their cruelties, calls in the ſecular arm, which condemns the priſoners to die; or rather ratifies the ſentence paſt by the Inquiſitors. This laſted till ſix in the morning.</p>
               <p>At laſt theſe miſerable creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the familiars and prieſts, were conducted under the guard of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031999_0164_0FF09BAF334179A8"/>of foot, to Campo da Laa, or the Woolheld. Here they were faſtened, with chains, to poſts, and ſeated on pitch barrels. Afterwards the king appeared, in a ſorry coach, at which were ropes inſtead of harneſſes. He then ordered the friars to exhort each of the victims in queſtion, to die in the Romiſh faith, upon pain of being burnt alive; but to declare, that ſuch as complied with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the prieſt, ſhould be ſtrangled before they were committed to the flames. His majeſty ſtaid till all the priſoners were executed.</p>
               <p>In this Auto da Fé, were burnt the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing perſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. Father Joſeph de Seguira, a prieſt, convicted of various hereſies, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</item>

                     <item>5. Gabriel Roderiguez Bicudo, a ſhoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who, after publicly abjuring juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm in a former Auto da Fé; and being
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031999_0165_0FF09C4444A934F0"/>taken up a ſecond time for committing a like crime, was convicted, and proved obſtinate.</item>
                     <item>6. Pedro de Rates Henequim, living on his eſtate, condemned for invening, writing, following and defending the doctrines of heretics; for turning hereſiarch with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable blaſphemies; convicted, falſe, diſſembling, conſident, varying and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</item>
                     <item>7. Joſepha Maria, ſpinſter, daughter of Gabriel Roderiguez Bicudo, abjuring in the ſame manner as her father, (above) and convicted a ſecond time; falſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, and impenitent.</item>
                     <item>8. Mecia da Coſta, a widow, reconciled in a former Auto da Fé for the crime of witchcraft, and living a-part from the catholic ſaith; making a contract with the devil, whom ſhe worſhipped as God; convicted, denying, obſtinate and relapſed.</item>

               </p>
               <p>The inſtant the ſad victims above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were delivered up to the ſecular arm, all the reſt of the priſoners wereded back, with the like ceremony, about ten at night, from St. Dominick's church to the Inquiſition. Being arrived there, we were carried through ſeveral galleries, till
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031999_0166_0FF09BF8906A6868"/>we came to the abode allotted us. Here were ſeveral chambers, the doors of which were open; when each of us choſe that which he liked beſt. There then were given to each a ſtraw bed, a blanket, and ſheets which had been laid in. Moſt of theſe things were far from clean, there not having been an Auto da Fé for two years before. The women were lodged a ſtory above us.</p>
               <p>Being thus ſettled, to the beſt of our power, we thought ourſelves the happieſt perſons upon the earth, though we had little to boaſt of. However, we were now together, and breathed the freſh air; we enjoyed the light of the ſky, and had a view of a garden: in a word, we knew that we ſhould not be put to death; all which circumſtances proved a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. The alcayde or gaoler, and his brother-keeeper brought each of us a loaf, a cake, and water ſufficient for the whole company; permitting us, at the ſame time, to divert ourſelves, provided we did not make a noiſe. This was the firſt time we had ſupped, in the Inquiſition, with any ſatisfaction. Having been greatly fatigued by the ceremony deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031999_0167_0FF09C0B1A2EAEB8"/>in the foregoing pages, I ſlept very ſoundly.</p>
               <p>I am to obſerve that, from the time of our returning from the proceſſion, we were ſupported at the expence of the Cardinal-Inquiſitor, and not at that of the mock holy office. We were ſoon ſenſible of this change of maſters, not only by the advantages deſcribed above; but alſo by the permiſſion allowed us, of ſending to our relations and friends, for ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as we might want, if we did not like thoſe given us; or had not enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy our appetites. It would be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ingratitude in me not to mention the very eſſential favours which I myſelf, as well as the three brethren, my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, received from the Free-Maſons at Liſbon. Theſe could not be eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> till they had obtained leave to viſit us, which gave us inexpreſſible joy; and their bounty proved of the moſt ſignal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us. We imagined at firſt, that the reaſon why the cardinal ordered us to be conſined, during ſome days, in this part of the priſon, was to accuſtom us, by inſenſible degrees, to the open air; and to diſpel the dreadful melancholy which had ſo long oppreſſed us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031999_0168_0FF09C3EC3774C70"/>the true cauſe of it was, that each of us might be the more eaſily conveyed to the place to which he was doomed by his ſentence; to put into our hands a bill of the expences the Inquiſitors had been at; and to give the various officers the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions neceſſary, for conveying us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the ſeveral places appointed by the Inquiſitors.</p>
               <p>During the courſe of the week in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome of the priſoners were baniſhed: ſuch as had more huſbands or wives than one were whipt through the ſtreets of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, and others ſent to the galley, among whom I was.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> GALLEY.</head>
               <p>THE Portugueze Galley is a priſon ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the river ſide, and conſiſts of two very ſpacious rooms built one over the other. That on the ground floor is the apartment of the ſlaves, and the other is for the ſick, and the officers of this priſon; it being the receptacle, not only of ſuch as are condemned by the Inquiſitors, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031999_0169_0FF09C32B29E4C38"/>by the lay judges. Among theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are Turks and Moors, taken on board the corſair veſſels; together with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive ſlaves, and bad or villainous ſervants, whom their maſters ſend to this galley, as a chaſtiſement.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral priſoners, of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever, are employed in tolls equally low and grievous. Some work in the dock yards; they carrying timber to the carpenters, unloading the ſhips, and providing water and proviſions for victualling ſuch as are outward bound.— They likewiſe carry water to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Liſbon; and to the king's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, in order for refreſhing them; in a word, they are obliged to ſubmit to any labours, how ignominious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoever, for the ſervice of his Portugueze majeſty, or of the officers who command over them. Theſe ſlaves are treated with the greateſt ſeverity and cruelty, except they find means to bribe their overſeers to gentleneſs, by giving them, at intervals, a little money.</p>
               <p>In this Galley, all the ſlaves are faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two and two, by one foot only, with a chain eight foot long. At their girdle
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031999_0170_0FF09C09688ADC48"/>is an iron hook, by which they ſhorten or lengthen their chain, to make the weight of it leſs troubleſome. Their heads and beards are ſhaved once a month. They wear coarſe blue cloaths, caps and coats; and have a great coat, made of coarſe ſerge of the ſame colour, which ſerves them as a cloak in the day time, and a coverlet at night. They lie in a ſort of frame of boards raiſed a little from the ground over which a mat is ſpread.</p>
               <p>To every Galley ſlave is given, each day, a pound and a half of very dry, black biſcuit; with ſix pounds of ſalt meat every month, and a buſhel of peaſe, lentils or beans, which they are allowed to ſell; in order to purchaſe better proviſions, if they can afford it.</p>
               <p>They are led early every morning, a ſew feſtivals excepted, whitherſoever their drudgery may be wanted. They then toil inceſſantly till eleven, when they leave work, in order to eat and reſt themſelves till one; after which they again renew their miſerable labours, and theſe they carry on till night, when they are conducted back to the Galley. Such is the life which theſe unhappy wretches lead daily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:031999_0171_0FF09C2922E3BB70"/>
When any of them fall ſick, they are removed to the other great room, where proper care is taken of them by the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, ſurgeons, &amp;c. It is incumbent on me to do juſtice to them in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The ſick are here treated with all imaginable care and humanity. Thoſe whoſe ſtomachs are too weak to digeſt ſtrong aliments, have good broth, on which occaſion chickens are not ſpared. But it is far otherwiſe with regard to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: their taſk-maſters exerciſing great cruelty towards all ſuch as commit a fault: thoſe unhappy ſlaves, being laid on their bellies, are faſtened to a ladder; when two men whip alternately their bare poſteriors with a bull's pizzle, or a thick pitched rope. The ſufferers often receive two or three hundred laſhes in this manner, whereby their ſkin is not only flead, but pieces of fleſh are torn away: ſo that the ſurgeons are obliged to make deep inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in order to prevent a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which frequently prevents their working during a long time. Theſe wounds often become ulcerous, and many are diſabled for life. In ſhort, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities exerciſed by this tribunal are ſo great, and ſo various, that Oldham might
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031999_0172_0FF09BB15954B5F0"/>juſtly put the following words into the mouth of Ignatius Loyola:

            <head>EXAMPLES OF THE INJUSTICE <hi>and</hi> CRUELTY OF THE INQUISITION.</head>
            <p>THE pretended zeal of the Inquiſitors, for preſerving religion in all its purity, is merely a cloak to hide their boundleſs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, their inſatiable thirſt of riches, and their vindictive ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The emperor Frederic, mentioned in the foregoing pages, who firſt inveſted the Inquiſitors with great privileges, was the firſt who made the moſt cruel abuſe of them. All who oppoſed his will were deemed heretics, and judged and burnt as ſuch. He committed to the flames, upon the falſe pretence of hereſy, ſo great a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031999_0174_0FF097D9C89F0800"/>number of Romaniſts, that pope Gregory could not forbear repreſenting to him in the moſt ſerious terms; that it became him to extirpate heretics only, and not the true ſons of the church.</p>
            <p>The monarch in queſtion did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that the court of Rome might turn thoſe very weapons againſt him which he had employed ſo unjuſtly againſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Chriſtians. This emperor was afterwards ſenſible of his error, but too late; for he himſelf was in 1239 impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a heretic; and being judged, was excommunicated as ſuch; and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects freed from the allegiance they had ſworn to him; though his hereſy was no more, than his having oppoſed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power which the popes pretended to exerciſe over all Chriſtians, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even crowned heads.</p>
            <p>Elezine, lord of Padua, whoſe hereſy was only too great attachment to the emperor Frederic, was likewiſe excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and Inquiſitors appointed to proſecute him for this pretended crime. Accordingly he was ſummoned to appear in Rome, whither he ſent perſons of reputation to declare his innocence.— However, theſe were not allowed to be
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031999_0175_0FF09C46594EF930"/>heard, the pope inſiſting that he ſhould appear in perſon; and, upon his refuſing to obey this order, the Roman pontiff ſent the biſhop of Treviſo to inform Elezine, that he would render himſelf obnoxious to all the puniſhments inflicted on heretics, in caſe he refuſed to appear perſonally in Rome, ſometime in Auguſt 1251; and further, that if he did not ſubmit to all the pope's injunctions, he would be declared infamous and a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic; himſelf and his poſſeſſions ſeized, and a cruſade ſent againſt him and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. In fine, ſentence was paſſed againſt this lord in 1254, whereby he was pronounced a heretic, and all his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions confiſcated in favour of his brother Albert.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, Count de Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſe fell a victim to the cruel power of the Roman pontiffs and their wicked agents. His dominions were ſacked by cruſaders, whom the pope had ſent out againſt him. In fine, this Count, though a zealous Romaniſt, could find no other way to extricate himſelf, than by making a ſubmiſſion, too mean and ſevere for a prince, whoſe only crime was his ſtrong attachment to Frederic,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031999_0176_0FF097ECEC924B28"/>then at variance with the court of Rome; and his not perſecuting his own ſubjects, who were accuſed, by that court, of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Inquiſitors cited Jane, daughter of the emperor Charles V. to appear before their tribunal; in order to be examined concerning another perſon, with regard to ſome articles of faith, which the Inquiſitors declared were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. The emperor himſelf ſtood in ſuch awe of the Inquiſition, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his daughter, in caſe ſhe thought the perſon accuſed ever ſo little guilty, not to delay her information, in order to avoid the ſentence of excommunication, levelled not only againſt other perſons, but even againſt himſelf. The princeſs, in compliance with this command, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave in her depoſition to Valdes, archbiſhop of Seville, then Inquiſitor-General.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſition of Arragon proceeded to ſtill greater lengths; it having the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to proſecute Don Carlos, eldeſt ſon to Don John II. king of Arragon.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cabrera hiſt, de Don Juan.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:031999_0177_0FF09C530AA78A00"/>
The Inquiſition of Caſtile diſtinguiſhed itſelf in a manner equally daring and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid; this tribunal attempted to proſecute the memory of the emperor Charles V. and to ſentence his will to the flames, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; together with all thoſe perſons who had had the greateſt ſhare in this monarch's friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Here follows a ſuccinct account of this incident, as related by Thaunus, d'Aubig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>né, and le Laboureur.</p>
            <p>This emperor's retreat had given riſe to various reports. One of theſe was, that he had contracted, by his almoſt continual correſpondence with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Germany, an inclination for their opinions; and yet the ſole motive of his withdrawing to a ſolitude, was, that he might have an opportunity of ending his days in exerciſes of piety conformable to his ſecret diſpoſition. It was likewiſe affirmed, that his ill treatment of ſeveral of thoſe brave proteſtant princes, whom he had ſubdued by force of arms, extorted from him ſuch an admiration of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in ill fortune, as made him almoſt bluſh for his conqueſts: and raiſed in him, by inſenſible degrees, an eſteem for their religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:031999_0178_0FF09C26924ACCE0"/>
A circumſtance which added to the probability of theſe reports, was, his making choice of perſons ſuſpected of hereſy to be the companions of his retreat, and the directors of his conſcience. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Caculla was his preacher; and his confeſſors-were the archbiſhop of Toledo, and eſpecially Conſtantine Pontius, biſhop of Droſſin. This report was ſtrengthened by the great number of paſſages, writ with the emperor's own hand, on the walls of his cell at St. Juſtus' where he died; theſe agreeing pretty nearly with the tenets of the proteſtants, on juſtification and grace.</p>
            <p>But a circumſtance which confirmed this opinion ſtill more, was, his will not being drawn up after the manner of the Roman Catholics; I mean that no pious le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies were read therein, nor any monies bequeathed for ſaying maſſes, which gave offence to the Inquiſitors. However, they did not dare to ſpeak openly on this occaſion, till they ſhould firſt know the ſentiments of Philip II. and whether he would not be offended at the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in queſtion; but this prince, on his aſcending the throne, ſigualized himſelf by perſecuting all thoſe who had ſhook off
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031999_0179_0FF09BDE05689138"/>the papal yoke; ſo that the Inquiſitors, in imitation of him, firſt proſecuted the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Toledo, primate of Spain, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Caculla, and laſt of all Conſtantine Pontius.</p>
            <p>As the king permitted them to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, this was conſidered as an undoubted proof of his zeal for the Romiſh religion: but the moſt judicious were ſtruck with horror, when they ſaw the emperor's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, in whoſe arms he died, delivered up, by his own ſon, to a moſt ignominious and cruel puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors could not forbear ſhowing, that they were prompted to this horrid act, by no other views than thoſe of intereſt; ſince, in the trials of the three perſons above-mentioned, they charged them with being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in drawing up the emperor's will; and ſentenced both it, and them, to the flames.</p>
            <p>Philip, who hitherto had beheld with the utmoſt indifference, the conduct of the Inquiſitors, now rouſed as from a lethargy; when reflecting on the bad things the world would ſay of him, in caſe he did not ſtop a proſecution ſo injurious to the memory of his royal
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031999_0180_0FF09B8E30E43088"/>father, and which might likewiſe be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fatal conſequences, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, ſecretly, to ſtop the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but employed, at the ſame time, gentle expedients, for fear of angering the Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>Don Carlos, only ſon to king Philip, being a prince of great vivacity; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the utmoſt veneration for his grandfather's memory, was highly offended at this inſult put upon it. Not knowing all the extent of the power of this horrid tribunal, he inveighed againſt it; and, after blarning his father's weakneſs, ſpoke publicly of this deſign of the Inquiſitors, as a ſhocking and unheard of attempt.— He even went ſo far, as to threaten to extirpate, one day or other, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and all its agents, for this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable outrage. But this generous prince paid dear for theſe paſſionate expreſſions; the Inquiſitors being determined to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him to their vengeance, and haſten his end.</p>
            <p>However, this diſpute between the king and the Inquiſition was afterwards adjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Caculla was burnt alive, with the effigy of Conſtantine Pontius, who died in priſon ſome days before. The arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031999_0181_0FF09C1F35727308"/>of Toledo appealed to Rome; and extricated himſelf by money and friends. After this, no farther mention was made of the emperor's will.</p>
            <p>Though this reconciliation might pacify the prince of Spain, the Inquiſitors were far from being appeaſed; it being one of their chief maxims, never to forgive. In this view, they raiſed ſo great a ſpirit of diſcontent among the common people, that the king was forced to remove Don Carlos from court; together with Don John his brother, and the prince of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, his nephew, who had ſhared in Don Carlos's juſt reſentment againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors.</p>
            <p>This cruel tribunal had not yet ſatiated its revenge. Some years after it imputed to this young prince, as a crime, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion he had extended to the inhabitants of the Netherlands, who were treated bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly. They declared, that as all the people in queſtion were heretics, the prince muſt neceſſarily be one, ſince he ſet up for their defender. In fine, they gained ſo ſtrange an aſcendant over the king's mind, that he, inſpired by a moſt unnatural ſpirit of bigotry, and being
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031999_0182_0FF09BE0622030D8"/>afraid of quarrelling with the Inquiſitors: ſentenced his ſon to die. The only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence the latter met with on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was to have the ſpecies of death left to his choice. The ill-fated prince, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like, had recourſe to the hot bath; when opening the veins of his arms and legs, he died gradually. Thus did this excellent young prince fall a martyr to the mercileſs Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>The year 1580 furniſhes us with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very remarkable inſtance, of the aſſuming ſpirit of this pretended holy tribunal.</p>
            <p>Cardinal Charles Borromeo, archbiſhop of Milan, who afterwards was canonized, going his viſitation of certain places, in his dioceſe, ſubordinate to him as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, and to the Swiſs cantons as to temporals; thought it neceſſary to make ſome regulations for the good of theſe churches.</p>
            <p>The Swiſs took umbrage at this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; when, without addreſſing the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, they ſent an embaſſador to the governor of Milan, intreating him not to let the prelate continue his viſitation in the places ſubject to them; and to aſſure him, that in caſe of refuſal, they would employ
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031999_0183_0FF09C34C0A83298"/>force; which muſt break the harmony it ſo highly concerned his ſovereign, the king of Spain to preſerve.</p>
            <p>The embaſſador being arrived in Milan, lodged at a rich merchant's houſe of his acquaintance. The Inquiſitor was no ſooner informed of this, than, diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law of nations, and the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences with which ſo great an outrage might be attended; he went, with all his officers, to the embaſſador's abode; when cauſing him to be ſhackled in his preſence, he hurried him away to the priſon of the Inquiſition. Though all perſons were ſtruck with horror, at ſuch an inſult of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to a ſtate in the perſon of its embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, yet no one dared to make the leaſt oppoſition. The merchant was the only perſon who intereſted himſelf in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for he, waiting upon the governor of Milan, told him the cruel uſage the embaſſador had met with. The governor ſent for the Inquiſitor, and obliged him to releaſe the embaſſador that inſtant; which being done, he paid him all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able honours, and complied with his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral demands. Thus the Swiſs were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their embaſſador's releaſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time with the news of
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031999_0184_0FF09BE2AFDCBB38"/>his impriſonment, otherwiſe they would have ſeized the cardinal, and uſed him exactly as the Inquiſitors had treated their embaſſador. The governor afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the archbiſhop, by a letter, that the intereſt of his catholic majeſty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abſolutely, that he ſhould diſcontinue his viſitations; which being done, things were quiet.</p>
            <p>The inſtances here given, prove ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, that if the Inquiſitors had kept within the bound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which the popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet to them, in eſtabliſhing their tribunal; (I mean the rooting up of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,) and had not concerned themſelves with politics; they would not have beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo inſolently towards monarchs, &amp;c. Let us now ſee ſome other examples of their treatment of perſons diſtinguiſhed by their birth and employments.</p>
            <p>Mark Antonio de Dominis was of a moſt illuſtrious Venetian family. He firſt entered among the Jeſuits; was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards biſhop of Segni, and at laſt arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Spalatro and primate of Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. He was thought the beſt ſkilled of any man of the age, in every branch of literature; eſpecially in divinity and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, both ſacred and prophane. This
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031999_0185_0FF09C5FC6F255E8"/>prelate was conſulted as an oracle, on every ſubject, and gave the higheſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all queriſts. Imbibing proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant principles, he defended them with the utmoſt vigour, in his Republica Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtica; and at the ſame time, wrote with greater vehemence againſt the pope and the court of Rome than its moſt inveterate enemies had ever done.</p>
            <p>The paſſionate deſire the prelate had to print this work in his life-time, and the little probability there was of his being able to ſtay in Italy after its publication, made him retire to Germany; whence he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went to England, whither he was invited by James I. king of Great Britain. Mark Antonio met with a gracious recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this theological monarch; he giving him an honourable ſupport; and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that lay in his power, to engage him to renounce the errors of the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the pope, whether he was unwilling to leave a man of ſo exalted a character, in the hands of the enemies to the Romiſh church; or rather, as it afterwards appeared, had reſolved to be revenged of, and make a public exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031999_0186_0FF09BC230EE0810"/>of him; ſet every engine at work, to induce him to return to his native country. At laſt, Don Diego Sarmiento da Cunna, the Spaniſh embaſſador at the Britiſh court, made Mark Antonio ſuch ſplendid offers, that he was prevailed upon to return to Italy.</p>
            <p>This unhappy prelate then forgot the maxims he had ſo frequently inculcated in his works, viz. That no perſon can offend the court of Rome with impunity, and that it never pardons an injury: for Mark Antonio, ſpite of the ſtrong exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his friends in England, who were for ever repreſenting to him the dangers to which he would inevitably expoſe himſelf, ſet out for Rome, where he was no ſooner arrived than he found his miſtake too late. The pontiff did not keep one of the promiſes made to Mark Antonio, but obliged him to abjure publicly the pretended hereſies advanced in his books. He was now left, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, at liberty; but was ever follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſpies, who, at laſt, falſely ſwore that he carried on a ſecret correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with England. Immediately the Inquiſitors ſeized this great man; but carrying on his proſecution with their uſual
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031999_0187_0FF09BCCA8C35550"/>dilatorineſs, he died in priſon, either thro' grief for the wrong ſteps taken by him; or through fear of the ſhameful and cruel puniſhment which he was ſenſible awaited him.</p>

               </gap> of perſons who ſwore that he was not a Chriſtian. Some time after, his only ſon and daughter were ſeized and confined in the ſame priſon. Theſe children, who were very young, impeached their father; whether excited thereto by evil counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, or that the tortures had extorted the impeachment from them. At laſt the unhappy father was ſentenced to be burnt alive, on the depoſitions of his children. The day of the Auto da Fé being come, the ſon drew near to his parent, to crave forgiveneſs and his bleſſing, but the ill-fated father replied; <q>I pardon you
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031999_0188_0FF09BBBC19BD998"/>both, though you are the ſole cauſe or my ignominious and cruel death; as to my bleſſing, I cannot give it you; for he is not my ſon, who makes a pretended confeſſion of untruths; and who, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the ſame Auto da Fé were likewiſe burnt Donna Beatrix Carvalho, of a noble family of Elvas, and wife to Jacomo de Mello; ſhe being ſentenced to die for judaiſm, on the oaths of her children. There is no doubt but that, had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors acted with ſincerity and equity, and with a real intention to find out the truth, they might have diſcovered the innocence of the lady in queſtion; as well as that of the above Signior Nobre, by comparing the confeſſions which each of
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031999_0189_0FF09B909A94BBB8"/>their children had made ſeparately, with the depoſitions of the witneſſes. A wide difference would certainly have been found, on this occaſion, in the facts and circumſtances. Truth admits of no variation; and is ever the ſame, in the mouths of thoſe who follow its dictates. Thus, by confronting them, new lights muſt have been ſtruck out; but then the doing this would not have brought on the confiſcation of the poſſeſſions of the two victims in queſtion, the ſwallowing up of which was the ſole view of the Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>Here follows another inſtance of the brutal injuſtice of the Inquiſitors: Joſeph Pereira Meneſes, captain general of his Portugueze majeſty's ſleets in India, was ordered by the governor of Goa to ſail, with his fleet, to the ſuccour of the city of Diu, then beſieged by the Arabs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his voyage, he was detained hy contrary winds, at Bacaim; whereby the Arabs had an opportunity of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Diu, and of coming back laden with rich ſpoils, before the arrival of the ſuccours brought by Pereira Meneſes. This commander being returned to Goa, was immediately ſeized by order of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031999_0190_0FF09B8811D80610"/>de Mello de Caſtro, governor of that place, and a ſworn enemy to Pereira. His proſecution was then ordered, when he was accuſed of loitering at Bacaim, purpoſely to avoid engaging the enemy; and thus to have cauſed, by his neglect and cowardice, the ruin and plunder of Diu. However, as governors are not permitted to put commanders to death, without firſt obtaining an expreſs order from the court of Portugal; Antonio de Mello could not take away his enemy's life; for which reaſon he pronounced ſuch a ſentence upon him, as was more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than death itſelf to a man of honour. Pereira, purſuant to the judgment paſſed upon him, was led by the common exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner through the ſtreets, with a halter about his neck, and a diſtaff at his ſide. A herald walking before, cried aloud, That this puniſhment was inflicted on him by the king, for being a coward and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Pereira was then carried back to priſon, where a familiar of the Inquiſition came and demanded him. This freſh ſtep ſurpriſed every one, who knew that he could not juſtly be accuſed of judaiſm, as he was of an ancient Chriſtian family, and had always behaved with honour.—
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031999_0191_0FF09BF0C132C728"/>The day of the Auto da Fé was therefore expected with impatience by the people, in order that his crime might be made known to them: but how great was their ſurpriſe, when the priſoner did not come forth in the proceſſion.</p>
            <p>Pereira had long been engaged in a quarrel with a gentleman, once his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend, and who was ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him before this misfortune. This falſe friend, harbouring a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to revenge himſelf whenever an opportunity ſhould offer, thought this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of Pereira the moſt favourable for his purpoſe, that could have happened. He now ſuborned five of Pereira's domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, who accuſed their maſter to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, of ſodomy; making oath that they had ſeen him perpetrate that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable crime with one of his pages, who thereupon was ſeized. The latter, having leſs courage than his maſter; and dreading a cruel death, in caſe he ſhould not do all he was commanded; and finding no other way to ſave his life than by pleading guilty, charged himſelf with a crime of which he was entirely innocent; and thus became, purſuant to the practice of the Inquiſitors, a freſh witneſs againſt his maſter. The
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031999_0192_0FF09B99F85032E0"/>ſervant, by this confeſſion, ſaved his own life, and was baniſhed to Mozambique in Africa.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as Pereira perſiſted in declaring himſelf innocent, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt alive; and would have been committed to the flames, had not his continual proteſtations of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; or rather a ſecret eſteem which the Inquiſitors ever entertained for him, made them ſuſpend his execution; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to try whether they might not, in time, prevail with him to make a confeſſion; or find opportunities to clear up the affair. For this reaſon he was ordered to remain in priſon till next Auto da Fé.</p>
            <p>During this interval, the Inquiſitors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the priſoner and his witneſſes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times; when interrogating the latter ſeparately, whether the moon ſhone the night in which, purſuant to their oath, their maſter committed the deteſtable crime in queſtion, they varied in their anſwers. Being now put to the torture, they denied all they before had ſwore againſt their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The accuſers were then ſeized, and Joſeph Pereira being declared innocent, came out of priſon next Auto da Fé, ſtripped of all his poſſeſſions and quite
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031999_0193_0FF09BCEA57D9478"/>ruined. His chief accuſer was baniſhed during nine years to Africa, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were ſentenced to the Galley for five years.</p>
            <p>The above-mentioned example ſhows, that the Inquiſitors make hereſy a pretence, merely to ſeize upon the wealth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and that this tribunal gives a wicked man the ſineſt opportunity poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſatiate his vengeance.—The ſpirit which animates the Inquiſitors eſtabliſhed in the Eaſt Indies, muſt really be horrid, ſince even the Jeſuits themſelves, thus ſpeak of them, in their univerſal Latin and French Dictionary, printed at Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voux. <q>The Inquiſition (ſay theſe moſt righteous fathers) is vaſtly ſevere in India. 'Tis true, indeed, that ſeven witneſſes are required to ſwear againſt a man, in order for his being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but then the depoſitions of a ſlave, or of a child are admitted. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner muſt accuſe himſelf, and he never ſees, nor is confronted, with thoſe who ſwear againſt him. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who happens to let drop the leaſt word againſt the church; or does not ſpeak, with ſufficient reverence of the
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031999_0194_0FF09C841BF07740"/>Inquiſition, ſhall be impeached.—The ſtandard or banner of the Inquiſition is of red ſilk, in which a croſs is paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; having an olive bough on one ſide; and on the other a ſword, with theſe words of the Pſalmiſt round it: "Ariſe, Lord, and judge thy cauſe."</q> What a ſolemn mockery have we here of ſcripture, and how deteſtable a uſe is made of a ſupplication of the Pſalmiſt!—Is this religion? Does this ſpirit deſcend from above? Surely no; but ſeems dictated ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the black chiefs of Milton's infernal council.</p>
            <p>The following inſtance proves, that the Inquiſitors will condemn an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rather than permit any of their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to be diſproved.</p>
            <p>A major in a Portugueze regiment was charged with profeſſing judaiſm privately, and hurried away to the priſon of the Inquiſition in Liſbon. Being deſcended of a family diſtinguiſhed by the name of new Chriſtians, this proved a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt him. He then was aſked, ſeveral times, the cauſe of his ſeizure, though he himſelf was an utter ſtranger to it. After he was kept in priſon two years, the Inquiſitors told him, that he was
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031999_0195_0FF09CA0C3E08208"/>accuſed and duly convicted, of being a relapſed Jew, which he utterly denied; proteſting that he had been always a true and faithful Chriſtian. In a word, they could not prevail with him, either by threats or promiſes, to plead guilty to any one article of which he ſtood impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he declaring reſolutely to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that he would die with innocence, rather than preſerve his life by an action, which muſt cover him with eternal infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Duke d'Aveyro, then Inquiſitor-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who was deſirous of ſaving this officer, being one day upon his viſitation, ſtrongly exhorted him to embrace the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he had of extricating himſelf; but the priſoner continuing inflexible, the Inquiſitor was fired, and ſpoke thus to him: "Doſt thou imagine that we'll have "the lie on this occaſion?" The Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor then withdrew, leaving the priſoner to his reflections on what he had heard. Surely theſe words employed a meaning inconſiſtent with the character of an upright judge, and ſtrongly ſpoke the iniquitous ſpirit of this tribunal.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Auto da Fé approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our victim was condemned to the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031999_0196_0FF09CDAEE7DA450"/>flames, and a confeſſor ſent to him. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at this horrid death, he, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely innocent, declared himſelf guilty of the crime laid to his charge. His poſſeſſions were then conſiſcated; after which he was made to walk in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in the habit of one relapſed; and laſtly, was ſentenced to the Gallies for five years.</p>
            <p>William Lithgow, a Scotchman, had ever retained a ſtrong inclination for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. To gratify it, he firſt went to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga, and there agreed with the captain of a French ſhip, to carry him to Alexandria. Before this ſhip ſet ſail, an Engliſh fleet, fitted out againſt the Algerines, came and caſt anchor before Malaga, the 7th of October, 1620; which threw the whole city into the utmoſt conſternation; theſe ſhips being ſuppoſed to belong to Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans. However, next morning, they found their miſtake; when the governor ſeeing the Britiſh croſs in the flags, went on board the ſhip of the Admiral, Sir Robert Manſel, who received him with the greateſt politeneſs; ſo that at his return, he removed the fears of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and made them lay down their arms. On the morrow, ſeveral of the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031999_0197_0FF09C8A39E34E30"/>crew came on ſhore; and being Lithgow's particular friends, ſpent ſome days in viewing the curioſities of the city, and in otherwiſe diverting themſelves; and then inviting him on board, they preſented him to the admiral, from whom he met with all imaginable civility. They kept Lithgow on board next day after which he returned to Malaga, and the fleet ſet ſail.</p>
            <p>As Lithgow was returning to his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through bye ſtreets, in order to carry all his things on board the French ſhip, which was to ſail that night for Alexandria; he was ſeized by nine catchpoles, or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who took him before the governor, to whom he complained of the violence which had been done him. The governor anſwered only by a nod; and bid certain perſons, with the town ſecretary, to go and examine him. This was to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with all poſſible ſecrecy, to prevent the Engliſh merchants, reſiding in Malaga, from bearing of his arreſt.</p>
            <p>The council aſſembling, he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and being ſuſpected to be an Engliſh ſpy, they did all that lay in their power to make ſome diſcovery to that purpoſe,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031999_0198_0FF09C7A24B990C8"/>but in vain. They afterwards aſked the names of the captains of the fleet; whether Lithgow, before his leaving England, did not know of the fitting out of this fleet? Why he refuſed the offer which the Engliſh admiral made of taking him on board his ſhip? In a word, they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was a ſpy; and that he had been nine months in Malaga, in no other view than to give intelligence, to the Engliſh court, of the time when the Spaniſh fleet was expected from India. They then obſerved, that his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with the officers, and a great many more of his countrymen on board this fleet, who had ſhewed him the higheſt civilities, were ſtrong indications of his guilt.</p>
            <p>As Lithgow found it impoſſible to eraſe theſe bad impreſſions, he intreated them to ſend for a bag, containing his letters and other papers; the peruſal of which, he declared, would prove his innocence. The bag being accordingly brought, and the contents of it examined, they were found to conſiſt chiefly of paſſports, and teſtimonials from ſeveral perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; a circumſtance which, inſtead of leſſening their ſuſpicions, ſerved only to
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031999_0199_0FF09CA2A030FB68"/>heighten them. Preſently a ſubaltern officer came into the room to ſearch him, and took eleven ducats out of his pocket. Stripping him afterwards to his ſhirt, they found in the waiſtband of his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the value of 548 ducats, in gold. Lithgow putting on his cloaths again, was conducted to a ſecure place, and from thence removed to an horrid dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where he was allowed neither bed nor bedding; and only an ounce and half of muſty bread, and a pint of water daily.</p>
            <p>As he would confeſs nothing, he was put to the torture three days after. The wretches had the inhumanity to make him undergo, in the ſpace of five hours, fifty different ſorts of torture; after which he was remanded back to priſon, where two eggs were given him, and a little hot wine, juſt to keep him alive.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion he received from a Turk, favours which he could not have hoped from perſons who ſtile themſelves Chriſtians. This Turk adminiſtered to him all the conſolation poſſible, and wept to ſee the cruelties exerciſed on Lithgow. He then informed him, that certain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh prieſts belonging to a ſeminary, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031999_0200_0FF09C7C8A181B40"/>with a Scotch cooper, had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time employed by the governor's order, in tranſlating into Spaniſh, all his books, and the obſervations made by him in his travels. The Turk added, that it was publicly reported, that he was a moſt notorious heretic. It was then, Lithgow naturally ſuppoſed, that every engine would be ſet at work, in order to ruin him.</p>
            <p>Two days after, the governor, with the Inquiſitor and two Jeſuits, came to Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow in priſon; when after aſking him ſeveral queſtions, and ſtrongly urging him to change his religion, they declared, that, having firſt ſeized him as a ſpy, they had diſcovered, by the tranſlation of his papers, that he ridiculed the bleſſed lady of Loretto; and ſpake very irreverently of his holineſs, Chriſt's vicegerent upon earth: that informations had been lodged againſt him before the Inquiſitors; that he ſhould be allowed eight days to return to the pale of the church; during which the Inquiſitor himſelf, and other prieſts, would give him all the inſtructions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to extricate him from his miſerable ſtate. They viſited him again ſeveral times, but without ſucceſs. In fine, the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031999_0201_0FF09C9785410FF0"/>eighth day being come, he was ſentenced to undergo eleven different tortures; when, in caſe he ſurvived them, he was to be carried to Granada, and burnt there, after eaſter holidays. The ſame evening he was put to the torture, and bore it with great reſolution, though the utmoſt cruelty was practiſed on this occaſion. He then was remanded to his dungeon, where ſome Turkiſh ſlaves brought him, ſecretly, refreſhments, which he was too weak to take. One of theſe ſlaves, though educated in the Mahommedan religion from his infancy, was ſo ſtrongly affected with the deplorable condition to which Lithgow was reduced, that he fell ſick for ſeveral days. However, a Mooriſh female ſlave amply compenſated for the kind Turk's abſence; ſhe being allowed more liberty in the priſon. This female ſlave brought Lithgow, daily, proviſions, with a little wine; and this courteſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>To conclude, at the time that Lithgow expected, every inſtant, to die in the moſt cruel torments, he was releaſed by a very unexpected accident. A Spaniard of diſtinction being at ſupper with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the latter informed him of every
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031999_0202_0FF09C72636A1210"/>thing that had happened to Lithgow, ſince his impriſonment. As he had deſcribed, minutely, the various tortures he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, a young Flemiſh ſervant, who uſed to wait on the Spaniſh gentleman at table, moved to compaſſion at the ſad relation of the barbarity exerciſed on Lithgow, and his being ſentenced to the flames; fell into into ſuch agonies, that he could not ſleep the whole night. Getting up next morning by day break, he went, unknown to any one, to an Engliſh factor; and informed him of the converſation which had paſſed between the governor and his maſter. The ſervant being gone, the Engliſhman ſent for the other ſix factors, his countrymen, reſiding in Malaga; when, conſulting together, they reſolved to write to Madrid, to Sir—Aſton, the Engliſh embaſſador; who preſenting a memorial to the Spaniſh king and council, Lithgow was releaſed and put on board Sir Robert Manſel's fleet, then lying at anchor before Malaga. The poor victim was ſo vaſtly weak, that they were forced to carry him, upon blankets. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral afterwards demanded Lithgow's books, papers, money, &amp;c. but no other anſwer
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031999_0203_0FF09C8637778A08"/>was returned him than mere compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lithgow's Travels; and Limbroch's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Inquiſition, tranſlated by the Rev.

            <p>Gonſalvius gives us an example, which ſhows that vice is not the object of the Inquiſitors hatred.—A poor inhabitant of Seville, who ſupported his family by his daily labour, had the mortification to have his wife kept forcibly from him by a prieſt, which yet was winked at by the Inquiſition, and every other tribunal. As this man was one day diſcourſing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purgatory, with ſome of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ſpoke in ſuch terms, as though he intended only to diſburden his mind: As to myſelf, (ſays he) I have my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in this world, by my wife's being thus with-held from me by the prieſt. Theſe words being told to the eccleſiaſtic, he impeached the huſband to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as having advanced ſome errors relating to the doctrine of purgatory. Hereupon the Inquiſitors, without once reproaching the prieſt for his crime, ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the huſband. The latter then was impriſoned two years; and, after walking
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031999_0204_0FF09D2C035C2B20"/>in the proceſſion at the firſt Auto da Fé, and being ſentenced to wear, during three years, the ſan benito, in a private priſon; at the expiration of that term, he was ordered, either to be continued in priſon, or to be releaſed, as the Inquiſitors ſhould ſee fitting. Theſe carried their cruelties to ſuch lengths, as to confiſcate, to the uſe of their tribunal, the little that this unhappy creature had in the world, and permitted the prieſt to ſtill enjoy his wife; the holy lecher being paſſionately fond of her.</p>
            <p>The various inſtances given above, all of them compiled from authors of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved veracity, ſufficiently ſhow, that the Inquiſition is the moſt iniquitous, and moſt inhuman tribunal on earth.</p>

                        <p>It has come to our knowledge, even from public report, that certain ſocieties, companies, meetings, aſſemblies, clubs, or conventicles, commonly called De Liberi Muratori, or Free-Maſons, or by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other name the ſame in different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are diſtinguiſhed, ſpread far and wide, and are every day increaſing; in which perſons, of whatever religion or ſect, contented with a kind of an affected ſhew of natural honeſty, confederate together in a cloſe and inſcrutable bond, according to laws and orders agreed upon between them;

               <l>With a ſong to Free-maſons of friendſhip and love.</l>
               <l>Inſpir'd by the theme the divinity flies,</l>
               <l>And thron'd on a rainbow before her ariſe,</l>

               <l>She views murder'd merit by ruffian-hand fall,</l>
               <l>And the grave gives its dead up at fellowſhips call,</l>
               <l>While the craft by their badges their innocence prove,</l>
               <l>And the ſong of free-maſons is friendſhip and love.</l>
               <l>From thoſe ages remote ſee the muſe ſpreads her way,</l>
               <l>To join in the glory the preſent diſplay;</l>
               <l>In freedom and friendſhip ſhe ſees the true band</l>
               <l>With virtue and ſplendour illumine the land;</l>
               <l>Religion's pure beams break the vapours of night,</l>
               <l>And from darkneſs myſterious the word gives the light,</l>
               <l>While lodges below, as the choirs from above,</l>
               <l>Join the ſong of free-maſons in friendſhip and love,</l>
               <l>That the future might keep what the preſent beſtows,</l>
               <l>In rapture prophetic the cherub aroſe;</l>
               <l>As he ſung thro' the ſkies angels echoed the ſound,</l>
