            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHILE I vent the fulneſs of my heart in the ſincereſt congratulations of you and myſelf, and our common country, on the arrival of the auſpicious day, which gives confirmed Sovereignty and Independence to confederate America, and pours into her boſom the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a ſafe, advantageous, honorable PEACE, the charms of which are vaſtly heightened and endeared to us by the horrid contraſt of an eight years' cruel War;— permit me at the ſame time to remind you, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign of this ſolemn aſſembly ſhould give a religious direction to our common joy, and conſecrate it into the livelieſt gratitude to that SUPREME POWER, who at once ſtiles himſelf a MAN OF WAR, and the GOD OF PEACE. That the rapture of our hearts on ſo glorious an occaſion may be thus guided into a holy channel, and elevated into a pious tranſport of God-exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adoration and thankſgiving—let us turn our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations to a noble pattern of this kind in the grateful, exulting Jews, on their liberation from the Babyloniſh captivity, as we have it exhibited in the
<q>
                  <bibl>126 PSALM, 3 firſt Verſes.</bibl>
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging: then ſaid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS the deliverance here celebrated by the church of God, was the moſt illuſtrious of any in the Old-Teſtament annals, and a moſt remarkable type of our ſpiritual redemption by the Meſſiah; as many of its
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018203_0003_0FA5BD24CB5F3D58"/>
leading circumſtances bear a ſtriking ſimilarity to thoſe which have diſtinguiſhed and dignified the ſalvation of united America; and as their ſentiments and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments upon it are ſuch as remarkably ſuit and become every American heart and tongue on the preſent occaſion; — let us therefore run over the affecting picture, which they themſelves give of the matter in the words now read: —in which they relate <hi>in the firſt place</hi> the pleaſing, over-whelming SURPRISE that ſeized their minds on firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the glorious tidings—"When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" —As if they had ſaid,—"The deliverance was ſo great and glorious in itſelf, ſo aſtoniſhing in its circumſtances, ſo ſudden in its accompliſhment, ſo unexpected and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable in every human view, ſo far above our higheſt ideas and hopes, ſo oppoſite to our juſt deſerts and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions—that we could ſcarce credit the teſtimony of our own ſenſes, and were ready to imagine the news of liberty no better than the pleaſing dream of a tranſported, deluded fancy, or the airy, baſeleſs fabrick of a midnight viſion." So Peter, when a celeſtial meſſenger knocked off his priſon-chains, and brought him forth to liberty, was at firſt ſo ſurpriſed at the ſudden, extraordinary deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that he could not believe it to be a waking reality, but only a viſionary picture painted on his imagination.— And doubtleſs the firſt ideas and feelings of many an American heart, on the news of the equitable, liberal treaty of peace, ratified between Britain and theſe Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign States, were nearly coincident with this deſcription: —for, the improbability of the haughty Monarch and Court of Britain's ever ſubmitting, (at leaſt at preſent,) to ſuch mortifying conceſſions, eſpecially of their adopting ſo generous a ſyſtem of policy, ſo contradictory to the narrow, deceitful, underhanded, cruel politics, which, before, they had uniformly purſued towards this country; —the diſappointment of our ſanguine proſpects of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in ſome former ſtages of this conteſt;—the long continuance of our diſtreſſes;—the viſible growing dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy and wickedneſs of America, under the judgments of Heaven, ſent and ſo long continued for her correction and reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—theſe, and many other diſcouraging
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018203_0004_0FA5BD25B252CC18"/>
ideas, combined their influence to render the glorious tidings of peace a very ſurpriſing, unexpected, overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound in the ears of many ſober Americans—a ſound too grand, good, joyful, to gain their ready confident belief—"Their rapture ſeem'd a pleaſing dream, the grace appear'd ſo great."</p>
            <p>"Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging"—The ſurpriſe of ſuch a deliverance produced an extaſy of joy; ſo that we could ſcarce reſtrain our paſſions or our tongues within the bounds of decency or decorum. "Then ſaid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them." Thoſe Heathen neighbours, who had obſerved and inſulted the diſtreſſed, abject ſtate of theſe captive exiles, were now conſtrained to own the ſuperintending, triumphant power, wiſdom and goodneſs of Jehovah, in their ſurpriſing deliverance—in reſcuing his feeble Iſrael out of the hands of their mighty oppreſſors, when they were without friends, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, without any enlivening hope or ſpirit—in raiſing up for them in this ſituation, and effecting their inſtant deliverance by a moſt unlikely inſtrument indeed, a Pagan, idolatrous Monarch, a ſtranger and an enemy both by nation and religion, the King of that very empire, which held them in ſervitude as its legal, conquered captives, and eſteemed and treated them as the loweſt dregs of mankind!—that ſuch a Prince, without any human ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, without, yea, contrary to, any of the uſual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of human policy, ſhould proclaim the remains of poor, oppreſſed Iſrael, a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> nation, and furniſh them, out of his own treaſures, with every requiſite for the re-eſtabliſhment and ſecure enjoyment of their ancient privileges in their own land—this was ſuch a ſpectacle of divine wonders in behalf of that people, as extorted a confeſſion from the moſt ſtupid idolaters, that Jehovah, the God of Iſrael, was far ſuperior to their idol-deities.—Juſt ſo, my brethren, the ſucceſsful ſtruggles of oppreſſed America, at firſt a feeble, naked, friendleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, againſt the gigantic power of Britain, a nation then reſpectable and terrible to all the world for military prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, ſtrength and glory,—have diſplayed an auguſt ſpectacle of divine manifeſtations in our favour, which commands
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018203_0005_0FA5BD2643B7B8A0"/>
the admiring attention of the world—All Europe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popiſh or Proteſtant, Chriſtian or Infidel, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the advancing ſtages of this conteſt with growing aſtoniſhment:—and while our wonderful ſucceſs has given a luſtre and dignity to our national character in the eyes of mankind, I doubt not but all ſober obſervers, and, one would think, all that are not abandoned Atheiſts, are conſtrained to ſay, the Lord hath done great things for America. Even the poor Indian ſavages around us, could make this remark on ſome great victory or deliverance granted to our pious, praying fathers—"Your God muſt be a very great and good Spirit, to hear and anſwer your prayers in ſo ſurpriſing a manner!"—If then Heathens, idolaters and ſcoffers are compelled to own a Superior Hand in theſe great events, with what eager, grateful tranſport ſhould thoſe, in whoſe behalf they are wrought, reply as in the next verſe—"The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad"—He hath done great things FOR US—Our Heathen neighbours are only cool ſpectators, but we are the feeling, happy ſubjects of the ſurpriſing mercy—"whereof we are glad":—our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are ſtruck with amazement, and ſome of them filled with rage and vexation; but we are filled with grateful joy—a joy proportioned to the greatneſs of the bleſſing, and the evidence we have that it flows from a God that is reconciled, and in friendſhip with his now penitent, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, reformed Iſrael.—As I mean to make the pious aſcription in this third verſe, the principal baſis of the enſuing part of my diſcourſe, I ſhall accordingly attempt to ſhew,</p>
            <p>FIRST, When the interpoſitions of Jehovah in favour of his people may be ſtiled <hi>great,</hi> or what it is that ſtamps them with this high character: which will naturally bring into view the principal events which have introduced and eſtabliſhed the American revolution. And then,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Point out and enforce the manner, in which the happy ſubjects of ſuch great divine manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould entertain and improve them.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting the FIRST HEAD, I would premiſe, that <hi>all</hi> the works of Jehovah are great, as being the products and diſplays of infinite perfection, and deſigned and adapted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018203_0006_0FA5BD26D03D0350"/>
to ſome very grand and excellent end:—particularly, all his acts of kindneſs to any of our fallen ſpecies, are the fruits of a benevolence infinitely great, prompting and co-operating with equal knowledge and power. But though all God's benevolent works are in this reſpect equal, as proceeding from the ſame efficient and impulſive Cauſe, yet the effects hereof, as terminating upon, and diſplaying the divine goodneſs and other attributes to the view of the creature, are almoſt infinitely diverſified: and in this view, ſome of the kind diſpenſations of Heaven are vaſtly, unſpeakably greater than others. For inſtance, thoſe fruits of divine goodneſs, which have a very great intrinſic worth—which carry in them a deliverance, or ſecurity from very great and terrible evils, and a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of many poſitive bleſſings—which promiſe very durable advantages, or draw after them a long ſeries of beneficial conſequences—which embrace great numbers of perſons as joint-ſharers in the important benefit—which triumph over mighty obſtacles that lie in their way— which are conferred in an uncommon, unexpected, ſudden, improbable, or peculiarly ſeaſonable manner;—ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or effects of divine goodneſs, may be ſtiled <hi>great</hi> in an emphatical and moſt glorious ſenſe. There was a ſignal concurrence of many of theſe heightening circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending the liberation of the Jewiſh captives ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the text. But the divine manifeſtations in favour of theſe United States, in which we this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, are eminently marked with <hi>all</hi> theſe dignifying characters —For the benefits granted, poſſeſs a vaſt <hi>intrinſic </hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> no leſs than INDEPENDENT LIBERTY, both civil and religious; the confirmed power of chooſing our own government and worſhip, of enacting our own laws, of acquiring and enjoying our own property, of regulating and extending our own commerce, and, in a word, of ſecurely and peaceably enjoying the moſt valuable tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings and ſpiritual privileges, in the greateſt and beſt country in the world! Will any ſon or daughter of America, in the view of theſe precious gifts, now ratified to us by Heaven, venture to ſpeak in a contemptuous or murmuring tone, of the iſſue of our long ſtruggle with Tyranny, as if we had reaped no other harveſt from it,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018203_0007_0FA5BD279963E890"/>
than the loſs of a great deal of our choiceſt blood, and an inſupportable weight of debt and of taxes for many years to come?—But what, my friends, are theſe ſacrifices and inconveniences, compared with thoſe <hi>terrible evils,</hi> from which Heaven, by this conflict, has delivered and ſecured us?—compared with unconditional ſubmiſſion to a foreign legiſlature <hi>in all caſes whatſoever,</hi> which was expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Britiſh Parliament, and attempted to be enforced by the whole military power of the nation—a demand, which, at one ſtroke, annihilated the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of liberty in this country, and placed her in the loweſt, baſeſt ſtate of vaſſalage, without leaving to her the leaſt right or property in any inſtance whatever! And as complete ſervitude muſt have been the immediate effect of a paſſive, non-reſiſting ſubmiſſion to this deſpotic claim; ſo if Heaven had permitted them to ſeduce or conquer us into this ſubjection, after reſiſting them with our arms, the conſequences muſt have been ſtill more inſupportably dreadful:—for a conqueſt would at once have made the Court of Britain both lords and landlords of this whole continent: and while our principal leaders, in the cabinet and field, would have been doomed to the block, or the gallows, the reſt of us, with our children, down perhaps to late poſterity, muſt have been humble, cringing tenants and ſlaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water, to the haughty minions of Britiſh power! Let us ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, my brethren, theſe tremendous evils, which we had ſo much reaſon to fear, together with thoſe we have actually felt from the diſappointed ambition and cruelty of our foes:—let our thoughts take a range through their polluted priſon-ſhips, and other murderous places of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, which have ſlain ſo many of our deſerving ſons— let us viſit the many populous towns wantonly conſumed, with the vaſt amount of property pillaged or deſtroyed, by their hands, with the many other traces of a baſe, vindictive ſpirit, which has marked their conduct towards us:—let us caſt a retroſpective eye on the many awful ſcenes of blood and carnage, of havock and depredation, with the long train of evils, both natural and moral, which compoſe War's gloomy retinue;—and then ſay, whether that event which puts a period to all theſe diſtreſſes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils,

and fears, which anchors our political ſhip in the harbour of ſecurity and peace, after having ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered the rage of ſo tempeſtuous a ſea,—is not a very great and capital mercy of Heaven!—a mercy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enhanced and ſweetned by the long and gloomy ſcenes of trouble which have preceded and introduced it!—A mercy too of a very <hi>complicated</hi> kind, not only as it ſaves us from ſuch a complication of evils, but as it carries in its bowels, or naturally draws after it, a long chain of important <hi>poſitive</hi> bleſſings, of <hi>extenſive</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.—For beſides the uſual ſweets and benefits of peace, accompanied with freedom, in the full ſcope and animating encouragement it gives to induſtry, to arts, to ſcience, to every noble, advantageous employment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and gratification of life—beſides theſe, the peaceful eſtabliſhment of our liberty and independence opens to us far more extenſive and glorious proſpects—it preſents us with a fair opportunity, with the nobleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements and advantages, for converting this immenſe northern continent into a ſeat of knowledge and freedom, of agriculture and commerce, of uſeful arts and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, of Chriſtian piety and virtue, and thus making it an inviting and comfortable abode for many millions of the human ſpecies, an aſylum for the injured and oppreſſed in all parts of the globe, the delight of God and good men, the joy and praiſe of the whole earth, ſoaring on the wings of literature, wealth, population, religion, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and every thing that is excellent and happy, to a greater height of perfection and glory than the world has ever yet ſeen.—It likewiſe opens a door for an extenſive commercial intercourſe between us and all nations, and directly leads to a rapid increaſe of it among the various parts of the world: which is not only an inexhauſtible ſource of wealth and opulence, but tends to expand the human mind, to introduce a reciprocation of good offices and benefits, "a general knowledge of wants, and the means of ſupplying them, an experimental acquaintance with the neceſſity and beauty of hoſpitality, an univerſal enlargement of the habits of thinking," more rational ideas and a more liberal adminiſtration of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a better knowledge and reliſh of the ſacred rights
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018203_0009_0FA5BD2942ABA7A0"/>
of humanity; all which directly conduce to humanize, refine, and exalt the human mind and manners, and carry forward mankind to greater perfection and happineſs than have yet been attained.—Our late convulſion, with its preſent happy termination, tends to wake up and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the dormant flame of liberty in all quarters of the earth; to rouze up an oppreſſed, enſlaved world from that ſtupor which has ſo long benumbed it—to rouze it to a due inquiry into the natural rights of men, and its own diſgraceful and wretched ſituation in tamely ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the deprivation of them; to open the eyes of kings and ſubjects to the true principles of liberty and juſtice, and to the abſurdity and iniquity of tyranny and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in all their forms; and thus to lead mankind to a manly aſſertion, and a happy recovery and re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their civil and religious rights; and hereby open and prepare their minds for the more eaſy reception of the truth and grace of the goſpel.—Accordingly, every wheel of Providence ſeems to be now in motion to haſten on the downfal of tyranny, of Popiſh ſuperſtition and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, and promote the cauſe of freedom, knowledge and truth:—The deſtruction of the whole order of the Jeſuits, who were the main prop of the Papal power; the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſecution in many European countries, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>France,</hi> where the preſent truly great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Monarch has placed the Proteſtants on an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his other ſubiects; and in <hi>Germany,</hi> where liberty of conſcience is granted to all peaceable ſubjects, of every denomination; the downfal of the helliſh Inquiſition in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the liberal inſtitutions which begin to take place in that country, ſo remarkable, hitherto, for a blind, narrow, furious, perſecuting bigotry; the ſecret contempt, in which almoſt all the learned and more knowing, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh countries, are ſaid to hold the abſurdities and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of that religion; the rapid progreſs of knowledge, and a ſpirit of free inquiry, of late years, over the earth; —theſe and other ſimilar events form a grand chain of Providence, in which the American Revolution is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal link—a chain, which is gradually drawing after it the moſt glorious conſequences to mankind; which is haſtening on the accompliſhment of the ſcripture-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

relative to the <hi>Millenial State,</hi> the golden age of the church and world in the latter days.—How magnificently great do the works of Jehovah towards America appear, when viewed in this light! What complicated, extended, laſting advantages ſeem to be wrapped up in them, not only to many millions in this Weſtern World, but to countleſs multitudes, as we truſt, in various parts of the globe!</p>
            <p>If we go on to apply the other characters of greatneſs enumerated above, relating to the manner in which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favours are conferred, or deliverances wrought, we find them all emphatically verified in God's gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations towards America. For was it not a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, unexpected, unlikely ſpectacle, to ſee Heaven not only raiſe up and inſpirit as it were an infant from its cradle, to encounter a mighty, armed giant, but to guide, aid, and ſucceed its untaught, feeble efforts, and infatuate, confound, baffle its boaſting, terrible antagoniſt, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner almoſt unparalleled in the annals of the word? Was it not an extraordinary phenomenon in the political world, for ſo many diſtinct and diſtant ſtates, ſo different in many reſpects in their education, laws, cuſtoms, manners, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and intereſts,—not only to unite in one common cauſe, but to preſerve and even ſtrengthen their union amidſt all the ſerpentine, unwearied artifices of a ſubtle enemy to divide them; inſomuch that the very meaſures they took to diſunite and deſtroy us, have uniformly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to defeat their own deſigns and expectations? Was it not a very unuſual ſpectacle, to ſee ſo young a country produce ſuch a number of able, ſpirited ſtateſmen and commanders, whoſe abilities and patriotiſm, whoſe equally judicious and vigorous meaſures, have at once ſaved their own country, and commanded the admiration and applauſe of the world? The late celebrated Lord <hi>Chatham,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our firſt general Congreſs, gives them this very honorable teſtimony—"I muſt declare and avow, that in all my reading and obſervation, for ſolidity of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, force of ſagacity, and wiſdom of concluſion, no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or body of men can ſtand in preference to the general Congreſs at Philadelphia." And if we turn our eyes from the cabinet to the camp, what an aſſemblage of wonders
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018203_0011_0FA5BD2F770EC1D0"/>
riſes to view in our illuſtrious military CHIEF!—A Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſtined by Heaven for juſt ſuch a period, country, and cauſe as ours!—whoſe judiciouſly cautious, defenſive, delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mode of conducting this war, has at once ſaved his own army and country, and weakened and worn down thoſe of the enemy:—a General, whoſe character combines all the different qualities of coolneſs and ſpirit, conſummate pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proportionate vigour, the moſt generous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and compaſſion joined with the moſt firm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted heroiſm, the moſt patient, unſhaken conſtancy under heavy diſcouragements and ſufferings, joined with a noble ſpirit of enterpriſe on all proper occaſions! My friends, while we contemplate this great character, placed at the head of our unexperienced forces, at ſuch a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſeaſonable juncture:—when we ſurvey the bright conſtellation of heroes under him, the ſubordinate officers and ſoldiers, whoſe hardſhips, toils, dangers, battles, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries—whoſe triumphant patience, courage, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, have inſtrumentally procured the bleſſings in which we now rejoice:—when we travel over the ſeveral bright ſtages of this conteſt, from the bloody, yet victorious NINETEENTH OF APRIL, 1775, to the ever-memorable preſervation of our young troops, and deſtruction of the veteran foe, at the battle of <hi>Bunker-hill;</hi> the brilliant, magnificent attacks and victories of <hi>Trenton</hi> and <hi>Princeton;</hi> the glorious capture of two whole Britiſh armies at <hi>Saratoga</hi> and <hi>Yorktown;</hi> the very critical detection and defeat of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold's black conſpiracy, by a train of nice and ſeemingly fortuitous incidents:—when to all this we add, the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing magnanimity, generoſity, and fidelity of the KING of France, the <hi>Cyrus</hi> of our Iſrael, whoſe paternal, liberal, effectual aid, afforded to us in our low eſtate, ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably reſembles the conduct of that ancient, noble Prince, whom Heaven inſpired, though an alien from their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to proclaim and effect the great deliverance cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by God's Iſrael in the text:—when we further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the top-ſtone of this grand fabrick laid, in the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a treaty of peace, which eſtabliſhes our unconditional independence, enlarges our territories, and gratifies our higheſt expectations and wiſhes:—and laſtly, when we reflect on the ill-deſerving, provoking character of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018203_0012_0FA5BD31129293E0"/>
people, in a moral view, for whom Jehovah has wrought all theſe wonders;—are we not conſtrained to own with raptures of grateful admiration, that the Lord hath indeed done great things for us—that his perfections have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed gloriouſly in our favour,—have triumphed not only over all the hoſtile attempts of our foes, but over all our own increaſing and crying guilt?</p>
            <p>What then remains but that we ſuitably entertain and improve theſe aſtoniſhing and endearing divine manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in our favour? Which is the SECOND THING to be illuſtrated and enforced.</p>
            <p>It becomes us then, in the firſt place, to aſcribe the whole glory of them to God, in imitation of the pious pattern of the text. This is nothing more than rendering to Jehovah his due:—this is a debt, which every ſacred motive, every ingenuous principle, every tie of gratitude, decency, and equity, forcibly urges us to pay. For, ſound reaſon, as well as revelation, teaches us, that all the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, proweſs, conduct and ſucceſs, which have guided and crowned our long conflict, have been derived from above—from the ſame Being, who raiſed up Moſes to lead his Iſrael from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and Cyrus to emancipate them from their <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſervitude. It was therefore a very fooliſh, as well as impious ſpeech of an European commander in a former war, <hi>that Providence always favours an hundred thouſand men;</hi> meaning, that notwithſtanding the influence of Providence, the ſtrongeſt army may be ſure of ſucceſs:—for there are a thouſand contingencies, which eſſentially affect the health, ſupplies, counſels, courage, operations and ſucceſs of an army, which no human ſagacity can foreſee, or human power controul, but which are wholly determined by an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, omnipotent Providence. To the God of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then let us couſecrate the gladneſs of this happy day—let us return back to him, in devout aſcriptions of praiſe, that full tide of joy, which He is pouring into our hearts—let us ſay, in the language of inſpiration,—"I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly" —"O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong; for his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten the victory"—"The Lord reigneth; let America—let the earth rejoice: let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018203_0013_0FA5BD315247A830"/>But while we religiouſly adore the governing providence of Jehovah, and gratefully aſcribe to him all thoſe great events which ſwell our boſoms with joy; let us beware that we do not impute theſe ſignal divine appearances in our favour, to any peculiar excellence in our national character. Alas, Sirs, the moral face of our country ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually confutes ſuch a vain-glorious ſentiment. Crimes of the blackeſt hue—countleſs multitudes of abominations, mark the viſible character of this great, this highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured community, and ſtill provoke the diſpleaſure of Heaven; while they ſerve as a foil to heighten and ſet off the triumphant freeneſs and riches of that goodneſs which has done ſuch great things for ſo unworthy a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as on the other hand, the turpitude and guilt of our national provocations are exceedingly enhanced by thoſe glorious manifeſtations of divine benevolence, againſt which they are committed. The preſent occaſion then loudly calls us to mingle the moſt humble penitence and contrition with our joyful gratitude and praiſe: and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there can be no truly grateful and holy joy in the goodneſs of God, without true humility, repentance, and reformation, for its foundation, companion, and fruit: for humble, godly ſorrow, and thankful joy, mutually beget, and ſtrengthen, and keep pace with each other; and no people, however highly favoured in external reſpects, have any ſure ground or warrant, or indeed any preſent moral capacity or meetneſs, for the exerciſe of true rejoicing in the divine goodneſs, while perſiſting in an impenitent courſe of rebellion againſt Him. Theſe conſiderations call upon us to rejoice with trembling, with humility, with a ſober, cautious, ſerious air, in oppoſition to all levity, pride, vain-glory, ſenſuality, carnal confidence and ſecurity. While we rejoice in the divine beneficence, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that for his own ſake he hath done theſe great things; not for any righteouſneſs in us; not merely that we might enjoy the exultation of victory and peace, or the pride of independence and empire; but that his own name may be exalted, that his own great deſigns, hinted above, of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Himſelf, and extending the kingdom of his Son, may be carried into effect: and though he has been uſing us in the late revolution as inſtruments of carrying forward
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018203_0014_0FA5BD3337027D30"/>
this glorious and benevolent plan, yet if we ourſelves <hi>mean not ſo,</hi>—if in our hearts and practice we are oppoſed to his intereſt and glory—if we as a people continue to fight againſt Him, after ſuch great diſplays as he has made of Himſelf before our eyes—if we abuſe the bleſſings of returning peace and public felicity to greater wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſin, to nouriſh a ſpirit of pride, ambition, luxury, diſſipation, venality, infidelity, and other concomitant vices; in this caſe our very proſperity will finally deſtroy us in the moſt aggravated manner; and God will promote the deſigns of his glory in our exemplary ruin, as he has now been doing in our ſurpriſing ſalvation.—Theſe ideas may well give a ſolemnity to our joy, and cauſe it to flow in the channel, and bring forth the fruits, of true holineſs. O let us exhibit our praiſes, not in word only, but in deed and in truth: let us teſtify the cordial ſincerity of our joys and thankſgivings on this occaſion, by a practical, ſteady conformity and obedience to that great and good Being, whom we profeſs to extol: and let me add, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous teſtimonies of our eſteem and gratitude for thoſe, whoſe toils, dangers, and ſufferings have eminently contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to our preſent ſecurity and happineſs—let our grateful love to the infinite Author, flow down and flow out, in ſuitable proportions, to the honored inſtruments of theſe ineſtimable benefits. Let thoſe men who have ſtood forth in the foremoſt rank of danger, and made the greateſt private ſacrifices to the public cauſe, whether in the ſenate or in the field, whether at home or in foreign climes,—let theſe live in our hearts—let their names and heroic deeds live and ſhine in our grateful annals, till time ſhall be ſwallowed up in eternity. Let us be eager to recompence their important labours of love for us and our children, for the unborn millions of our future deſcendants. Let us welcome the ſuffering ſoldier to the boſom of a free and peaceful country, with tears of gratitude, and ſmiles of applauſe—let us gladly divide with him thoſe ſweets of independence and wealth, which his gallantry and wounds have ſecured to us. Let us fly to ſooth the griefs, and wipe away the tears of the many widows and orphans, which this cruel war has made; and to relieve the mortifying diſtreſſes of poverty, into which it has plunged
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018203_0015_0FA5BD33966F4D28"/>
many of our meritorious citizens. Let us gladly contribute our ſhare towards fulfilling the engagements of the public, to all that have credited or in any way aſſiſted it, whether our own citizens or foreigners: and inſtead of complaining of the load of debt which lies upon us, let us bleſs God, that the great object of our long ſtruggle is obtained at ſo cheap a rate;—that our burden, however preſſing, is light, compared either with the value of the acquiſition or with the inſupportable load which muſt have fallen upon us, and cruſhed us into ruin, had we been re-united to Great-Britain:—let us be willing to ſacrifice the paltry, yet expenſive pleaſures and parade of luxury, prodigality, vain magnificence, and other impoveriſhing, though faſhionable vices, and practiſe frugality, induſtry, humility, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, with the whole train of private and patriotic virtues: then, by the bleſſing of God, we may hope that our country will ere long be delivered from every embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing difficulty, which retards her progreſs towards the zenith of perfection, and will become an ample theatre for the laſt and moſt glorious diſplays of the divine benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the human ſpecies. Who, that loves his country or mankind, can help exulting in ſo glorious a proſpect, and wiſhing to ſee it ſpeedily realized? That it may be ſo,—</p>
            <p>O Thou, GREAT ARBITER of the nations, who haſt done ſuch great things for us, ſtill guard, maintain, and perfect the magnificent ſtructure, which thy own hand hath reared in this weſtern world! Grant that here may ever dwell the uncorrupted faith, the pure worſhip, the benevolent, peaceful virtues of primitive Chriſtianity, extending their benign influences to the utmoſt bounds of this vaſt continent, and cauſing the wilderneſs and waſte places of America to bloſſom like the roſe, and flouriſh as the garden of God! May this infant-empire, this new-born nation live in thy ſight! May it grow and flouriſh under thy almighty patronage, in every thing that is great and good and happy, till all the ſtates and empires of the world ſhall be abſorbed in the everlaſting kingdom of thy Son!
