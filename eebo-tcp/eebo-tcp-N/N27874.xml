            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE WAY TO PLENTY, OR, THE HISTORY OF TOM WHITE. [CONCLUDED.]</head>
            <p>I THANK you for the hint, ſir, ſaid the farmer, "I am reſolved to rejoice though, and others ſhall rejoice with me: And we will have a merry night on't."</p>
            <p>So Mrs. White dreſſed a very plentiful ſupper of meat and pudding; and ſpread out two tables. The farmer ſat at the head of one, conſiſting of ſome of the neighbours, and all his work-people. At the other ſat his wife, with two long bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on each ſide of her. At theſe ſat all the old and infirm poor, eſpecially thoſe who lived in the workhouſe, and had no day of feſtivity to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the graſs, in the little court, ſat the children of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and of the other poor, whoſe employment it had been to gather flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and dreſs and adorn the horns of the
<pb n="3"
                   facs="unknown:037139_0003_100C93A78502CA88"

ram; for the farmer did not wiſh to put an end to any old cuſtom, if it was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. His own children ſtood by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they carried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</p>
            <p>This feaſt though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd dropped in with a good deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he had at his houſe, and they were much pleaſed. When the Doctor ſaw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoying themſelves, he was much moved; he ſhook the farmer by the hand, and ſaid, "But thou, when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recompence thee, but thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurrection of the juſt."</p>
            <p>"Sir," ſaid the farmer, "'tis no great matter of expence, I kill a ſheep of my own, potatoes are as plenty as blackber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with people who have a little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought. I ſave much more cider in the courſe of a year by never allowing any carouſing in my kitchen, or drunkenneſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037139_0004_100C93A911653F40"/>
in my fields, than would ſupply many ſuch feaſts as theſe, ſo that I ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the poorer at Chriſtmas. It is cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make people happy, ſir, than to make them drunk. The Doctor and the ladies condeſcended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtories, but not one profane word, or one indecent ſong; ſo that he was not forced to the painful neceſſity either of reproving them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they ſung the ſixty-fifth pſalm, and the ladies all joined in it, and when they got home to the vicarage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The HARD WINTER.</head>
               <p>In the famous cold winter of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year, 1795, it was edifying to ſee how patiently farmer White bore that long and ſevere froſt. Many of his ſheep were frozen to death, but he thanked GOD that he had ſtill many left. He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find in-door work that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was ſo conſiderate, that juſt at that time ſhe leſſened the number of her hogs, that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037139_0005_100C93AB32897448"/>
ſhe might have more whey and ſkim milk to aſſiſt poor families. Nay, I have known her live on boiled meat for a long while together, in a ſickly ſeaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pot-liquor made ſuch a ſupply of broth for the ſick poor. As the ſpring came on, and things grew worſe, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her houſe; though ſhe uſed to have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe good things, and will again I hope when the preſent ſcarcity is over; though ſhe ſays ſhe never will uſe ſuch white flour again, even if it ſhould come down to five ſhillings a buſhel.</p>
               <p>All the pariſh now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was ſure the froſt had killed the wheat. Farmer Wilſon ſaid the rye would never come up. Brown the maltſter inſiſted the barley was dead at the root. Butcher Jobbins ſaid beef would be a ſhilling a pound. All decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye; and as to hay there would be none to be had for love nor money.
<q>I'll tell you what, ſaid farmer White, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is dreadful.</q>
The crops are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037139_0006_100C93ACE689C8A0"/>
juſt now; but 'tis too early to to judge. Don't let us make things worſe than they are. We ought to comfort the poor, and you are driving them to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Don't you know how much GOD was diſpleaſed with the murmurs of his choſen people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he ſent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing ſatisfies grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers. We have a promiſe on our ſide, that there ſhall be ſeed time and harveſt time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide againſt an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it is come upon us, than ſink under it when it comes. Grumbling can't help us. Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity can. Let us ſet about planting pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes in every nook and corner, in caſe the corn <hi>should</hi> fail, which however I don't believe. Let us mend our management before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our honeſt labourers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head lands of our plowed fields, or other waſte bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</p>
               <p>The farmer had many temptations to end his corn at an extravagant price to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037139_0007_100C93AF99F5C080"/>
a <hi>certain sea port town;</hi> but as he knew that it was intended to export it againſt law, he would not be tempted to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage unlawful gain; ſo he threſhed out a ſmall mow at a time, and ſold it to the neighbouring poor far below the market price. He ſerved his own workmen firſt. This was the ſame to them as if he had raiſed their wages, and even  better, as it was a benefit of which their families were f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e to partake. If the poor in the next pariſh were more diſtreſſed than his own, he ſold to them at the ſame rate. "For," ſaid he, "there is no diſtinction of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in heaven, and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</p>
               <p>He had been uſed in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now reſolved to give up that pleaſure. So he parted from a couple of ſpaniels he had; for he could not bear that his dogs ſhould be eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meat, or the milk which ſo many men, women, and children wanted.</p>

               <head>The WHITE LOAF.</head>
               <p>ONE day, it was about the middle of July, 1795 when things ſeemed to be at the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037139_0008_100C93B1F0DE1DD8"/>
deareſt, and the Rulers of the land had agreed to ſet the example of eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but coarſe bread. Doctor Shepherd read, before ſermon, in the church their public declaration, which the magiſtrates of the county ſent him, and had alſo ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. Mrs. White of courſe was at church, and commended it mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Next morning the Doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to ſettle further plans for the relief of the pariſh. He was much ſurpriſed to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall white loaf, which ſhe had been buying at a ſhop. He ſaid nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expoſe the faults of a miſtreſs to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but walked on, reſolving to give Mrs. White a ſevere lecture for the firſt time in his life. He ſoon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the firſt perſon he ſaw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a ſad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was ſlipped out of his ſleeve, was ſwelled in a frightful manner. Mrs. White was ſtanding at the dreſſer making the little white loaf into a poultice, which ſhe laid upon the ſwelling in a large clean old cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037139_0009_100C93B38129F170"/>"I aſk your pardon, my good Sarah," ſaid the Doctor, "I ought not, however appearances were againſt you, to have ſuſpected that ſo humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintineſs of your own, or to fly in the face of your betters, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I ſee it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have ſent Tom to a ſurgeon who would have done no more good for him than you have done; for in thoſe inflammations the moſt ſkilful ſurgeon could only apply a poultice. Your kindneſs in dreſſing the wound yourſelf, will, I doubt not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the cure at the expence of that three-penny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom ſhall have a a good ſupply of Rice from the Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." "And he ſhan't want for ſkim milk," ſaid Mrs. White, and was he the beſt lord in the land, in the ſtate he is in, a diſh of good rice milk would be better for him than the richeſt meat.</p>

               <head>The PARISH MEETING.</head>
               <p>ON the tenth of Auguſt the veſtry held another meeting, to conſult on the beſt method of further aſſiſting the poor. The proſpect of abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer White had a mind to be a little jocular with his deſponding neighbours. Well, neighbour Jones," ſaid he, "all the wheat was killed, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The barley all dead at the root. Farmer Jones looked ſheeepiſh, and ſaid, to be ſure the crops had turned out better than he thought, Then," ſaid Dr. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, learn to truſt Providence another time."</p>
               <p>Among other things, they agreed to ſubſcribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be ſold out to the poor at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low price, and Mrs. White was ſo kind as to undertake the trouble of ſelling it. After their day's work was over, all who wiſhed to buy at theſe reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening. Dr. Sepherd dropped in at the ſame time, and when Mrs. White had done weighing her rice, the Doctor ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037139_0011_100C93BB9E2F0148"/>"My honeſt friends, it has pleaſed GOD to viſit this land with a ſcarcity, to which we have been little accuſtomed. There are ſome idle evil minded people who are on the watch for public diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, not that they may humble themſelves under the mighty hand of GOD, (which is the true uſe to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit themſelves by diſturbing the public peace. Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by riot and drunkenneſs, double the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will compleat our misfortune, while peace, induſtry, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread to be ſure is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the quality of it, another, to leſſen the quantity we conſume. If we cannot get enough of coarſe wheaten bread, let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This laſt is what I eat in my own family. It is pleaſant and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Our bleſſed Saviour ate barley bread you know, as we were told in one of the Numbers of the Cheap Repoſitory, which I hope you have all heard; as I deſired the maſter of the Sunday ſchool to read it juſt after even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſervice, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the ſchool. This is a good cuſtom, and one of thoſe little books ſhall be often read at that time.</p>
               <p>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time of ſcarcity; and I am going to ſhew my good will, as much by my advice as my ſubſcription. It is my duty, as your friend and miniſter, to tell you, that one half of your preſent hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without ſhoes and ſtockings, with great luncheons of the very whiteſt bread, and that three times a day. Half that quantity, and ſtill leſs if it were coarſe, put into a diſh of good onion or leek porridge, would make them an excellent breakfaſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny too of the very pooreſt of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you 'tis what I cannot afford to do. Come Mrs. White, you muſt aſſiſt me a little. I am not very knowing in theſe matters myſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable, if the poor made a better uſe of their bounty. Mrs.

White do give theſe poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go further than it now does. When you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap diſhes, and I dare ſay you are not leſs notable now you manage for yourſelf."</p>
               <p>"Indeed neighbours, ſaid Mrs. White, what the good doctor ſays is very true. A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a leek or onion, out of your own garden which coſts nothing, a bit of ſalt, and a little coarſe bread, will breakfaſt your whole family. It is a great miſtake at any time to think a bit of meat ſo ruinous, and a great loaf of bread ſo cheap. A poor man gets ſeven or eight ſhillings a week; if he is careful he bring's it home. I dare not ſay how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now ſugar and butter are ſo dear, becauſe I ſhould have you all upon me, but, I will ſay that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the hardeſt fare. This at all times, but particularly juſt now, is bad management. Dry peaſe to be ſure have been very dear lately! but now they are plenty enough. I am
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037139_0014_100C93C1782FBE48"/>
certain then, that if a ſhilling or two of the ſeven or eight was laid out for a bit of coarſe beef, a ſheep's head, or any ſuch thing, it would be well beſtowed. I would throw a couple of pounds of this into the pot with two or three handfuls of grey peaſe, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or turnip, and carrot; or any garden ſtuff that was moſt plenty; and let it ſtew two or three hours, and it will make a diſh ſit for his Majeſty. The working man ſhould have the meat: the children don't want it, the ſoup will be thick and ſubſtantial, and requires no bread.</p>

               <p>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," ſaid farmer White. "I adviſe my men to raiſe each a large bed of parſnips. They are very nouriſhing, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Sixpennyworth of ſeed, well ſowed, and trod in, will produce more meals than four ſacks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have ſo little ground, it will not require more than an eighth part of the ground which the four ſacks will take. Parſnips are very good the ſecond day warmed in the frying-pan, and a little raſher of pork or baoon will give them a nice flavour."</p>
               <p>Dr. Shepherd now ſaid, "as a proof of the nouriſhing quality of parſnips, I was reading in a hiſtory book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of parſnips, though Indian corn is ſo famous: it will make a little variety too."</p>
               <p>"I remember," ſaid Mrs. White, "a cheap diſh, ſo nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel ſome raw potatoes,

ſlice them thin, put the ſlices into a deep frying-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper. Then I get a bone or two of a breaſt of mutton, or a little ſtrip of ſalt pork, and put into it. Cover it down cloſe, keep in the ſteam, and let it ſtew for an hour."</p>
               <p>"You really get me an appetite, Mrs. White by your dainty receipts," ſaid the Doctor. "I am reſolved to have this diſh at my own table." "I could tell you another very good diſh, and ſtill cheaper," anſwered ſhe. "Come, let us have it," cried the Doctor. "I ſhall write all down as ſoon as I get home, and I will favour any body with a copy of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts who will call at my houſe." "And I will do more, Sir," ſaid Mrs. White, "for I will put any of theſe women in the way how to dreſs it, the firſt time, if they are at a loſs. But this is my diſh.</p>
               <p>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a ſtone jar, filled up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added ſhe; "I have taken to uſe nothing but potatoe ſtarch;

and though I ſay it that ſhould not ſay it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</p>
               <p>The Doctor now ſaid, "I am ſorry for one hardſhip which many poor people la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under. I mean the difficulty of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little milk. I wiſh all farmers wives were as conſiderate as you are, Mrs. White.

This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to Sots, Gamblers, and Sabbath breakers. Thoſe who do not ſet their young children to work on week days, and ſend them to ſchool on Sundays, deſerve little favour. No man ſhould keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If he feeds them at home they rob his children; if he ſtarves them, they rob his neighbours. We have heard in a neighbouring city that ſome people carried back the ſubſcription loaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were too coarſe; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane begged with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," ſaid the Doctor, "we will liſten to all modeſt complaints, and try to redreſs them." "You were pleaſed to ſay, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "that we might find much comfort from buying coarſe bits of beef. And ſo we might, but you do not know, ſir, that we can ſeldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not ſo bad." How ſo, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Jobbins for a bit

Now, ſir, if ſuch kind gentle-folks were aware that this gravy and ſoup not only conſume a great deal of meat, (which, to be ſure, thoſe have a right to uſe who can pay for it) but that it takes away thoſe coarſe pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am ſure they would not do it. For indeed the rich have been very kind, and I don't know what we ſhould have done without them."</p>
               <p>"I thank you for the hint Betty," ſaid the Doctor, "and I aſſure you I will have no more gravy ſoup.

            <head>THE GRAND ASSIZES; OR General Goal Delivery.</head>
            <p>THERE was in a certain country a great King, who was alſo a Judge. He was very merciful, but he was alſo very juſt; for he uſed to ſay, that juſtice was the foundation of all goodneſs. His ſubjects were apt enough, in a general way, to extol his merciful temper, and eſpecially thoſe ſubjects who were always committing crimes which made them lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be puniſhed by his juſtice. This laſt quality they conſtantly kept out of ſight, till they had cheated themſelves into a not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n that he was too good to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at all.</p>
            <p>Now it had happened a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the Kings' favor, and had alſo fallen from a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037139_0023_100C93D362B02080"/>
very proſperous ſtate in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts: but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay, the King's ſon moſt generouſly took the whole burthen of their debts on himſelf; and, in ſhort, it was propoſed that all their affairs ſhould be fettled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only they would ſhew themſelves to be ſorry for what they had done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I ſhould here remark, that a book was alſo given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the King's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in the time to come; and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after having lived a certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mber of years in a part of the ſame King's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and under his eye and juriſdiction, there ſhould be a Grand Aſſizes, when every one was to be publickly tried for his paſt behaviour, and after this trial was over, certain heavy puniſhments were to be inflicted on thoſe who ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037139_0024_100C93D4F44DFBF0"/>
have ſtill perſiſted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</p>
            <p>It may be proper here to notice, that this King's Court differed in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects from our Courts of Juſtice, being indeed a ſort of Court of Appeal, to which queſtions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courts. And although with us all criminals are tried, and very properly in my opinion, by a Jury of their Peers, yet in this King's country the mode was very different; for ſince every one of the people had been in a certain ſenſe crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the King did not think it fair to make them judges alſo. It would indeed have been impoſſible to follow in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the cuſtoms which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in our Courts are mere overt acts, as the Lawyers call them, that is, acts which regard the outward behaviour; ſuch as the acts of ſtriking, maiming, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo forth. But in the King's Court it was not merely outward ſins, but ſins of the heart alſo which were to be puniſhed.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037139_0025_100C93D6FB3AEEF0"/>
Many a crime, therefore, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of in the Court of King's bench, or at the Old Bailey, was here to be brought to light, and was reſerved for this great day. Among theſe were Pride and Oppreſſion, and Envy, and Malice, and Revenge, and Covetouſneſs, and Secret Vanity of Mind, and Evil Thoughts of all ſorts, and all evil Wiſhes and Deſires. When Covetouſneſs, indeed, put men on committing Robbery, or when Malice drove them to an act of Murder, then the common Courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for theſe Great Aſſizes; nevertheleſs, ſince even a Thief and Murderer would now and then eſcape in the common Courts, for want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or through ſome fault or other of the Judge or Jury, the eſcape was of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment for the poor criminal, for he was ſure to be tried again by this great King; and even though he ſhould have been puniſhed in ſome ſenſe before, yet he had now a farther puniſhment to fear, unleſs, indeed, he was one of thoſe, who had obtained, by the means I before ſpoke of this great King's pardon. The ſins of the heart, however, were by far the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037139_0026_100C93D9A1773AF0"/>
moſt numerous ſort of ſins, which were to come before this great Tribunal; and theſe were to be judged by this great King in perſon, and by none but himſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he poſſeſſed a certain power of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at all ſecrets.</p>
            <p>I once heard of a certain King of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who built a whiſpering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word his rebellious ſubjects uttered, though ſpoken ever ſo low. But this ſecret of the King of Sicily was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what this great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King poſſeſſed; for He had the power of knowing every thought which was conceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</p>
            <p>Now you may be ready to think, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that theſe people were worſe off than any others becauſe they were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined ſo cloſely, and judged ſo ſtrictly; far from it; the King was too juſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect bricks without giving them ſtraw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, as I before obſerved; and becauſe they were naturally ſhort-ſighted, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037139_0027_100C93DB2C5D1DE0"/>
them with a glaſs for reading it, and thus the moſt dim-ſighted might ſee, if he did not wilfully ſhut his eyes: but though the King <hi>invited</hi> them to open their eyes, he did not <hi>compel</hi> them; and many remained ſtone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, becauſe they would not uſe the glaſs, nor take the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means for reading and underſtanding all that was written for them. The humble and ſincere learnt in time, to ſee even that part of the book which was leaſt plainly written; and it was obſerved that the ability to underſtand it depended more on the heart than the head; an evil diſpoſition blinded the ſight, while humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity operated like an eye-ſalve.</p>
            <p>Now it happened that thoſe who had been ſo lucky as to eſcape the puniſhment of the lower Courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good ſort of people, and of courſe very ſafe from any danger of this <hi>Great Assize.</hi> This grand intended trial had been talked of ſo much, and put off ſo long, (for it had ſeemed long at leaſt to theſe ſhort-ſighted people,) that many perſuaded themſelves it would never take place at all; and far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037139_0028_100C93DCBA0CA820"/>
part were living away therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever thinking about it; they went on juſt as if nothing at all had been done for their benefit; and as if they had no King to pleaſe, no King's ſon to be thankful to, no book to guide themſelves by, and as if the aſſizes were never to come about.</p>
            <p>But with this King "a thouſand years were as one day, for he was not ſlack concerning his promiſes, as ſome men count ſlackneſs." So at length the ſolemn period approached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the ſolemnity, or rather, they prepared for it much as ſome of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the Aſſize times; I mean by balls and feaſtings, and they ſaw their own trial come on, with as little concern as is felt by the people in our ſtreets, when they ſee the Judge's proceſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the town, who indeed comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that it is only thoſe in the priſons who are guilty.</p>
            <p>But when at laſt the day came and every man found that he was to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for himſelf, and that ſome how or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all his ſecrets were brought out,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037139_0029_100C93DEB91DA888"/>
and that there was now no eſcape, things began to take a more ſerious turn. Some of the criminals were got together debating in an outer Court of the Grand Hall, and there they paſſed their time, not in compunction and tears, not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing themſelves with ſuch as had been ſtill more notorious offenders.</p>
            <p>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and oppreſſion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, inſulted a poor fellow as a thief, becauſe he had ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was, ſaid a Citizen to his Apprentice, for you drank and ſwore at the ale-houſe every Sunday night." Yes," ſaid the poor fellow, "but it was your fault that I did ſo, for you took no care of my ſoul, but ſpent all your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach me; I might have followed a good example, but I ſaw only bad ones. I ſinned againſt leſs light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had ſpent all his wages on gin, took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037139_0030_100C93E103A82C28"/>
that he had not ſpent a great eſtate in Bribery at Elections, as the Lord of his Manor had done, while a perjured Elector boaſted that he was no drunkard, like the journeyman.</p>
            <p>I have not room to deſcribe the awful pomp of the Court, nor the terrible founding of the trumpet which attended the Judge's entrance, nor the ſitting of the Judge, nor the opening of the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who ſtood before him. I ſhall paſs over the multitudes who were tried and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dungeons and chains, and fire, and perpetual baniſhment, from the preſence of the King, which always ſeemed to be the ſaddeſt part of the ſentence. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice further, a few who brought ſome plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the King, and even decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves ſo far as to think that his own book of laws would be their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>A thoughtleſs Spendthrift advanced without any contrition, and ſaid, "that he had lived handſomely, and had hated
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037139_0031_100C835B22908A90"/>
the covetous whom God abhorreth, and that he truſted in that paſſage of the book which ſaid, that 'Covetouſneſs was Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry;' and that he therefore hoped for a favorable ſentence.' It proved that this man had not only avoided Covetouſneſs, but he had even left his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in want through his exceſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. The Judge immediately poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that place in the Book where it is written, he that provideth not for his houſehold, is worſe than an Infidel. He that liveth in pleaſure is dead while he liveth; "thou," ſaid he,
<q>in thy life time, received'ſt thy good things, and now thou muſt be tormented.</q>
—Then a miſer, whom hunger and hoarding had worn to ſkin and bone, crept forward and praiſed the ſentence paſſed on this extravagant youth, "and ſurely," ſaid he, "ſince he is condemned, I am the man that may make ſome plea to favor—I was never idle or drunk, I kept my body in ſubjection. I have been ſo ſelf-denying that I am certainly a Saint: I have loved neither father nor mother, nor wife, nor children to exceſs, in all this I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the book of the law,—Then the Judge ſaid, "but where are thy works of

mercy and thy labors of love? ſee that family which periſhed in thy ſight laſt hard winter, while thy barns were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing; that poor family were my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, yet they were hungry, and thou gaveſt them no meat." "Go to now, thou rich man, weep and howl for the miſeries that are come upon you. Your gold and your ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire."—Then came up one with a moſt ſelf ſufficient air, He walked up boldly, having in one hand the plan of an Hoſpital which he had built, and in the other the drawing of a ſtatue, which was erecting for him in the country that he had juſt left, and on his forehead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, in Gold Letters, the Liſt of all the Public Charities to which he had ſubſcribed. He ſeemed to take great pleaſure in the condemnation of the Miſer, and ſaid, "Lord, where ſaw I thee hungry and fed thee not, or in priſon and viſited thee not? I have viſited the fatherleſs and widow in their affliction." —Here the Judge cut him ſhort by ſaying "True, thou didſt viſit the fatherleſs, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

part of my command to keep thyſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world. No, thou wert conformed to the world in many of its ſinful cuſtoms, "thou didſt follow a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil;" "thou didſt love the world and the things of the world:" and the motive to all thy charities was not a regard to me but to thy own credit with thy fellow men. Thou haſt done every thing for the ſake of reputation, and now thou art vainly truſting in thy works, inſtead of putting all thy truſt in my Son, who has offered himſelf to be a ſurety for thee. Where has been that humility and gratitude to him which was required of thee. No, thou wouldſt be thine own ſurety: thou haſt truſted in thyſelf: thou haſt made thy boaſt of thine own goodneſs; thou haſt ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and thou haſt enjoyed the praiſe of men, and verily I ſay unto thee, "thou haſt thy reward."</p>
            <p>A poor diſeaſed blind cripple, from the very Hoſpital which this great man had built, then ſell proſtrate on his face, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, "Lord be merciful to me a ſinner!" on which the Judge, to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of all, ſaid, Well done, good and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037139_0034_100C93E94B40BCC0"/>
faithful ſervant." The poor man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "Lord, I have done nothing! but thou haſt <hi>suffered." "Well,</hi>" ſaid the Judge; "thou haſt been an example of patience and meekneſs, and though thou hadſt but few talents, yet thou haſt well improved thoſe few; thou hadſt time, this thou didſt ſpend in the humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy ſtation, and alſo in earneſt prayer, even for that proud Founder of thine Hoſpital, who never prayed for himſelf; thou waſt indeed blind and lame, but it is no where ſaid, my Son give me thy feet, or thine eyes, but <hi>give me thy heart</hi>; and even the faculties I did grant thee, were employed to my glory; with thine ears thou didſt liſten to my word, with thy tongue thou didſt ſhew forth my praiſe, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.—There were ſeveral who came forward and boaſted of ſome ſingle and particular virtue, in which they had been ſuppoſed to excel. One talked of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, another of his courage, and a third of his fortitude; but it proved, on cloſe examination, that ſome of thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed virtues were merely the effect of a particular conſtitution of body: that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proceeded from a falſe motive, and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037139_0035_100C93EB9524EB08"/>
that not a few of them were actual vices, ſince they were carried to exceſs; and under the pretence of fulfilling one duty, ſome other duty was loſt ſight of; in ſhort, theſe partial virtues were none of them done in obedience to the will of the King, but merely to pleaſe the perſon's own humour, and they would not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtand this day's trial, for "he that keepeth the whole law, and yet wilfully and habitually offends in any one point, was declared guilty of breaking the whole.</p>
            <p>At this moment a ſort of thick ſcales fell from the eyes of the multitude. They could now no longer take comfort by meaſuring their neighbours' conduct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own. Each at once found himſelf in his true light, and ſaw, alas! when it was too late, that he ſhould have made the book which had been given him his rule of practice before, ſince it now proved to be the rule by which he was to be judged. Nay, every one now thought himſelf even worſe than his neighbour, becauſe, while he only <hi>saw</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> of the guilt of others, he <hi>felt</hi> his own in all its aggravated horrors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:037139_0036_100C93ED4562A598"/>To complete their confuſion, they were compelled to acknowledge the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the judge who condemned them; and alſo to approve the favorable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by which thouſands of other crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inals had not only their lives ſaved, but were made happy and glorious beyond all imagination, and all this was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their ſincere repentance, and their humble acceptance of the pardon offered to them by the King's Son. One thing was remarkable, that whilſt moſt of them who were condemned never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected condemnation, but even claimed reward for their ſuppoſed innocence or goodneſs, all who were rewarded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given were ſenſible, that they owed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to a mere act of grace, and they cried out with one voice, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the praiſe!!!</p>
