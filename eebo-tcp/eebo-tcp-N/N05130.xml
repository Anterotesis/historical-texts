            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An over-eager and greedy following after the World: The Zeal of ſome Mens Spirits after Riches, hath eaten up all their Zeal of God. O!

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, a jovial and vainly merry Life, ſuch the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are, who have left off to walk mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord of Hoſts, and have given themſelves to live merrily with the World; who have given over to weep with them that weep, and are fallen in to a laugh with them that laugh, to jeſt and ſport and be vain with the vain ones, yea, and it may be to drink and to ſit by it with thoſe that drink. It's now grown too creditable to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent drinking Houſes: Tradeſmen that are Profeſſors, eſpecially in Cities or great Towns, how ordinarily do they, upon Pretence of Diſpatch of Buſneſs, ſit many Hours over a Diſh of Coffee, or a Cup of Ale, or a Glaſs of Sack; and carry it ſo, that they can hardly be diſtinguiſhed from the good Fellows of the World; but perhaps by this only, That they are now down-right drunken into Breaſts. If there be a Liberty of ſuch Houſes, and meetings in them ſometimes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006452_0017_1028F8EE8E669988"/>neceſſary (as perhaps it may) yet let not this Liberty be uſed as an occaſion to the Fleſh. 3. Gaudineſs or over-coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Apparel, wherein ſome of them glitter and ſhine amongſt the greateſt Gallants of the Earth. Some amongſt Profeſſors do not only ſhun but diſdam and deſpiſe the old Self-denial that was wont to be among Chriſtians in theſe and the like Particulars, as if they were ſet at Liberty by the Goſpel from the Laws of Chriſt, as well as from the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> To theſe three let me add one Evil more: 4. A neglect of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; of the Inſtructing, Catechiſing, and due Diſciplining them; the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of which Neglect are very ſadly to be ſeen in the Ignorance, Errors, Rudeneſs and Diſorderlineſs abounding amongſt many of them: there are not a few, who take ſome Care of themſelves, but leave the Bridle on the Necks of theirs, and reap many Heart breaking Crops in them, as the Fruits o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now diligently ſearch and conſider thy ſelf in all theſe Things; and when

            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Bend the main Fores of all your Religion upon theſe very Points wherein you are moſt failing or foulty.</hi> The Devil will allow us to be buſy in other Matters of Religion, ſo he can but keep us off from thoſe Things where our great Streſſes lies: And the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart will take up with that which is moſt eaſy and pleaſant, that thereby it may the better ſhift it ſelf of that which is more hard, and would go to the quick with it. We never purge or bleed to any Purpoſe, till we hit upon the right Humour, and ſtrike the right Vein.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006452_0019_1028F8F299190898"/>
This is to act rationally and in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to bend our great Strength there, where our great Difficulty and Weakneſs lies. When you have by ſearching found out what you moſtly ſtick at, let it be your firſt grand Errand in every Prayer, whether ordinary or extraordinary, to beg ſpecial Help in this particular Caſe: your weakneſs in any particular Grace or Duty, the Power of any particular Luſt, Corruption or Temptation, your moſt ordinary and common Falls in Point of Converſation; let theſe have a ſpecial Place in every Prayer you make: And alſo let them be moſt heedfully watched and laboured againſt in your Lives. Turn in the Strength of Prayer &amp; Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs upon the Strength of Sin; let your main Batteries be againſt the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and where your Walls are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there ſet the ſtrongeſt Guard and Watch.</p>
            <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Meaſure your proficiency in Religion, by the Power you get in thoſe Particulars, wherein you have been moſt deficient or foulty.</hi> Judge not your ſelves by thoſe Things which are moſt eaſy in Religion, but by your coming off in your moſt difficult Caſe.</p>

Some Profeſſors may at Times ſeem to be full of good Affections, ſtrangely elevated and enlarged in their Prayers, yea, and to live in ſo great Peace, as to take themſelves to have attained to the riches of full Aſſurance, and yet for all this may be but very poor Chriſtians all the while.

If thou haſt run with the Foot-men (within thee) and theſe have been too hard for thee, how wilt thou contend with them that ride upon Horſes?

            <p>But on the other Side, if thou doſt obtain, if thou doſt prevail in thine own perſonal Caſe, this hath good Hope in it. 'Tis an Argument that thy Prayers are accepted with God; and if the Lord accept thee when thou prayeſt for thy ſelf, or for thine Houſe, thence the greater Hope will ſpring that he will accept thee when thou prayeſt for his own Houſe and People.

            <p>IT was a great Word which <hi>Luther</hi> ſpoke, when he ſaid, '<hi>There is a Kind of Omnipotency</hi> in Preyer.— Where do we find in all the Book of God a more wonderful Expreſſion, than that of the Lord to praying <hi>Meſes, Now let me alone?</hi>— Prayer is ſtronger than Iron Gates. At the Prayers of the Church the iron Gates fly open, and the Apoſtles Fetters fall off. Sometimes the Prayers of one Man that hath an eminent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God, are a Means to preſerve a whole Town, yea a whole Land from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.—</p>
