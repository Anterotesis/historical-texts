            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS the cauſe of the preſent ill-humour in America, and of the Reſolutions taken there to purchaſe leſs of our manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, does not ſeem to be generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it may afford ſome ſatisfaction to you, if I give them the following ſhort hiſtorical ſtate of facts.</p>
               <p>From the time that the colonies were firſt conſidered as capable of granting aids to the Crown, down to the end of the laſt war; it is ſaid that the conſtant mode of obtaining thoſe aids was by requiſition made from the Crown through its Governors to the ſeveral Aſſemblies,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013147_0003_0F8EBE4A08EBEB98"/>
in circular letters from the Secretary of State in his Majeſty's name, ſetting forth the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, requiring them to take the matter into conſideration, and expreſſing a reliance on their prudence, duty and affection to his Majeſty's government, that they would grant ſuch ſums, or raiſe ſuch numbers of men, as were ſuitable to their reſpective circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The colonies being accuſtomed to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, have from time to time granted money to the Crown, or raiſed troops for its ſervice, in proportion to their abilities, and, during all the laſt war, beyond their abilities, ſo that conſiderable ſums were returned them yearly by Parliament, as exceeding their proportion.</p>
               <p>Had this happy method been continued (a method which left the King's ſubjects in thoſe remote countries the pleaſure of ſhewing their zeal and loyalty, and of imagining that they recommended themſelves to their Sovereign by the liberality of their voluntary grants) there is no doubt but all the money that could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected to be raiſed from them, in any manner, might have been obtained from them, without the leaſt heart-burning, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or breach of the harmony of affections and intereſts that ſo long ſubſiſted between the two countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:013147_0004_0F8EBE4AA715DC00"/>It has been thought wiſdom in a government, exerciſing ſovereignty over different kinds of people, to have ſome regard to prevailing and eſtabliſhed opinions among the people to be governed, wherever ſuch opinions might in their effects promote or obſtruct public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.—If they tend to obſtruct public ſervice, they are to be changed before we act againſt them, and they can only be changed by reaſon and perſuaſion.—But if public ſervice can be carried on without thwarting thoſe opinions, if they can be on the contrary made ſubſervient to it, they are not unneceſſarily to be thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how abſurd ſoever ſuch popular opinions may be in their natures.</p>
               <p>This had been the wiſdom of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with reſpect to raiſing money in the colonies. It was well known that the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts univerſally were of opinion, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney could be levied from Engliſh ſubjects, but by their own conſent, given by themſelves or their choſen repreſentatives. That therefore, whatever money was to be raiſed from the people in the colonies, muſt firſt be granted by their aſſemblies, as the money raiſed in Britain is firſt to be granted by the Houſe of Commons. That this right of granting their own money was eſſential to Engliſh liberty; and that if any man, or body of men, in which they had no repreſentative of their chooſing,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013147_0005_0F8EBE4B8C64A350"/>
could tax them at pleaſure, they could not be ſaid to have any property, any thing they could call their own. But as theſe opinions did not hinder their granting money voluntarily and amply, whenever the Crown, by its ſervants, came into their aſſemblies (as it does into its Parliaments of Britain and Ireland) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded aids, therefore that method was choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, rather than the baneful one of arbitrary taxes.</p>
               <p>I do not undertake here to ſupport thoſe opinions; they have been refuted by a late act of Parliament, declaring its own power; which very Parliament, however, ſhewed wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much tender regard to thoſe inveterate prejudices, as to repeal a tax that had odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly militated againſt them.—And theſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices are ſtill ſo fixed and rooted in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, that it is ſuppoſed not a ſingle man among them has been convinced of his error by that act of parliament.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter, therefore, who firſt projected to lay aſide the accuſtomed method of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to raiſe money on America by ſtamps, ſeems not to have acted wiſely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from that method (which the coloniſts looked upon as conſtitutional) and thwarting unneceſſarily, the general fixed prejudices of ſo great a number of the King's ſubjects. It was
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013147_0006_0F8EBE4C2979E798"/>
not, however, for want of knowledge that what he was about to do would give them great offence; he appears to have been very ſenſible of this, and apprehenſive that it might occaſion ſome diſorders, to prevent or ſuppreſs which he projected another bill, that was brought in the ſame ſeſſion with the ſtamp act, whereby it was to be made lawful for military officers in the colonies to quarter their ſoldiers in private houſes. This ſeemed intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other act. Great oppoſition, however, being raiſed here againſt the bill, by the agents from the colonies, and the merchants trading thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the coloniſts declaring that, under ſuch a power in the army, no one could look on his houſe as his own, or think he had a home, when ſoldiers might be thruſt into it, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his family, at the pleaſure of an officer, that part of the bill was dropt; but there ſtill remained a clauſe, when it paſſed into a law, to oblige the ſeveral aſſemblies to provide quarters for the ſoldiers, furniſhing them with fire, beds, candles, ſmall beer or rum, and ſundry other articles, at the expence of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral provinces.—And this act continued in force when the ſtamp-act was repealed, though, if obligatory on the aſſemblies, it equally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated againſt the American principle above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that money is not to be raiſed on Engliſh ſubjects without their conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013147_0007_0F8EBE5109F7F4C8"/>The colonies nevertheleſs, being put into high good humour by the repeal of the ſtamp-act, choſe to avoid a freſh diſpute upon the other, it being temporary, and ſoon to expire, never (as they hoped) to revive again; and in the mean time they, by various ways, provided for the quartering of the troops, either by acts of their own aſſemblies without taking notice of the acts of Parliament, or by ſome variety or ſmall diminution (as of ſalt and vinegar) in the ſupplies required by the Act, that what they did might appear a voluntary act of their own, and not done in obedience to an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they thought contrary to right, and therefore void in itſelf.</p>
               <p>It might have been well if the matter had thus paſſed without notice; but an officious Governor having written home an angry and aggravating letter upon this conduct in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of his province, the outed projector of the ſtamp-act, and his adherents, then in the oppoſition, raiſed ſuch a clamour againſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as in rebellion, &amp;c. and againſt thoſe who had been for the repeal of the ſtamp-act, as having thereby been encouragers of this ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebellion, that it was thought neceſſary to enforce the quartering act by another act of Parliament, taking away from the province of New-York, which had been moſt explicit in its refuſal, all the powers of legiſlation, till it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013147_0008_0F8EBE521E172FA0"/>
ſhould have complied with that act: The news of which greatly alarmed the people every where in America, as the language of ſuch an act ſeemed to be Obey implicitly laws made by the Parliament of Great Britain, to force mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from you without your conſent, or you ſhall enjoy no rights or privileges at all.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, deſirous of ingratiating himſelf with the oppoſition, or driven to it by their clamours, projected the levying more money from America, by new duties on various ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our own manufacture, as glaſs, paper, painters colours, &amp;c. appointing a new board of cuſtoms, and ſending over a ſet of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners (with large ſalaries) to be eſtabliſhed at Boſton, who were to have the care of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting theſe duties; and which were, by the act, expreſsly mentioned to be intended for the payment of the ſalaries of Governors, Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other officers of the Crown in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it being a pretty general opinion here, that thoſe officers ought not to depend on the people there for any part of their ſupport.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention to combat this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but perhaps it may be ſome ſatisfaction to you to know what ideas the Americans have on the ſubject. They ſay then, as to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, that they are not like Princes whoſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013147_0009_0F8EBE5234049AC8"/>
poſterity have an inheritance in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a nation, and therefore an intereſt in its proſperity; they are generally ſtrangers to the provinces they are ſent to govern; have no eſtate, natural connection, or relation there, to give them an affection for the country; that they come only to make money as faſt as they can, are frequently men of vicious characters and broken fortunes, ſent merely to get them off the hands of a miniſter ſomewhere out of the way; as that they intend ſtaying in the country no longer than their government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and purpoſe to leave no family behind them, they are apt to be regardleſs of the good will of the people, and care not what is ſaid or thought of them after they are gone. Their ſituation gives them many opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vexatious, and they are often ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their dependance on the aſſemblies for all that part of their ſupport that does not ariſe from fees eſtabliſhed by law, but would probably be much more ſo if they were to be fully ſupported by money drawn from the people, without the conſent or good will of the people, which is the profeſſed deſign of this act. That if by means of the enforced duties, government is to be ſupported in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, without the intervention of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, their aſſemblies will ſoon be looked upon as uſeleſs, and a Governor will not call them, as having nothing to hope from their meeting,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013147_0010_0F8EBE52F4660448"/>
and perhaps ſomething to fear from their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into, and remonſtrances againſt his mal-adminiſtration; that thus the people will be deprived of their moſt eſſential rights; that its being, as at preſent, a Governor's intereſt to cultivate the good will, by promoting the welfare of the people he governs, can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no prejudice to the Mother-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſince all the laws he may be prevailed to give his aſſent to, are ſubject to a reviſion here, and if reported againſt by the Board of Trade, as hurtful to the intereſt of this country, may, and are immediately repealed by the Crown; nor dare he paſs any law contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as he holds his office during the pleaſure of the Crown, and his Securities are liable for the penalties of their bonds, if he contravenes thoſe inſtructions.</p>
               <p>This is what they ſay as to Governors.</p>
               <p>As to Judges, they alledge, that being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from hence by the Crown, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their commiſſions, not during good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as in Britain, but during pleaſure, all the weight of intereſt would be thrown into one of the ſcales (which ought to be held even) if the ſalaries are alſo to be paid out of duties forced from the people without their conſent, and independent of their Aſſemblies approbation or diſapprobation of the Judges
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013147_0011_0F8EBE53B8C55728"/>
behaviour; that where the Crown will grant commiſſions to able and honeſt Judges during good behaviour, the Aſſemblies will ſettle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and ample ſalaries on them during their commiſſions; but at preſent they have no other means of getting rid of an ignorant, unjuſt Judge (and ſome of ſcandalous characters have, they ſay, been ſent them) but by ſtarving him out.</p>
               <p>I do not ſuppoſe theſe reaſonings of the Americans will have much weight in them. I do not produce them with an expectation of convincing you. I relate them merely in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the taſk I have impoſed on myſelf, to be an impartial Hiſtorian of American facts and opinions.</p>

               <p>THE Coloniſts being greatly alarmed, as I obſerved in my laſt, by news of the act for aboliſhing the legiſlature of New-York, and the impoſition of theſe new duties, profeſſedly for ſuch diſagreeable, and to them appearing dangerous purpoſes; accompanied by a new ſet of Revenue officers, with large appointments, which gave ſtrong ſuſpicion

that more buſineſs of the ſame kind was ſoon to be provided for them, that they might earn thoſe ſalaries, began ſeriouſly to conſider their ſituation, and to revolve afreſh in their minds, grievances, which from their reſpect and love for this country, they had long borne, and ſeemed almoſt willing to forget.

That thus the whole American people were forbidden the advantage of a direct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of wine, oil, and fruit from Portugal, but muſt take them loaded with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of a voyage of one thouſand leagues round about, being to be landed firſt in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be re-ſhipped for America: expences amounting, in war-time, at leaſt to thirty per cent. more than otherwiſe they would have been charged with, and all this, merely that a few Portugal merchants in London might gain a commiſſion on thoſe goods paſſing through their hands.—Portugal Merchants, by the bye, who complain loudly of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hardſhips laid on their trade by foreigners, and yet even the laſt year, could oppoſe with all their influence the giving eaſe to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects under ſo heavy an oppreſſion— That on a frivolous complaint of a few Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia Merchants, nine colonies were reſtrained
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013147_0013_0F8EBE553438A700"/>
from making paper-money, though become abſolutely neceſſary for their internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, from the conſtant remittance of their gold and ſilver to Britain.—But not only the intereſt of a particular body of merchants, the intereſt of any ſmall body of Britiſh tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or artificers, has been found, they ſay, to outweigh that of all the King's ſubjects in the colonies.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a ſtronger natural right than that of a man's making the beſt profit he can of the natural produce of his lands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he does not thereby injure the State in general. Iron is to be found every where in America, and beaver furs are the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of that country. Hats and nails, and ſteel, are wanted there as well as here. It is no importance to the common welfare of the Empire, whether a ſubject gets his living by making hats on this or that ſide of the water; yet the hatters of England have prevailed! ſo far as to obtain an act in their own favour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining that manufacture in America, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to oblige the Americans to ſend their bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to England, to be manufactured, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe back the hats loaded with the charges of a double tranſportation. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have a few Nail-makers, and ſtill a ſmaller number of Steel-makers (perhaps there are not half a dozen of theſe in England) prevailed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013147_0014_0F8EBE55F5E96FF8"/>
totally to forbid, by an act of Parliament, the erecting of ſlitting-mills, and ſteel-furnaces in America, that the Americans may be obliged to take nails for their buildings, and ſteel for their tools from theſe artificers under the ſame diſadvantages. Added to theſe, the Americans remembered the act authorizing the moſt cruel inſult that perhaps was ever offered by one people to another, that of emptying our gaols into their ſettlements (Scotland too, has within theſe few years, obtained the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege it had not before, of ſending its rogues and villains to the plantations) an inſult ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by that barbarous, ill-placed ſarcaſm in a report of the Board of Trade, when one of the provinces complained of the act. <q>It is neceſſary that it ſhould be continued for the better peopling of your Majeſty's colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</q> I ſay, reflecting on thoſe things, the Americans ſaid to one another (their news papers are full of diſcourſes) theſe people are not content with making a monopoly of us, forbidding us to trade with any other country of Europe, and compelling us to buy every thing of them, though in many articles we could furniſh ourſelves 10, 20, and even 50 per cent. cheaper elſewhere; but now they have as good as declared they have a right to tax us, <hi>ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum,</hi> internally and externally; and that our conſtitution and liberties ſhall all be taken away if we do not ſubmit to that claim. They
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013147_0015_0F8EBE56AA696048"/>
are not content with the high prices at which they ſell us their goods, but have now begun to enhance thoſe prices by new duties; and by the expenſive apparatus of a new ſet of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, they appear to intend an augmentation and multiplication of thoſe burthens that ſhall ſtill be more grievous to us. Our people have been fooliſhly fond of their ſuperfluous modes and manufactures, to their impoveriſhing our country, carrying off all our caſh, and loading us with debt; they will not ſuffer us to reſtrain the luxury of our inhabitants as they do that of their own, by laws; they can make laws to diſcourage or prohibit the importation of French ſuperfluities; but though thoſe of England are as ruinous to us as the French ones are to them; if we make a law of that kind, they immediately repeal it. Thus they get all our money from us by trade, and every profit we can any where make by our fiſhery, our produce, and our commerce, centers fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with them! But this does not ſatisfy. It is time then to take care of ourſelves, by the beſt means in our power. Let us unite in ſolemn reſolutions and engagements with and to each other, that we will give theſe new offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as little trouble as poſſible by not conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Britiſh manufactures, on which they are to levy the duties. Let us agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume no more of their expenſive gew-gaws; let us live frugally; and let us induſtriouſly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013147_0016_0F8EBE5782DF4A60"/>
manufacture what we can for ourſelves; thus we ſhall be able honourably to diſcharge the debts we already owe them, and after that, we may be able to keep ſome money in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not only for the uſes of our internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but for the ſervice of our gracious Sovereign, whenever he ſhall have occaſion for it, and think proper to require it of us in the old conſtitutional manner. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reproaches thrown out againſt us in the public papers and pamphlets; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we have been reviled in their Senate as rebels and traitors, we are truly a loyal people. Scotland has had its rebellions, and England its plots, againſt the preſent royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but America is untainted with thoſe crimes; there is in it ſcarce a man, there is not a ſingle native of our country who is not firmly attached to his King by principle and by affection. But a new kind of loyalty ſeems to be required of us, a loyalty to Parliament; a loyalty that is to extend, it ſeems, to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of all our properties, whenever a Houſe of Commons, in which there is not a ſingle member of our chooſing, ſhall think fit to grant them away without our conſent, and to a patient ſuffering the loſs of our privileges as Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if we cannot ſubmit to make ſuch ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We were ſeparated too far from Britain by the ocean, but we were united ſtrongly to it by reſpect and love, ſo that we could at any time
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013147_0017_0F8EBE58647EFCB0"/>
freely have ſpent our lives and little fortunes in its cauſe; but this unhappy new ſyſtem of politics tends to diſſolve thoſe bands of union, and to ſever us forever. Woe to the man that firſt adopted it! Both countries will long have cauſe to execrate his memory.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the wild ravings of the at preſent half diſtracted Americans. To be ſure no reaſonable man in England can approve of ſuch ſentiments, and, as I ſaid before, I do not pretend to ſupport or juſtify them; but I ſincerely wiſh, for the ſake of the manufactures and commerce of Great-Britain, and for the ſake of the ſtrength a firm union with our growing colonies would give us, that thoſe people had never been thus needleſsly driven out of their ſenſes.</p>
