            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM very ſenſible, that the Subject of the enſuing Treatiſe, is none of the moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in this Age, wherein we are ſo much degenerated and apoſtatized from the true Doctrines and Principles of the Reformation: Yet being convinced, that it is not only a Doctrine of Truth, but alſo a Truth of great Importance in the Chriſtian Syſtem, I am willing to appear for the Defence of it, whatſoever Diſ-eſteem or Reproach it may expoſe me to, from ſuch as cannot bear to ſee or hear it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with any Moderation of Temper. It is a Doctrine with which ſundry other Doctrines of the Scripture are ſo inſeparably connected, that they cannot, with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, be maintained without it; ſuch as, <hi>Original Sin,</hi> the <hi>utter Impotency,</hi> or rather <hi>ſtrong Averſion of the human Will to true Holineſs,</hi> the <hi>irreſiſtible Efficacy of Converting Grace, Free Juſtification by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone,</hi> and the <hi>final Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the Saints.</hi> It is therefore a fooliſh Queſtion which ſome aſk, <hi>What need is there for preaching up this Doctrine, or meddling with it?</hi> It is neceſſary to ſtand up for it, againſt the Tide of Oppoſition, for the Sake of all theſe other Doctrines of God's Word, which muſt ſtand or fall with it. It is neceſſary for bringing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004896_0003_100E1501E610FAD8"/>Sinners off from all Dependance upon themſelves, to the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt alone for their Juſtification, and to the ſuper-natural efficacious Power of his holy Spirit for their Sanctification. It is neceſſary for ſtopping every Mouth from boaſting before God, and that the apparent Heirs of Glory may aſcribe the whole Praiſe and Glory of their Salvation to him. It is a ſtrong for the Conſolation of Believers, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for their Love. It is moreover neceſſary for the Glory of God's Sovereignty over his rebellious Creatures. On all theſe Accounts 'tis a Doctrines of great Uſe, tho' it be not very agreeable to proud, unrenew'd Nature, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> may ſometimes appear awful to true Believers, when their Evidences of a converted State are very dark to them.</p>
            <p>It is now ſome Years ſince I entertained Thoughts of publiſhing Something on this Subjects; the chief Reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining me to it was, that there were ſo many ſmall Pieces, in Oppoſition to the Doctrine, in People's Hands, abounding with a great Deal of Miſrepreſentations and falſe Reaſoning, yet fair and plauſible to the ignorant and unthinking; and ſo few, on the other Hand, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it. There is, indeed, a great Deal well written upon it; but then it is generally in larger Volumes, along with other Subjects, ſo that People in common have not the Advantage and Benefit of it. It's true, there have been ſome ſmall Pieces upon it of late, of good Uſe; Mr. <hi>Whitefield's Anſwer</hi> to Mr. <hi>Weſly's bold Sermon;</hi> and another <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the ſame <hi>Sermon,</hi> done by an anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, are both very good, ſo far as they go; but I judg'd it needful to treat the Subject more fully, and ſo have taken a larger Compaſs in ſhewing the Reaſonableneſs of the Doctrine, confirming it from Scripture, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all Objections.</p>
            <p>It is likely this Eſſay may come under the View of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of very different Sentiments about the Doctrine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. I would deſire all to read it with Care and Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntion, giving every Argument its due Weight, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004896_0004_100E15036CA59890"/>carrying what you read along with you, from one Thing to another; ſo that when you have read it thro', you may have the Subſtance and Strenght of what has been ſaid, in your View. If this Method be taken, I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that ſuch as are moſt oppoſite to the Doctrine, and prejudiced againſt it, will at leaſt be convinced, that it is not that horrid and monſtrous Thing, which perhap, they had conceiv'd it to be: But whatever Influence this Treatiſe may have on the Oppoſers of the Doctrine, I hope it will, thro' the divine Bleſſing, be ſatisfying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming to others. I think the Doctrine of Election may be a comfortable Support to exerciſed Chriſtians, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Intereſts of the Kingdom of Chriſt, at this Day, when there is ſuch fierce Oppoſition made againſt the Revival of Religion and Succeſs of the Goſpel amongſt us, tho it is the Doing of the Lord. Bold Men ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their Might againſt it, and try to blacken it to the World with horrid Falſhoods, and odious malicious Reflections: But God will carry on his own Deſigns, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the feeble Attemps of Creatures.</p>
            <p>I commit this little Piece to the Reader's ſerious Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and the Bleſſing of the Almighty God.</p>

            <head>The DOCTRINE of PREDESTINATION, TRULY and FAIRLY ſtated.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N order to ſpeak clearly, and to Advantage, upon any Subject; and eſpecially if it be much controverted in the World, it is in the firſt Place neceſſary, that it be exactly defined, and bounded by its proper Limits; that it be repreſented properly, as it is maintain'd by thoſe who contend for it, that ſo both Parties may have the ſame fixed, determinate Idea of what they reaſon about, and ſpeak both ſtill to the ſelf ſame Thing. Endleſs are the Confuſions and Contentions that are introduced into the World, either for the Want of this Care in defining, and rightly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject in Debate; or for 'Want of Honeſty in an Oppoſite, when he will not keep cloſe to the very Thing, tho' he doth underſtand what it is. It is the readieſt Way to bring any Controverſy to a right Iſſue, rightly to ſtate and repreſent the Caſe, and then to keep cloſe to it, as ſo ſtated, and not ſuffer another Thing, under the ſame Name, to be ſhuffled in, in its Place, thro' the Courſe of the Argument. In this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004896_0006_100E1508160085C8"/>Way, ſuch Objections, as ſuppoſe the Caſe to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what it is, are eaſily anſwered, by reducing the Objector to the prefixed Limits, and ſo ſhewing his Argument to be Nothing to the Purpoſe in Hand. And I Thingk there is no where more need of this Care and Attention, than about the Doctrine of <hi>God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> which is the Subject of this ſmall Treatiſe. I know not any Doctrine more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly oppoſed, without being rightly underſtood; or by being diſingenuoſly and uncandidly miſrepreſented. I ſhall therefore, firſt of all, ſtate the Doctrine truly, and then defend and confirm it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the true State of the Doctrine, it may be taken up in theſe two or three Propoſitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That as God, from everlaſting, was pleaſed, in his own free Sovereignty, to decree and determine, to create this World; and to make Man in it a reaſonable Creature, in his own Image, holy and upright, every Way fitted and impower'd for that Duty which was due, from ſuch a rational Creature, to the great God Creator, with full Ability to perſevere and continue in that happy State of Integrity; and to enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Life with him, wherein all the human Race were to be concern'd and engaged; and <hi>Adam,</hi> their firſt Father, conſtituted their publick Head and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative; ſo that as he kept or broke the Covenant, they were to enjoy or loſe the promis'd Bleſſings of it: And as God infallibly foreknew the Fall and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> as what he had decreed to permit, and ſo the Depravity and Ruin of his Poſterity conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon, according to the Covenant; with all the actual Sins which every Individual ſhou'd ever be guilty of; ſo he was likewiſe pleaſed, of his own mere Grace and free Favour, to deerce and determine, to recover and ſave a Number, only known to himſelf, of that fallen wretched Race, thro' the Meditation of his own Son's Redeeming them, by anſwering the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004896_0007_100E150B5893D6F0"/>Precept and Penalty of the broken Law for them; and thro' the Sanctification of his eternal Spirit, making them fit for and capable of glorifying and enjoying him forever.</item>
               <item>2. That God's determining and appointing to ſave any of fallen Mankind, or any in particular more than others, was not up on the Foreſight of any Difference which he foreſaw they wou'd make among themſelves, by the better Improvement of any common Helps and Advantages, as the Reaſon of it: But it was purely of his own ſovereign, free, wiſe Pleaſure, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace.</item>
               <item>3. That the reſt of fallen Mankind, not thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and ordained to eternal Life, he was pleaſed, of his ſovereign, wiſe and righteous Pleaſure, as a juſt King and Lawgiver, to determine to leave in their fallen State; and to puniſh them according to all the Sin and Diſobedience, which they ſhou'd be guilty of, and chargeable with.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This is, briefly, a juſt View of the Caſe I am upon; which I hope, with the divine Direction and Conduct, to maintain againſt all the Arguments commonly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Doctrine. I cannot indeed expect, that this Repreſentation of it, will render it generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and agreeable, to thoſe who have been long prejudiced againſſt it; but that is not the Queſtion, whether we wou'd encline and deſire to have it ſo; but, whether it be truly and really ſo, whether we wou'd deſire it ſhou'd be ſo, or not? Many of the Laws and Commands of God are very contrary to the Will and Inclination of depraved Sinners; but they are not the leſs truly the Commands of God for that. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Deſence of this Doctrine, I wou'd firſt ſhew, that it is a reaſonable, and next, that it is a ſcriptural Doctrine; and ſpeak to the Arguments which may be urged, both for and againſt it, from both theſe Topicks, of Reaſon and Revelation.</p>

II. 1. Thoſe who oppoſe the Doctrine of abſolute Decrees, generally bring in a heavy Indictment againſt it, as big with the moſt glaring Abſurdities, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, and Contradictions to the very Light of Reaſon: And theſe ſuch as involve in them the groſſeſt Impiety, and moſt horrid Blaſphemy againſt the divine Majeſty; as, that it is directly contrary to, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infers the exact Reverſe of moſt of the glorious Perfections and Attributes, which Reaſon, as well as Scripture, teaches us to aſcribe to the great God; that it makes him unjuſt, and tyrannically cruel: Some ſay (I dread to expreſs it) worſe than the very Devil; that it makes him the Author of Sin, chargeable with moſt if not all the Guilt of it; that it makes him a moſt groſs, hypocritical Diſſembler, &amp;c. But ſure, it is not the proper <hi>Calviniſtick</hi> Doctrine, upon that Head, that theſe Men bring in all theſe awful and ſhocking Charges againſt; but ſome horrid Compoſition of their own Brain, which they will palm upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> whether they will or no: Or elſe they juſt reſolve, to bring a popular Odium upon the Doctrine, by ſuch vile, bold, and daring Methods; to impoſe upon ſuch as are not well capable to reaſon clearly or cloſely, upon ſuch a ſublime Subject, that they may abhor the very Thoughts of it. I readily own, that whatſoever Notion infers any the leaſt Imperſection in God, is unreaſonable and worſe than falſe. But let the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have given of this Doctrine, be but duly and unbyaſs'dly conſidered; and then tell me, if there is any Thing ſo diſhonourable to God, or unreaſonable in it: If there is, in which of the three Propoſitions, or Articles is it? Is it in the firſt, when it is ſaid, that God decreed to permit <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall? But you muſt own, that he did permit it, <hi>that is,</hi> that he did not prevent it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f you own that <hi>Adam</hi> did fall; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently you muſt own, that God decreed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or ſuffer him to fall; for it's highly abſurd to ſay
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004896_0009_100E150F0F45C658"/>that he did permit it without determining to permit it; that is the ſame Thing as to ſay, that he took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it at all, till it was done; that it never once came under the View of his all-comprehending, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning Mind, how <hi>Adam</hi> wou'd behave himſelf in ſuch Circumſtances as he was in, when he did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, if left merely to his own Uſe of his original Powers: But this is to deny God's infinite and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Perfection. Well then, if he had this View and Knowledge of what <hi>Adam</hi> wou'd do in ſuch a Caſe, if thus left to himſelf; <hi>that is,</hi> that he wou'd ſin; he determin'd either to hinder or ſuffer it, to prevent or permit it. It's manifeſt he did not determine to prevent it, for if ſo, it wou'd not have been: And his not determining or decreeing to prevent in when he infallibly knew it wou'd be if he did not, was decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to permit it. And then, upon this Decree to permit the Fall, proceeded God's certain Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, as future. Moreover, this permiſſive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and Foreknowledge of Man's Tranſgreiſion and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, plainly appears, from God's having foreoroain'd a Redeemer before the Foundation of the World, as acccording to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. And now, ſeeing theſe Things are plainly ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That God did thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to permit the Fall of Man, which, in his perfect and boundleſs Knowledge, he ſaw would be, if he did not hinder it by his immediate, ſuper-added Influence; and conſequently foreſaw it, as a Thing that wou'd ſurely be; ſo plain, that he muſt have a ſtrange Art of managing his Reaſon, who will carefully follow theſe few Steps I have here taken, and not be conſtrain'd to yield his Aſſent: Then ſurely one would think, there was more Reverence and Honour due to the great and glorious Majeſty of God, than for any poor Worms of the Duſt, to bring in their bold Charges againſt him here; and ſay, that for theſe Things he is the Author of Sin, either in that be created Man at all, or in that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004896_0010_100E151290074968"/>he did not prevent his Sin, when he could have done it. <hi>Who art thou, O Man, that replieſt againſt God!</hi> Surely it becomes us, to entertain more honourable, exalting Tho'ts of God, than to give the leaſt Way to ſuch a vile Suggeſtion; even ſuppoſing our poor Mole-Eyes ſhould not be able to diſcern, to our Satisfaction, how it could be otherwiſe. We may, on the one Hand, be clearly aſſured of God's permiſſive Decree, and certain Foreknowledge of Man's Sin; and on the other Hand, as well aſſured, that he is eſſentially, and infinitely holy: And tho' we ſhould not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe together, yet he can; and that ought to ſilence and ſatisfy us: It does not well befit us, to put ourſelves upon a Par with him; and think, that he can know Nothing, but what we muſt know too. But yet, I ſee no Need of leaving the Caſe at this Iſſue neither: For how unreaſonable and ridiculous is the Ground of the Charge? God did not purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to prevent <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sinning, when it was eaſy to his Power to have prevented it; well, and what then? Did not the Lord give him ſufficient Power to have prevented it himſelf? And was not this enough to free the kind Creator from all Blame in the Caſe? Cannot God make a Creature perfect, and compleat in its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Rank, endowed with full Ability and Power to preſerve its Glory unſtain'd, and put it in a State of Probation and Trial, without a criminal Charge? Muſt he be call'd to anſwer at the Creature's Bar, for its own Miſcarriage and voluntary Rebellion, in ſuch a Caſe? Indeed, if we maintained, that God did not give <hi>Adam</hi> ſufficient Power to preſerve his Fidelity, and withſtand the Temptation; or that God, by his immediate Energy, overpower'd him to a Compliance; then I confeſs, there would be no ſtanding before the Argument: But as we aſſert no ſuch Thing, nor any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will afford ſuch a Conſequence, how unfair and inexcuſable is it, to give out as if we did? Which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004896_0011_100DEFABAE19D1A0"/>is the Method of too many, either ignorantly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And let me obſerve, that the <hi>Arminians,</hi> yea, Men of all Sorts of Religions in the World, are no leſs obliged to anſwer this Difficulty, than the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts;</hi> for they muſt all ackowledge, that there is Sin in the World, and that God has permitted it, otherwiſe it could not be; yea, you muſt acknowledge yourſelves to have been guilty of Sins, and ſuch as you might have avoided. But dare you lift up your Face before God, and ſay to him, <q>I have done many Evils, even ſuch as I had Power to refrain; but they are thy Sins and not mine, becauſe thou didſt not keep me from them.</q> Would not your own Reaſon confound you with Shame, at the Thoughts of ſuch a male-pert, ſenſeleſs Speech to God? As little Reaſon is there, whatever leſs, for charging the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God in the Caſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Or, is it Matter of juſt Prejudice againſt this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that Mankind are ſaid to have been conſidered, in the divine Decree, as univerſally fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> in Conſequence of his Breach and Violation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, wherein he was appointed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Head and Repreſentative of his Poſterity? But ſure yourſelves muſt acknowledge, that all Mankind did fall in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, if you profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the holy Scriptures: So long as the Fifth Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtands in the Bible, it will be impoſſible, with any Face of Modeſty, to deny it; where we are told, that <hi>by one Man Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> And that <hi>by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</hi> When you ſay, that all Mankind are recovered again, out of the Condemnation and Ruin which the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon them, by Jeſus Chriſt; is it not an Acknowledgment, that they were all once fallen, and ruin'd by it? And inaſmuch as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004896_0012_100E1514145425B8"/>yourſelves acknowledge it was ſo, you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it was reaſonable, and no-way inconſiſtent with the Perfections of God, that it ſhould be ſo; or elſe you ſay, point blank, that God was, at leaſt once, unrighteous. And now, ſeeing Mankind were fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> which God's glorious Perfections will not ſuffer us to think it was any Way unreaſonable on unjuſt in him; it neceſſarily follows, that it would have been no Way unreaſonable or unjuſt in God, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he had ſo pleaſed, to have left them all in that fallen State, without reſtoring any. Seeing there was once a plain Forfeiture of all Rights and Privileges, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law and Juſtice, it was at the free Pleaſure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the great Law-giver, to beſtow them again upon any or not; unleſs you will ſay, that our Recovery by Chriſt was not of free and mere Grace, but what God was bound to order and bring about, or elſe oppoſe his own Nature and be unjuſt; and ſo, that herein he did what we have no Reaſon to thank him for: Which, to ſay, is not only a groſs Inconſiſtency in itſelf, but ſuch an Impiety againſt God, that few, I believe, wou'd be ſo bold as to venture upon it. It is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to talk of our being <hi>redeem'd,</hi> by God, out of a miſerable State, which it was unjuſt for him, either to ſuffer us to come into, or yet to leave us in. There is no need of a Mediator and Redeemer, in ſuch a Caſe. Then indeed Chriſt is dead in vain. Thus far we have made our Way clear. Well then, I ſay again, if it would have been no Way unbecoming God, if he had ſo pleaſed, to have determined to leave all Mankind in that fallen State; no Man will ſay, who duly conſiders what he ſays, that it would have been any Way unbecoming him, had he ſo pleaſed, looking upon them in this fallen, guilty, apoſtate State, to have made this Diſtinction among them, in his eternal Purpoſe; which I am defending: And ſo the proper Doctrine of Predeſtination, in the right Notion
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004896_0013_100E15168B43ED28"/>of it, muſt be own'd to be entirely reaſonable; and the very Method, for what we know, that God (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs he has told us the contrary) was pleaſed to take.</p>
            <p>But to make all this yet clearer, I would give this farther brief Account, of the Reaſonableneſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's partaking in the ſad Fruits of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. I would account for it, from his being ſet up, as their publick Head and Repreſentative, in the firſt Covenant. If this Conſtitution and Appointment of God, was reaſonable, then all that was natively conſequent upon it, according to the Tenor of it, muſt be ſo too. To make it appear, that this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was every Way juſt and reaſonable, let it be conſidered, that it was in its own Nature adapted, and directly calculated to the great Good and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Mankind; ſecuring to them a confirmed State of Innocence, and everlaſting Happineſs, upon their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it to leave him in a State of Probation and Trial; ſo that none of them would have been any more in the Danger of a probationary State for themſelves. <hi>Adam</hi> was ſufficiently impower'd to manage this great Truſt, endowed with full Ability to keep the Covenant; yea, with as full as any of his Offspring would have had, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2. In the next Place, is there any thing ſo horrid in the ſecond Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That God's Decree and Purpoſe, to ſave any of the fallen, apoſtate Race, was not founded upon his Foreſight of their good Works, and diligent Endeavours, as the Cauſe of it; but was purely owing to his own ſovereign Pleaſure and Grace. This is a Sentiment ſo far from being unreaſonable, that I think the contrary is plainly ſo, abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that the imperfect, corrupted, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſelfiſh Endeavours, of rebellious, guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould be of ſuch high Price with God, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to determine him to ſave them; ſo that he would be unjuſt, if he did not thereupon deſign and effectuate their Salvation. Is this a Notion, either ſo very reaſonable in itſelf, or honourable to God? And yet this is the Principle that muſt be maintain'd, if the Doctrine I am defending be charged with being, in itſelf, unreaſonable. To manifeſt a little the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of ſuch a Notion, I would aſk, If an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect Obedience to the Law of God, without the leaſt Defect, would be any more than our Duty to him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he is ſuch a glorious Being, and we his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! If it would not (and no Man in his right Wits will ſay otherwiſe) then how can the very imperfect, the every Way corrupt, and contemptible Obedience, that's performed by guilty Sinners, make it ſo neceſſary for God to pardon their paſt Diſobedience, as that he would be unreaſonable and unjuſt, if he did not? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Principle, Pardon would not properly be pardon; it would not be an Act of meer Grace, and rich Mercy, but of juſt Debt. But who is there, that has the Front to demand it, as ſuch, for all the good Works that ever he did? I believe you wou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd hard Work of it, to bring the Notion into Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and very formally tell the great God, that <q>Tho' you had ſinn'd againſt him, and contemned his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; yet you had done ſo well ſince, that you
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004896_0018_100E1520EA76F0F0"/>wou'dn't now be beholden to him for Pardon, you claim'd it as your due, on the Score of his eſſential Equity, which, he would be unjuſt, if he refus'd.</q> It is moreover a Notion, that entirely ſuperſedes and takes away all Neceſſity of Chriſt's Attonement and Satisfaction. What need of ſuch a Propitiation and Ranſom, if any thing that guilty Sinners cou'd do, could render it unjuſt in God, not to ſave them? And now, ſeeing theſe Things are plainly ſo, it as plainly and neceſſarily follws, that it was no Way unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor unbecoming any of the divine Perfections for God to make his own ſovereign, abſolute Good-Will and Pleaſure, the Rule of his Determinations, of diſpenſing his ſaving Mercies to any fallen, guilty Sinners; and not their Works or Endeavours. Yea, I'll add, it is highly preſumable from Reaſon itſelf, and ſeems to be its very Dictate, that this was actually the Way of God's Proceeding in the Caſe; as what was moſt ſuitable to his independent Sovereignty, for the maintaining, and Illuſtration of his exalted Glory; and to abaſe the Pride of all Fleſh, that none ſhould glory in his Preſence; but as it is written, <hi>He that glorieth, ſhould glory in the Lord alone:</hi> That his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd and ſaved People, ſhould forever aſcribe the <hi>whole Glory and Praiſe</hi> to his ſovereign, free, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Grace. This Method, in the Caſe, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding like a God; as becomes the ſupream JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH: Exalts both his own Glory, and the Happineſs of ſaved Sinners, to the higheſt; while they are ever ſenſible, that as he might juſtly have ſaved none, ſo they have Nothing to aſcribe to themſelves in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, why he ſaved them more than any others. Hence their Hearts beat high with the tendereſt, ſweeteſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of Love and Wonder, with the higheſt Aſcriptions of Glory and Praiſe, to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever. So that, I believe, this Doctrine ſuits beſt with the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004896_0019_100E152441645A90"/>of Heaven, however it be reliſh'd on Earth. If we conſider the hateful, horrid, and criminal Nature of Sin; what can there be in any Sinner, to engage to him the Love and Favour of a God of infinite Holineſs, and incomprehenſible Majeſty; in whoſe Sight the Heavens are not clean; who <hi>charges his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with Folly?</hi> Now, tho' all theſe Conſiderations make it plainly appear, that it's every Way reaſonable, yea, moſt becoming the adorable Majeſty of God, that the Reaſon of his appointing any fallen Sinners, in particular, more than others, to eternal Life, ſhould be wholly reſolv'd into his ſovereign Pleaſure; that it ſhould be entirely founded in himſelf, and not at all in them: Yet I'm apprehenſive, that here lies the main Ground of the Quarrel; for tho' Sin has made Man extreamly poor, it hasn't made him humble, but much to the contrary; the unbroken Pride and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of Sinners Hearts, will not allow it to be right or equitable at all, that it ſhould be altogether at the free, ſovereign Pleaſure of God, whether to ſave them or not; unleſs they have it in their own Hand, they'll quarrel with God himſelf; altho' they deſerve not ſo much as the leaſt Ground for Hope, that ever he will ſave them. It would ſurely, better become ſuch Hell-deſerving Rebels as we, to be ſo humbly ſenſible of our vile Iniquities, as to acknowledge God's ſovereign Right to diſpoſe of us as he ſees fit; that if he ſhould abandon us to Miſery forever, it would be but juſt and right, notwithſtanding all that ever we could do; and if he ſaves us, it will be an Inſtance of the moſt glorious, free, ſovereign Grace and Mercy, which he might righteouſly have denied. But theſe Things may ſuffice here, to ſhow that this Part of the Doctrine alſo, ſtands free of all unreaſonable Abſurdity, and unbecoming Reflections on God. And if you wou'd have the whole Evidence again, in a narrow Compaſs, you may take it thus. God, the great
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004896_0020_100E1525C685EFE8"/>Creator and Upholder of all Things, is the rightful Law-giver, and moral Governor of the reaſonable World; conſidering the infinite, boundleſs Glory and Perfections of his Nature, and his Right in and over us, as his Creatures, our Obligations of Love and Duty to him, are inconceivably great and infinite: Hence Sin and Diſobedience againſt ſuch infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and Obligations, is infinitely evil; deſerving the Sinner's everlaſting Rejection from God, with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added poſitive Puniſhment. All Mankind, thro' the Sin and Diſobedience of their firſt Parent, are become deſtitute of original Righteouſneſs, and all Right to the Life and Happineſs promiſed in the firſt Covenant; and all ſuch as are preſerved to Years in the World, have ſinned actually in their own Perſons, and that far beyond what was abſolutely unavoidable from their original Depravity; whence they in Juſtice deſerve a far greater Puniſhment. God had as clear and certain a Knowledge of all this Apoſtacy, and Sin of, Mankind, from all Eternity, as after it actually came to paſs; ſo that in his Decrees concerning them, he conſidered them as in ſuch a fallen, guilty State, deſerving the Execution of his vindictive Juſtice; and atogether inſufficient to do any thing, that might in the leaſt ſatisfy its Demands, for the averting of the Stroke. And ſo, from the whole, it clearly appears, that God had as aboſolute, juſt, and great a Sovereignty over them, to appoint any Part of them for Life or Death, according to his own Pleaſure, as the <hi>Potter has over his Clay, of the ſame Lump, to make one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, after all theſe Things, what can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſaid againſt the third and laſt of the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Which is, That God determin'd to leave a Part of theſe guilty Sinners, (<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe whom he did not chuſe to Salvation) in their fallen guilty State; and to execute Juſtice upon them for their Sins.

            <p>Again, it is objected, that this Doctine <hi>makes God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is their making ſuch a Difference between Perſons, in their Temper and Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as is contrary to Right and Equity; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the like. And I readily own, that Partiality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons, in this Senſe, is very far from God <hi>He accepts not the Perſons of Princes, nor regards th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Account at all of the little Differences among them, of Nation of any of his Dealings towards them: And it is in this Senſe, that Reſpecting of Perſons is always taken in Scripture, where-ever it is condemn'd in Men, or deny'd concerning God. And ſure the Doctrine I am defending, is ſo far from inferring any ſuch Reſpect of Perſons in God, that it's at the firſt View directly contrary to it. Yet farther I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, there may be among Men a ſavouring of one more than another, which you may call Reſpecting of Perſons, or if you will, Partiality, or by what Name you pleaſe; but it carries no ill Idea in it: Such, for Inſtance, as our Lord ſpeaks of, <hi>Matth.</hi> xx. where the Lord of the Vineyard gave to ſome of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers an undeſerved Bounty, while he gave to others only what Juſtice neceſſarily required: And this is brought in by our Lord Jeſus himſelf, for this very Caſe (ſce <hi>vcr.</hi> 16.) to vindicate God's making ſuch a Difference among guilty Sinners, againſt ſuch as make this Objection: And God's Defence here, is unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, againſt all the Murmurings of ſuch as he has not choſen to Salvation; <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong,</hi> whatſoever good I do to others; <hi>Is it not lawful for me

            </p>
            <p>It is farther objected, that according to this Doctrine, <hi>it is God's Fault, and not theirs, that any periſh; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it was ever impoſſible for them to be ſaved, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were under an irreverſible Appointment to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, before ever they had a Being.</hi> But what has been ſaid already, will eaſily anſwer all the Difficulty that may ſeem to be in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That God appointed them to be puniſhed only for their Sins, whereby they in Juſtice deſerve it: And ſurely their Sinning is not any Fault in God; nor yet his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to deſerved Puniſhment for it: But ſeeing all their Puniſhment will be only according to the Demerit of their Sin, their whole Deſtruction will properly be of themſelves, and their own Fault. But if any ſhould yet fooliſhly think, that the meer Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or infallible Certainty of the Event, would render Sinners free of all the Blame of their Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it was always certain, that ſo it would be in the End. Let them try any other Scheme they pleaſe, and ſee if they can rid themſelves of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for whatſoever at any Time is, was always infallibly certain to be, whether you allow a Deecree concerning it, or not: So that you muſt either deny, that it's ſo much as poſſible for any Creature to periſh juſtly, at all; or you muſt own, that the bare Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Event, that they will periſh, does not free them from being the proper blameable Cauſes of their own Perdition: And its being certain by a divine Appointment, makes them no more clear of the Blame; becauſe the Decree only is, to puniſh them for, and according to the Demerit of their Sins; which Sins, it lays no forcible Conſtraint, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion upon them, to be guilty of.</p>
            <p>Again, it is ſaid, That <hi>if this Doctrine be true, then it follows, that God creates Men to damn them.</hi> This
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004896_0026_100E15328E289A70"/>ſeems to be a ready-hand Argument, almoſt in every ones Mouth that denies the Doctrine.</p>

               </gap> his bringing them into Being: And this imports in it that God loves, and delights in the Puniſhment and Miſery of Creatures, merely as ſuch, and for its own Sake; which is a Thing moſt blaſphemous to ſuppoſe of him. To ſuppoſe, that the Miſery of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtrictly and abſtractly in itſelf, without any other Conſideration, is agreeable and pleaſing to God; yea ſo agreeable, that he makes them for this very End that he may have the Pleaſure of puniſhing them; is indeed, to repreſent him like the very worſt of Beings But then I would aſk, Does God's decreeing to puniſh Men for their Sin, as they deſerve, for maintaining the Dignity of his Government, and the ſhewing forth of his infinite Holineſs, Juſtice, and rightful Authority; does this, I ſay, bear in it any ſuch Thing, as that he delights barely in the Miſery of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo as to create them for the Sake of it? How irrational is ſuch a Conſequence? But if any will yet inſiſt on it, as a juſt Conſequence, I deſire them to conſider a little, how they will free their own Scheme of it; which is every whit as liable to the Charge: Unleſs they have ſtupid Ignorance, and blaſphemous Preſumption enough, to deny God's infinite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Fore-knowledge of all Things, it is juſt as reaſonable to bring this Objection againſt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> as the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and ſay, that <hi>God creates Men to damn them,</hi> if he knows before-hand, that he will damn them; if he fore-knew that they would die impenitent, in Unbelief; and thereupon has decreed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004896_0027_100E1535064A5230"/>their Damnttion, before he has created them. The Truth in the Matter is this, God decreed to create all Men for the Manifeſtation of his own Glory, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s his End in all his Works; and looking upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their Apoſtacy and Sin, he decreed to leave a particular Part of them in that State, and to puniſh them according to their Sin, for the Manifeſtation of the Glory of his Sovereignty, Holineſs and Juſtice, and the right and infinite Obligations of his Authority, as a Law-giver over his reaſonable Creatures. This View of the Caſe gives no Ground for the Charge contain'd in the Objection. Tho' God foreſees that Mankind will ſin againſt him, cannot he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, create them; and determine to puniſh them, or any Part of them, as their Sin deſerves, for the Illuſtration of his Glory aforeſaid; without being chargeable with creating them, juſt that he might damn them? To ſay ſo, is the ſame Thing as to ſay, that the Sin and Default of the Creature, muſt bind up God's Hands from doing that which is in itſelf every Way reaſonable and Right; And in ſhort, to ſay, that right is wrong. But I preſume, I have been long enough on the firſt Method propos'd, for defending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this Doctrine: And that, from what has been ſaid, it ſufficiently appears, at leaſt, that it is a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine free of all unreaſonable Abſurdity in itſelf, and no way diſhonourable to God. So that Reaſon has Nothing to ſay, why it may not be ſo. And if in the next Place we find, that God's infallible Word of Truth declares that it is ſo; this ought to put a final Concluſion to the Debate, and fully determine the Controverſy. If there is Nothing in the Doctrine abſurd, or contrary to Reaſon, why it may not be ſo; then when a paſſage of Scripture is brought to prove that it is ſo, we muſtn't be put off any more with this Anſwer, That <q>whatever the Scripture means, it can't mean Predeſtination.</q> A great Aſſerter of

On this Miſrepreſentation, much of his arguing for the <hi>Arminions</hi> proceeds.

But farther, Reaſon not only readily allows, that God might have form'd his eternal Purpoſes and Decrees, concerning fallen Man, according to this Doctrine; but (if duly attended to, without ſelfiſh Prejudice) it ſeems, as has been already hinted, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to perſude us, that ſo the Caſe really is, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt becoming God's independent Sovereignty; and moſt expreſſive of the abſolute Freeneſs, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Riches of his Grace, to thoſe that are ſaved; whereby the whole Glory of it is ſecured to himſelf, and no Ground afforded to the Hell-deſerving Sinner, for any Thing, contrary to thoſe humble Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of his own Wretchedneſs that well become him: Whereas the contrary Doctrine leaves Room to the Sinner, to truſt to ſomething in himſelf, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe ſomething to himſelf, in the Matter of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It ſets too high a Value upon the deſpicable, religious Endeavours of corrupted Sinners; when it maintains, that God is thereby induced to receive the Sinner to Favour, notwithſtanding all his Rebellions. And by thus repreſenting the God, whom by Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we have contemn'd and diſhonour'd as ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

If Sin againſt God, is looked upon as a Thing that's ſo eaſily Compenſated; and the Breach occaſion'd by it, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily made up, on ſuch low Conditions.

And as this Purpoſe and Fore-appointment of God, made their Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Juſtification infallibly certain; ſo it equally ſecures their final Glorification.

            <p>The 9th Chapter of this Epiſtle is very plain and expreſs on this Argument.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Meaning here, appears plainly from all that follows; For the Illuſtration and Confirmation of this Caſe, he ſhews, that God put a great Limitation upon that Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which he particularly deſign'd the Promiſe; in his Words to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> Hereby the Lord ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gnified to him, that there was a greater Number of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004896_0035_100E154750572E88"/>the Election to be of his Poſterity in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Line, than in the Line of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or of any of his other Sons that he ſhould ever have, as he had ſeveral by a ſecond Marriage; and therefore God would take a more ſpecial Care of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Offspring. And indeed, no other Account can be given, for his diſtinguiſhing Concern about them, more than the reſt of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity; or for his affording greater Advantages to one Nation than another, at this Day, but becauſe of a much greater Number of his elect Ones being among them; becauſe he knows whom he has choſen. And then the Apoſtle comes to give another Inſtance of the ſame Kind, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſtinction which God made between the two Branches of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Offspring, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. and Sequ. <hi>And not only this, but when</hi> Rebecca <hi>alſo bad conceived by one, even by our Father</hi> Iſaac: <hi>(For the Children being not yet born, neither having done any good or Evil, that the Purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand, not of Works, but of him that calleth) it was ſaid unto her, The Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſhews, that tho' God had ſaid, that <hi>the Seed of Abraham,</hi> which he chiefly intended in the Promiſe of being their God, <hi>was to be in</hi> Iſaac's <hi>Line;</hi> yet he intended one Part of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Seed more than the other; which he intimated to <hi>Rebecca</hi> before her Twin-Children were born, when he ſaid, <hi>the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger.</hi> And thus he obſerves, there was a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Purpoſe and Decree of God concerning them <hi>(before they had done any good or evil)</hi> according to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; which Purpoſe of Election is not of Works, <hi>but of him that calleth,</hi> according to his own ſovereign Pleaſure. The Apoſtles Meaning is plainly this, that God's chuſing <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a great Number of his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, more than <hi>Eſau</hi> or his Poſterity, was not on Account of any good Works to be performed by any of them, more than by the others, as the Reaſon of it; any more than it was on Account of good Works
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004896_0036_100E1549C274DC48"/>already done, before they were born, when neither of them had done either good or evil. So, tho' the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Words very likely refers to the reſpective Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terities of thoſe two Brothers, as well as to their own Perſons; yet they reſpect their ſpiritual Intereſt more than their temporal; and ſignify, that God had many more of his Elect in the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> than of <hi>Eſau,</hi> at leaſt while they continued two viſibly diſtinct Bodies; and therefore he took more Care of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity, taking them into, and keeping them in a viſible Church Relation to himſelf, while he ſuffered the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> to degenerate into Heatheniſm and Pagan Idolatry; ſo caſting them off from ſo much as any viſible Relation to him, as his Church; And this directly anſwers the Apoſtle's Purpoſe; which is to ſhew, that God had a peculiar elect Seed among the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which he principally deſign'd, and referr'd to, in the Promiſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was no Argument, that the Word of God had fail'd or taken no Effect; tho' great Bodies of their natural Seed were neglected, and ſeparated from his Church; and it was as reaſonable to ſuppoſe the ſame Thing of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Seed. This Election, he aſſerts, was <hi>not of Works, but</hi> purely <hi>of him that calleth,</hi> as he pleaſes. And ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and Sequ. he goes on, to anſwer the grand Objection, which he ſaw wou'd readily he laid againſt the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That it make God unjuſt, cruel, partial, and all what not: <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?</hi> ſays he, <hi>Is there Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God? God forbid. For he ſaith to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy, and I will have Compaſſion on whom I will have Compaſſion.</hi> He obſerves, that God had ſufficiently anſwered the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection himſelf, in theſe his Words to <hi>Meſes, Exed,</hi> xxxiii. 19. Which clearly ſignify, that <hi>all had ſinned,</hi> and juſtly deſerved the Execution of his Wrath; and ſo were become Objects of meer Mercy, which he

And in theſe Words he declares, that as he juſtly might, ſo he really has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this royal Sovereignty to himſelf, of beſtowing Mercy to guilty Creatures, juſt as himſelf pleaſes; that <hi>he will have Mercy and Compaſſion on whom he will.</hi> From whence the Apoſtle clearly infers, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> i. e. The Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any guilty Sinners, is not at all of themſelves, as being better enclin'd and behav'd than others; but altogether of God, who beſtows Mercy as he pleaſes; <hi>who will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and who will have Compaſſion on whom he will have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi> But I preſume I need proſecute the Argument no farther from this Chapter; it is fully clear already, beyond all reaſonable Contradiction, that it maintains the very Doctrine I have undertaken to prove.</p>
            <p>And it is no leſs clearly maintain'd in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Epheſions: According as he hath choſen us in him,</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without Blame before him, in Love: Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by Jeſus Chriſt, to himſelf, according to the good Pleaſure of his Will;</hi> ver. 4, 5. The Election which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, was more than a chuſing of them to external Church Privileges, even an Election to eternal Salvation; for he ſays, <hi>God had predeſtinated them to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And</hi> (as he ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 17.) <hi>if Children, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt.</hi> Moreover he deſcribes them, as thoſe that were in a State of ſaving Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, ſaying, <hi>God hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in heavenly Places in Chriſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004896_0038_100E154E497952D0"/>Jeſus:</hi> And then immediately adds, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy.</hi> Their <hi>being bleſſed with all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> was according to God's fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Choice of them; it was the Fruit of a gracious and eternal Purpoſe to that End; and they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, not becauſe they would be holy, but that they ſhould be holy; their Goodneſs was not the Cauſe, but the Effect of their Election. And <hi>ver.</hi> 5. they were <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> or fore-appointed, <hi>to be the Children of God,</hi> not according to their <hi>good Works</hi> or Diſpoſitions, but <hi>according to the good Pleaſure of his Will;</hi> not to their own Praiſe, but <hi>to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace;</hi> as it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And very expreſly, to the ſame Purpoſe, he ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Purpoſe of him, who worketh all Things after the Counſel of his own Will.</hi> We are not <hi>predeſtinated to the heavenly Inheritance,</hi> ſays he, according to the Purpoſe of one, who proceeds according to the Will and Behaviour of others; but <hi>according to the Purpoſe of him, who does all Things after the Counſel of his own Will.</hi>

            <p>Another Place of Scripture, very expreſly aſſerting an abſolute Election, you may ſee in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 9. <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began.</hi> The plain Meaning of theſe Words (if they can be made plainer) is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <q>God hath ſaved us. and effectually called us out of a State of Sin to Holineſs; and this is not to be aſcribed to any Works or Endeavours of ours, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But beſide theſe direct and immediate Teſtimonies of Scripture to the Doctrine, it may be farther clearly prov'd, from ſuch Scripture Paſſages, as declare the Abſoluteneſs and Sovereignty of God's Proceeding, in the effectual Calling, and Converſion of Sinners, to himſelf.

                  </gap> which are mighty; and baſe Things of the World, and Things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen; yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things that are; That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence.</hi> Here you ſee, God calls juſt whom he will, among the guilty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men: Some of the high and mighty of the World; but more generally he has order'd it, that thoſe whom he deſigns to call, ſhall be poor and mean in all worldly Reſpects: And the general Reaſon is, to daſh down all human Pride, <hi>that no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence;</hi> but that <hi>he that glorieth,</hi> ſhould <hi>glory</hi> only <hi>in the Lord,</hi> ver, 31. And it is remarkable, how
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004896_0041_100E1554C38AE410"/>the Apoſtle alters the Term, after he had begun with <hi>Calling,</hi> he puts in <hi>Chuſing</hi> in the Place of it; becauſe temporal Vocation exactly correſponds to eternal Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the certain Conſequent and Evidence of it; and the one is as free and abſolute as the other, ſo that it was equal which of the Terms he us'd. Numbers of Scripture Inſtances prove this Truth. What good Works of Obedience to Chriſt had <hi>Paul</hi> done? Or what good Diſpoſitions had he towards him, before he reach'd him by his powerful Grace, to induce the Lord to chuſe and call him? Were not great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Nation, as good as he, left to periſh in Unbelief? What were the good Works and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of <hi>Abraham,</hi> more than others, when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, as he was ſerving other Gods on the other Side of the Flood, with the reſt of his Father's Houſe? <hi>Joſh.</hi> xxiv. 2. of whom the Lord ſays, <hi>Iſai.</hi> li. 2. <hi>I called him alone, and bleſſed him.</hi> This Argument is ſo clear, and certain in all its Parts, that I think it would be quite ſuperfluous, to beſtow any more Pains upon it.</p>
            <p>Again, the Doctrine of Abſolute Election appears from the only Way of fallen Sinners Salvation, as it is laid down and declar'd in the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> The Way of believing only and entirely in the Merit and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus, for actual Reconciliation with God. The Argument here may be thus form'd. That Doctrine, which leaves no Room for guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to reſt and depend on any thing, but the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Favour of God, and their Acceptance with him; (the contrary of which, does give Room to Sinners to reſt, and depend alſo, on ſomething elſe, for Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Acceptance with God) muſt be true, and its contrary falſe, according to the Scriptures: But the Doctrine of abſolute Election leaves no Room for guilty Sinners to reſt and depend on any thing, for the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004896_0042_100E1557D2CBE7A8"/>reconcil'd Favour of God, and their Acceptance with him, but the Merit and Attonement of Jeſus Chriſt only: And the contrary Doctrine does give them room to reſt, and depend alſo, on ſomething elſe for it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomething in them, or done by them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctrine of abſolute Election is true, and the contrary Doctrine falſe, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The Scripture clearly teaches us, to look only to the Merit and Attonement of Chriſt's Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for actual Juſtification before God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with him: And it is as clear, that the Doctrine, of Sinners being choſen in Chriſt, and fore-appointed to Juſtification and eternal Life thro' him, of God's mere, ſovereign, free Grace, agrees very well with this; it cuts all the Sinews of Self-Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and leaves the Sinner no other Foundation to caſt himſelf upon, but the ſovereign Mercy of God, thro' a redeeming Saviour. And I think it's as clear again on the other Hand, that the oppoſite Doctrine, of a conditional Election, founded either upon the actual Exiſtence of ſome Good in, or done by the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or upon the Fore-Sight of it to be in him, or done by him, lays a Foundation for Self-Dependance, and ſo tends to keep undone Sinners from cloſing with Chriſt in the Way of the Goſpel. This deluſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion makes poor Creatures ſwell very big with a Conceit of themſelves, and what they do; when they imagine their Qualifications and Doings are of ſuch Price with God, it makes them halve the Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Salvation between Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and their own, which he will never bear: It makes them patch their filthy Rags and menſtrous Cloaths, to his compleat, unſpotted Robe, for a joint Recommendation of them to God's Acceptance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I can't ſee a material Difference between <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Proteſtants and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> about the Doctrine of Juſtification. And I find two great Biſhops, one of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004896_0043_100E155B0F578938"/>each Sort, of my Mind. Says Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his <hi>Expoſition</hi> (more properly <hi>Perverſion</hi>) of the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> Page 126. <q>This Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo ſtand by many of the Writers of the <hi>Church of Rame</hi> (after the Reformation) that as to the Main of it, we have no juſt Exception to it.</q> The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in his Expoſition of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> Page 93, after he has been explaining their Senſe of Juſtification, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of good Works, ſays, <q>And indeed we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the learned of their Party (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reform'd) do not contend ſo much of late about this Subject, as they did formerly; and there are but few, who do not now confeſs, there ought not to have been a Breach upon this Point. But if this important Difficulty about Juſtification, upon which their firſt Authors laid all their Streſs, be not look'd upon now, as eſſential, by the wiſeſt Perſons amongſt them, we leave them to think, what they ought to judge of their Separation; and what Hopes there would be of an Union, if they wou'd but overcome their Prejudice, and quit the Spirit of Contention.</q> Thus we ſee Proteſtants and Papiſts cordially ſhaking Hands, and agreeing again, in one of the moſt material Matters of Difference. And all the Conteſt remaining, is, which Side has made the Approach to the other. The one ſays, <hi>You have come to us:</hi> The other ſays, <hi>No, but you have come to us</hi> And this, I believe, will be judged but a ſmall Matter for Brethren to fall out about. However, I think I might venture, in a Court of Equity, to undertake to obtain Sentence upon this Plea, in Favour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument I ſhall offer, for Confirmation of this Doctrine, ſhall be taken from the declared Scope and Deſign of God in the Goſpel; which is (as it is highly reaſonable) to ſecure the whole Glory of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004896_0044_100E155D6E2DF5E0"/>Sinners Salvation to himſelf; and forever hide Prid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from Man: He aſſures us, he has ſo concerted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Scheme, and laid the Plan, that the ſaved Sinner ſhall not have the leaſt Ground to boaſt, or glory: Which evidently proves, that Election is not conditional founded on Sinners good Works or Diſpoſition; but abſolute, founded on God's good Pleaſure. For upon the conditional Scheme, the juſtify'd, converted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, has it to aſcribe to himſelf, that he, more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is in ſuch an happy State. The Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be God's diſtinguiſhing Love and Grace to him, beyond others; but his own diſtinguiſhing Goodneſs: For the others are ſuppoſed to have had as much Love and Kindneſs from God, as he; Whence then came the Difference that is between them? Not from God, for he made no Difference; but from himſelf. And does not this give ſome Ground for boaſting of himſelf in the Caſe? To arrogate ſome Glory and Praiſe to himſelf? But the true Goſpel-Way of Salvation, will not, in the leaſt, admit of any ſuch Thing. It is croſs to God's declared View, and Deſign in it. See <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8, 9. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved, thro' Faith; and that not of yourſelves: It is the Gift of God: Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould beaſt.</hi> The Way which God has laid for Sinners Salvation, is ſuch, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes and bars againſt all Boaſting in thoſe that are ſaved; and therefore it is not of <hi>Works,</hi> but thro' <hi>Faith,</hi> which is a Soul-humbling, Self-emptying Grace, and a Gift of God's royal Bounty, which he beſtows at pleaſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 27. After the Apoſtle has clearly laid down the true Goſpel-Way, of guilty Sinners Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Salvation, thro' the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed in a Way of believing; he aſks, <hi>Where is boaſting then?</hi> and anſwers, <hi>It is excluded. Not by the Law of Works, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> All boaſting is entirely excluded, by that Method which God has eſtabliſhed. And hence we may, with abundant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004896_0045_100E155F1D8A60C0"/>conclude, that that Doctrine, which affords any Room for Glorying and Boaſting, is not of God, being directly contrary to the Plan and Deſign of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Having now, I think, with great Clearneſs, from God's Word of Truth, prov'd the Doctrine of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, unconditional Election; I proceed in the next Place to prove, That thoſe of guilty Mankind, whom God did not thus chuſe to everlaſting Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' Chriſt, he determined to leave in their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty State, and inflict upon them their deſerved Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And upon this Branch of Predeſtination, I need be but ſhort, becauſe it is adundantly proven already, by the Proof of the former; for the one is a neceſſary Conſequence of the other. If God determin'd to deal with guilty Mankind, in ſuch a ſoverign Way as has been prov'd, making his own righteous, ſovereign Pleaſure, the only Rule of his Proceedings towards them, then it neceſſarily follows, that ſuch as he did not ordian to Life, he did ordian to deſerved Death. To ſuppoſe an abſolute and certain Election of a Part of guilty Sinners, to be redeem'd and ſaved, and yet, that the reſt are not reprobated or rejected, are very inconſiſtent Notions. For ſeeing all Mankind were looked upon and conſider'd, by God in his Decrees, as under a righteous Sentence of Condemnation to Puniſhment for their Sin; then ſure ſuch as he did not determine to deliver out of that Condemnation and Ruin, were left in it, to ſuffer the Law. To ſay, <hi>That they were all elected conditionally, tho' the others were abſolutely,</hi> is as contrary to thoſe Scriptures that have been adduced, as to deny an abſolute Election al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. For they aſſert Election to be univerſally abſolute, contrary to ſuch a Diſtinction of a two-fold Election: It is a Notion, eſpecially contrary to thoſe Paſſages, which declare the Abſoluteneſs of <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> in all thoſe that are ſo called: And thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004896_0046_100E1560A48647E0"/>ſages which declare, that all that are ſaved, are ſaved in ſuch a Way, as excludes all Self-glorying and Self-depending. But I proceed to offer a ſew other Proof from the Scripture, for the Confirmation of this Head. And firſt I argue thus, Thoſe who were not given in Charge by the Father to Jeſus Chriſt, to be redeem'd and ſav'd by him, were left in their Sins, and ordian'd to ſuffer the Law for them themſelves.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who were not certainly elected to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were not given in Charge by the Father to Jeſus Chriſt, to be redeem'd and ſav'd by him: Therefore they were left in their Sins, and ordain'd to ſuffer the Law for them themſelves. That thoſe, who were not certainly elected to Salvation, were not given in Charge by the Father to Jeſus Chriſt, to be redeem'd and ſav'd by him; is plain from this, That all thoſe, who were ſo given in Charge to Jeſus Chriſt, to be redeem'd and ſav'd by him, ſhall certainly be ſaved by him; and were certainly and infallibly ordain'd to be ſo. This is clearly prov'd from the Words of Chriſt, <hi>Job.</hi> vi. 38, 39. <hi>For I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me. And this is the Father's Will, which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe Nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt Day.</hi> Theſe Words I think, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that all ſuch, as are not in the End actually ſav'd by Jeſus Chriſt, if he be faithful to his Truſt, were not committed to his Charge to be redeem'd by him, and conſequently they were left under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatory Sentence of the Law.</p>
            <p>Another Proof. that thoſe whom God has not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely elected to Salvation, he has left to periſh, and abandon'd from his ſaving Care, you have, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 7. where after the Apoſtle has ſaid, that <hi>the Remnant of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which God had reſerved to himſelf, according to the Election of Grace, had obtain'd Righteouſneſs and Life,</hi> he adds, <hi>And the reſt were blinded.</hi> Very full
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004896_0047_100E15632D731608"/>and expreſs to the ſame Purpoſe are thoſe Words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>

            <p>This Doctrine, o Sinners <hi>Rejection or Reprobation</hi> in the eternal Purpoſe of God, is indeed, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a very awful and ſolemn one; eſpecially to thoſe who don't find in them the comfortable Evidences of Election; and might reaſonably excite in them a deep Concern about the great Concerns of their Souls, and ſtir them up to take no peaceful Reſt, till they find in themſelves the hopeful Token of God's electing Love, in a ſupernatural work of renewing, ſan ſtifying Grace in their Souls. But then let us take Care, that we don't charge God fooliſhly and wickedly in the Caſe, as if he were cruel and unrighteous. What if God was willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, upon <hi>the Veſſels of Wrath, fitted to Deſtrution,</hi> and worthy of Death, who can juſtly find fault with him? What if he had reprebated all apoſtate Mankind, as well as all apoſtate Angels, who cou'd ſay, he had done wrong? Every Mouth muſt have been ſtopped, all the World being guilty before him.</p>
            <p>But I come to ſpeak to the Objections, commonly urged from the Scriptures againſt the foregoing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in both its Branches. And here I ſhall firſt take Notice of the Method, which thoſe, on the other Side of the Queſtion, put a main Confidence in, for the overthrowing of this Doctrine; by going about to prove a <hi>Univerſal Redemption;</hi> that <hi>Chriſt dyed equally for all, and every Individual of Mankind; for one as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uch as another.</hi> This, they think, they can very eaſily ptove from ſuch Places of Scripture, as ſpeak of <hi>his Dying for all Men; for all the World; the whole
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004896_0048_100E15658B998350"/>World; for every Man;</hi> and the like. But theſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Expreſſions of Scripture, will not amount to ſufficient Proof of what they bring them for; for all ſo plain as they think they are for them. If ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Terms of Scripture, muſt of Neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in ſuch a large Extent as they might ſeem to carry in them; we ſhall then as eaſily prove many other Things from Scripture, which no Man of common Senſe, will believe to be intended in it: For Inſtance, as readily and plainly as they will prove, that Chriſt laid down his Life for <hi>every</hi> individual Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Race; as plainly, I ſay, will I prove, that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Race will have Praiſe from God at the Day of Judgment; from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 5. where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Then ſhall every Man have Praiſe of God.</hi> As plainly and fully will I prove, that after <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's Preaching, every Individual of Mankind preſs'd into the Kingdom of God; from <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>Since that Time the Kingdom of God is preached, and every Man preſſeth into it.</hi> And by the ſame Rule you may have it prov'd, that every human Creature ſpoke of the Faith of the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> Rom. i. 8. <hi>Your Faith is ſpoken of throughout the whole World.</hi> Theſe few Examples, inſtead of great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which might be produced, are ſufficient to ſhew, that ſuch univerſal Terms in Scripture, muſt be often underſtood under very great Reſtrictions; and quite in another Senſe than our Oppoſites will allow, when they are us'd concerning the Death of Chriſt. Some of thoſe Places of Scripture, where ſuch univerſal Terms are us'd, concerning Chriſt's Death, and the Effects of it, only ſignify the Virtue and Efficacy of it, to thoſe who partake of the Benefits of it. Some others ſignify, that his Death was deſign'd promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for ſome of all Nations, and of all Ranks and Conditions of Men, as not confin'd to any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nation, or Degree of Mankind. Others again
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004896_0049_100E15670DB6E510"/>only mean, that Chriſt is the only Saviour, that none are ſaved but thro' his Death. In the firſt Senſe, we are to underſtand <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 18. The Deſign of that whole Chapter is to ſhew, That Chriſt's Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, is of <hi>ſufficient</hi> Virtue, for the juſtifying and ſaving of the <hi>moſt guilty</hi> Sinners. For this Purpoſe, the Apoſtle obſerves the Efficacy of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and breaking the Law, to the condemning of thoſe to whom it was charged and imputed, declaring, that much more is Chriſt's fulfilling the Law, effectual to the compleat Juſtification of thoſe to whom it is umputed, notwithſtanding their former Condemnation. And ſo when he ſay, that <hi>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation: Even ſo, by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all Men to Juſtification of Life.</hi> His Meaning is, That as the Offence and Diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> prevail'd, to the condemning of thoſe to whom it reach'd, and was imputed; even ſo, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was ſufficiently effectual, to the full Juſtification of thoſe to whom it was imputed, from the Guilt of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and all others; ſo as to entitle them again to eternal Life. So that the Apoſtle's Deſign, is not at all to run a Parallel between <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offence and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, in the Extent of their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Effects; but to compare the one with the other, as to the Efficacy of their Influence; in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which he obſerves, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs <hi>is much ſuperiour,</hi> as it juſtifies to Life, even after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Offence has condemn'd to Death. And thus the Phraſe, <hi>all Men,</hi> in both Parts of the Verſe, is to be underſtood with this Limitation, <hi>viz. All Men, on whom it came:</hi> In the firſt Part of the Verſe, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all Men,</hi> on whom it came, <hi>to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> i. e. ſo as to condemn them: In the latter Part, <hi>the free Gift came upon all Men,</hi> on whom it name, <hi>to Juſtification of Life;</hi> i. e. ſo as to juſtify
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004896_0050_100E1577614EEE88"/>them to Life. I preſume, if <hi>every Man</hi> had been in the Text, inſtead of <hi>all Men,</hi> the <hi>Univerſaliſts</hi> would have tho't it every whit as ſtrong for their Purpoſe, as they do now. And you may ſee how that this Phraſe muſt be underſtood the ſame Way, in <hi>Mark</hi> viii. 25.<note n="*" place="bottom">I accommodate myſelf here, to thoſe who underſtand only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation: The Term, in the Orginal, is in the plural Number, <hi>all Men,</hi> as well as in <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 18. But it is equal as in the Senſe, which of the Ways it is rendred.</note> Where it is ſaid, of the Man that had been blind, to whom Jeſus Chriſt gave Sight, that <hi>he ſaw every Man clearly;</hi> which can't be underſtood of the Extent of his Sight, that he ſaw every Man that was in the World; but of the Strength and Efficacy of his Sight, that he ſaw every Man, whom he did ſee, clearly. It is indeed true, that <hi>by the Offence of</hi> Adam, <hi>Judgment came upon</hi> every Individual of his Poſterity, except the human Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to Condemnation:</hi> And this Verſe is a clear and certain Proof of it. But then I conceive, it is not the Univerſality of the Term here, that proves it: It is as fully prov'd from the next Verſe, as from this; where it is only ſaid, that <hi>by his Diſobedience, many were made Sinners;</hi> becauſe the Imputation of his Sin <hi>at all,</hi> is Evidence enough, that it is imputed to <hi>all and every one</hi> that deſcends from him, in the ordinary Way of Generation; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Relation was the ſame to all, as the natural and common Parent of the human Race. But farther, there is this plain Reaſon, evincing, that the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Term here, muſt be underſtood in this limited Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe if it be underſtood in the large, extenſive Senſe, in which the <hi>Arminians</hi> will have it, it will prove a great deal too much for them; not <hi>a univerſal, conditional Redemption,</hi> which they contend for, but a <hi>univerſal, abſolute Redemption and Salvation.</hi> It will then prove, that <hi>every Individual</hi> of the human
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004896_0051_100E156BE652CA80"/>Race, are <hi>actually juſtified</hi> to eternal Life, by the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt: And we are ſure, that <hi>whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. viii. 30. Thus you ſee the true Senſe of this Text, and manifeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the whole Context, deſtroys all Foundation of an Argument for <hi>Univerſal Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper Import, and Deſign of thoſe Words, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 2. <hi>He is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> is, that the Death of Chriſt was a Propitiation, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, not only for People among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or for thoſe who were then Believers in thoſe Parts of World; but alſo for ſome, be they more or leſs, in all Parts and Ages of the World: For he was to be God's Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 6. That <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for all;</hi> it appears from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that he means Perſons of all Ranks and Degrees; for he brings it in as an Argument to enforce his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to <hi>pray for Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> The ſame univerſal Term he manifeſtly intends in the ſame Senſe, in the 1ſt Verſe, when he ſays, <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men.</hi> He can't mean ſure, that they ſhou'd pray for the Millions of Men that were dead, and gone to their own Place before that Time: Neither can he intend, that they ſhould pray for ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from an Intereſt in our Prayers, 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 16. <hi>There is a Sin unto Death: I do not ſay, that</hi> a Man <hi>ſhall pray for it;</hi> that is, for ſuch as are guilty of it: But he explains his Meaning, to be for Men of all Stations and Degrees, the high as well as the low; adding, <hi>for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9. That <hi>Chriſt taſted Death for every Men;</hi> the Meaning is, for every Man that is ſaved; to ſignify, that <hi>none</hi> are ſav'd but thro'
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004896_0052_100E156E485DBD28"/>Chriſt's Death, that his Death is the <hi>only Purchaſe</hi> of Salvation for any Man. In the ſame limited Manner we muſt underſtand the ſame Term, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 28. <hi>We preach Chriſt, warning every Man, and teaching every Man;</hi> that is, warning and teaching every Man, to whom we have Opportunity to preach. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 5. <hi>When the Lord comes to Judgment, every Man ſhall have Praiſe of God;</hi> that is, every Man that is ſaved, or has been truly godly. Another Place of Scripture which is brought in, to ſerve the Cauſe of <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 1. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks, of ſome <hi>who ſhould privily bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift Deſtruction.</hi> But the Apoſtle only ſpeaks of the Lord's having bought them, as what might have been hop'd concerning them as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Goſpel Revelation of a Saviour, that dy'd to redeem Sinners, affords Ground to all, to whom it comes, to hope, that his Death might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for them, as well as others, (tho' it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>all and every one</hi> alike) ſeeing it does not point out the Perſons in particular, for whom he did not intend the Benefits of his Death. And ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Perſons here, the Apoſtle mentions it as a high Aggravation of their Crime, that they ſhould <hi>deny</hi> that Redeemer, of whom they had no Reaſon to conclude to the contrary, but that he had <hi>bought and redeemed them;</hi> when they had the ſame Ground for Hope, this Way, that any others had, before they had the ſpecial Evidences of it in renewing Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus, I have conſidered ſome of the moſt material Paſſages of Scripture, which are advanced in Favour of <hi>Univerſal Redemption.</hi> And I think any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Perſon might ſee, from what has been ſaid, that they come far ſhort of anſwering the Deſign they are advanced for. And any other Paſſages of the like Strain, are to be underſtood the ſame Way. I have
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004896_0053_100E156FEB7C9950"/>already mention'd a Place of Scripture, <hi>John</hi> vi. 39. which proves, that all thoſe, who were given to Chriſt to redeem, he will ſurely ſave and finally glorify; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it may be ſaid, he was unfaithful to his Charge: For it was <hi>the Will of him that ſent him, that he ſhould loſe none of them, but raiſe them up again at the laſt Day;</hi> and ſo put the finiſhing Stroke to their full Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification: Which confirms a <hi>particular</hi> Redemption, in Oppoſition to a <hi>univerſal.</hi> In the 10th Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> our Lord ſpeaks of a <hi>peculiar People,</hi> which he had both among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom he calls his <hi>Sheep, for whom,</hi> he ſays, <hi>he laid down his Life.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> xvii. he ſpeaks of thoſe whom the Father had given him, as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the reſt of Mankind: <hi>For theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> he ſays, <hi>he prays, and not for the World,</hi> ver. 9. and ver. 19. he ſays, <hi>For their Sakes I ſanctify my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> that is, it is for their Sakes that I ſet myſelf apart to the Office and Charge of a Redeemer, and devote myſelf to be a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only farther point out, as briefly as may be, ſome Abſurdities attending the Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Redemption;</hi> and ſo diſmiſs it. If God ſent his Son to die for Sinners, with an equal View and Deſign to ſave them all by it, intending as much the Salvation of one as another, without any Difference; then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that thoſe who are ſaved, are no more beholden or obliged to God, than thoſe that periſh: And it was not from him that they were ſaved, any more than others, but from themſelves; and ſo he ſhall not have the Glory of it; nay, he is rather beholden to them, for letting him have his End. Again, it will follow, that God in a great Meaſure comes ſhort of obtaining his End and Deſign, and that in the greateſt Affair that ever he undertook, ſo far as we are acquainted: An End which he was ſo intent upon, that <hi>he ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up to</hi> the Death, that he might obtain it. The End which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004896_0054_100E15716E2F5570"/>ſet upon, was the Salvation of all the human Race, and yet he is greatly diſappointed of it; for great Numbers forever periſh. Now how can any Man reaſonably perſuade himſelf, that God really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf, and intended ſuch and End, and yet did not made it ſure, and aſcertain the Attainment of it? Was it not eaſy to his Power to do it? Has he not <hi>the Hearts of all Men in his Hand?</hi> Would it have done tham any Injuſtice, to have perſuaded them by almighty Power, and made them willing to be happy? But ſeeing he has not done ſo, it is plain, that the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all, was not the End and Deſign he had in view, in ſending his Son into the World to die. Would he have left a Deſign he had ſo much at Heart, upon the precarious Bottom (to ſay the beſt of it that any can ſay) of the <hi>Fee-will</hi> of corrupted Creatures, that were no way well affected towards him, but aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſaffected? Nay farther, it will follow, that it might have ſo happened, as that he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt his End altogether: For, for-all ſo ſeriouſly as he intended it, and was ſet upon it; yet it ſeems he did not make it certain, no, not as to the Salvation of any one Soul, but left it altogether to themſelves. One would think by this, that he was not very Intent upon it, for all the great Pretences of ſome, by this Doctrine, to magnify his Love and Good-Will to Men. And it may be conſider'd, which Doctrine magnifies the Love of God moſt? That which renders the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a conſiderable Number infallibly certain; or that which leaves it altogether uncertain, as to any? leaving it entirely to the <hi>good Pleaſure</hi> of their depraved Wills? I believe it will be found, that <hi>more</hi> will be ſaved in <hi>that</hi> Way, than would have been in <hi>this:</hi> For I think, upon this Score, none at all would be ſaved. However, it's plain, that great Multitudes do finally oppoſe and contradict this ſuppoſed Intention of God; and what hinders, but all the reſt might do ſo
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004896_0055_100E1574F6628FC8"/>too, according to this <hi>univerſal</hi> Scheme; and ſo not ſo much as one be ſaved after all; for all are alike op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Way of Salvation, by Nature? But you'll ſay, perhaps, there was no Danger of ſuch a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, and Fruſtration of God's End as this; for he fore-knew who would comply with the Goſpel and be ſaved; and ſo knew that he would not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fail of his Deſign. But this is ſo far from clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine, that it introduces a new Abſurdity. For how can it be conceiv'd, that God could really intend, and deſign the Death of Chriſt, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, for thoſe who he infallibly knew would never be Partakers of it? Is it not an Abſurdity, mayn't I ſay Impoſſibility, in the very Nature of the Thing? To what Purpoſe, was the Death of Chriſt deſign'd for them; or for what Advantage? Not to ſave them, for that the Lord knew would never be: And every deſigning of an End, includes in it ſome Degree of Expectation, which could not be in this Caſe. Was it to purchaſe ſufficient Grace for them, that ſo they might be ſav'd if they would? Well, but the Lord knew, that they would not make the ſaving Uſe of it; and why then was it intentionally purchas'd for them; ſure you will not ſay, it was to make their Guilt and Puniſhment the greater? Let the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Univerſal Redemption</hi> conſider a little, how they will digeſt and ſolve theſe Things. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>The Oppoſers of the Doctrine of <hi>Abſolute Decrees,</hi> argue farther againſt it, from ſome Places fo Scripture, which they ſuppoſe declare a general Will, and Deſire in God, of the Converſion and Salvation of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and how much he would be pleaſed with it: Which they ſuppoſe, is contrary to his having purpos'd not to give to ſome the Grace neceſſary and ſufficient for their Converſion, but to leave them to periſh in their Sins. I ſhall a little conſider the principal paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which they advance to this Purpoſe, and ſhew,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004896_0056_100E15697A5AC820"/>that they intend nothing contrary to this Doctrine. One of them is, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> ii. 4. <hi>God will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> If <hi>all Men</hi> here, be underſtood for <hi>every individual Man in the World;</hi> then God's willing them to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, can't mean his having will'd and purpos'd, that they ſhall be ſav'd; for then they all wou'd be ſav'd, becauſe he can eaſily fulfil all his Purpoſes, and ſurely will do ſo. For <hi>his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure,</hi> Iſai. xlvi. 10. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth forever, and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations,</hi> Pſal. xxxiii. 11. But if the Words be taken in this unlimited Senſe, the Meaning of the Place muſt only be, that the Salvation of <hi>all Men,</hi> in the Way of Faith and Holineſs, would be a Thing very agreeable to the approving, and preceptive Will of God; as he delights in Holineſs, and the Happineſs which is connected with it; and that Sin, for which it is that any periſh, is diſagreable and hateful to his holy Nature: And yet, all this is no Way inconſiſtent with his determining to puniſh Sinners for their Sin. But I think it is plain, from the Context, that by <hi>all Men</hi> here, we are to underſtand, <hi>Men of all Characters and Degrees;</hi> for the Words are brought in as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to encourage Chriſtians to <hi>pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> And in the ſame Senſe, the Term <hi>all Men,</hi> is intended in the firſt Verſe, as I have made appear before.</p>
            <p>Another Place is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe; but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> I think it is pretty manifeſt, that the Perſons the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here, are the <hi>Elect of God:</hi> The Perſons to whom he writes theſe Epiſtles, are conſider'd under that Character, in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 2. he calls them <hi>Elect, according to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God the Father, thro' Sanctification of the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004896_0057_100E1579D11EACD8"/>Spirit unto Obedience, and to the ſpinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter we are inform'd, that he <hi>writes this ſecond Epiſtle</hi> to the ſame, or ſame Sort of Perſons: And of the ſame he ſpeaks in the Verſe under our preſent Conſideration, joining himſelf, as being alſo an elect Perſon, with them; ſaying, <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering to us-ward;</hi> i. e. towards us, the Election of his Grace, <hi>not willing that any,</hi> viz. of us, <hi>ſhould periſh, but that, we, all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> and be called in. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Deſign, in the Words, is, to ſhew the Reaſon of God's delaying to put an End to the preſent State of this World, and bring on the general Judgment; in anſwer to <hi>the Scoffers, that,</hi> he ſays, <hi>ſhould be in the laſt Days, ſaying, Where is the Promiſe of his Coming? For ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all Things continue as they were from the Beginning of the Creation,</hi> ver. 3, 4. In anſwer, I ſay, to theſe <hi>Atheiſtical Scoffs,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that God had done as great, unlikely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Things already, as the ſhutting up the Scene of this World in ſuch a ſolemn Manner, tho' they wilfully neglected to take Notice of them. He had not only, by the Word of his Power, created the Heavens and the Earth out of Nothing at firſt, but a long Time after, had deſtroyed the Earth, and its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Inhabitants, by a Flood of Water: And ſo it was no incredible, nor unlikely Thing, that he ſhould, at laſt, burn it with <hi>Fire at the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of ungodly Men;</hi> and notwithſtanding it had ſtood ſo long, in much the ſame State, after the People of God had ſpoke of this, as what would ſurely be, he obſerves, that a long Space of Time with us, is but little with God; and then ſays, <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe, (as ſome Men count Slackneſs) but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, &amp;c.</hi> that is, The Lord's deferring the End of the World, and laſt Judgment ſo long, is not thro' Forgetfulneſs, or careleſs Neglect
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004896_0058_100E157B55955C30"/>of his Promiſe to that Purpoſe; but the true Reaſon of it, is, that <hi>all his Elect</hi> may be brought in, <hi>not</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>willing that any</hi> of them <hi>ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> be converted and ſaved; and therefore he will not come to Judgment, at a Time when there are any of them on the Earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverted; nor until the laſt of the whole Number is ſitted for Glory.</p>
            <p>There is another Scripture, that is always brought in upon this Head of Argument, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiii. 11. Where the Lord declares, with the Solemnity of an Oath, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his Way and live.</hi> When the Lord ſays, <hi>he has no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked;</hi> the plain Senſe of the Words is, that the Death and Miſery of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is <hi>not a Pleaſure</hi> to him in itſelf, or for its own Sake, meerly as it is a Miſery to the Creature. But this doesn't ſay, but that their Death and Puniſhment may be agreeable and pleaſing to him, under other Conſiderations; as it is an Execution of Juſtice, and Manifeſtation of his own Glory. If it were not ſo, Would he inflict Puniſhment upon any of them? Would he diſpleaſe and make himſelf uneaſy? And when he ſays, That <hi>it is a Pleaſure to him, that the Wicked turn from his Way, and Live.</hi> The Meaning is, that righteouſneſs and Holineſs in his Creatures, and the Happineſs conſequent upon it, is the Object of his Approbation and Liking, a Thing, in itſelf, agreeable and pleaſing to his holy Nature. But this, ſure, is no Proof, that he equally and alike deſign'd the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation of all Sinners. If it prov'd any thing this Way, it would prove, that he diſign'd it certainly for them all, if his Power could effect it.</p>
            <p>The Words of our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 37. are often brought in upon this Head, where he ſays of <hi>Jeruſalem, How often would I have gathered thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004896_0059_100E157DC3193E50"/>together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> If we underſtand the Lord Jeſus to ſpeak here, of his Willingneſs to have gather'd them, with Reference to his divine Nature, as God, the Words only prove, that Sinners Compliance with the Goſpel, and turning to Holineſs, is a Thing, in itſelf, agreeable and pleaſing to God's holy Nature; Holineſs being the Object of his Love and Complacence; that his Dealings with that People, in the Courſe of his Miniſtry among them, tended in their own Nature to bring them thus to their Duty; and that their Unbelief and Impenitency was owing to the Perverſeneſs and Corruption of their own Wills, as the Cauſe of it. But if we ſuppoſe him to ſpeak of his Willingneſs, meerly as Man, in his human Nature, then I ſee no Inconvenience in allowing, that it may ſignify an intenſe and paſſionate Deſire in him of their Converſion and Happineſs: But ſurely no ſuch Paſſions, or uneaſy long Deſires, and eſpecially for Things which will never be effected, are to be aſcribed to the divine Nature. For my Part, I can't apprehend what Sort of a Will and Deſire, for the Converſion and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Men, it is, which thoſe who deny <hi>abſolute Predeſtination</hi> ſuppoſe to be in God, any Way conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his Perfection: They ſuppoſe includes much more, than that the Holineſs and Happineſs of his Creatures is a Thing in itſelf, lovely and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him; that it is his preceptive and approving Will, that they ſhould be holy and conſequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: which is very conſiſtent with the Doctrine they oppoſe, from this Topick of a general Will: And they can't allow it to include ſo much as a real Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that all ſhall be ſanctified and ſaved; becauſe then all would be ſo; which is contrary to Fact: Or elſe God's Purpoſe would be fruſtrated, and he would come ſhort of what he certainly intended ſhould come to paſs, which is highly abſurd. But they ſeem to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004896_0060_100E158032280AC8"/>fancy a Sort of an uneaſy Wiſhing and longing Deſire in God, for that which notwithſtanding will never be; and if this be not to make God ſuch a One as ourſelves, I know not what is: Does it no argue God to be ſubject to the Weakneſſes of Creatures? and not only ſo, but that he ſuffers himſelf to be made uneaſy, and to be croſs'd in his Deſires, by that which he could eaſily prevent? which is what no wiſe Man would allow in himſelf: And therefore, tho' God may ſometimes condeſcend to ſpeak to Sinners in ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as they uſe to one another, when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Greatneſs and Ardency of their Deſire for any thing; yet we are not hence to imagine, that there are any ſuch human Paſſions and Creature-Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in him: The Deſign of ſuch Modes of ſpeaking in God is only to ſignify, how deſirable and excellent a Thing it is, in itſelf, for Creatures to love, to obey and honour him; and how much it is both their Duty and Intereſt to do ſo: And the Reaſon why this is expreſs'd in ſuch a Manner, as imports weak Paſſions in Men when they ſpeak ſo, is, becauſe it is the moſt ſuitable Way of Dealing with ſuch Creatures as we are, beſt adapted to our Capacity and Condition; it is a Method that has the moſt ſuitable Tendency in itſelf to work upon and prevail with rational Creatures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing beſt to their Capacity the Excellency and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Holineſs, and the horrid hateful Nature of Sin; for tho' it is the ſuper-natural Power of God's Spirit, that prevails with any Sinners to be holy; yet, as a wiſe Agent, he makes uſe of the moſt ſuitable and beſt adapted Means for that Purpoſe, dealing with Men in a Way ſuited to their rational Nature, and human Capacities. Thus it is we are to underſtand the various Expoſtulations and Entreaties of God in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>As another Topick of Argument againſt the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of God's <hi>Decrees,</hi> the Oppoſers of it ſeem to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004896_0061_100E1582BAD3B528"/>think, that <hi>all Men</hi> have <hi>ſuſhcient</hi> Power to do that which is required as <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and with which Salvation is <hi>certainly</hi> connected; or, at leaſt, that they have ſufficient Power to <hi>enſure to themſelves</hi> ſuch ſupernatural Power as is neceſſary for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And this is what is commonly call'd <hi>Univerſal ſufficient Grace.</hi> For the Support of this Opinion, they refer to ſuch Places of Scripture in which God commands <hi>all Men,</hi> where the Goſpel comes, <hi>to be holy as he is holy, to repent and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, to make themſelves new Hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Hence they argue, that <hi>all</hi> have Power ſome Way to do theſe Things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they ſay, it would be <hi>unjuſt for God to require more of Men than they can perform.</hi> To this I anſwer, That theſe Men ſeem entirely to over-look, in this Way of Reaſoning, the Ruin brought upon the human Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, by the Fall and Apoſtacy of <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Head and Repreſentative of all Mankind:</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, until he ſinn'd, was furniſh'd with <hi>ſufficient Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to do whatſoever God did, or ever ſhould require of him; at leaſt, had he not ſinn'd, his Ability would always have been encreaſed equally with his Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: There was a <hi>full Proportion</hi> between his Power and the Law he was under. And ſo it would have been with all his Poſterity, had he <hi>fulfilled</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant; but as, by his Tranſgreſſion, they loſt <hi>all</hi> Right and Title to <hi>that</hi> Happineſs and Life of Communion with God, which was ſecured to them in the Covenant, upon his Obedience: ſo they loſt God's moral Image, and the Power of holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and it was at God's <hi>free ſovereign Pleaſure</hi> to confer Happineſs again, and the Grace neceſſary to it, as he pleaſed: And as God was then under <hi>no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to afford Strength anſwerable to the Law, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he <hi>obliged</hi> to bring down the Requirements of his Law to the Level and Capacity of the fallen ruin'd Creature: Tho' Man, by his own Default, has loſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004896_0062_100E158578EB51D0"/>his Power of Obedience, that is no Argument, that God muſt loſe his Right and Claim: The Creature's Sin, and Wretchedneſs thereby, can't diſſolve his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Duty to God: God's Law muſt ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame, as a perfect and eternal Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, let Creatures change and alter as they will. If it be aſk'd, <hi>For what End the Law of God is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and his Commands laid upon us in his Word, if we have not Ability to fulfil?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>For various Ends:</hi> To teach us what is our Duty to God; what we ought to be aiming at and endeavouring after: To ſhew us our Sins and Tranſgreſſions; <hi>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</hi> Rom. iii. 20. as the Crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Line is diſcover'd by laying it to a ſtrait one: To teach us our utter Inability fo fulfil the Law, and obtain Life by our Obedience; (for which Purpoſe our Saviour referr'd One to the <hi>Keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Matth. xix. 17. whom he found big with the Conceit that he could do much) that ſo we may ſee our Neceſſity of getting Righteouſneſs and Strength from Chriſt, a Mediator: And thus the Law is given, as a School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt; it is a Means whereby the Lord brings in his Elect to the Redeemer by Faith: And it is given as a Rule of Life to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd Children of God, to direct them how they are to honour and glorify him.</p>
            <p>If it be objected to the above Account, of Sinners <hi>Inability</hi> to do what is now requir'd of them under the Diſpenſation of the new Covenant, that <hi>Adam</hi> had not a Power of Believing in a Redeemer, of repenting and renewing his Heart, as having no need of it; and the Exerciſe of it being inconſiſtent with his State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; and therefore we cannot be ſaid to have loſt it in him, ſeeing it was not given him while he ſtood in the Character of our <hi>Repreſentative.</hi> To this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be eaſily reply'd, That tho' he had not his Power for ſuch Acts and Purpoſes as theſe, in his innocent
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004896_0063_100E158701EB41B8"/>State; yet, had we, in our guilty State, that Power reſtor'd, which he had, we would be able to believe in the Redeemer, to repent, &amp;c. The Impoſſibility of his putting forth ſuch Acts, was not from the Want of inherent Power, but the Inconſiſtency of them with his Condition: It was inconſiſtent with his State of Innocence, to have had any Occaſion for adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring Phyſick, to recover his Health; yet that is no Argument, that he had not <hi>ſufficient Ability</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>I would juſt farther refer it to the Conſideration of thoſe, who offer this Argument againſt God's <hi>Decrees,</hi> and yet, in the mean time, acknowledge, that <hi>no Man in this Life can fulfil the Law of God perfectly,</hi> how they are conſiſtent with themſelves: For herein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge, that <hi>God requires more of Men, than they can now perform, ſince the Fall;</hi> and ſure they will not own, that <hi>it is ſo,</hi> and ſay, <hi>it is unjuſt</hi> too.</p>
            <p>For farther Proof of this <hi>Univerſal Power</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> they urge the Invitations of the Goſpel to believe in Chriſt, and its Promiſes to ſuch as do believe; ſuch as <hi>Iſal.</hi> xlv. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the Ends of the Earth:</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door, and knock; if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, &amp;c.</hi> Such Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they think, infer, that there is a Power in Man to comply with them, otherwiſe they would be vain and needleſs. But this is a vain Argument; For tho' Sinners are without Strength, thro' the Darkneſs of their Minds, and Obſtinacy of their Wills; yet ſuch Invitations are needful, to ſhew them their Duty, and the only Way in which they can ever be happy; and to afford them a Ground and Warrant for believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and reſting their Souls upon him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: By theſe Invitations, and Promiſes to Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the holy Spirit encourages, and perſuades con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Souls to cloſe with Chriſt, as their Saviour, and caſt themſelves upon his Meditation and Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004896_0064_100E15895AB62A50"/>with humble joyful Confidence. The Spirit of God, by his Power, brings a Sinner to believe in Chriſt, in a Way agreeable to his Nature as a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature; and ſo makes uſe of the Offers and Promiſes of the Goſpel, as the Soul's Warrant for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Claim to Chriſt, as his Saviour, and believing in him for his Salvation. Likewiſe, theſe Invitations and Promiſes are of great uſe for the Comfort of true Believers, ſhewing that there is a ſure Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Believing and Salvation. When <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the People of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> xxx. 19. <hi>That he had ſet Life and Death before them, Bleſſing and Curſing,</hi> and bids them <hi>chuſe Life;</hi> The Words may be eaſily underſtood in the ſame Senſe with the fore-mention'd Paſſages, to ſignify, that there is a certain and inſeparable Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between true Holineſs and eternal Life, tho' this Holineſs is the Effect of a ſuper-natural divine Power, exerted only <hi>in whom the Lord pleaſes:</hi> And the Lord propoſes this Holineſs, which is connected with Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to Sinners Choice, to import the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Neceſſity of their chuſing it; and that he may deal with them in a Way agreeable to the Nature of reaſonable Beings. But yet, I think it is plain from the Context, that the <hi>Life and Death</hi> there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, was <hi>temporal Proſperity and Adverſity;</hi> which Life was promiſed to <hi>that</hi> People, upon their ſtrict Adherence to the outward Preſcriptions of the Law that was given them: And it will be readily own'd that they might thus chuſe and perform Obedience without <hi>ſpecial renewing Grace:</hi> And, in this Senſe, <hi>Righteouſneſs and Life</hi> are to be frequently underſtood in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>It is further argued, for this <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> from the Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> Matth. xxv. But we are not to underſtand by theſe <hi>Talents, Univerſal ſufficient Grace,</hi> whereby <hi>all Men</hi> are enabled to convert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if <hi>they will;</hi> and ſavingly to renew and change

               <hi>their Wills:</hi> But other Gifts and Bounties of divine Providence, ſuch as natural Endowments of Mind, good Education, Health, worldly Goods, outward Goſpel-Privileges, and the like; which God diſtributes to Mankind in various Meaſures, <hi>as he pleaſes.</hi> Thoſe who made ſuch Improvement of their <hi>Talents,</hi> ſignify the <hi>truly godly,</hi> who are <hi>effectually</hi> renew'd by God's Power, <hi>according to his Purpoſe.</hi> The Perſon that made no Improvement, ſignifies <hi>unconverted Sinners,</hi> who do not <hi>ſincerely</hi> love and honour God. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count taken of theſe Servants, at their Lord's Return, and his different Retributions to them, according to their <hi>paſt Conduct,</hi> are deſign'd to teach us, that the Lord Jeſus <hi>will ſurely come at laſt to Judgment,</hi> that we <hi>muſt all appear</hi> before his Judgment-Seat, to give an <hi>Account of the Deeds done in</hi> this Life, and that <hi>our paſt Behaviour here,</hi> both in Heart and outward Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will be the <hi>Rule,</hi> according to which the <hi>Sentence of Judgment</hi> will paſs upon us: Tho' the Reward of Happineſs, <hi>to the Godly,</hi> will not be given them for <hi>their Godlineſs,</hi> as the Cauſe of it; yet it will be given to <hi>them only,</hi> who have been thus qualified and fore-prepared by the Lord for it; and that, in different Degrees, according to their different Degrees of Care, Zeal and Diligence in the Ways of God, after their <hi>Converſion.</hi> On the other Hand, all the <hi>Ungodly</hi> ſhall be condemned to Puniſhment, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of their Works; and to different Degrees of Puniſhment, according to their different Deſerts. And thus, the <hi>Works,</hi> the <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of Men in this Life, will be the <hi>Rule,</hi> according to which the <hi>final Awards</hi> will be made at the <hi>laſt Day</hi> to <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> tho' not the <hi>meritorious or procuring</hi> Cauſe of them to <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Theſe Things I take to be the very Scope and Deſign of the Parable; and ſo the <hi>univerſal Men</hi> have no Service at all to their Cauſe from it. It is meer trifling to aſk, as ſome do,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004896_0066_100E158D4E038E10"/>
               <hi>If the Servant, that was puniſh'd, had made as good uſe of his Talent, as the reſt did of theirs, would not have been as well accepted?</hi> That is, whether finally impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners would not have been accepted of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as true Believers, and ſincerely godly Perſons, had they been true Believers, and ſincerely godly as well as they? I am free enough, to anſwer in the <hi>Affirmative:</hi> Had they been ſuch, it would have been a certain Evidence, that they had been elected to Holineſs and Salvation, as well as the others; for true juſtifying and ſanctifying Faith, <hi>is not of ourſelves, it is the Gift of God,</hi> given according to his Purpoſe and Grace, which was made ſure to <hi>all</hi> Believers in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began. But then the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not at all touch the Matter in Debate, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether unrenewed Sinners have had as ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grace given them, to be true Believers and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons, as thoſe who are really ſuch. Conſidering that Sinners Impotency conſiſts chiefly in their Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their Inability in the Oppoſition of their Wills to God's Will, I think it is plain, that <hi>no Grace</hi> is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but that which is <hi>actually effectual:</hi> Their Wills are not juſt in <hi>Equilibrio,</hi> in an even Ballance between Holineſs and Sin, as much enclin'd to the one Side as the other, ſo as that they might bring their Wills to a Compliance with, and Complacence in the Ways of God, by their own Reaſon; or by the Help of ſome divine Affiſtances, which they might alſo reject: But their Wills are ſtrongly ſet againſt the New-Covenant Way of Salvation, and the holy Law of God, in its ſpiritual Nature and Extent; and therefore, <hi>No Man can come unto Chriſt, except the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. vi. 44.</p>
            <p>Again, they argue in another Method from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Calls, Invitations, and Offers of the Goſpel, reaſoning after this Manner: <hi>It would,</hi> ſay they, <hi>be the higheſt Inſtance of Diſſembling and Deccit, for God to call Sinners to repent and turn from their evil Ways,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004896_0067_100E158FC9BD7050"/>with ſuch Appearance of real Sincerity and Earneſtaneſs, if he had before infallibly decreed, that a great many of them ſhould not repent and turn</hi> (not to communicate the Grace of Converſion and Repentance to many, it ſhould be.) <hi>And what greater Inſincerity and Illuſion,</hi> ſay they, <hi>can well be imagin'd, than for God to make ſuch a general, unlimited Offer of Chriſt, and Salvation thro' him, as</hi> Rev. xxii. 17. Whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely; <hi>when he has already purpos'd, not to give Salvation to many? How can ſuch an open Declaration agree with ſuch a ſecret Purpoſe? Would there not be a direct Oppoſition between his outward Expreſſions and inward Sentiments? Which is drownright Falſifying and Hypocriſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this plauſible Reaſoning, on which ſome of the greateſt Patrons of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme beſtow a great Deal of Eloquence, is grounded on a miſtaken Apprehenſion of the Nature and true Import of theſe <hi>Calls and Goſpel-Offers:</hi> God's Calls to Sinners, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn to him, to believe in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> are only ſo many Significations of what is Sinners Duty, and what is agreeable to God's holy Nature, pleaſing and approveable in his Sight: Theſe <hi>Calls</hi> do not ſignify what is God's <hi>Purpoſe</hi> concerning Men, but what is their Duty to him; and that he loves Holineſs in his Creatures, that <hi>the righteous Lord loves Righteouſneſs:</hi> And ſo, in all ſuch Calls and Commands, there is an entire Agreement between God's Words, and his Will ſignify'd by them: For he does indeed <hi>will theſe Things,</hi> as the Matter of Sinners Duty, and loves them, as agreeable to his own holy Law. This juſt View of the <hi>many Calls</hi> of God in Scripture to Sinners, for their Repentance, and Convertion to Holineſs, deſtroys <hi>all the Force</hi> of the Argument taken from them, as tho' they were incoſiſtent with God's ſecret Will and Purpoſe, to leave <hi>many</hi> in their Sins without <hi>converting Grace;</hi> for they import <hi>Northing</hi> in their true Deſign
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004896_0068_100E15923363A3C0"/>contrary to it. And when God condeſcends to uſe Anguments and Expoſtulations with Sinners, about what he requires, it is, that be may deal with them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reaſonable Beings, and convert his <hi>Elect,</hi> in a Way agreeable to their rational Nature.</p>
            <p>As to the Offers of Chriſt made to all where the Goſpel comes, and Promiſes of Salvation, thro' him, to all ſuch as truly believe in him: It is moſt certain, that God does will and purpoſe to ſave all ſuch as truly accept of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and believe in him, as he is propos'd and ſet forth, in the Goſpel Revelation of him; for he declares, that <hi>all ſuch ſhall be ſaved:</hi> But then, we are to conſider this Faith in Chriſt as <hi>the Giſt of God,</hi> according to <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. and a Grace of his <hi>powerful Operation or Working,</hi> Col. ii. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 11. beſtow'd <hi>only</hi> upon, and wrought <hi>only</hi> in thoſe whom he has <hi>choſen;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>the Faith of God's Elect,</hi> Tit. i. 1. And thus, the <hi>Promiſes of the Goſpel</hi> run exactly parallel with the <hi>Election of Grace,</hi> and do not import any thing contrary to it. Indeed, to ſay, that God does <hi>not</hi> really deſign ro ſave <hi>all</hi> who ſhall believe in Chriſt, not withſtanding he has declar'd that <hi>he will,</hi> were to impute the <hi>groſſeſt Falſhood and Deceit</hi> to him; but there is no ſuch Thing in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is brought againſt. It is true, the <hi>Offer</hi> of Chriſt, as a Saviour, is <hi>made to all,</hi> to be accepted and believed in, for their Salvation in particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the News of the Goſpel-Salvation is ſent: But then, this <hi>Offer</hi> does not ſignify or import, that God deſign'd him, and the ſaving Benefits of his Death, <hi>equally for all;</hi> but that, inaſmuch as all have <hi>equal Need</hi> of him, and God has not reveal'd, or any Way pointed out who they are, whom he has <hi>not choſen</hi> to Salvation thro' him, ſo as they might be known either to themſelves or others, it is the great Duty of <hi>all,</hi> to accept of him with <hi>all their Hearts,</hi> according to the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004896_0069_100E1594E8AD21B8"/>Declarations concerning him in the Goſpel, <hi>freely and willingly</hi> to comply with the Way of Salvation thro' his Attonement, caſting a fiducial Dependance upon him, <hi>and him only,</hi> for their eternal Life; for which Faith, the infallible Promiſe of Salvation, to all ſuch as ſo receive him, is ſufficient Warrant and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. And it was neceſſary that the <hi>Offer</hi> ſhould be thus <hi>univerſal,</hi> when it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not reveal'd, who in particular <hi>were elected</hi> to Salvation thro' him, that ſo the <hi>Elect</hi> might be brought to believe in him, upon a rational Ground and Foundation; for they could not know, that they <hi>were choſen</hi> to Life, thro him, more than any others, before their Believing; and therefore, could not have had a Ground for Faith to go upon, were it not for the Promiſe to <hi>whoſoever believes,</hi> and the Declarations, that it is <hi>every one's Duty</hi> cordially to comply, and be pleaſed with that Way of Salvation, thro' an attoning Mediator; and upon the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Promiſe, to caſt a Reliance, and the whole Dependance of their Souls, for Salvation, upon him. In this Manner it is, that the <hi>Offers of Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel, are <hi>general and univerſal:</hi> Not importing, that <hi>he died alike for all,</hi> or that he was <hi>equally deſign'd for all,</hi> in the Purpoſe of God; but that, ſeeing <hi>none</hi> have any Reaſon certainly to conclude againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they were <hi>rejected</hi> in the divine Purpoſe; and ſeeing <hi>Acceptance and eternal Life,</hi> thro' Chriſt, is promis' to <hi>all</hi> that believe; it is the Duty of <hi>all,</hi> with their whole Hearts, to <hi>embrace</hi> him as he is propos'd, and <hi>believe</hi> in him: And yet, <hi>none</hi> will ſo believe in him but the <hi>Choſen of God, who are called according to his Purpoſe.</hi> And thus, as God is entirely conſiſtent with himſelf in the Caſe, ſo are the Miniſters of the Goſpel conſiſtent with themſelves, in maintaining God's <hi>abſolute Decrees,</hi> and yet making ſuch general Offers of Chriſt, as a Saviour, to all that hear them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004896_0070_100E15967857CC30"/>uſing Arguments with them for that Purpoſe, and promiſing Life and Salvation, in his Name, to all that truly comply with the Goſpel, and believe in him: And tho' they don't know the <hi>Elect of God</hi> among their Hearers, he does, and will apply this Goſpel to their Hearts, ſo as to bring them to believe in Chriſt, and become <hi>truly godly.</hi> Theſe Conſiderations, if duly weighed and attended to, I think, may be abundantly ſatisfactory in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>There is another Argument, commonly inſiſted on by thoſe on the other Side of the Queſtion, taken from God's Appointment of a Goſpel-Miniſtry, Ordinances of Worſhip, and Means of Grace in his Church, as if they were <hi>altogether vain and uſeleſs,</hi> on Suppoſition of ſuch <hi>eternal Decrees. According to the</hi> Calviniſt <hi>Doctrine of</hi> Predeſtination, (ſay they) <hi>it is quite need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for Miniſters to preach, and as needleſs for People to hear, or to perform any religious Duty whatſoever; and the Reaſon is, becauſe they cannot alter the Purpoſe of God concerning them, whatever it be, do they well or ill; they will fare as well, let them live as they liſt, as if they did never ſo well; and ſo they had e'en as good take their Swing: Nay, it had been much better for all the Reprobate, that they had never had the Privilege of the Goſpel; becauſe, according to the Scripture, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Miſery o thoſe that periſh, will be much aggravated by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an awful Charge indeed; and if it be juſt, the Doctrine is certainly moſt inſufferable; which takes off all Reſtraints from the moſt profligate Courſe of Life, farther than what proceed from our temporal Intereſt in this World; and Arguments from private temporal Intereſt, do often ſway more to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Crimes, than moral Honeſty. But I hope to make it appear, that the Objection is <hi>moſt falſe and groundleſs:</hi> And to this Purpoſe, let theſe few Things be conſider'd:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:004896_0071_100E1599C354E3D8"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Suppoſing there were no Arguments for a pious godly Life, to be had from our own eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; yet there are Reaſons of another Nature, of ſufficient Weight and Force in themſelves, to induce us to it, and engage us to endeavour after it. Is not the great God, who is infinitely good and glorious, worthy of the greateſt Eſteem, profoundeſt Subjection, and higheſt Adorations of all the rational Creation? And has he not an inviolable Right and Claim to theſe Things from us, as our Creator and Preſerver? And is not Conformity to God, and to obey and honour him, the greateſt Honour and Glory of a created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Theſe Arguments, I know, have little Weight with apoſtate Creatures, whoſe Underſtandings are darkned, and all their other Faculties wholly corrupted; but that is not for Want of ſufficient Weight in their own Nature: Nothing can ever diſſolve God's Title to the Homage and Obedience of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would have two or three Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd and weigh'd together: Firſt, that the <hi>Elect</hi> are elected to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit; <hi>whom he did predeſtinate, them be alſo called.</hi> And this effectual Calling and ſanctifying Grace, wrought in the heart by the holy Spirit, is the certain Fruit and Evidence of eternal Election; whereby thoſe who are the Partakers of this Grace, may, and frequently do come to a comfortable Satisfation, as to their Election of God.</p>
            <p>Again, you are to obſerve, that the <hi>Elect</hi> themſelves, before their Converſion and effectual Calling, have no Notices or Evidences at all of their being elected, more than others: which muſt needs be a very uneaſy and diſtreſſing Condition, when the Spirit of God touches the Conſcience. And then, in the next Place, let it be conſider'd, that God has appointed the Preaching of the Goſpel, and other religious Exerciſes, ſuch as, reading the holy Scriptures, and other good Books,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004896_0072_100DEFA997760310"/>Prayer, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to be the Means whereby be ordinarily converts and ſanctifies his <hi>Elect,</hi> and affords them the comfortable Tokens of his electing Love. He has appointed theſe Ordinances and Means, as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Channels wherein to communicate his ſpecial Grace to thoſe whom he has choſen. Now if theſe Things be duly adverted to, I think it will be clear, that there is Uſe, and great Uſe too, for the Preaching of the Goſpel, and other Exerciſes of Religion, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtancy with God's <hi>abſolute Decrees:</hi> And that there are ſufficient Reaſon, to engage Perſons to a very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obſervance of them, and of all the Commands of God; for the Ordinances of God are the Means which he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es fit in his Wiſdom to make uſe of, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Sanctification of his Elect, which Work of Grace is the only Evidence of our belonging to God, as his elect People: And therefore one can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think, that any, but ſuch as are ſtupidly unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their Souls everlaſting States, could reaſon in earneſt in the Strain of the Objection I am now upon: Surely, one that is any Way duly thoughtful, about a Matter of ſuch vaſt Moment as his eternal Well-being, would readily think with himſelf to this Purpoſe; <q>Oh, what would I not give, to have ſome comfortable, diſtinguiſhing Evidences of being choſen of God, and appointed to Life: Well, his Ways and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are the Means he uſes for this Purpoſe; the Channels in which he is wont to communicate his ſpecial Grace to thoſe he deſigns to ſave; I muſt wait upon, and look to him in that Way of Hope, and keep at the Pool where he uſes to come and heal diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed Souls; it may be, he will-ſome time meet with me, in his own Way, which he has appointed for viſiting his choſen, and fulfil in me all the Good-Pleaſure of his Goodneſs, and the Work of Faith with Power, and cauſe me to rejoice in his Love. Theſe Ways of Religion are not only the Ways in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004896_0073_100E159DA6E97CA0"/>which there is only reaſonable Ground of Hope to meet with ſuch Bleſſings, but they are the Commands and Inſtitutions of God, recommended with his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and therefore, to diſregard and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, will be to diſobey and contemn God ſtill the more, and alſo will expoſe me to a more awful Puniſhment.</q> Conſider now, if this be not a juſt and right Way of Reaſoning in the Caſe: Nay, I am convinced, that the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Doctrine, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and really believ'd, will make People much more careful, ſerious and diligent Obſervers of the Ways of God, than the contrary Doctrine will; for it tends much more to bring them to a ſolemn ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Concern of Heart about their eternal State, and conſequently to make them more earneſt in all the moſt hopeful, probable Ways of meeting with Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Tho' it is true, that ſuch as are rejected in the Purpoſe of God, will never be converted in the Uſe of all the Means of Grace; yet, ſeeing they do not know the ſecret Purpoſe of God concerning them, but have the ſame Reaſon to entertain Hopes that they may be choſen to Life, that any other unconverted Perſons have, it would be a high and provoking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God for them, to neglect the Ordinances, which he has appointed as Means, for the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpecial Grace and ſweet Conſolation to his Elect; and which he therefore, by his ſovereign Authority, requires all, who have the Opportunity, to attend upon: And they ſhall find it, if guilty of it, brought into the Account againſt them, at the great Day, when <hi>every Man ſhall be judged according to his Works,</hi> and they ſhall receive, proportionably, the <hi>greater Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the <hi>Elect converted,</hi> their Hearts are ſo renew'd, as <hi>to love God above all,</hi> and to make Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Will their hearty Choice; Believing in
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004896_0074_100E15A011FE7DB8"/>Jeſus Chriſt, his Love is ſhed abroad in their Hearts, and ſweetly conſtrains them to ſerve and honour him, to whom they are under ſuch endearing Engagements. The COnſideration of Go's having elected them to eternal Glory, when he might juſtly have rejected them as well as any others; the Hope and Proſpect of that eternal Glory with him, and the Conſideration of his having ſent his Son to anſwer the Law for them, and ſuffer in their Room, that they might be deliver'd from deſerved Miſery, and made happy in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf forever; their Apprehenſions of his Glory and infinite Excellency in himſelf, and his Right in and over them as his Creatures; all theſe Things are powerful Arguments with them, to love and praiſe God; it is their Deſire and Delight to glorify and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. Moreover, the Lord Jeſus takes them for his peculiar Charge; it is a Part of his Office, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to bring them ſafe to Glory thro' all Dangers; accordingly, his holy Spirit dwells in them, as a Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier and Comforter: thus they are engaged to God, in the Way of Holineſs, by the moſt inviolable Cords and loving Bands: So that the Doctrine of <hi>abſolute Election</hi> is far from deſtroying Holineſs of Life: It is a ſtrong Excitement to it, in all the renew'd Children of God, who love him, when they are enabled to ſee the hopeful Evidences of their own Election. And therefore, ſuch as ſay (as ſome, no leſs wickedly than fooliſhly, do) that <hi>if they were perſuaded of the Truth of the Doctrine of</hi> Predeſtination, <hi>they would never be at any Pains or Care to ſerve God more,</hi> had juſt as good ſay plainly, <hi>they have no Love to God,</hi> and that <hi>they are entire Strangers to the Nature of true Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider, the Method of Reaſoning in the Objection, is ſuch as you would not allow to be juſt, in other Caſes of the like Nature. Can you think, it would have been juſt Reaſoning in King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to ſay, that <hi>becauſe the Lord had ordain'd he ſhould live
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004896_0075_100E15A19654F6F8"/>Fifteen Years longer</hi> (2 Kin. xx. 6.) <hi>he had no more need of either Food or Phyſick?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was of another Mind, when he ordered <hi>a Lump of Figs to be laid to the Boil,</hi> ver. 7. This ſhews us, that God brings about his Purpoſes in the Uſe of ſuitable Means, and that it is therefore neceſſary for us to obſerve them. Was ever anything more abſolutely and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively fix'd in the Purpoſe of God, than the Time and Manner of Chriſt's Death? <hi>John</hi> vii. 30. &amp; viii. 20. &amp; xii. 32, 33. Was he therefore unwiſe for uſing any Means for his Preſervation from the Hands of his Enemies? Of which we have frequent Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 59. <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 29, 30. <hi>Joh.</hi> xi. 53, 54. Was St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf, when, tho' God had told him, that both he and all that were in the Ship with him, ſhould be ſaved thro' all the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of their Voyage; yet, when the Ship-men were about to go off in the Boat and leave the reſt in the Diſtreſs, he ſaid to them, <hi>except theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved?</hi> Acts xxvii. In like Manner, it may be as truly and reaſonably ſaid, that <hi>except the Elect be converted and ſanctified, they cannot be ſaved from Hell;</hi> becauſe of the certain Connection God has made between the Means and the End. And none have any Reaſon to expect <hi>converting Grace,</hi> while they prophanely neglect the <hi>Means of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the latter Clauſe of the Objection, that <hi>the Non-elect, who have had the Opportunity of the Goſpel, will be more miſerable than if they had not:</hi> I anſwer, It is very likely it will be ſo, with the moſt of them: But then, I think, if they improv'd the Goſpel, as they might do, tho' they would not be converted and ſaved by it, yet they would not be the more, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the leſs miſerable for it. If it be enquir'd, <hi>For what End the Goſpel is ſent to ſuch as God has not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſave?</hi> I anſwer, It is chiefly for <hi>the Elect's Sake</hi> that are among them; that thereby they may
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004896_0076_100E15A40C2A8850"/>be brought in to Chriſt, and prepar'd for the heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude the Anſwer to the whole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with a <hi>general Remark</hi> or two. Seeing the Doctrine, in itſelf, does not take away our Obligations to a religious Life, but affords ſufficient Motives and Arguments for it, then it is no Argument againſt the Truth of the Doctrine, tho' ſome ungodly Men ſhould abuſe it to a Liberty to ſin: Other Doctrines of the Goſpel are liable to the ſame abuſe, as well as this. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, that ſome might be ready to infer from the Goſpel-Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as he laid it down, that they might <hi>continue in Sin, that Grace might abound,</hi> Rom. vi. 1. That ſome would be ready to object againſt him, that he made <hi>Chriſt the Miniſtor of Sin,</hi> i.e. one that gave Liberty and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Sin, <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 17. And that ſome did actually affirm that he ſaid, <hi>Let us do Evil, that Good may come,</hi> Rom. iii. 8. Again, The Lord Jeſus, who came to <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> and purchaſe to himſelf <hi>a peculiar People, zealous of good Works,</hi> will have his End; tho' ſome Men, of corrupt Minds, ſhould abuſe his Truth, to the awful Aggravation of their Guilt in the Day of his appearing. And I think we have little Encouragement, to go to the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme for the Advancement to true practical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if we confider what Advancement this Way, it has produced ſince it came in Faſhion.</p>
            <p>What is farther brought as an Objection, by ſome, I think is hardly worth taking Notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ſome will be apt to take Occaſion, from the Doctrine of</hi> Predeſtination, <hi>to live in a ſlothful Negligence and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from a Preſumption that they are elected, and ſo cannot miſs of Salvation:</hi> And <hi>others will be apt to fall into Deſpair, from a fearful Apprehenſion, that they are not elected.</hi> As I hinted already, we are to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between the <hi>Abuſe</hi> unreaſonably made of a Doctrine,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004896_0077_100E15A6627FDD08"/>and its <hi>natural Tendency,</hi> in itſelf: And that is there in this Doctrine, that leads to either of theſe <hi>wide Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams?</hi> How can it lead any to a <hi>groundleſs Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>ſlothful Negligence;</hi> when, according to it, none have. Reaſon to perſuade themſelves <hi>they are elected,</hi> until they are renew'd and ſanctify'd; and then they cannot be careleſs about the Honour and Obedience due to God? <hi>How ſhall they that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> Rom. vi. 2. All the Goſpel-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a Life of Holineſs, and this of their Election among the reſt, do then effectually engage their Hearts to it. Indeed, if they knew their Election before their Converſion, before they believ'd in Chriſt and lov'd God, no doubt they would abuſe it to Sloth and Licentiouſneſs, till God chang'd their Hearts: But they have no ſure Evidence of their Election till they are brought to a better Diſpoſition. And how can it bring any to <hi>Deſperation,</hi> when they <hi>cannot</hi> know that they are <hi>not elected?</hi> For Perſons to conclude poſitively, that <hi>they are appointed to Deſtruction,</hi> is to conclude without Reaſon, and Pretending to know the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reveal'd Secrets of God's Breaſt.</p>
            <p>Some think the Words of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 42. are contrary to this Doctrine; where he ſays of <hi>Jeruſalem, If thou hadſt known, in this thy Day, the Things that belong to thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> Which Words, they ſuppoſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the Inhabitants of the City had, before that Time, had ſuch inward Aſſiſtance from God, as put it in their Power to convert themſelves; but which were then forever withdrawn from them, for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of them, ſo that their Caſe was then beyond all Hope. And in this ſame Senſe they ſuppoſe, that <hi>all Men have a Day of Grace,</hi> in ſome Part of their Life, or, as they rather chuſe to term it, <hi>a Day of Viſitation.</hi> But this Opinion is without any Foundation in the Text: How can the Words ſignify, that their Day
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004896_0078_100E15A7E64C0BF0"/>there ſpoken of, was a Time in which they had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inward Grace; when they clearly imply, that they did not ſo much as know the Things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to their Peace in that Day? The true Import of our Lord's Words is, That they had had, in that outward Means of Conviction, that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> ſufficient to prevail with them, as rational Creatures, to acknowledge and own him as ſuch; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of which, they rejected and perſecuted him, and would, in a little Time put him to Death; for which they ſhould, before long, be puniſh'd with utter Ruin, both of their City and Nation, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows lows in the next Words. And ſo the Words alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that there was leſs Probabilty and reaſonable Hope of their being converted to God, after all ſuch Means had been ſo long quite loſt upon them, than there was before, according to God's ordinary Way of Working.</p>
            <p>And now I have gone thro' all the contrary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Objections, of any Conſequence, that I know of; and upon the whole, muſt deſire the careful Reader, ſeriouſly to look back and conſider, if the Doctrine of <hi>abſolute Predeſtimation,</hi> as it has been ſtated and repreſented, be not entirely agreable to Reaſon, clearly founded on Scripture, and perfectly conſiſtent with every Part of it, and conſequently a moſt certain Truth of God. Let us not be wilfully reſolved againſt admitting reaſonable Evidence, but <hi>quit ourſelves like Men,</hi> and uſe our Underſtandings, with humble Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God, on whom all Creatures are dependant, for a right Judgment and a ſound Mind. Don't ſay, you won't believe it, juſt becauſe you don't like it: That is both the Shame and Crime of a reaſonable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the greateſt Folly in the World; for if it be a Truth, it will be ſo, whether you like it and believe it, or not. And let us alſo conſider, what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Uſe, and native Tendency of the Doctrine: And
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004896_0079_100E15AA56D707D8"/>ſo, let us humbly lie low, as guilty Criminals, before the Foot-ſtool of God's Sovereignty, acknowledging his Right to <hi>diſpoſe of us,</hi> for Life or Death, <hi>as he pleaſes.</hi> Let us not be ſtupidly eaſy in our Minds, without the Experience of ſupernatural, ſanctifying Grace in our Hearts, the only Evidence of our Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Mean of ſolid Comfort, <hi>without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Let us ſeek and long for it, in all the Ways of God's Commands and Ordinances, where it is moſt likely to be found; and not treaſure up greater Loads of Wrath to ourſelves, againſt the Day of Wrath, by Diſobedience to the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver's Authority. Let ſuch of us, as God has given the Tokens of his ſpecial Love unto, in our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, give the <hi>Glory and Praiſe to him alone:</hi> And ſtill endeavour, to live anſwerable to the Obligations of ſuch wonderful, diſtinguiſhing Love and Grace. Let us give up all Confidence of our own Ability, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on our own Righteouſneſs and good Doings, to entitle us to Happineſs; caſting ourſelves only on the Mediation and Attonement of the Son of God, as he is reveal'd and propos'd in the Goſpel; ſeeking for that living Faith in him that brings Joy and Peace to the Soul, that works by Love and the freeſt Obedience. Such as theſe are the Things, which this Doctrine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leads to; and ſo, it agrees to the great Deſign of God in the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> the Illuſtration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory of his <hi>Free Grace,</hi> in the Salvation of guilty Sinners: Whereas the contrary Scheme defaces and ſinks it down: But God will have the Glory, and it's ſit he ſhou'd: The whole Glory, from firſt to laſt, he has ſecur'd to himſelf.
