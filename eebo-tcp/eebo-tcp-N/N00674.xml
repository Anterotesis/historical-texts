            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, who brought in the same great Plenty of Goods, with whom we entered into a strict Allyance, and tyed his Ship with the bark of a Tree, which was often Renewed until at length we changed the bark of the Tree which kept our Allyance firm, and made it of a more substantial matter, by which it became a Covenant Chain, which is the Term we have ever since used, and in this Covenant Chain we and the Brethren have been continually Linked, and have fixed it so sure, that we have never since with-drawn our hands from it, and we the five Nations shall never depart from it, but keep the same Inviolable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Corlaer,</hi> All our Confidence is and we are well assured that our great Brother will take our whole House under his Protection, in which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence we have great joy, the like having been our Comfort in former times, and Coll. <hi>Peter Schuyler</hi> hath been always the Instrument that hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the assuring to us this Comfort.

now become a Tree of Welfare and Peace, and our living under it for the time to come will make us Enjoy more ease, and live with greater advantage then we have done for several years past, and we therefore in the hopes of this enjoyment, Renew our old Covenant Chain under this Tree of Welfare, whilst our great Brother has the care of this Government.

               <hi>Brethren,</hi> You may judge of the great Affection the King of <hi>England</hi> my great Master, has for you, by the Richness of the Present he now makes you, so I doubt not but you will always demean your selves worthy of the Esteem my great Master has for you.
