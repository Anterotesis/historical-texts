            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Life and Confeſſion of JOHNSON GREEN, Who is to be Executed this Day, Auguſt 17th, 1786, for the Atrocious Crime of BURGLARY; Together with his LAST and DYING WORDS.</head>
            <p>I <hi>JOHNSON GREEN,</hi> having brought myſelf to a ſhameful and ignominious death, by my wicked conduct, and as I am a dying man I leave to the world the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hiſtory of my Birth, Education, and vicious Practices, hoping that all people will take warning by my evil example, and ſhun vice and follow virtue.</p>
            <p>I was born at Bridgwater, in the Country of Plymouth, in the Commonwealth of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, was twenty-nine years of age the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of February laſt. My father was a negro, and a ſervant to the Hon. Timothy Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> late of ſaid Bridgwater, deceaſed. My mother was an Iriſh woman, named Sarah Johnſon, ſhe was a widow, and her maiden name was Green. I have been called Joſeph-Johnſon Green. When I was five years of age my mother bound me as an Apprentice to Mr. Seth Howard of ſaid Bridgwater, to be inſtructed in Agriculture. I was uſed very tenderly, and inſtructed in the principles of the Christian Religion. Whilſt I was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice my mother gave me much good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice cautioned me againſt keeping company with thoſe that uſed bad language and other vicious practices, She adviſed me not to go to ſea nor into the army, foretold what has come to paſs ſince the commencement of the late war, and ſaid it would not come to paſs in her day. She died about ſixteen years ago, and if I had followed her good advice I might have eſcaped an ignominious death.</p>
            <p>When I was eighteen years of age (contrary to my mother's advice) I inliſted into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican ſervice, and remained in the ſame for the duration of the war. I would juſt obſerve to the world, that my being addicted to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, the keeping of bad company, and a correſpondence that I have had with lewd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, has been the cauſe of my being brought to this wretched ſituation.</p>
            <p>In March, 1781, I was married at F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtown, to one Sarah Phillips, a muſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, who was brought up by Mr. Olney, of Providence. She has had two children ſince I was married to her, and I have treated her exceeding ill.</p>
            <p>When I began to ſteal I was about 12 years old, at which time I ſtole four cakes of gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbread and ſix biſcuit, out of a horſe cart, and afterwards I ſtole ſundry ſmall articles, and was not detected.</p>
            <p>When I was about fourteen, I ſtole one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of lemons and one cake of chocolate, was detected, and received reproof. Soon after I ſtole ſome hens, and my conduct was ſo bad that my maſter ſold me to one of his couſins, who uſed me well.</p>
            <p>I continued the practice of ſtealing, and juſt before I went into the army I took my maſter's key, unlocked his cheſt, and ſtole two ſhillings; he diſcovered what I had done, gave me cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but not ſo ſeverely as I deſerved.</p>
            <p>Sometime after I was engaged in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſervice, at a certain tavern in Sherburne, I ſtole fifteen ſhillings, one caſe bottle of rum, one dozen of biſcuit, and a pillow caſe with ſome ſugar.</p>
            <p>In April, 1731, I ſtole at the Highlands, near Weſt-Point, a pair of ſilver ſhoe buckles, was d<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cted, and received one hundred laſhes.</p>
            <p>In October, the ſame year, when I was at Weſt-Point and we were extremely pinched for the want of proviſions, three of us broke open a ſettler's markee, ſtole three cheeſes, one ſmall firkin of butter, and ſome chocolate. I only was detected, and puniſhed by receiving one hundred ſtripes.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the winter of 178<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, at Eaſton, I broke into a griſt mill, belonging to Mr. Timothy Randall, and ſtole about a buſhel of corn, and at ſundry times the ſame year I broke into a cellar belonging to Mr. Ebenezer How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, of the ſame place, and ſtole ſome meat and tobacco; and I alſo broke into a cellar and a corn houſe belonging to Mr. Abiel Kinſley, of the ſame place, and ſtole ſome meat and corn; and at haſt-Bridgewater, the ſame year, I broke open a griſt mill, and ſtole near a buſhel of meal; and at ſame time ſtole three of four dozen herrings our of a corn houſe. I alſo went to a corn houſe belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Whitman, of Bridgwater, and ſtole two cheeſes out of it.</p>
            <p>Auguſt Iſt, 1784, I broke open a houſe in Providence, and ſtole goods to the value of forty dollars. Soon after I broke open a ſhop near Patuxet Falls, ſtole one pair of cards, two cod fiſh, and ſundry other articles.</p>
            <p>In 1784 I alſo committed the following crimes, viz. I broke into a cellar about a mile from Patuxet Bridge, ſtole about thirty weight of ſalt pork, one caſe bottle, and ſeveral other articles. About the ſame time I ſtole out of a waſhing tub in Patuxet, a pair of trowſers, three pair of ſtocking, and a ſhirt; and at Seaconk I ſtole two ſhirts and ſome ſtockings through an open window. I ſtole at a barn between Seaconk and Attleborough, a woollen blanket, and through an open window near the ſame place, I ſtole two ſheets, one gown, and one ſhirt. At Mr. Amos Shepherdſon's in Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, I ſtole out of waſh-tub, one ſhirt, two ſhirts, one ſhort gown, and one pair of ſtockings.</p>
            <p>At Norton, I broke into a cellar belonging to Col. George Leonard, and ſtole a quarter of mutton. The ſame night I broke into another cellar near that place, and ſtole between twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and thirty weight of ſalt pork.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, I broke onto tavern near the ſame place, and stole near two dollars in money, and one caſe-bottle of rum.</p>
            <p>Between Providence and Attleborough, I broke open two cellars, and ſtole ſome meat.</p>
            <p>I broke into a houſe in Johnſon, and ſtole betwixt twenty and thirty wt. of ſalt pork and beef, and one broom.</p>
            <p>Some of the things I ſtole this year, I ſold at the market in Providence.</p>
            <p>April 23d. 1785. I was impriſoned at Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket, for ſtriking a truckman, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, at a time when I was intoxicated with liquor: The next day I was releaſed upon my paying a fine and the coſt of proſecution.</p>
            <p>I broke open a houſe in Stoughton, ſtole ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral aprons, ſome handkerchiefs, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparel.</p>
            <p>I ſtole about two yards and an half of tow cloth from Col. David Lathrop, of Bridgewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the ſame night I ſtole a ſhirt from a clothier, in the ſame town; and I alſo ſtole one apron, one pocket-handkerchief, one pair of ſtockings, and one ſhift from Thomas Howard, of Eaſt-Bridgewater, upon the ſame night.</p>
            <p>The next week I ſtole a piece of tow-cloth, in Halifax, and at the ſame time I broke into a houſe, and ſtole about twenty pounds of ſalt beef, and three pounds of wool.</p>
            <p>October 15th, 1785, I broke open a ſhop in Walpole, and ſtole ſeven pair of ſhoes.</p>
            <p>Nov. 1785. I broke open a ſtore in Natick, and ſtole a quantity of goods from the owner, viz. Mr. Morris.</p>
            <p>At Capt. Bent's tavern, in Stoughtonham, I went down chimney, by a rope, opened a window and faſtened it up with my jack-knife; immediately after, a man came to the houſe for a gallon of rum; he called to the landlord, and his daughter (as I took her to be) aroſe and waited upon him. She diſcovered the open window, with the jack-knife, and ſaid it did not belong to the houſe; it was concluded that it belonged to ſome boys who were gone to a huſking, and had called there that evening.—It was my deſign to have made my eſcape out at the window, when I opened it, in caſe I ſhould be diſcovered by any perſon in the houſe: But when the man came up to the houſe, I fearing I might be diſcovered, drawed myſelf up chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and ſtood on the croſs-bar until he was gone and all the people were aſleep; I then deſcended again, and ſtole near three dollars out of the bar; then aſcended the chimney and eſcaped without being diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The ſame month I hid a quantity of goods which I had ſtole (part of them being the goods I had ſtolen at Natick) in a barn, belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Foſter, in Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and I engaged to come and work for the ſaid Foſter It happened that I was taken upon ſuſpicion that I had ſtolen a horſe (which I had taken and rode about four miles) and committed to gaol in the county of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, but as no ſufficient evidence appeared, I was ſet at liberty. In the mean time the ſaid Foſter found the goods and advertiſed them. I ſent my wife to him, ſhe owned and received the goods, and I eſcaped undiſcovered, by her telling him that I came to his houſe in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preceding the day I had gromiſed to work for him; that as it was late in the night, and the weather rainy, I did not chooſe to diſturb him and his family, by calling them up; that I was obliged to leave the goods and return home, and being taken up on the ſuſpicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, I could not take care of the goods &amp;c.</p>
            <p>April 1ſt, 1786, I broke into a houſe, in Medford, and ſtole two pair of ſtockings, one ſcarf, one gown, and one pair of buckles.</p>
            <p>The ſame month I broke into the houſe of one Mr. Blake, innholder, oppoſite the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks in Rutland, and ſtole a bottle of bitters, and three or four dollars in money.</p>
            <p>Soon after I broke into Mr. Chickery's houſe, in Holden, and ſtole about thirty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars worth of clothing. The next day I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the woods, and at evening Mr. Chickery took me up after I had got into the high-way, ſearched my pack, and found his things. On his attempting to ſeize me, I ran off, and made my eſcape.—I left my pack, and the money I had ſtolen from Mr. Blake.</p>
            <p>Not long after, I went to Mr. Jotham Howe's in Shrewſbury, and opened a window, and ſtole a blanket.</p>
            <p>I then went to another houſe, broke in, and ſtole a fine apron out of a deſk. The ſame night I went to a barn belonging to Mr. Baldwin, in ſaid Shrewſbury, and lodged in it the next day, and at evening I broke into his houſe, and ſtole about three ſhillings and three pence in money, and about nine dollars worth of clothing, for which crime I am now under ſentence of death.</p>
            <p>The ſame night I broke open the houſe of Mr. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>or, In ſaid Shrewſbury, and ſtole i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> money and goods, to the value of near ſix dollars.</p>
            <p>I alſo broke into the houſe of Mr. Roſs Wyman, of the ſame town, and upon the ſame night, and ſtole from him near two dollars.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I ſtole a pair of thread ſtockings at a houſe juſt beyond ſaid Wyman's, and hid myſelf in the woods, where I lay all the next day, and at evening I ſat off towards Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and was taken up by a guard that was placed by a bridge in the edge of Westborough. I was taken before General Ward, confeſeſed the crimes alledged, was committed to gaol, and in April laſt, I received ſentence of death, for the crime aforementioned.</p>
            <p>Upon the evening of the firſt day of June, I cleared myſelf of all my chains, and made an eſcape from the gaol; And notwithſtanding all the admonitions, counſels and warnings that I had received from the good miniſters and other pious perſons who had viſited me under my confinement, I returned again to my vicious practices, "like the dog to his vomit, and the ſow that is waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire;" for the very ſame evening I ſtole a cheeſe out of a preſs in Holden: And the next Saturday I broke into the houſe of Mr. James Caldwell, in Barre, and ſtole near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five dollars worth of clothing.</p>
            <p>I tarried in Barre about twelve days, and then ſet off for Natick, and on the way I broke into a cellar, in Shrewſbury, and ſtole ſome bread and cheeſe—Whilſt I tarried in Barre, I lived in the woods all the time—when I had got to Natick, I ſtole two pair of ſtockings and two pocket handkerchiefs, that were hanging out near a houſe.</p>
            <p>From Natick I went to Sherburne, and broke open a ſtore belonging to Mr. Samud Sanger, and ſtole between four and five dozen of buttons.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to Mr. John Sanger's houſe, in the ſame town, broke it open, and ſtole a caſe bottle of rum, one bottle of cherry rum, ſix cakes of gigerbread, and as many biſcuits: I ſearched for money, but found none.</p>
            <p>At another tavern in the ſame town, I took out a pane of glaſs, and opened the window, but I was diſcovered by the landlord, made my eſcape, and went back to Natick, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there two days.</p>
            <p>From Natick I went to Sroughtonham, and at Capt. Bent's (the place were I went down the chimney) the cellar being open, I went through it, and in the bar-room I ſtole fifteen ſhillings in money, one caſe bottle of rum, and one half dozen of biſcuits.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I went to Eaſton, and on the way I broke open a houſe, and ſtole ſome cheeſe, and two pair of ſhoes, and two pair of shoe buckles. At Eaſton I tarried two days, and then made my eſcape from two men who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to take me up on ſuſpicion that I had broken gaol. From thence I went to Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and through a window I ſtole two cheeſes and at a tavern near the ſame place, I ſtole ſix ſhillings and eight pence, one caſe bottle of rum, a ſailor's jacket, and one pair of ſilver knee buckles.</p>
            <p>I then ſat off for Providence, and by the way I opened a window, and ſtole one cotton jacket, one jack-knife; and at another houſe on the ſame way, I ſtole through a window one fine apron, one pocket handkerchief, and one pillow caſe.</p>
            <p>I came to providence the 26th day of June, and not long after, I broke open a cellar, and ſtole one bottle of beer, ſome ſalt fiſh, and ten pounds of butter.</p>
            <p>A few nights after, I went to Col. Mantons's in Johnſton, and the cellar being open, I went into it, and ſtole twenty pounds of butter, near as much ſalt pork, one milk pail, one cheeſe cloth, and one frock.</p>
            <p>A few nights after, I went to Justice Belknap's in the ſame place, and broke into his cellar, and ſtole about thirty pounds of ſalt pork, one neat's tongue, one pair of nippers, one box of awls, and one bag.—It remarkably happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 13th ultimo (the day that had been appointed for my execution) that I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to gaol in Providence, on ſuſpicion of having ſtolen the things laſt mentioned, and on the 18th ult. I was brought back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in this gaol again.—Many more thefts and other vicious, practices have I been guilty of, the particulars of which might tire the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the reader.</p>
            <p>Some of the things I have ſtolen I have uſed myſelf—ſome of them I have ſold—ſome have been taken from me—ſome I have hid where I could not find them again—and others I have given to lewd women, who induced me to ſteal for their maintenance. I have lived a hard life, by being obliged to keep in the woods; have ſuffered much by hunger, nakedneſs, cold, and the fears of being detected and brought to juſtice—have often been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſtealing when I was not guilty, and others have been accuſed of crimes when I was the offender. I never murdered any perſon, nor robbed any body on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I have had great dealings with women, which to their and my ſhame be it ſpoken, I often too eaſily obtained my will of them. I hope they will repent, as I do, of ſuch wicked and infamous conduct. I have had a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with many women, excluſive of my wife, among whom were ſeveral abandoned Whites, and a large number of Blacks; four of the whites were married women, three of the blacks have laid children to me beſides my wife, who has been much diſtreſſed by my behaviour.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given a hiſtory of my birth, education and atrocious conduct, and as the time is very high in which I muſt ſuffer an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death, I earneſtly intreat that all people would take warning by my wicked example; that they would ſhun the paths of deſtruction by guarding againſt every tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; that they would ſhun vice, follow vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and become (through the aſſiſtance of the ALMIGHTY) victorious over the enemies of immortal felicity, who are exerting themselves to delude and lead nations to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>As I am ſenſible of the heinouſneſs of my crimes, and am ſorry for my wicked conduct, in violating the laws of the great Governour of the Univerſe, whoſe Divine Majeſty I have offended, I earnetly pray that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my ſins, blot out my multiplied trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and receive my immortal ſpirit into the Paradiſe of never ending bliſs.</p>
            <p>I aſk forgiveneſs of my wife, and of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom I have injured. I return my ſincere thanks to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and others, who have viſited me under my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their counſels and admonitions, and for the good care they have taken of me: God reward them for their kindneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us all through this troubleſome world to the regions of immortal felicity in the kingdom of Heaven—AMEN.</p>

            <head>The following POEM was written at the requeſt of JOHNSON GREEN, by a priſoner in Worcester Gaol, and is at ſaid GREEN's ſpecial requeſt, added to his Life and Confeſſion, as a PART of his DYING WORDS.</head>
            <l>LET all the people on the globe</l>
            <l>Be on their guard, and ſee</l>
            <l>That they do ſhun the vicious road</l>
            <l>That's trodden been by me.</l>
            <l>If I had ſhun'd the paths of vice;</l>
            <l>Had minded to behave</l>
            <l>According to the good advice</l>
            <l>That my kind mother gave,</l>
            <l>Unto my friends I might have been</l>
            <l>A bleſſing in my days,</l>
            <l>And ſhun'd the evils that I've ſeen</l>
            <l>In my pernicious ways.</l>
            <l>My wicked counduct has been ſuch,</l>
            <l>It's brought me to diſtreſs;</l>
            <l>As often times I've ſuffer'd much</l>
            <l>By my own wickedneſs.</l>
            <l>My lewdneſs, drunkenneſs, and theft</l>
            <l>Has often times—(behold)</l>
            <l>Caus'd me to wander, and be left</l>
            <l>To ſuffer with the cold.</l>
            <l>Hid in the woods, in deep diſtreſs,</l>
            <l>My pinching wants were ſuch,</l>
            <l>With hunger, and with nakedneſs</l>
            <l>I oft did ſuffer much.</l>
            <l>I've liv'd a thief; it's a hard life;</l>
            <l>To drink was much inclin'd;</l>
            <l>My conduct has diſtreſs'd my wife,</l>
            <l>A wife both good and kind.</l>
            <l>Though many friends which came to ſee</l>
            <l>Me, in theſe latter times,</l>
            <l>Did oft with candour, caution me</l>
            <l>To leave my vicious crimes;</l>
            <l>Yet when I had got out of gaol,</l>
            <l>Their labour prov'd in vain;</l>
            <l>For then, alas! I did not fail</l>
            <l>To take to them again.</l>
            <l>If I had not conducted ſo;</l>
            <l>Had minded to refrain;</l>
            <l>Then I ſhould not have had to go</l>
            <l>Back to the gaol again.</l>
            <l>Thus in the Devil's ſervice, I</l>
            <l>Have ſpent my youthful days,</l>
            <l>And now, alas! I ſoon muſt die,</l>
            <l>For theſe my wicked ways.</l>
            <l>Repent, ye thieves, whilſt ye have breath,</l>
            <l>Amongſt you let be wrought</l>
            <l>A reformation, leſt to death,</l>
            <l>You, like myſelf, be brought.</l>
            <l>Let other vicious perſons ſee</l>
            <l>That they from vice abſtain;</l>
            <l>Leſt they undo themſelves, like me,</l>
            <l>Who in it did remain.</l>
            <l>I hope my ſad and diſinal fate</l>
            <l>Will ſolemn warning be</l>
            <l>To people all, both ſmall and great,</l>
            <l>Of high and low degree.</l>
            <l>By breaking of the righteous laws,</l>
            <l>I to the world relate,</l>
            <l>That I thereby have been the cauſe</l>
            <l>Of my unhappy fate.</l>
            <l>As I repent, I humbly pray</l>
            <l>That God would now remit</l>
            <l>My ſins, which in my vicious way</l>
            <l>I really did commit.</l>
            <l>May the old TEMPTER ſoon be bound</l>
            <l>And ſhut up in his den,</l>
            <l>And peace and honeſty abound</l>
            <l>Among the ſons of men.</l>
            <l>May the great GOD grant this requeſt,</l>
            <l>And bring us to that ſhore</l>
            <l>Where peace and everlaſting reſt</l>
            <l>Abides for ever more.</l>
