            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER has attentively conÅ¿idered the Å¿eries of queÅ¿tions propoÅ¿ed for public diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ion by the Teylerian Society, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they have uÅ¿ually had the peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of uniting curious inveÅ¿tigation with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral utility. But, of all the queÅ¿tions propoÅ¿ed by this, or by any literary Å¿ociety whatever, none appears either of greater conÅ¿equence in itÅ¿elf, or from the complexion of the times, more likely to excite attention, than that which is now offered by this reÅ¿pectable body, as the Å¿ubject of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the literary honour which they annually confer. It directly leads to examine the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal foundations of civil Å¿ociety, to unfold the chief obligations of all Å¿ocial duties, to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the important advantages of Å¿ubordination, on the one hand, and, on the other, to guard againÅ¿t the dreadful and odious conÅ¿equences both of deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiÅ¿m and of anarchy. Such are the momentous conÅ¿iderations neceÅ¿Å¿arily connected with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of this queÅ¿tion; the propoÅ¿al of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025234_0003_0FCC92AA2A3ADA20"/>
which does equal honour to the diÅ¿cernment and public Å¿pirit of the worthy directors of the Tey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian inÅ¿titution. Happy may the perÅ¿on account himÅ¿elf, and juÅ¿tly will he be entitled to the thanks of his fellow men, who Å¿hall be enabled to treat this Å¿ubject in any manner adequate to its real conÅ¿equence and dignity. Far, indeed, is the writer of this EÅ¿Å¿ay from preÅ¿uming to lay claim to this praiÅ¿e, but he feels his heart impreÅ¿Å¿ed by the importance of the Å¿ubject, and animated with a warm deÅ¿ire of contributing to the public good that portion which his Å¿mall abilities may permit. Ever Å¿ince he was capable of any rational reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he has found his Å¿oul actuated by the Å¿acred flame of Liberty, by an abhorrence of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and by that love of juÅ¿tice which dictates an equal enjoyment of all the rights of human nature. The grand principle of the natural equality of men, if rightly underÅ¿tood, is the only baÅ¿is on which univerÅ¿al juÅ¿tice, order, and freedom, can be firmly built, and permanently Å¿ecured. The view exhibited in this EÅ¿Å¿ay, Å¿o far from looÅ¿ening the bands of Å¿ociety, or weakening that Å¿ubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without which no government can Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, will draw more cloÅ¿ely every Å¿ocial tie, and more Å¿trongly confirm the obligations of legal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the rights of legal authority.</p>
            <p>The writer is Å¿ufficiently aware that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:025234_0004_0FCCAE0EAB74D508"/>
which he attempts to unfold, will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable either to the wild enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿ts for liberty, or to the Å¿ervile and tyrannical abettors of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power. That moderation, which flows from the love and the perception of truth (which commonly lies between two extremes) is Å¿eldom acceptable to the multitude, who, incapable of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing the uÅ¿e from the abuÅ¿e of things, are generally as extravagant and impetuous in the maintenance of right, as in the abetment of wrong. It is only the few, who have Å¿haken off the Å¿hackles of prejudice, diÅ¿pelled the clouds of paÅ¿Å¿ion, and burÅ¿t from the dungeon in which they confine the Å¿oul, that can view and reliÅ¿h ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as they appear in the pure and Å¿teady light in which nature exhibits them. The eyes of the reÅ¿t of mankind are either too weak to Å¿uÅ¿tain its luÅ¿tre, or, if they have beheld it for Å¿ome time, become Å¿o much dazzled as to loÅ¿e Å¿ight of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which it is deÅ¿igned to unfold to them, and are thus deprived of that direction in conduct which it ought to afford. Of the truth of this aÅ¿Å¿ertion, the times in which we live furniÅ¿h abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and melancholy examples.</p>
            <p>Since the generality of mankind, then, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in extremes, and the wiÅ¿er few, if they keep themÅ¿elves free from the contagion of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:025234_0005_0FCCAE1253D11308"/>
prejudice and paÅ¿Å¿ion, will, from this very circumÅ¿tance, Å¿eldom acquire any great influence over the general conduct; it may be aÅ¿ked, of what uÅ¿e can Å¿uch writings be, which the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will either not read, or not apply to profit, and the more intelligent do not require? To this queÅ¿tion the anÅ¿wer is obvious:âthat the progreÅ¿s of truth is Å¿ure, though Å¿low; that, if every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of diÅ¿cernment and moderation would conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as his duty to communicate, as far as his Å¿phere may extend, the light he himÅ¿elf has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, a great deal of good might at laÅ¿t be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿hed; and that to contribute any portion, however Å¿mall, to the common benefit, is both a Å¿ufficient motive and a Å¿ufficient reward to a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and generous mind. The human Å¿oul is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for truth and virtue. Error, prejudice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, are unnatural Å¿tates. SuperÅ¿tition and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, popular frenzy, or deÅ¿potic oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be deÅ¿tined by the Supreme Director of the world to hold a perpetual reign, becauÅ¿e they counteract his wiÅ¿e and benevolent deÅ¿igns. The paÅ¿Å¿ions, and the conÅ¿equent agitations which they excite, as they are violent, can never be laÅ¿ting, and, from their very violence itÅ¿elf, tend, by a Å¿pecies of fermentation, to throw off the dregs of ignorance and folly, which obÅ¿truct the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Å¿pecies. TheÅ¿e convulÅ¿ions may
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:025234_0006_0FCCAE135BF74188"/>
be compared to tempeÅ¿ts and hurricanes which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercaÅ¿t the Å¿ky with a temporary gloom, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occaÅ¿ion the moÅ¿t dreadful calamities; but, in the end, refine the atmoÅ¿phere, and preÅ¿erve its Å¿alubrity. It is more natural to Å¿uppoÅ¿e that the progreÅ¿s of the world is towards improvement and perfection, than, as gloomy but contracted minds are apt to fancy, towards degeneracy and ruin. Even the final deÅ¿truction of this globe, which Scripture teaches us to expect, will only Å¿erve to introduce a more perfect and glorious Å¿cene. The times in which we live, though agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with violent convulÅ¿ions, and marked by Å¿triking events, are peculiarly favourable to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal inquiry and to Å¿ubÅ¿tantial improvement. On the public affairs of the world, it has often been Å¿aid, that the Å¿peculations of philoÅ¿ophers in their cloÅ¿ets have but little influenÃ§e. But Å¿uch an opinion can be adopted by thoÅ¿e only who are as great Å¿trangers to experience as they are to Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. The conduct of men is commonly direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their opinions. Their opinions are formed by their principles; their principles, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction which they receive, by the books which they read, by the company which they frequent. Hence it is eaÅ¿y to Å¿ee how far the public opinions and conduct muÅ¿t, in a literary age, be affected by the writings that appear in it. If theÅ¿e are dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:025234_0007_0FCCAE14ADDA1D08"/>
by Å¿oundneÅ¿s of judgment, and benignity of heart, they cannot fail of producing much bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p>The time, therefore, and pains employed in Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations Å¿uch as are Å¿uggeÅ¿ted by the important queÅ¿tion I now propoÅ¿e to diÅ¿cuÅ¿s, cannot be miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pent, if the Å¿ubject is treated with any tolerable degree of accuracy and preciÅ¿ion. Even thoÅ¿e who fail of Å¿ucceÅ¿s may Å¿till claim the honour of a laudable attempt; and from men of Å¿uch judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and candour as characteriÅ¿e thoÅ¿e to whom I have the honour of addreÅ¿Å¿ing this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, are Å¿ure of obtaining it. Without detaining the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of my candid readers any longer from the immediate conÅ¿ideration of the queÅ¿tion now before them, I Å¿hall directly proceed to examine it. As it Å¿tands propoÅ¿ed by the Society, it divides itÅ¿elf into three parts:
<list>
                  <item>I. In what reÅ¿pects may men be Å¿aid to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual?</item>
                  <item>II. What are the rights reÅ¿ulting from this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality?</item>

               <p>THAT all men are, by nature, equal, is an opinion Å¿o generally received among thoÅ¿e who are accuÅ¿tomed to any degree of philoÅ¿ophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that to call it in queÅ¿tion might appear abÅ¿urd, and to prove it Å¿uperfluous. Yet, this opinion, like many general maxims which obtain a currency in the world, however true it may be, in its proper Å¿enÅ¿e, is not. I am inclined to believe, of the greateÅ¿t part, Å¿ufficiently founded according to the acceptation of thoÅ¿e who admit it. If it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood in any Å¿enÅ¿e, excluÅ¿ive of all natural Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and diÅ¿tinction among men, it will be found to contradict univerÅ¿al experience. At whatever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025234_0010_0FCCAE1ACB523950"/>
of human life, in whatever Å¿tate or condition of Å¿ociety, we contemplate our Å¿pecies, we Å¿hall find that nature has diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed individuals from each other, by peculiar and appropriate qualities, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t as remarkably, in Å¿ome inÅ¿tances, as Å¿he has diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed the human race from the inferior creatures. ThoÅ¿e philoÅ¿ophers, who, in order to exalt themÅ¿elves, attempt to degrade their Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and diÅ¿play their eloquence by defending the moÅ¿t irrational paradoxes, are eager to perÅ¿uade us that, as human nature, in its original Å¿tate, is on a level with the brutes, Å¿o individuals among mankind derive every difference of corporeal and mental perfection that characterizes them, wholly from the opportunities of improvement which they have enjoyed, or from the happy Å¿ituations in which they have been placed. Contradicting univerÅ¿al experience, they Å¿trive to refer the judgments which it eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes, to the claÅ¿s of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular prejudices; and, pretending to lead us to the true knowledge of human nature, exhibit to our view a Å¿tate of brutiÅ¿h ignorance, and of Å¿avage ferocity, which has never exiÅ¿ted but in their own imaginations.

within its preÅ¿cribed compaÅ¿s, never can, by any improvement, be carried one Å¿tep beyond its primitive limits. That capacity of perfection, which they grant to him, as his only diÅ¿tinction above the inferior animals, implies, in its very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more elevated and extenÅ¿ive powers, than any of theÅ¿e can poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s. To deny this, is to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ert, that a building may be erected without a foundation, an elegant and beautiful form exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without original materials, an effect produced without a cauÅ¿e. TheÅ¿e writers Å¿eem to overlook the whole analogy of nature, in which every Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from every other, by proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties common to all of the Å¿ame claÅ¿s, while all the individuals of each Å¿pecies are characterized by their peculiar qualities. It would be equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urd to think of forming a man out of a brute, as to imagine that a fiÅ¿h may be transformed into a quadruped.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e, however, who Å¿eek not fame, but wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not brilliancy, but truth, will, in all their enquities concerning human nature, take the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Å¿pecies, as they find it exhibited, in its various forms, by daily obÅ¿ervation, by the incorrupted records of HiÅ¿tory, and by the authentic relations of travellers. Beyond theÅ¿e Å¿ources of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they will not pretend to go in queÅ¿t of Å¿tates
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025234_0013_0FCCAE2005ADCBE0"/>
of human nature, which are only to be found in the pictures of poets, or in the hypotheÅ¿es of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophers equally fanciful; and they will conÅ¿ider it as no leÅ¿s ridiculous for any one to philoÅ¿ophiÅ¿e on man with an Ourang-Outang before him, than it would be for a perÅ¿on, attempting to determine the qualities of gold, to reject an undoubted piece of that metal, and begin his experiments with a piece of pinchbeck. For, as a Å¿tatue, however elegantly finiÅ¿hed, Å¿till contains the rude maÅ¿s of marble, on which Å¿o much Å¿ymetry and beauty has been Å¿uperinduced; Å¿o, man, in the moÅ¿t civilized Å¿tate of Å¿ociety, Å¿till retains the original principles of his nature on which all the various modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he has undergone, have been ingrafted. It is the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the philoÅ¿opher to diÅ¿cover theÅ¿e amidÅ¿t all the adventitious circumÅ¿tances with which they may be connected, or the various Å¿hapes and colourings which they may have aÅ¿Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No human purÅ¿uit, no human inÅ¿titution, no human enjoyment, no human corruption itÅ¿elf, but may be ultimately referred to Å¿ome original principle of our nature; and without theÅ¿e origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al principles, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to account for the power of education, of habit, and of example. If, laying aÅ¿ide all regard to imaginary Å¿tates of human nature, in which none of the principles, which now Å¿o powerfully influence our Å¿pecies,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025234_0014_0FCCAE247018F530"/>
are Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have unfolded themÅ¿elves, we fix our attention on mankind as they are exhibited to us in hiÅ¿tory, and by daily obÅ¿ervation, there is one important fact, which muÅ¿t occur to every one endowed with the Å¿malleÅ¿t reflection. This fact, on which I mean chiefly to found my reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the whole of this Å¿ubject, is, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Å¿imilar the Å¿pecies may be in general, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diverÅ¿ity of abilities, talents, and character, obtains among the individuals that compoÅ¿e it.</p>
               <p>This diverÅ¿ity is evident with regard both to the body, and to the mind. In Å¿ome, we behold great bodily Å¿trength and dexterity, and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar aptitude for mechanical operations, and for rapid and powerful movements. In others, the powers of imagination conÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves; while judgment, acuteneÅ¿s, penetration, and Å¿agacity, in the conduct of life, diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h another claÅ¿s of men. An uncommon clearneÅ¿s and energy of intellect, and an aptitude for the abÅ¿tract Å¿ciences, raiÅ¿e others above the common level. Some have an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing faculty of perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, of addreÅ¿s, and management in mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affections, and influencing the conduct of their fellow men.</p>
               <p>Nor is this diverÅ¿ity leÅ¿s remarkable in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualities of men, than in their corporeal and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025234_0015_0FCCAE25EB907F10"/>
intellectual powers. Some have a wonderful command of their own paÅ¿Å¿ions, and can preÅ¿erve their moderation and compoÅ¿ure of Å¿oul amidÅ¿t the greateÅ¿t provocations, and the moÅ¿t trying cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; others are deprived of all Å¿elf government by the Å¿lighteÅ¿t adverÅ¿ity, or by the Å¿malleÅ¿t oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition. Some natures are extremely Å¿ympathetic, and eaÅ¿ily moved by the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es of their fellow men; while others diÅ¿cover an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing inÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibility with regard not only to the afflictions of other perÅ¿ons, but even to their own. Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and all the gentle and amiable qualities which accompany it, peculiarly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h Å¿ome characters, while fortitude and magnanimity, and all the Å¿tern and awful virtues, are the leading fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Å¿ome elevated Å¿pirits. Not to mention the characteriÅ¿tical marks of ambition, avarice, voluptuouÅ¿neÅ¿s, indolence, or vanity, which diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ify Å¿uch a number of individuals, it is certain that the moral complexion of men is as various as their corporeal conÅ¿titution, or their mental faculties, and perhaps is greatly influenced by both.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be alledged, that theÅ¿e diÅ¿tinctions of character are entirely derived from the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of Å¿ociety, and from different opportunities of cultivation; and by no means referable to any original bent of nature. This concluÅ¿ion will not
<pb n="18"

be authoriÅ¿ed either by the inductions of reaÅ¿on, or by experience. For, in the firÅ¿t place, it is hard to be conceived how any combination of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances, or any influence of education and habit, can produce any power or propenÅ¿ity, of which the original Å¿eeds have not been dropped into the conÅ¿titution by the hand of the Creator. All that Å¿ituation and opportunity can effectuate, is to furniÅ¿h theÅ¿e inherent powers and propenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with the means of unfolding themÅ¿elves, of increaÅ¿ing in vigour, and of acquiring maturity. If they are entirely wanting, they will never be implanted by any effort of human Å¿kill, or be brought into action, by any favourable combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumÅ¿tances. If they exiÅ¿t in any degree, however Å¿mall, opportunity, exerciÅ¿e and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will advance them to a pitch of Å¿trength Å¿o greatly above their primitive condition, as will have the appearance of a real creation. If we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the fact itÅ¿elf, it muÅ¿t be evident that children and Å¿avages, who have received no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction, Å¿how varieties of character, as well as men who have enjoyed all the advantages of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed Å¿ociety, and who move in its different Å¿pheres. Although a proneneÅ¿s to imitation is univerÅ¿ally predominant in childhood, yet the manner of imitating, and the objects to which it is directed are infinitely diverÅ¿ified. As Å¿oon as the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025234_0017_0FCCAE2AB7473EC0"/>
faculties begin to unfold, all the paÅ¿Å¿ions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ities that belong to human nature impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariÅ¿e, and, according as the one or the other of theÅ¿e is moÅ¿t prevalent, characteriÅ¿tical features diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the infant. The objects that engage the attention of the Å¿avage, and the deÅ¿ires that animate his purÅ¿uits, are indeed few, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of thoÅ¿e that exiÅ¿t in more poliÅ¿hed Å¿tates of Å¿ociety. Yet, as theÅ¿e concentrate his whole Å¿oul, Å¿o they excite its energies the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully within their limited compaÅ¿s, and conÅ¿pire the more Å¿peedily to form his character. In the Å¿avage Å¿tate, the genuine impulÅ¿es and propenÅ¿ities of nature are freely allowed to appear, and, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in one point, exert themÅ¿elves with the greater vigor, and give to each individual that peculiar complexion which reÅ¿ults from the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Å¿trength of his native powers<note n="*" place="bottom">See RobertÅ¿on's HiÅ¿tory of America, and Raynal's Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿toire PhiloÅ¿ophique et Politique <hi>paÅ¿Å¿im.</hi>

which the hand of nature has impreÅ¿Å¿ed. I mean not to aÅ¿Å¿ert that thoÅ¿e diverÅ¿ities of talents and character are wholly to be aÅ¿cribed to the unaÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powers of nature, but only that they prevail in the joint proportion of theÅ¿e powers, and of the circumÅ¿tances that call them into exerciÅ¿e. As the fire will Å¿oon be extinguiÅ¿hed, if not conÅ¿tantly fed by combuÅ¿tibles, and as theÅ¿e combuÅ¿tibles, however multiplied, will not produce flame, and light, and heat, unleÅ¿s they are kindled; Å¿o the human faculties, if never called into action by correÅ¿ponding Å¿ituations, will remain torpid and inefficacious; and the moÅ¿t favourable concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of circumÅ¿tances will not produce genius, dexterity, Å¿agacity, and virtue, if the original Å¿eeds of all theÅ¿e qualities are totally wanting. Be this as it may, it is incontrovertible that there is, among the various individuals that compoÅ¿e the human Å¿pecies, an almoÅ¿t infinite diverÅ¿ity of abilities, temper, and character.</p>
               <p>From this circumÅ¿tance a natural <hi>inequality</hi> muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily ariÅ¿e. ThoÅ¿e talents and diÅ¿poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are the moÅ¿t amiable and reÅ¿pectable, directly point out their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors as the objects of love and eÅ¿teem. Wherever Å¿uch qualities appear it is as impoÅ¿Å¿ible for the human mind, unleÅ¿s it be moÅ¿t deplorably depraved, to withhold its ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025234_0019_0FCCAE2DE58550F0"/>
and affection, as it would be for any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauÅ¿e not to produce its effect when placed in circumÅ¿tances adapted to its operation. Every diÅ¿play of genius, of Å¿agacity, of penetration, and prudence, is calculated to excite the admiration of the beholders, to afford them pleaÅ¿ure, and if beneficently directed, to demand their gratitude. Fortitude, magnanimity and generoÅ¿ity, command veneration, and excite eÅ¿teem. GentleneÅ¿s, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, kindneÅ¿s, and compaÅ¿Å¿ion, appearing as the diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing features in any character, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to attract the love and complacency of all to whom they are known. Even corporeal Å¿trength and dexterity procure a certain degree of reÅ¿pect to their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors, on account of their utility in life both to others and to themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>It is equally certain, that reÅ¿pect, eÅ¿teem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and love, enÅ¿ure to thoÅ¿e who are the objects of them, a very high degree of influence over the reÅ¿t of mankind. Such will be liÅ¿tened to, imitated, and obeyed, by all who are capable of eÅ¿timating the qualities above mentioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their real merit; the luÅ¿tre which they Å¿hed around their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors dazzles thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Å¿ouls are leÅ¿s diÅ¿cerning and elevated; and even the Å¿tupid and the baÅ¿e are conÅ¿trained to pay an involuntary homage. That Å¿uch qualities are the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025234_0020_0FCCAE2EEF1B95E8"/>
only original Å¿ources of power and influence, is evident from the conduct of all who aÅ¿pire at ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring conÅ¿ideration and authority. If they want the reality, they affect the appearance of them, and, even when power alone reduces their fellow men under their Å¿ubjection, they endeavor alÅ¿o, if not Å¿tupified by the habits of tyranny, to engage their eÅ¿teem, and to captivate their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, Å¿enÅ¿ible that dominion, to which theÅ¿e give no Å¿upport, can never be Å¿ure and laÅ¿ting. I am far from aÅ¿Å¿erting that all power and diÅ¿tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are founded on this natural baÅ¿is. Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able experience proves the contrary. But, that reÅ¿pectable and amiable qualities are the primitive Å¿ources of authority and pre-eminence; and, when freely allowed to exert themÅ¿elves, cannot fail to obtain them, will be as generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as it is certain in fact<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence it is eaÅ¿y to account for monarchies having been almoÅ¿t every where the primitive form of government. As no Å¿ociety could Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t without Å¿ome directing power, and, as rude and Å¿avage men were incapable of extending their views to thoÅ¿e more complicated Å¿yÅ¿tems which obÅ¿ervation and experience alone can Å¿uggeÅ¿t and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, it was natural for them to pitch on the Å¿impleÅ¿t form, which was dictated rather by Å¿entiment, than by reaÅ¿on, and to yield that voluntary obedience to a chief, which their admiration of his Å¿uperior qualities inÅ¿pired. This Å¿imple form laÅ¿ted as long as the chief continued to diÅ¿play theÅ¿e virtues, and to apply them in Å¿uch a manner as to conciliate general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. But, as Å¿oon as oppreÅ¿Å¿ion rendered him an object of hatred, or weakneÅ¿s, an object of contempt, the evils experienced pointed out the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿ecuring the public welfare on a firmer baÅ¿is than the capricious pleaÅ¿ure of an individual; and the habits of Å¿ociety Å¿uggeÅ¿ted more complicated Å¿yÅ¿tems of government, better adapted to the grand objects of political union. Among boys at Å¿chool, one diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by his courage, his Å¿agacity, or his art, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aÅ¿Å¿umes the lead, and governs the juvenile community, with a Å¿way as deÅ¿potic as that of any eaÅ¿tern monarch. The caÅ¿e is nearly the Å¿ame in all voluntary aÅ¿Å¿ociations.</note>.</p>

We may freely aÅ¿Å¿ert, that, if any mortal conÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly excelled the reÅ¿t of mankind in every poÅ¿Å¿ible talent and quality, whether corporeal, intellectual, or moral, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hes the Å¿pecies in general, and had every poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible opportunity of diÅ¿playing this perfection in all its luÅ¿tre, he would be raiÅ¿ed, by nature herÅ¿elf, as much above the reÅ¿t of his fellow men as they are above the inferior animals, and be as clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned to lead and govern them. Or, if all the abovementioned qualities were the peculiar attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of any given number of men, theÅ¿e would be marked out, by Divine Providence, as a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ariÅ¿tocracy or Å¿enate, to preÅ¿ide over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to which they belonged.

every diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to purÅ¿ue, and, from the willing homage and obedience of the reÅ¿t of mankind, of every power to Å¿ecure, the public good. Or, laÅ¿tly, if any human being were inveÅ¿ted with Å¿uch Å¿trength and agility of body, with Å¿uch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿s of underÅ¿tanding, and with Å¿uch complete maÅ¿tery of his own paÅ¿Å¿ions, as fully to provide himÅ¿elf with every thing neceÅ¿Å¿ary for his Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or conducive to his convenience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and as neither to be expoÅ¿ed to the injuries of others, nor to be tempted to injure them, nor to be affected by their misfortunes; Å¿uch a mortal would be perfectly independent of the reÅ¿t of mankind; and as he needed nothing from them, Å¿o he would, in no reÅ¿pect whatever, be their debtor.</p>
               <p>But Å¿uch characters as thoÅ¿e above deÅ¿cribed have never yet exiÅ¿ted in the world, and indeed never can exiÅ¿t. Such an aÅ¿Å¿emblage of perfection is not human, but divine.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IF we conÅ¿ider the various talents and modes of excellence of which the human Å¿pecies is capable, we Å¿hall acknowledge that neither all theÅ¿e, nor any conÅ¿iderable number of them, have ever been found united in any one individual; nay, that the higheÅ¿t degrees of many of them are incompatible with each other. For, when diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed honors, or extenÅ¿ive reputation, are acquired by illuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities, we are not thence to infer that the perÅ¿ons, to whom theÅ¿e diÅ¿tinctions are allotted, Å¿urpaÅ¿s the reÅ¿t of mankind in every quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Å¿pecies; but only that they have attained Å¿uperiority in Å¿uch, as being more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, are, on that account, more admired. ThoÅ¿e mechanical arts and inferior virtues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which human Å¿ociety could not Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, attract no admiration, becauÅ¿e they are daily exhibited.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025234_0024_0FCCAE34ED138918"/>
Yet the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious of mankind Å¿tand more in need of the benefits which theÅ¿e afford, than their diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed abilities can confer on the humble poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors of the former. As thoÅ¿e endowed with the qualities moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary in human life, but of inferior eÅ¿timation, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as are diÅ¿play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mechanical labour and art, cannot, from their occupations themÅ¿elves, aÅ¿pire at the Å¿ublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more elegant abilities which diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h others; theÅ¿e, on the other hand, muÅ¿t remain deÅ¿titute of the more uÅ¿eful ones. That leiÅ¿ure, meditation, and Å¿tudy, without which the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mind cannot be perfected, neceÅ¿Å¿arily prevent that full exerciÅ¿e of the corporeal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which enÅ¿ures their higheÅ¿t vigour and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A fancy uncommonly lively and bright is adverÅ¿e to the patient and accurate reÅ¿earches of philoÅ¿ophy, and to the juÅ¿t application of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, in the diÅ¿covery and developement of truth, and the improvement of Å¿cience. That minute attention to calculation, that arithmetical exactneÅ¿s, and that conÅ¿tant obÅ¿ervance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varying routine of buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, which are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to mercantile and oeconomical purÅ¿uits, but which preÅ¿ent no imagery to the mind, are inauÅ¿picious to the more elegant enjoyments of taÅ¿te, and to the cultivation of the fine arts. The Å¿tern and awful virtues Å¿eldom aÅ¿Å¿ociate with the gentle and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025234_0025_0FCCAE366BED8F48"/>
amiable, and, claiming reÅ¿pect and veneration, Å¿eem to diÅ¿dain complacency and love. Even Å¿ome corporeal perfections appear repugnant to others. The moÅ¿t robuÅ¿t conformation of the members, and the Å¿trength it produces, are not eaÅ¿ily united with great agility, and with delicate refinement in the organs of Å¿enÅ¿e. In a word, it appears to be the intention of nature, that, although the human faculties are various, and capable of being carried to amazing heights of excellence; yet this Å¿hould Å¿eldom be accompliÅ¿hed, unleÅ¿s when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common culture and improvement are beÅ¿towed on Å¿ome particular faculty, or at leaÅ¿t, on a few faculties which have a peculiar native Å¿trength.</p>
               <p>Variety of talents is, therefore, more applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Å¿pecies than to individuals. The Å¿eeds of each (as we have above obÅ¿erved) are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, caÅ¿t into every individual conÅ¿titution, but the Å¿oil is differently adapted to them, and that particular power to which it is favourable, Å¿prings up, and, if properly cultivated, comes to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Å¿preads around its branches, and bears abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fruit. It may be objected, that it Å¿eems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prepoÅ¿terous to Å¿uppoÅ¿e the creator implanting in any conÅ¿titution the principles of powers, which were never deÅ¿igned to come to maturity. But, let it be conÅ¿idered that, as the different improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025234_0026_0FCCAE387319A658"/>
of men depend on various occurrences, and, as mentioned above, the characteriÅ¿tical qualities of each individual will be in the united degree of their primitive Å¿trength, and of the opportunities of culture; it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the Å¿eeds of each Å¿hould be dropped into every human frame, Å¿o that, when favourable circumÅ¿tances concurred, that power which they were beÅ¿t calculated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove might Å¿pring up and flouriÅ¿h, and thus as much human excellence might, on the whole, be produced as the human condition would admit. This was, moreover, neceÅ¿Å¿ary in order to conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that general Å¿imilarity which characteriÅ¿es the Å¿pecies, and unites them together in the bonds of a common nature.</p>
               <p>Be this as it may, it is undoubted that thoÅ¿e who aim at diÅ¿tinction, or even at moderate degrees of excellence in a great variety of objects, generally exhibit a ridiculous figure; after having waÅ¿ted their time, exhauÅ¿ted their powers, and Å¿uperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on their minds habits of inconÅ¿tancy and fickleneÅ¿s. Even the greateÅ¿t genuiÅ¿es, when they leave that particular track, in which indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nature had provided them with unfading lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and endeavour to invade the province, and and Å¿natch the rewards of others, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, on the one hand, the moÅ¿t aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing inÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025234_0027_0FCCAE397086C290"/>
of the Å¿trength of the human mind, afford, on the other, no leÅ¿s convincing proofs of its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and vanity<note n="*" place="bottom">This might be illuÅ¿trated by many examples of a fooliÅ¿h affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of univerÅ¿ality of genius.</note>. Hence the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual devoting himÅ¿elf to Å¿ome favourite and uÅ¿eful purÅ¿uit, to which every other Å¿hould be Å¿ubÅ¿ervient, and of applying to the diligent diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of that department in which he can produce the greateÅ¿t benefit to mankind, and acquire the greateÅ¿t honour to himÅ¿elf.</p>
               <p>From what has been Å¿aid in this and the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chapter, it appears, in the <hi>firÅ¿t</hi> place, That nature herÅ¿elf has eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed clear and certain diÅ¿tinctions among men, in the various qualities allotted to each individual, and in the various op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities furniÅ¿hed them in the courÅ¿e of life for their improvement. TheÅ¿e opportunities may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, though in inferior degrees, in the rudeÅ¿t as well as in the moÅ¿t poliÅ¿hed Å¿tates of Å¿ociety. It is evident, <hi>Å¿econdly,</hi> That theÅ¿e diÅ¿tinctions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not the perfection of all the human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but the Å¿ingular excellence of one, or of a few of them, conÅ¿picuous in individuals.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FROM the two facts eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion of the laÅ¿t chapter, duly conÅ¿idered, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me that the juÅ¿t notion of the natural equality of all mankind, as far as relates to their mutual duties, is to be derived; and that, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paradoxical it may Å¿eem, an <hi>equality</hi> the moÅ¿t exact and perfect, in reÅ¿pect of every moral and Å¿ocial obligation, Å¿prings from <hi>inequality</hi> itÅ¿elf.</p>
               <p>Human nature is evidently endowed with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of appetites and deÅ¿ires, adapted to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects which are capable of Å¿upplying its wants, or of furniÅ¿hing it with pleaÅ¿ures. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Å¿tands in need of conÅ¿tant Å¿upport, which is not to be procured without conÅ¿iderable art and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This art and labour muÅ¿t be greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, if not only the neceÅ¿Å¿aries, but alÅ¿o the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and elegancies of life are deÅ¿ired, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025234_0029_0FCCAE3CB42B4150"/>
the refinements of Å¿enÅ¿e conÅ¿idered as objects of purÅ¿uit. The Å¿enÅ¿es are not only inlets of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures merely corporeal, but of others alÅ¿o of a more refined and delicate kind, of which the mind under the influence of fancy, is the chief percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Hence they open a very extenÅ¿ive field of human enjoyment, and claim the whole compaÅ¿s of nature to adminiÅ¿ter materials for the fine arts. The mind of man is eagerly deÅ¿irous of knowledge, and wiÅ¿hes to diÅ¿cover the relations, the cauÅ¿es and the effects, of the various objects that are preÅ¿ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. Not only corporeal wants and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, the Å¿enÅ¿es of beauty, of harmony, and of magnificence, and the love of knowledge, Å¿ubject man to neceÅ¿Å¿ities, which muÅ¿t be Å¿upplied, or offer to him pleaÅ¿ures which he cannot but deÅ¿ire; he is alÅ¿o actuated by various affections, Å¿ome Å¿elfiÅ¿h and Å¿ome benevolent, which Å¿erve as conÅ¿tant Å¿purs to action, and impel him into various tracks, according to the different complexions of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Such is the nature of man; and from what has been Å¿aid above, as well as from other conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on which I Å¿hall Å¿lightly touch, it is evident, that each individual is inÅ¿ufficient, not only for his own perfection, but even for the Å¿upply of his moÅ¿t urgent neceÅ¿Å¿ities. The other animals are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025234_0030_0FCCAE3DEB396248"/>
by nature provided with defence and covering, with Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence and Å¿helter. They Å¿oon attain the full vigour and the complete exerciÅ¿e of their powers, and, without inÅ¿truction or Å¿uccour, can apply them with certainty to their reÅ¿pective ends. But man, as he enters into the world naked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleÅ¿s, and unprovided with Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence, Å¿o, without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and co-operation of his Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he muÅ¿t ever remain in the moÅ¿t abject and comfortleÅ¿s condition. The inclemency of the Å¿eaÅ¿ons, the Å¿terility of the earth, the ferocity of Å¿avage animals, his natural imbecility, oppoÅ¿e to his comfortable exiÅ¿tence Å¿o many and Å¿o powerful obÅ¿tacles, as he could never expect of himÅ¿elf to Å¿urmount. He is aÅ¿Å¿ailed by evils which he cannot repel, Å¿ubject to wants which he cannot Å¿upply, and Å¿urrounded by objects which he cannot, by his own Å¿trength, convert to his uÅ¿e. DeÅ¿tined for Å¿ociety, he is immediately thrown on its care, and bound by his own weakneÅ¿s, to contribute to its Å¿trength. DeÅ¿igned to form the moÅ¿t intimate union with his fellow men, he is conÅ¿tituted miÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and deÅ¿titute without them; but, conÅ¿trained by this circumÅ¿tance, to join his efforts to theirs, he derives the moÅ¿t aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing acquired power from his natural imbecility. FurniÅ¿hed with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities greatly Å¿uperior to inÅ¿tinct, he at firÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿es them in a manner greatly below it; and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025234_0031_0FCCAE3F6C19D738"/>
formed for infinite improvement, he proceeds from the Å¿malleÅ¿t beginnings; but can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin nor proceed without the co-operation of his fellow men.</p>
               <p>What multiplication of ingenuity, what combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of induÅ¿try, what concurrence of different abilities, are requiÅ¿ite not only to carry to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but even to invent and exerciÅ¿e, with any tolerable degree of dexterity, thoÅ¿e mechanical arts and employments, which exalt the citizen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Å¿avage, which Å¿weeten and embelliÅ¿h Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial life, which furniÅ¿h all that variety of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and pleaÅ¿ure we daily behold and enjoy, and which, from the moÅ¿t helpleÅ¿s of the animal creation, render man the lord of the world. Will the foreÅ¿t be felled and moulded into furniture, the quarry be dug and poliÅ¿hed into materials for building, the marÅ¿h drained and converted into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable land, the overflowing river confined to its proper channel, the inferior creatures conÅ¿trained to Å¿uccour human weakneÅ¿s by their Å¿uperior Å¿trength, or their Å¿poils be manufactured into clothing; will the Å¿uperfluities of one country Å¿upply the deficiencies of another, and navigation unite the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant regions by the mutual and permanent ties of beneficial commerce; will all this, and much more, which I forbear to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025234_0032_0FCCAE411E8B2338"/>
be accompliÅ¿hed without the united and juÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regulated efforts of the human Å¿pecies, and the equal application of the talents of each to the common intereÅ¿t<note n="*" place="bottom">See Smith's Wealth of Nations, Book 1.</note>? Will the Å¿ecret Å¿prings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be explored, and the laws, which Å¿he obÅ¿erves through all her different provinces, be inveÅ¿tiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unleÅ¿s time and opportunity are furniÅ¿hed to the acute and the ingenious, by means of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence provided for them, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and induÅ¿try of thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e faculties are leÅ¿s refined and exalted?</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that, as each individual is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inÅ¿ufficient for his own happineÅ¿s, Å¿o he muÅ¿t depend, in a great meaÅ¿ure, on the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of others for its attainment; and that however much any one may contribute to the benefit of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men, by the excellence and Å¿plendour of his abilities, whether nutural or acquired, he derives from them as much as he can beÅ¿tow, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much more than he gives.</p>
               <p>If the union of all, then, be neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Å¿uÅ¿tenance, the convenience and the happineÅ¿s of each individual, and each individual can, in his turn, contribute conÅ¿iderably to the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025234_0033_0FCCAE426D0CBAE8"/>
it follows, as a neceÅ¿Å¿ary conÅ¿equence of this determination of nature, that order and Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination muÅ¿t be introduced, by which the different members of the community may have their proper taÅ¿ks allotted to them, the talents of each be directed to their proper objects, injuÅ¿tice and violence be reÅ¿trained, and as great a Å¿um of common felicity be produced, as the condition of humanity will permit. Hence, new channels are cut out for abilities, namely, thoÅ¿e which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ed in offices of power and authority. As rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, however, loudly dictates the inÅ¿titution of theÅ¿e for the common good of the human race; Å¿o Å¿he requires that they fall to the lot of thoÅ¿e who are qualified to diÅ¿charge them. When this actually takes place, the order of nature is obÅ¿erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all its happy conÅ¿equences enÅ¿ue. When this order is overturned, and the different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Å¿ociety, but eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t dignity and uÅ¿e, are committed to Å¿uch as are incapable of diÅ¿charging the duties of them, all the diÅ¿mal effects of folly, injuÅ¿tice, and confuÅ¿ion, are Å¿pread through the whole of the Å¿ocial frame, and the evils of that inequality, which the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and blindneÅ¿s of mankind have introduced, are Å¿everely felt. When the talents and merits of men are allowed their free courÅ¿e, are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fair field for their exerciÅ¿e, and are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025234_0034_0FCCAE44B2716BF0"/>
of thoÅ¿e rewards which are by nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, there never can be any ground to complain of inequality among men. For, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unequal their abilities and opportunities may be in themÅ¿elves, the moÅ¿t perfect equality exiÅ¿ts in the diÅ¿tribution of the rewards and advantages annexed to each by the conÅ¿titution of nature. The good effects of univerÅ¿al induÅ¿try, and the proper application of the powers of every individual, Å¿o as to produce the greateÅ¿t good upon the whole, are then felt through all the Å¿ocial body. Every perÅ¿on poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es that degree of wealth, of conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and of honour, to which he is entitled by his honeÅ¿t induÅ¿try, or by his Å¿ervices to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. The active and noble minded exert all their powers for the common welfare, in the moÅ¿t effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious and illuÅ¿trious manner. The indolent and Å¿elfiÅ¿h are conÅ¿trained, by the indigence and contempt into which they muÅ¿t otherwiÅ¿e fall, to contribute their Å¿hare to it. But, when power and riches are employed to fruÅ¿trate virtue of the reÅ¿pect which is its due, abilities, of the diÅ¿tinction and influence which they juÅ¿tly claim, and honeÅ¿t induÅ¿try, of its natural fruits, a moÅ¿t Å¿hocking <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality</hi> takes place, which can only Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the moÅ¿t odious tyranny. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as this oppreÅ¿Å¿ion prevails, which throws the principal advantages of Å¿ociety into
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025234_0035_0FCCAE46493B6F10"/>
the hands of a few, by no means the moÅ¿t reÅ¿pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of its members, and renders it a patrimony and inheritance, of which they may diÅ¿poÅ¿e at pleaÅ¿ure, Å¿ociety is corrupted and miÅ¿erable. In proportion as that equality is maintained, which the Creator has eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, and which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, not in all the members of the Å¿ocial body being placed on a level, but in mutual dependence and parity of obligation among all, amidÅ¿t a variety of diÅ¿tinctions, conditions, and ranks, Å¿ociety is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, free, and flouriÅ¿hing, Å¿ecuring to each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual the full enjoyment of all his natural advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, enÅ¿uring to the public the complete product of the efforts of all well directed and juÅ¿tly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined; uniting all the members of the Å¿ocial body by the ties of mutual intereÅ¿t and benevolence, and preÅ¿erving as much liberty as is conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with civil union.</p>
               <p>In Å¿uch a happy Å¿tate of things, whatever forms of Å¿ubordination may exiÅ¿t, as there is a mutual dependence among all the parts of the Å¿ocial body; Å¿o there is not the Å¿malleÅ¿t ground for pride and inÅ¿olence, on the one hand, or for degradation and debaÅ¿ement of Å¿entiment, on the other. Are any exalted above others by the Å¿uperiority of their mental powers, they are inferior to them in other qualities, which are abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025234_0036_0FCCAE47F9A4D9E8"/>
Å¿upport and convenience of life. If one excels in uÅ¿eful qualities, another is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and Å¿hining ones; and, as pleaÅ¿ure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utility, is pernicious, Å¿o utility, without pleaÅ¿ure, becomes languid and inÅ¿ipid. If one is exalted to power, or illuÅ¿trious by fame, thoÅ¿e who faithfully diÅ¿charge the duties of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obÅ¿cure Å¿tation, enable him to fulfil the duties of his more conÅ¿picuous one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his exaltation, by occupying thoÅ¿e parts of the general Å¿yÅ¿tem, without which the higher orders could not Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, and by paying him that deference and reÅ¿pect to which his merit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled. If one is eminent by his wiÅ¿dom and Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, by his genius and wit, by his knowledge and erudition; another is no leÅ¿s diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by his activity and Å¿trength, by his Å¿kill and dexterity, by his induÅ¿try and labour. If one is venerable by his elevation of Å¿oul, by his generoÅ¿ity, public Å¿pirit, and intrepidity; another is amiable by his gentleneÅ¿s and complaiÅ¿ance, by his patience, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿ty, and meekneÅ¿s; and, if the former qualities are the ornaments, the latter are the great Å¿weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of life, while both, operating in conjunction, Å¿upply mutual defects, and impart mutual Å¿trength and imbelliÅ¿hment. If thoÅ¿e who fill the higher Å¿tations in a becoming manner, confer the greateÅ¿t benefits on their fellow men, they are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025234_0037_0FCCAE49304F8208"/>
to them for their Å¿upport. If the latter Å¿tand in need of the judgment and penetration of the former; in order to deviÅ¿e the beÅ¿t plans of proÅ¿ecuting the public good, and of maintaining the general Å¿afety; theÅ¿e, again, Å¿tand in need of their reÅ¿olution and diligence to carry their plans into execution. If Å¿ome contribute to the inÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and improvement of their fellow men, by teaching and illuÅ¿trating the grand principles of virtue, on which the welfare of Å¿ociety is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally founded, thoÅ¿e who enjoy the benefit of their inÅ¿tructions, turn them to their profit, by practiÅ¿ing towards them the virtues which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate. If one claÅ¿s of men maintain good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and peace, and another exerciÅ¿e all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and uÅ¿eful arts of Å¿ocial life, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who Å¿ecure theÅ¿e enjoyments and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againÅ¿t external invaÅ¿ion, and offer their blood as their contribution to the common intereÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>As, in the human body, therefore, the welfare of the whole depends upon that of each individual member, and that again is neceÅ¿Å¿arily affected by whatever affects the whole Å¿yÅ¿tem; and there is thus a mutual dependence and Å¿ympathy among all the parts; Å¿o, in Å¿ociety, every individual having a particular portion of talents, and, if properly placed, a particular Å¿tation, conformable to this,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025234_0038_0FCCAE4B41A5E7D0"/>
allotted to him, becomes neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the welfare of the whole community, and as he affects, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e affected by, its proÅ¿perity or detriment. All are united by mutual dependence and Å¿upport: Break but one link of the chain, and the reÅ¿t are of no uÅ¿e, or, at leaÅ¿t, are deprived of much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and comfort, which is enjoyed when the Å¿ocial Å¿eries is complete.</p>
               <p>Nor ought it to be alledged, that many of thoÅ¿e wants, which cannot be Å¿upplied but in Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, are not the wants of nature, but are merely adventitious, and generated in that Å¿ociety, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of which they are produced to prove. We readily grant that, in refined and highly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed Å¿tates of civilized life, where luxury has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverÅ¿ally diffuÅ¿ed its effeminating influence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wants and deÅ¿ires are generated, which are not only not agreeable to nature, but repugnant to human perfection and felicity. Let it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be obÅ¿erved, that this pernicious tendency to human happineÅ¿s begins by looÅ¿ening thoÅ¿e ties which knit men moÅ¿t firmly together. It is Å¿elfiÅ¿h, not Å¿ocial, enjoyments which are moÅ¿t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e to him an perfection, and man begins to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his own happineÅ¿s, by Å¿eparating it from the general good. It is undoubted that all the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers of human nature are carried to the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025234_0039_0FCCAE4C2D9DDF28"/>
higheÅ¿t perfection in Å¿ociety, and droop and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h in Å¿olitude. That Å¿tate, Å¿urely, which is moÅ¿t perfective of every human faculty, is the moÅ¿t <hi>natural,</hi> and it is only by the Å¿trangeÅ¿t perverÅ¿ion of terms and ideas that the contrary can be aÅ¿Å¿ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the perfection of the Å¿ocial Å¿tate cannot be attained, without the mutual dependence of mankind, in that extenÅ¿ive Å¿enÅ¿e in which I have exhibited it. That dependence is, therefore, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the conÅ¿titution of nature itÅ¿elf.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER IV. FINAL CAUSES</hi> of the <hi>VARIETY</hi> of <hi>HUMAN TALENTS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is evidently the intention of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in beÅ¿towing upon different perÅ¿ons different powers and abilities, to point them out for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Å¿tations and circumÅ¿tances, to aÅ¿Å¿ign to them different duties and taÅ¿ks, and thus to promote moÅ¿t effectually the welfare of the human Å¿pecies. By this Å¿cheme, it is unqueÅ¿tionable, many more advantages are obtained, with regard to the beÅ¿t intereÅ¿ts of mankind, than could have been Å¿ecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diÅ¿penÅ¿ing the Å¿ame portion of ability and virtue, that diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hes our Å¿pecies, on any other plan whatever. For every particular talent is thus cultivated with greater Å¿ucceÅ¿s, when it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies the conÅ¿tant and habitual attention of its poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or, than it could have been if he had been overloaded with a multiplicity of employments, or diÅ¿tracted by the exerciÅ¿e of various abilities. A greater Å¿um of excellence is thus produced in the Å¿pecies, and, of conÅ¿equence, its perfection and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025234_0041_0FCCAE4FB9FDC788"/>
happineÅ¿s is more effectually promoted. By this plan of diÅ¿tribution, moreover, opportunities are afforded for the exerciÅ¿e of many virtues, which could not have otherwiÅ¿e exiÅ¿ted. Thus, were all equally wiÅ¿e and learned, no opportunity could be afforded for diÅ¿playing either a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative or a docile diÅ¿poÅ¿ition. Were all equally rich, or equally powerful, neither generoÅ¿ity nor gratitude could be excited; and, as there could be no demand for Å¿uccour and protection, on the one hand, Å¿o, on the other, there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion for condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion and Å¿ympathy. Finally, mankind by being rendered abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to each other, are conÅ¿trained to maintain a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intercourÅ¿e of good offices; and Å¿ociety is thus united by the firmeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t laÅ¿ting bonds.</p>
               <p>In fact, this diverÅ¿ity of talents and virtues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the chief circumÅ¿tance which qualifies men for a Å¿ocial and political exiÅ¿tence. Were all endowed with the Å¿ame definite portion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of whatever kind, to what purpoÅ¿e would men aÅ¿Å¿ociate, Å¿ince they would derive little more from their union than they individually poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed? An accumulation of mere Å¿trength would be the only effect of combined powers, in the Å¿ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Å¿ix horÅ¿es can draw a greater weight, and to a greater diÅ¿tance, than two. This diverÅ¿ity of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025234_0042_0FCCAE50B0E34A10"/>
abilities, by rendering mankind mutually depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from their detached weakneÅ¿s, becomes the Å¿trongeÅ¿t motive to aÅ¿Å¿ociation, the moÅ¿t powerful bond of Å¿ociety, and its greateÅ¿t excellence and perfection, when it is properly arranged. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, and on the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition that the Å¿ame Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific qualities were, as in the brutes, allotted to each individual, a more perfect <hi>equality</hi> would indeed be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed among all the members of the Å¿pecies; but it would be an <hi>equality</hi> uÅ¿eleÅ¿s for every purpoÅ¿e of aÅ¿Å¿ociation, and would Å¿erve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Å¿eparate than to unite them. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance I am inclined to think, has not hitherto been Å¿ufficiently conÅ¿idered, at leaÅ¿t not in the light in which I have repreÅ¿ented it. In this light, thoÅ¿e pleas of Å¿uperior wiÅ¿dom, or of Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power, which AriÅ¿totle*, and Å¿ome late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who appear not very favourable to the cauÅ¿e of equal freedom, have urged as the foundations of the dominion of one part of mankind over the reÅ¿t, are deÅ¿titute of all force. For, if theÅ¿e pleas Å¿hould be admitted, even in their utmoÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they will furniÅ¿h no ground for independent dominion and Å¿uperiority, unleÅ¿s it can be proved, at the Å¿ame time, that the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors of theÅ¿e qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are equally endowed with every other which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary or conducive to human felicity. Should
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025234_0043_0FCCAE52E1875FC0"/>
the wiÅ¿dom and the Å¿trength (as is commonly the caÅ¿e) be found indifferent Å¿ubjects, it will remain to be decided to which the Å¿uperiority is to be aÅ¿Å¿ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what particular degree of each of theÅ¿e qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to conÅ¿titute a rightful claim. Art and ingenuity may likewiÅ¿e Å¿uppoÅ¿e themÅ¿elves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to Å¿ome portion of dominion, Å¿ince it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted that their influence is very conÅ¿iderable in the affairs of life. In this manner, every thing is thrown into confuÅ¿ion, and no clear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>right</hi> is any where left. But, by the view we have taken of the Å¿ubject, (which will, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myÅ¿elf, be found to be the true one) every man acquires a clear and definite claim according to the portion he contributes to the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, a moÅ¿t Å¿alutary <hi>equality</hi> is Å¿till left among mankind, and the community is knit together by ties which cannot be diÅ¿Å¿olved, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction of general and particular happineÅ¿s. In a word, the Å¿lighteÅ¿t contemplation of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture convinces us that man is deÅ¿igned by his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator for Å¿ociety, and, as this was his deÅ¿tination, he is Å¿o conÅ¿tituted as to be impelled towards it by all his propenÅ¿ities and powers, and linked to it by all his wants and enjoyments, with whatever abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities he may be endowed, or in whatever Å¿tation he may be placed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FROM what has been already Å¿aid, it will now Å¿ufficiently appear, that the moÅ¿t perfect equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of obligation, of benefits received and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts among all the members of Å¿ociety, of whatever denomination or degree, who faithfully diÅ¿charge their duties; that that dependence, which the proud and the powerful are fain to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to one Å¿phere and Å¿tation, runs through all alike, and that independence, at which all aÅ¿pire, is no where to be found among men. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though any human being Å¿hould be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of every imaginable perfection and advantage; yet while he lives in Å¿ociety, and abundantly Å¿atisfies all his Å¿ocial propenÅ¿ities, from which the Å¿ublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ures of human nature are derived, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from mankind Å¿uch an ample portion of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025234_0045_0FCCAE552EAF0108"/>
that he is bound to compenÅ¿ate it by every return, which the utmoÅ¿t exertion of his abilities can enable him to make. From his elevated Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority he is thus obliged to deÅ¿cend to the <hi>equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of a citizen, and of a man.</p>
               <p>In the eye of reaÅ¿on, therefore, and of the UniverÅ¿al Parent, every honeÅ¿t Å¿tation of life is equally honourable, Å¿ince they are all but parts of the great Å¿ocial body which his wiÅ¿dom has planned, and his power preÅ¿erves. In this view, no human creature is more or leÅ¿s worthy than another, but in as far as he diÅ¿charges or neglects the part allotted to him, and augments or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hes the Å¿um of general felicity; or as he occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies a place which he is incapable of filling, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives others of their juÅ¿t Å¿tation, Å¿natches, from them the rewards to which they are entitled, or prevents them from performing the duties of the Å¿tation in which they are placed, and of the Å¿phere in which they move.</p>
               <p>The principles above eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed are widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoÅ¿e which pride and tyranny em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and inculcate. If men are endowed with Å¿uperior abilities, or raiÅ¿ed to an exalted Å¿tation, they will not eaÅ¿ily admit that, between them and their inferiors, the dependence and the obligation
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025234_0046_0FCCAE56AB292220"/>
are reciprocal. UnleÅ¿s they are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by peculiar generoÅ¿ity of Å¿entiment, they will conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as no very pleaÅ¿ing doctrine that, between the Å¿overeign and the Å¿ubject, the magiÅ¿trate and the people, the great and the mean, the rich and the poor, the acute and the dull, the learned and the ignorant, there is no difference but in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of different powers, and in the diÅ¿charge of different offices peculiar to each capacity, and uÅ¿eful to all; and that, if the firÅ¿t have a juÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on the Å¿econd for Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion and obedience, for honour and reÅ¿pect, for convenience and eaÅ¿e, the Å¿econd have as juÅ¿t a claim on them for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence, for the adminiÅ¿tration of juÅ¿tice, and the preÅ¿ervation of equal liberty, for the Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of their wants and the relief of their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, for inÅ¿truction and good example. Pride and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny would place, on the one Å¿ide, all honour and reÅ¿pect, and nothing but diÅ¿regard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, on the other; here, all oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and there, all patience and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion; here, all convenience and pleaÅ¿ure, and there, all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and indigence; here, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ãâã</desc>
                  </gap> have the Å¿mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to be conÅ¿idered as an eternal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there, the greateÅ¿t Å¿ervices to paÅ¿s for indiÅ¿penÅ¿ible duties. With Å¿uch Å¿entiments, it is no wonder that the mutual dependence and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of men Å¿hould be rejected as a dangerous
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025234_0047_0FCCAE5834E35268"/>
and odious doctrine, equally Å¿ubverÅ¿ive of public order, and of private right. ThoÅ¿e who think and act in this manner, either making no returns for the benefits they receive from Å¿ociety, or poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing no capacity to make them, are eager to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ent every notion of mutual obligation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality among men, as imaginary and preÅ¿umptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to oblige the world to look on them as its eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed lords. But Å¿uch opinions can never retain their influence, when knowledge has begun to make any progreÅ¿s, and mankind to underÅ¿tand their own nature and dignity. The bodies of men can never be enÅ¿laved, when their minds are free; and the moÅ¿t diligent care of all deÅ¿pots, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rank or denomination, ever has been, and ever muÅ¿t be, to keep mankind in ignorance. As Å¿oon as knowledge diffuÅ¿es her light over the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in which they are inchained, the doors are thrown open, and their chains fall off. In fact, pride and tyranny, by deÅ¿troying that mutual obligation, and that juÅ¿t equality which we have now eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, Å¿ap the very pillars which Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port greatneÅ¿s and diÅ¿play Å¿plendour. For, if there is no mutual obligation, no parity of right, then power, on the one hand, and weakneÅ¿s on the other, are the only bonds of Å¿ocial or civil uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is eaÅ¿y to Å¿ee where, in Å¿uch circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the greateÅ¿t power will be found; whether
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025234_0048_0FCCAE59A97284F8"/>
in the hands of the poor, the mean, the illiterate; or in thoÅ¿e of the rich, the great, the learned, and the ingenious. But if the grand principle of <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of obligation, and of mutual dependence, is adopted in opinion, as it is eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in nature, if Å¿tations and offices are neither unjuÅ¿tly uÅ¿urped, nor their duties perfidiouÅ¿ly and weakly performed, the obligation to obedience and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion is as Å¿trong on inferiors, as that of juÅ¿tice and diÅ¿inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ted zeal for the public good is on rulers and magiÅ¿trates; and the honor obtained by diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed abilities is equally due to their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors, as the fruits of their honeÅ¿t labour are due to the lower orders of the community. This principle places the fabric of Å¿ociety on a firm and laÅ¿ting foundation, and all the parts of the building, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever different in point of Å¿plendour and ornament, are Å¿o cloÅ¿ely connected, and Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the whole, that none of them can be removed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, without injuring the beauty or the Å¿olidity of the Å¿tructure. This equally balances all the parts and members of the Å¿ocial body, makes pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence itÅ¿elf emerge from common intereÅ¿t, and again depreÅ¿Å¿es that Å¿eparate independence which pre-eminence would aÅ¿Å¿ume, by referring it to that collective power from which it is wholly derived. A conÅ¿tant balance, and reaction of obligation and duty, is thus maintained through all the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025234_0049_0FCCAE5B2B8451E0"/>
of Å¿ociety, Å¿imilar to what we obÅ¿erve in nature. As exhalations and vapours from the ocean and the lower parts of the earth, reÅ¿ting on the tops of mountains, form the Å¿prings whence are derived the rivers that water and fertilize the different regions of the globe, and return at laÅ¿t into the ocean, and thus a conÅ¿tant circulation is maintained; Å¿o the more elevated Å¿phere of Å¿ocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty derive their political exiÅ¿tence and energy from the general maÅ¿s, and, if properly filled, diffuÅ¿e through the whole Å¿ocial body a Å¿alutary influence, which again Å¿erves to maintain their dignity and Å¿plendour. The individuals that occupy theÅ¿e Å¿pheres, detached from Å¿ociety, and conÅ¿idered merely as individuals of the human race, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to no diÅ¿tinction or Å¿uperiority, but what ariÅ¿es from corporeal or mental qualities, which are the diÅ¿tinctions of nature. But, viewed in their connection with the political body, they claim their pre-eminence and power, on the Å¿ame principle by which Å¿ociety is held together, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the general good muÅ¿t limit the pretenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of individuals.</p>
               <p>This is that <hi>equality</hi> of mankind, which has been Å¿o often aÅ¿Å¿erted, but is Å¿eldom well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿toodâan <hi>equality</hi> which the proud and tyrannical diÅ¿dain, becauÅ¿e it oppoÅ¿es their Å¿elfiÅ¿hneÅ¿s or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolenceâan
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025234_0050_0FCCAE5D79C52770"/>
                  <hi>equality</hi> which turbulent and deÅ¿ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men are fain to abuÅ¿e as an engine for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning regularity and government, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing that anarchy in the midÅ¿t of which they themÅ¿elves are to riÅ¿e. It is an <hi>equality</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Å¿ubordinationâan <hi>equality</hi> of wants, with a diverÅ¿ity of means of Å¿upplying themâan <hi>equality</hi> of obligation, with different modes of diÅ¿charging it. It is an <hi>equality</hi> which, by rendering all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceÅ¿Å¿ary, makes all, who faithfully diÅ¿charge their duties, equally honourable in the Å¿ight of God; but, by requiring higher and lower Å¿tations, and various diÅ¿tinctions and Å¿pheres, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes different degrees of reÅ¿pectability and honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. It is an <hi>equality</hi> which degrades none but the tyrant, the ruffian, the thief, the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, and the Å¿luggard; and exalts all, but theÅ¿e, to the ennobling dignity of conÅ¿tituent members of the grand community of mankind, and of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low labourers with God in advancing the felicity of his moral and intellectual creation.</p>
               <p>Not leÅ¿s abÅ¿urd, than pernicious, therefore, is that levelling notion, which confounds all diÅ¿tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ranks, annihilates Å¿ubordination, and deÅ¿troys that juÅ¿t <hi>equality</hi> which is founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in human happineÅ¿s. While this fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic opinion is directly contrary to the appointment
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025234_0051_0FCCAE5EE9951888"/>
of God in the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of Å¿ociety, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deÅ¿tructive in its conÅ¿equences, it commonly tends, like every other extravagant and vicious paÅ¿Å¿ion, to fruÅ¿trate its own gratification. Taking <hi>licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s</hi> for <hi>liberty,</hi> it becomes the greateÅ¿t promoter of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m. For, as nothing has brought religion more into diÅ¿repute, than bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, fanaticiÅ¿m, and hypocriÅ¿y, which have Å¿o of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aÅ¿Å¿umed that venerable and Å¿acred name; and as nothing has brought Å¿o much diÅ¿grace on philoÅ¿ophy, both in ancient and modern times, as the profligate lives of pretended philoÅ¿ophers; Å¿o <hi>licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s,</hi> appearing under the diÅ¿guiÅ¿e of <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> has a direct tendency to render it either odious or contemptible. The tyrannical oppreÅ¿Å¿ors of their fellow men, and their Å¿ervile abettors, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly lay hold of the horrid exceÅ¿Å¿es which licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouÅ¿neÅ¿s produces, and at which they Å¿ecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, as infidels delight in the corruptions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; paint them with the deepeÅ¿t colours of an inflamed imagination; and aÅ¿cribe them with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to thoÅ¿e principles of true liberty, to which they are Å¿o repugnant in their origin, and Å¿o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious in their conÅ¿equences. The ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, incapable of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing appearances from realities, haÅ¿tily admit both the aÅ¿Å¿ertion and its inference, and Å¿eek refuge from arnarchy in the chains of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m. The wiÅ¿e, however and the

good, will equally guard againÅ¿t the wild decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the demagogue, and the crafty inÅ¿inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the tyrant, will hold faÅ¿t thoÅ¿e eternal principles of equity which God has impreÅ¿Å¿ed on their Å¿ouls, and, if they cannot evince their truth, or inculcate their practice, on mankind, will deplore the blindneÅ¿s and the corruption of their Å¿pecies, and pray that the Father of light may at laÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold a day of knowledge and Å¿erenity, when the benignant voice of truth Å¿hall neither be Å¿tifled by the mandate of tyranny, nor drowned by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of tumult, when the power of oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion Å¿hall be extinguiÅ¿hed together with the deÅ¿ire of it; when freedom Å¿hall be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed on the baÅ¿is of Å¿ubordination, and Å¿ecured by obedience to law; when men Å¿hall be attached to juÅ¿tice by the permanent bleÅ¿Å¿ings of Å¿ecurity and peace.</p>

               <p>HAVING, in the preceding Chapters, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chief foundation on which it may be aÅ¿Å¿ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all men are equal, in as far as relates to every Å¿ocial and civil duty, I Å¿hall now briefly point out Å¿everal other reÅ¿pects in which the <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of mankind is farther evident.</p>
               <p n="1">I. All men are endowed with the Å¿ame frame of body, and with the Å¿ame general conÅ¿titution of mind. NotwithÅ¿tanding the diverÅ¿ities, which obtain among individuals, in point of higher or lower degrees of excellence in any of the original faculties of our nature, all the Å¿pecies, excepting Å¿ome uncommon and monÅ¿trous inÅ¿tances, is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriÅ¿ed by the Å¿ame members and organs of body, and by the Å¿ame faculties, propenÅ¿ities, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Å¿oul. Does the richeÅ¿t, the moÅ¿t power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the moÅ¿t beautiful, the moÅ¿t ingenious among
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025234_0054_0FCCAE639D457C08"/>
the Å¿ons of men, feel leÅ¿s the Å¿enÅ¿e of hunger and thirÅ¿t, of cold and pain, than thoÅ¿e of contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿criptions; or are theÅ¿e laÅ¿t leÅ¿s diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed than the former, by the general conÅ¿truction and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the human frame; Do not the rich and the poor, the obÅ¿cure and the elevated, come into the world in the Å¿ame Å¿tate of imbecility and wretchedneÅ¿s? Is the infant of opulent parents poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of greater vigour, or does he require leÅ¿s the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of thoÅ¿e on whoÅ¿e care he is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately caÅ¿t, than the infant of the peaÅ¿ant or the beggar? Can he already diÅ¿cern and provide his food, uÅ¿e his limbs, defend himÅ¿elf from danger, and, by his hereditary independence, vindicate the true Å¿uperiority of his condition? So far is any of theÅ¿e from being the caÅ¿e, that, if there is any difference, in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, between him and the infant of meaner rank, it is all in favour of the latter. This, from the Å¿trong and healthy conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his parents, brings along with him a frame naturally vigorous and robuÅ¿t, and requiring only the moÅ¿t ordinary care for its nouriÅ¿hment, its preÅ¿ervation, and its final maturity. The other often inherits from thoÅ¿e who begat him a Å¿ickly and Å¿lender conÅ¿titution, which the utmoÅ¿t atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aÅ¿Å¿iduity can hardly preÅ¿erve from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the moment of birth, and afterwards more frequently debilitate than Å¿trengthen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:025234_0055_0FCCAE659105BE08"/>Again, the Å¿ame natural principles, propenÅ¿ities, and affections, operate on all mankind with differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of force, according to their different Å¿ituations. All men, of whatever rank or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are Å¿trongly actuated by a principle of Å¿elf-preÅ¿ervation, by the love of liberty, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire of pleaÅ¿ure, and an averÅ¿ion to pain, by the love of Å¿ociety, and a diÅ¿like of Å¿olitude, by the parental, conjugal, and filial attachments, by a Å¿enÅ¿e of honour, by reÅ¿entment of injuries, and by a certain affection for their country. None are deÅ¿titute of Å¿ome perception of beauty, order, and magnificence in the works of nature or art, and none, but Å¿uch as are monÅ¿trouÅ¿ly corrupted, are inÅ¿enÅ¿ible to the eternal diÅ¿tinctions of right and wrong, of virtue and vice, of truth and error, in human judgments and actions. Even the moÅ¿t Å¿tupid, ignorant and perverÅ¿e of the human Å¿pecies differ, in this reÅ¿pect, from the brutes, that, as they remember the paÅ¿t, and anticipate the future, Å¿o they are capable of forming and purÅ¿uing Å¿ome plan of life, of conceiving Å¿ome Å¿yÅ¿tem of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s which they deÅ¿ire to attain, or Å¿ome image of miÅ¿ery which they endeavour to avoid. No human being, therefore, enjoys or Å¿uffers like the inferior animals, according to the blind impulÅ¿es of appetite, or the unanticipated impreÅ¿Å¿ions of Å¿enÅ¿e, but has Å¿ome previous deliberation and choice, with
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025234_0056_0FCCAE666C704C08"/>
regard to the objects of deÅ¿ire and averÅ¿ion. Every mortal alÅ¿o feels that, by the birth-right of human nature, he is entitled to certain <hi>rights,</hi> of which he cannot be deprived without ceaÅ¿ing to be a man, or without envying the condition of the inferior creatures. TheÅ¿e are the common features of humanity which characteriÅ¿e all the Å¿pecies, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h among them Å¿o many points of equality.</p>
               <p n="2">II. All men are equal in being equally expoÅ¿ed to viciÅ¿Å¿itudes, and to death. To attempt any proof of theÅ¿e facts would be nugatory and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. But the conÅ¿equences to be deduced from them, with reÅ¿pect to the light in which the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent orders and deÅ¿criptions of men ought to view each other, are not Å¿o evident, or at leaÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s not that influence over the heart, to which they are in reaÅ¿on entitled. For, if the moÅ¿t exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of mankind muÅ¿t, as well as the loweÅ¿t, Å¿ubmit to the Å¿troke of death, and moulder the prey of worms in the grave, if this event equally hangs over his head every moment, and, when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, muÅ¿t Å¿trip him of every external diÅ¿tinction; can any pretenÅ¿ions be more abÅ¿urd than thoÅ¿e of pride, which are Å¿olely founded on a pre-eminence Å¿o tranÅ¿ient and uncertain? For any one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to value himÅ¿elf on Å¿uch tranÅ¿itory diÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is as ridiculous, as it would be for a traveller
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025234_0057_0FCCAE67EA3D9D28"/>
to imagine himÅ¿elf proprietor of every field through which he paÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p>BeÅ¿ides, the Å¿tations which diÅ¿criminate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent orders of Å¿ociety, are by no means perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently attached to any number of individuals that may now enjoy them, or to their deÅ¿cendants. They are Å¿ubject to many viciÅ¿Å¿itudes, and have a conÅ¿tant tendency to change. As the parts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial nature are in perpetual fluctuation, and are Å¿ometimes altered by Å¿ecret and Å¿ilent decays, Å¿ometimes by violent convulÅ¿ions, by tempeÅ¿ts, hurricanes, inundations, earthquakes and volcanos, Å¿o the various orders of Å¿ociety are expoÅ¿ed to conÅ¿tant changes, partly by Å¿udden and violent agitations, partly by thoÅ¿e Å¿ecret, but certain cauÅ¿es, which are continually operating the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the depreÅ¿Å¿ion of men. Foreign wars or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿tic commotions, Å¿ignal calamities or uncommon proÅ¿perity, illuÅ¿trious virtues or flagrant vices, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moÅ¿t wonderful alterations in human for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Leaving the public tranÅ¿actions of our own times, which furniÅ¿h moÅ¿t Å¿triking proofs of this fact, what numberleÅ¿s inÅ¿tances croud into the mind while it revolves the events of ancient or modern hiÅ¿tory!</p>

               <p>There is, beÅ¿ides, in every Å¿tation a certain ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to change, and the Å¿ame cauÅ¿es that produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the elevation of the higher orders of men, are imperceptibly operating alÅ¿o in favour of others placed in inferior conditions. As a projectile, when it has reached its higheÅ¿t point of elevation, begins immediately to deÅ¿cend, and continues its courÅ¿e downwards with an accelerated velocity; Å¿o there appears to be a certain point of exaltation, beyond which human grandeur cannot proceed, and which, by being the termination of Å¿plendour, becomes the beginning of decline, and of final pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation. On the other hand, as the Å¿eed of a tree, from the moment it is dropped into the ground, is continually expanding, and receiving
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025234_0059_0FCCAE6BACB12D68"/>
from the earth new additions to its growth, till it mingle its branches with the clouds, and cover the Å¿oil with its Å¿hade; in lik manner, among the lower orders of men, there are evident principles of increaÅ¿e and amelioration of their condition, which fail not to operate Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully when they are favoured by opportunities.</p>
               <p>For, what are the vices which are apteÅ¿t to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect elevated and and affluent circumÅ¿tances; and what the virtues which an humble and hard lot moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily engenders and cheriÅ¿hes? In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we often behold pride, which excites indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and hatred, and, conÅ¿equently, combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to repreÅ¿s it. We behold luxury and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, which waÅ¿te rapidly the moÅ¿t Å¿plendid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and incapacitate for exertion and activity. We behold careleÅ¿Å¿neÅ¿s and inattention, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low people's affairs to run into diÅ¿order, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion irreparable confuÅ¿ion at laÅ¿t. We often behold extortion, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and flagrant abuÅ¿e of power, in order to retrieve broken circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which haÅ¿ten the ruin they are employed to prevent, and produce indelible diÅ¿grace.</p>
               <p>In an humble and Å¿evere lot, we frequently Å¿ee humility and modeÅ¿ty, which never fail to concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate complacency. We Å¿ee patience and frugality,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025234_0060_0FCCAE6DB627AD90"/>
of which the former renders the hardeÅ¿t conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tolerable, and the latter draws eaÅ¿e from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury. We Å¿ee induÅ¿try, and a Å¿ucceÅ¿sful exertion of abilities, which firÅ¿t make men uÅ¿eful and indiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ibly neceÅ¿Å¿ary even to their Å¿uperiors; then bring them into notice and regard; and, laÅ¿tly, raiÅ¿e them to truÅ¿t and affluence. Thus, while thoÅ¿e who are placed in the higheÅ¿t Å¿tations, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they have no exertions to make, becauÅ¿e they have reached the pinnacle of human greatneÅ¿s, are verging towards decline and obÅ¿cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, thoÅ¿e who move in an inferior Å¿phere, urged by their neceÅ¿Å¿ities, or Å¿timulated by their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are making conÅ¿tant efforts to riÅ¿e, watching every favourable opportunity of Å¿ucceÅ¿s, and Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently climbing the Å¿teep from which the former are deÅ¿cending. Where are now thoÅ¿e illuÅ¿trious families that occupy Å¿uch a remarkable place in ancient hiÅ¿tory? They are not Å¿urely all extinct; their deÅ¿cendants, doubtleÅ¿s, exiÅ¿t Å¿omewhere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. But they are confounded with the general maÅ¿s of mankind, while others have ariÅ¿en to Å¿hine in the Å¿phere from which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. It is thus that Divine Providence, which has, for the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t reaÅ¿ons, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Å¿tations and talents among men, has by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their virtues and vices to operate their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effects of alternate depreÅ¿Å¿ion and exaltation,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025234_0061_0FCCAE6EB014B358"/>
reÅ¿tored the balance, which diÅ¿appears from the view of Å¿uperficial obÅ¿ervers.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If we juÅ¿tly eÅ¿timate the advantages and inconveniencies of every condition of life, we Å¿hall find that they nearly balance each other, that the Å¿um of happineÅ¿s, Å¿hared among the human Å¿pecies, is divided in pretty equitable portions; and that equality of enjoyment is another ground, on which the different ranks of Å¿ociety, if not the individuals that are placed in them, are on a level. The grand difference, in this reÅ¿pect, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in what is appropriated to no Å¿tation or fortune, but is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually open to them allâinternal diÅ¿poÅ¿ition and character; which it is unqueÅ¿tionable, may be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in their greateÅ¿t excellence, and enjoyed in their higheÅ¿t perfection, in the loweÅ¿t, as well as in the moÅ¿t elevated, Å¿phere. As the different regions of the globe, however removed from the Equator, or the Poles, enjoy equal meaÅ¿ures of light and darkneÅ¿s, though diÅ¿tributed in different manners; Å¿o the different orders of Å¿ociety poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s equal portions of felicity, and are expoÅ¿ed to equal pains, though the modes of enjoyment and Å¿uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be diverÅ¿ified. If the honours of an exalted Å¿tation are greater than thoÅ¿e of an humble one, its duties are alÅ¿o more difficult, if its virtues are more Å¿plendid, its temptations are more enticing,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025234_0062_0FCCAE7029F397F0"/>
and its vices more conÅ¿picuous; if its enjoyments are more refined, its Å¿ufferings are more acute, and its afflictions more durable. Is it Å¿uppoÅ¿ed that the burden of labour is heavier than that of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or the pains of indigence greater than thoÅ¿e of Å¿enÅ¿uality? ConÅ¿ider that health often Å¿miles, on the cheek of poverty, while diÅ¿eaÅ¿e deforms the face of opulence. Do any imagine that the Å¿olicitude of providing daily Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence is greater than that which attends the improvement, or the Å¿ecurity, of an extenÅ¿ive eÅ¿tateâthat the real wants of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afford more anxiety and care, than the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary demands of extravaganceâthat the evils which are really felt, are greater than thoÅ¿e which diÅ¿tempered fancy creates?âlet Å¿uch conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diÅ¿content, the uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s, the dejection, the wayward humours, and the Å¿ullen gloom, that Å¿o often haunt the great and the wealthy, and acknowledge that Å¿leep viÅ¿its the couch of Å¿traw, and flies from the bed of down.</p>
               <p>Do any imagine that it is more difficult to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ue, with conÅ¿tancy and firmneÅ¿s, the rugged and thorny paths of the humble vale of life, than to maintain the elevated poÅ¿ts of dignity and honour, in the midÅ¿t of intrigue, of competition, of cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and of all the uncertainty of favor? Let them reflect on the Å¿olicitudes and the terrors of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025234_0063_0FCCAE721E329740"/>
the public governor, when unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sful iÅ¿Å¿ues at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his adminiÅ¿tration, when the tide of popular approbation begins to ebb, when his enemies Å¿pread diÅ¿content through the land, repreÅ¿ent him to the people as the author of their calamities, and rouÅ¿e them to Å¿acrifice him as the victim of their fury. The Å¿torm often burÅ¿ts on the palace, when it paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es inoffenÅ¿ively over the cottage!</p>
               <p n="4">IV. All men are equal in having Å¿ome peculiar duty to diÅ¿charge, Å¿ome peculiar advantages for the exhibition of correÅ¿ponding virtues, Å¿ome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar temptations to correÅ¿ponding vices, and in being placed in a courÅ¿e of probation for a future and final Å¿tate. If the duties of each Å¿tation are properly diÅ¿charged, its virtues proportionably diÅ¿played, and its temptations Å¿urmounted, it is difficult to Å¿ay whether the greateÅ¿t praiÅ¿e is due to the Å¿uperior or inferior ranks of Å¿ociety. If the duties or the virtues of either are neglected, or its temptations allowed to prevail, the blame is equal on both Å¿ides, although the puniÅ¿hments are frequently diÅ¿tributed very unequally under human governments. That all men are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent placed in a preparatory Å¿tate for a future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence, both natural and revealed religion concur in evincing. It is no leÅ¿s evident, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal principles by which the divine government
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025234_0064_0FCCAE7332B2D9F0"/>
is adminiÅ¿tered, that the characters which men have acquired in the preÅ¿ent period of being, will be the only meaÅ¿ures of their future fate, and that all thoÅ¿e diÅ¿tinctions, which are wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, will then diÅ¿appear forever! If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is then paid to the different Å¿tations which men have occupied here below, it will only be in order to determine how far they have diÅ¿charged the duties of them, and what degree of merit, or demerit, is to be aÅ¿Å¿igned to each individual, according to the talents he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities he enjoyed for the practice of every virtue. Here all men are placed on the moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equality, have the Å¿ame hopes, the Å¿ame fears, the Å¿ame pleas to urge, the Å¿ame titles to produce, or rather are levelled by the Å¿ame incapacity of all merit, but what is derived from the clemency of the Great Judge, operating through the plan of Å¿alvation he has eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed. With his eyes turned to this Å¿cene, with any adequate impreÅ¿Å¿ion of this awful conÅ¿ummation on his heart, (and mad muÅ¿t he be to whoÅ¿e mind Å¿uch thoughts are never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent!) can any one deny the equality of mankind, nor perceive the empty titles, and tinÅ¿el Å¿plendors and idle pageants of this tranÅ¿itory period, Å¿wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before his Å¿ight, and finally diÅ¿appearing, like the dreams which occupy his fancy in Å¿leep, but fade and are forgotten when he opens his eyes, and again enjoys the reality of things.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of moral and metaphyÅ¿ical Å¿ubjects, hardly any thing has occaÅ¿ioned greater obÅ¿curity, and, of conÅ¿equence, more violent diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, than the ambiguity of terms, and the vague and indeterminate ideas annexed to them by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parties. Of this no word can afford a more Å¿triking inÅ¿tance than the term <hi>right,</hi> eÅ¿pecially when applied to denote a moral capacity to <hi>act,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:025234_0067_0FCCAE786C48AF68"/>
to <hi>poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s,</hi> or to <hi>demand,</hi> in certain circumÅ¿tances. Of this the notion will be found to be as various, as the philoÅ¿ophical or religious Å¿yÅ¿tems which men have adopted, the profeÅ¿Å¿ions which they have embraced, the Å¿tations which they occupy, or the company they frequent. Although peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may agree in Å¿ome general and indefinite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>right,</hi> yet, in the peculiar ideas they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain with regard to its application to all the particular objects of human action and purÅ¿uit, it will be found that their conceptions are not redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to any determinate Å¿tandard. We are not, on this account, however, to imagine that the rights of men are indefinable, or that there are not general claÅ¿Å¿es to which they may be reduced. For, although the private rights of individuals muÅ¿t vary according to their different circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and relations, there are Å¿till certain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent principles on which they are founded, and from which they muÅ¿t be deduced, in order to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them from thoÅ¿e powers which fraud Å¿ecretly obtains, or violence openly uÅ¿urps. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s this were the caÅ¿e, laws and obligations would be unmeaning words, and power the only arbiters of right and wrong.</p>
               <p>Without entering at preÅ¿ent into any abÅ¿truÅ¿e and refined Å¿peculations concerning the foundation
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025234_0068_0FCCAE79EC43E8C0"/>
of moral obligation, I Å¿hall only obÅ¿erve, that we Å¿eem, in general, to denominate that <hi>right</hi> which has a tendency to promote the univerÅ¿al happineÅ¿s of mankind, or that of the individual himÅ¿elf, when it is not repugnant to the more extenÅ¿ive intereÅ¿t, whether of the whole Å¿pecies, or of the Å¿maller communities into which the Å¿pecies is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. To theÅ¿e two general heads, namely, <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> to general, and <hi>tendency</hi> to particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s, when properly limited, it will be found that every thing juÅ¿t, and honorable, and praiÅ¿e-worthy, in human Å¿entiments and conduct is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately referable. Whoever <hi>does,</hi> or <hi>poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> or <hi>demands,</hi> what is conducive to the common good, or to his own intereÅ¿t in conÅ¿iÅ¿tency with this, that he Å¿hould <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s,</hi> or <hi>demand,</hi> we Å¿ay he has a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>do,</hi> to <hi>poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s</hi> or to <hi>demand,</hi> it.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the only notions we can form to ourÅ¿elves of happineÅ¿s muÅ¿t be derived from thoÅ¿e original principles of our nature, by which certain objects are conÅ¿tituted the means of Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and pleaÅ¿ure, and others the cauÅ¿es of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿ineÅ¿s and pain. The former become, on that account, <hi>deÅ¿irable,</hi> and the latter, <hi>diÅ¿agreeable</hi> and <hi>odious.</hi> By implanting theÅ¿e deÅ¿ires and averÅ¿ions in the Å¿oul of man, the Creator evidently intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they Å¿hould be indulged within the limits
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025234_0069_0FCCAE7BDA46BEE0"/>
he has preÅ¿cribed to them, and, in order to diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver theÅ¿e limits, has Å¿uperadded the noble faculty of reaÅ¿on. Accordingly, there Å¿eems annexed to every natural <hi>deÅ¿ire</hi> and <hi>propenÅ¿ity</hi> of the heart, a certain feeling of a <hi>right</hi> to its indulgence. The original propenÅ¿ities and deÅ¿ires Å¿pring up Å¿ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouÅ¿ly in the Å¿oul, and impel it to action. In children, theÅ¿e are the firÅ¿t Å¿timulants to motion and activity, and, as they are Å¿till undirected by the higher principles of our nature, and by the improvements of experience, conÅ¿titute their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notions of <hi>right.</hi> As the inferior animals are immediately carried by nature towards thoÅ¿e ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are adapted to Å¿atisfy their inÅ¿tinctive principles; Å¿o men, in the firÅ¿t period of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence, greedily deÅ¿ire and Å¿eize whatever their appetites or paÅ¿Å¿ions point out to them as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conÅ¿ider it as an injury to withhold from them the indulgence; but Å¿uch is the beautiful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in the human conÅ¿titution, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theÅ¿e propenÅ¿ities limit and balance each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Å¿o that the immoderate indulgence of one prevents that Å¿atisfaction of others, which is alÅ¿o a neceÅ¿Å¿ary ingredient of happineÅ¿s. Different pains and inconveniencies, Å¿oon experienced from imbridled propenÅ¿ities, Å¿uggeÅ¿t the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Å¿elf-command. The pleaÅ¿ures and the advantages of Å¿ociety attach men to their Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025234_0070_0FCCAE7CF1F3FAA8"/>
and point out, at the Å¿ame time, the neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of regulating their conduct in Å¿uch a manner as to prevent their deÅ¿ires and purÅ¿uits from encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the equally natural deÅ¿ires and purÅ¿uits of others.</p>
               <p>ReaÅ¿on, recollecting the paÅ¿t, and anticipating the future, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes Å¿uch rules of action and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment as unite the perfection and happineÅ¿s of the individual with the general intereÅ¿t of the Å¿pecies, and convert the harmonious movements of the whole Å¿ocial body into the moÅ¿t efficacious means of promoting the happineÅ¿s of all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of whatever rank or degree. The moral faculty, Å¿urveying Å¿uch a beautiful and Å¿alutary arrangement, Å¿anctions it with its approbation, and decrees that every human being is bound to act and to enjoy in conformity to the principles of this Å¿yÅ¿tem. The various relations and circumÅ¿tances of men being conÅ¿idered and defined, general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims are formed, which are denominated the <hi>laws of nature.</hi> As the human conÅ¿titution is the work of the Å¿upreme Creator, whatever is, by juÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, deducible from this conÅ¿titution, as a rule of conduct to man, is as juÅ¿tly held to be a divine law, as if the Omnipotent LegiÅ¿lator had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the moÅ¿t audible voice.

               <p>FROM the Å¿hort deduction contained in the preceding chapter, joined to what has been eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed in the firÅ¿t book, it is evident that there are certain <hi>natural rights,</hi> which cannot be infringed, without overturning the foundations of human Å¿ociety, and that there are others which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to certain deÅ¿criptions of men, in conÅ¿equence of that Å¿ocial order which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the general felicity. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are to be conÅ¿idered as the original conditions of the Å¿ocial compact; the latter, as the means by which it is to be executed; and both flow from that idea, of equality of obligation which we have above illuÅ¿trated.</p>
               <p>In the firÅ¿t place, there are certain principles Å¿o Å¿trongly interwoven with the human frame, Å¿o intimately blended with its eÅ¿Å¿ence, Å¿o efficient of all that can be called human, that the violation of them cannot be regarded in any other light

than in that of a degradation, nay, an entire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the diÅ¿tinctive attributes of the human character. Of conÅ¿equence, every man Å¿tipulates, by entering into Å¿ociety with his Å¿pecies, that the enjoyments grounded on theÅ¿e principles, or, in other words, the <hi>rights</hi> which attach to them, as the gifts of God to his rational creatures, Å¿hall be maintained to him inviolate; and reÅ¿erves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf the privilege of defending them at all hazards, whenever it is attempted to wreÅ¿t them from him. For, as every human being is a conÅ¿tituent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Å¿ocial body, he is, while he diÅ¿charges the duties incident to his peculiar capacity, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, equally with every other, to the grand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of human nature, which civil Å¿ociety is intended to maintain and improve. He is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary, as the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed of mankind, to the general perfection and felicity, and he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to it that portion which his abilities enable him to furniÅ¿h. The rights, therefore, which are indiÅ¿penÅ¿ibly neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the preÅ¿ervation and happineÅ¿s of each individual, in whatever rank or Å¿ituation he may be placed, muÅ¿t equally belong to all, and can never Å¿uffer the Å¿malleÅ¿t diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from any claims or prerogatives attached to the diÅ¿tinctions of fortune, of rank, or of talents. They are the neceÅ¿Å¿ary appendages of that <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> which Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts among all men amidÅ¿t the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ities
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025234_0074_0FCCAE8307510048"/>
which Å¿ociety and civiliÅ¿ation have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall firÅ¿t briefly enumerate and explain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and original <hi>rights</hi> of human nature, which equally belong to all men without exception; and, Å¿econdly, thoÅ¿e adventitious <hi>rights,</hi> which belong only to particular deÅ¿criptions of men, as characteriÅ¿ed, whether by particular talents, or by particular Å¿ituations in civil life, but equally to all to whom theÅ¿e deÅ¿criptions are applicable.</p>

               <p n="1">I. EVERY innocent member of Å¿ociety has a <hi>perfect right</hi> to life, and to the integrity of his body. No principle is more deeply engraved in the conÅ¿titution of all animals, than that of Å¿elf-preÅ¿ervation. Every living creature has an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of diÅ¿Å¿olution, and a Å¿trong averÅ¿ion from pain, which is a Å¿timulant Å¿till more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the love of pleaÅ¿ure; becauÅ¿e the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of evil is the firÅ¿t Å¿tep towards enjoyment. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excites the deteÅ¿tation of mankind more than an unprovoked attempt on life, or even violent aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ault, when no more is intended than to wound, or to mutilate. BeÅ¿ides, no man can be uÅ¿eful to Å¿ociety, but in as far as his life is preÅ¿erved and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and bodily health and vigour are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to diÅ¿charge the moÅ¿t important Å¿ocial duties. The right to theÅ¿e is Å¿acred and inviolable, and, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are unjuÅ¿tly aÅ¿Å¿aulted, every man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025234_0076_0FCCAE86AEA11688"/>
to defend them even by the Å¿laughter of the aggreÅ¿Å¿or, when every other means of Å¿ecurity is removed. In this right is evidently included that of the preÅ¿ervation of chaÅ¿tity when attacked.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Every man has a <hi>perfect right</hi> to the full fruits of his own honeÅ¿t ingenuity and labour. The Creator, by beÅ¿towing on every perÅ¿on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain portion of corporeal or mental ability, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended that it Å¿hould be exerciÅ¿ed. To this exerciÅ¿e man are impelled by the Å¿timulants of pleaÅ¿ure, and of pain. ReaÅ¿on, which enables mankind to anticipate futurity, Å¿uggeÅ¿ts, from the recollection of former wants, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for them when they Å¿hall again recur. The natural productions, which may be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to the uÅ¿e of man, neceÅ¿Å¿arily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the property of the firÅ¿t occupier, becauÅ¿e, if they were appropriated to none, they would be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s to all; at leaÅ¿t; Å¿uch of them as could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford no preÅ¿ent uÅ¿e would remain neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unimproved. For no man will beÅ¿tow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and time on that from which he is to receive no profit. Men are Å¿trongly affected by a tender Å¿olicitude for their offspring and near connections, to whom they wiÅ¿h to impart a Å¿hare of their Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities during life, and, at death, to tranÅ¿mit their entire poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions. They are inflamed with
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025234_0077_0FCCAE882B816F98"/>
a thirÅ¿t of honour and applauÅ¿e, and eager to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them by the diÅ¿play of uÅ¿eful, of elegant, or of Å¿ublime, talents. BeÅ¿ides, while men mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿upply each other with what they want, for an equivalent, Å¿ociety is more cloÅ¿ely cemented by a conÅ¿tant interchange of the various products of induÅ¿try, of art, and of wealth; and, by the different conditions of men in point of fortune, opportunity is, as above obÅ¿erved, afforded for the exerciÅ¿e of many virtues, which could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e exiÅ¿t. Man's double capacity, as an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and as a member of Å¿ociety, is thus beÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, and his Å¿elfiÅ¿h, as well as his Å¿ocial, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ities are gratified. In fact, the Å¿ame means that enable him moÅ¿t amply to indulge the former, alÅ¿o qualify him for Å¿atisfying moÅ¿t effectually the latter. By the exerciÅ¿e and cultivation of all his faculties, and by the improvement of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities he enjoys, he beÅ¿t promotes his own private happineÅ¿s, and, in the Å¿ame manner, he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes moÅ¿t to the public good. As the perfection and Å¿olidity of all the parts of a building produce the Å¿olidity and perfection of the whole; Å¿o, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Å¿ociety, the proÅ¿perity of all its members in their different relations and circumÅ¿tances, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Å¿um of general happineÅ¿s. NotwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, the Utopian Å¿yÅ¿tem of a community of goods, which Å¿ome political projectors, fixing
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025234_0078_0FCC92A5F634C520"/>
their eyes on partial views of advantage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, have endeavoured to recommend, and Å¿ome Å¿maller Å¿ocieties have exemplified, it is undoubted that both public and private happineÅ¿s require that the right of property Å¿hould be Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly maintained.</p>
               <p>This <hi>right</hi> implies not only that poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ãâã</desc>
                  </gap> lawfully acquired, Å¿hould remain the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late property of their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors, but alÅ¿o that every honeÅ¿t and fair mean of acquiring Å¿hould be equally open to all who are placed in the Å¿ame circumÅ¿tances. It requires that a fair field be granted for the exerciÅ¿e of every uÅ¿eful and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental talent, and that its natural rewards be not with held from it. Partial and narrow Å¿yÅ¿tems of policy, whereby the intereÅ¿t of a few is only conÅ¿ulted, frequently cramp genius, and reÅ¿train induÅ¿try, to the great prejudice of the common good.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e, however, with whatever pretexts they may be coloured, are juÅ¿tly to be accounted viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Å¿acred right of property, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not only what men already honeÅ¿tly poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s, but alÅ¿o, what they may honeÅ¿tly obtain. The powers of their bodies, and the faculties of their minds, are the only property which men receive
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025234_0079_0FCCAE8BA09A63C8"/>
from nature. The exerciÅ¿e of theÅ¿e on the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous natural productions, introduced the <hi>adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> rights to theÅ¿e objects, and inheritance and contracts transferred them from their original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors to their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors. But the foundation of all property is the common <hi>right</hi> to the earth and its productions, which God has granted to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, together with the peculiar appropriation which every one made of Å¿ome portion of theÅ¿e to himÅ¿elf, by the uÅ¿e of his mental and corporeal powers. It is abÅ¿urd, therefore, that <hi>adventitious</hi> rights Å¿hould be Å¿acred, while the <hi>primary</hi> means of acquiring theÅ¿e rights may be wantonly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿cribed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. All men have an equal <hi>right</hi> to a fair and honeÅ¿t character, till it has been proved that they have juÅ¿tly forfeited it. The love of character is deeply implanted in the human breaÅ¿t, and as it can only be extinguiÅ¿hed with the extinction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; Å¿o it is Å¿trong in proportion to the Å¿trength of virtuous and elevated Å¿entiments. The loÅ¿s of reputation, wounding one of the moÅ¿t lively feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the human heart, is one of the greateÅ¿t calamities in life. With the loÅ¿s of character ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other evils are unavoidably connected, which, while they deÅ¿troy the private happineÅ¿s of the individual, alÅ¿o fruÅ¿trate his public utility. The
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025234_0080_0FCCAE8CAADD1560"/>
Å¿ucceÅ¿s of a perÅ¿on in the world, whether in the improvement of his fortune, or in the exerciÅ¿e of his abilities, depends greatly on the opinion which is entertained of his integrity. His uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s to Å¿ociety depends chiefly on the confidence which his fellow men can repoÅ¿e in him. When any man's honeÅ¿ty is queÅ¿tioned, his talents, far from being objects of complacency, are converted into Å¿ources of terror, and mankind naturally combine in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deprive them of thoÅ¿e opportunities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, which Å¿eem to threaten their own Å¿afety.</p>
               <p>Fame, or diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed conÅ¿ideration and reÅ¿pect, belong only to eminent abilities, virtues or Å¿tations. But the character of honeÅ¿ty belongs equally to all who faithfully diÅ¿charge every Å¿ocial and civil obligation. ThoÅ¿e who, in every Å¿ituation and circumÅ¿tance, whether of exaltation or of obÅ¿curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, carry along with them purity of heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of conduct, meet on the equal footing of good men, and are equally entitled to all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, advantage, and conÅ¿ideration, which that character juÅ¿tly claims, and cannot fail to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s, if not clouded by miÅ¿repreÅ¿entation, or Å¿tained by calumny. The moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious abilities, or the moÅ¿t exalted Å¿tation, give not, of themÅ¿elves, a better title to a fair and Å¿potleÅ¿s character, than
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025234_0081_0FCCAE8E29EE8EE0"/>
the moÅ¿t moderate parts, or the moÅ¿t humble cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances. This <hi>right,</hi> till it is loÅ¿t by vicious action, extends to all conditions and ranks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV. THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</head>
               <p n="4">IV. EVERY man has a <hi>perfect right</hi> to <hi>liberty,</hi> or to act in whatever manner he pleaÅ¿es, provided he offers no injury to others, and violates no law enacted by the public authority of the civil Å¿ociety to which he belongs. As Å¿oon as we form the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a rational agent, freedom immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the conception, and all happineÅ¿s and all virtue reÅ¿t on its foundation. For, as virtue conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the proper uÅ¿e of all our faculties, or in that conduct which is Å¿uited to the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition; Å¿o happineÅ¿s conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of thoÅ¿e enjoyments, of which nature has rendered us capable, and which the right uÅ¿e of reaÅ¿on enables us to obtain. But how can he, who is deprived of the power of regulating his own actions, and of determining and directing his purÅ¿uits, either exert his faculties in Å¿uch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is beÅ¿t adapted to their ends, or purÅ¿ue thoÅ¿e enjoyments, with the greateÅ¿t vigour, to which
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025234_0083_0FCCAE9129360898"/>
he has aÅ¿Å¿igned the higheÅ¿t value; how can he, who is Å¿ubjected to the arbitrary will of another, contribute his portion to the common order and felicity; which reÅ¿ults from the combined efforts of all directed to this glorious and comprehenÅ¿ive endâfrom the combined exertions of knowledge, wiÅ¿dom, Å¿kill, ingenuity, dexterity, art, labour, reÅ¿olution, and vigour, Å¿hared among all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Å¿ocial body? SuppreÅ¿s the juÅ¿t exertion of any of theÅ¿e Å¿eparate portions, juÅ¿t Å¿o much is cut off from the general perfection and happineÅ¿s, and, while individuals are oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, the public Å¿uffers. Subject them to the arbitrary will of one, or of a few, all the light, and invention, and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which reÅ¿ult from the free, but well regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, efforts of all acting in harmonious concert are goneâall that variety of talent, of deÅ¿ign, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uit, and of operation, which embelliÅ¿h, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and Å¿trengthen, human Å¿ociety, is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hedâand the whole Å¿ocial maÅ¿s, Å¿ubordinated to one feeble and impotent will, ever influenced by narrow and contracted views, or by cloudy paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, either pines in a paÅ¿Å¿ive lethargy, or, if it is called into action by extraordinary Å¿timulants, exhauÅ¿ts its Å¿trength by its efforts, while their produce is wholly drawn off by the privileged part; Å¿imilar to thoÅ¿e aged trunks on which we behold a few of the higher branches retaining their
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025234_0084_0FCCAE92DCAAB6F0"/>
Å¿ap and verdure, while the tree itÅ¿elf is rotten, and Å¿inking Å¿peedily to duÅ¿t. Thus the preÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the attainment of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as well as of private, felicity; nor can it ever be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed that any human being, whoÅ¿e judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is found, and who has not been corrupted by long habits of Å¿ervitude, would either expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly or tacitly relinquiÅ¿h what is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enjoyment of human nature, and without which, Å¿ociety itÅ¿elf is his greateÅ¿t curÅ¿e. In Å¿hort, liberty and human nature are inÅ¿eparable; to deÅ¿troy the former, is to annihilate the latter âis to annihilate every notion of duty, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and happineÅ¿s, beyond what is merely Å¿enÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and brutiÅ¿h.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder then, that the love of freedom Å¿hould be Å¿trong and vigorous in the breaÅ¿t, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the elevation of Å¿entiment, the Å¿enÅ¿e of honour, the regard for virtue, with which each individual is endowed, and that, by every generous and feeling Å¿oul, Å¿lavery Å¿hould be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateÅ¿t of human evils. BaÅ¿e, indeed, and corrupted, and broken by habits of Å¿ervile Å¿ubjection, muÅ¿t that man be, who can conÅ¿ider himÅ¿elf as the property of his fellow creature, and feels no indignation at the tyrant who reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him to this deÅ¿picable condition, and who, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading

the rational creation of God, which he has firÅ¿t debaÅ¿ed in his own Å¿oul, outrages heaven while he domineers upon earth. Few of mankind are Å¿o degenerate as to have loÅ¿t all Å¿enÅ¿e of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the native dignity of man. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may Å¿ubmit in Å¿ilence to a deÅ¿pot, yet they abhor him in their hearts: and, when they can do it with Å¿afety, would lay hold of the firÅ¿t opportunity of Å¿haking off the yoke. The named of maÅ¿ter and Å¿lave annihilate all claims of duty<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> all voluntary offerings of affection, and exhibit man to man in a Å¿tate of hoÅ¿tility, where power is the only right, and terror the only obligation<note n="*" place="bottom">From theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations it may be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed as a certain truth, that arbitrary governments, in whatever hands they may be placed, can never effectually Å¿ecure the happineÅ¿s of mankind. With whatever wiÅ¿dom and goodneÅ¿s a prince may be endowed, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible, from the narrowneÅ¿s of the human mind, that his views can extend to every department of civil Å¿ociety; and he will be unavoidably expoÅ¿ed to impoÅ¿ition from Å¿ome quarter or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His adminiÅ¿tration, of conÅ¿equence, can never be marked with that extenÅ¿ive beneficence, which reÅ¿ults from forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which are calculated to collect into one point the wiÅ¿dom, ingenuity, and vigour, which are diffuÅ¿ed through the whole Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial body. BeÅ¿ides, as it is the intention of civil Å¿ociety to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineÅ¿s of all its members, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible that its ends can be obtained, when the Å¿enÅ¿e of freedom, which is Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial an ingredient of human felicity, is either completely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed, or deprived of its enjoyments.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025234_0086_0FCCAE9632244DC0"/>NotwithÅ¿tanding this averÅ¿ion to Å¿ervitude, and this love of freedom, Å¿o Å¿trongly implanted in the human breaÅ¿t, it muÅ¿t be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that there is in mankind both an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing propenÅ¿ity to tyrannize, and a wonderful facility in Å¿ubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to enormous power. The freedom which men claim to themÅ¿elves, they are not willing to grant to others, and the principle which inÅ¿pires the wiÅ¿h of independence, produces the exerciÅ¿e of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion. The love of pre-eminence and power rejects competition and equality; fond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to one's own opinions Å¿timulates men to preÅ¿cribe them as rules to others; poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly aims at enlarging its bounds: elevation and authority have a perpetual tendency upwards, and, in their aÅ¿cent, depreÅ¿s thoÅ¿e parts through which they moveâthe generality of mankind, long accuÅ¿tomed to admire Å¿plendour and wealth, or eminent talents, readily Å¿ubmit to their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and voluntary homage often begins the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is at laÅ¿t exacted as a right. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Å¿ervitude debilitate the Å¿enÅ¿e of freedom, and the rigours of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion are frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary to rouÅ¿e it. It is thus that the love of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence Å¿timulates to encroach on the rights of others, and that Å¿uch encroachment is Å¿o fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Å¿ucceÅ¿sful.</p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:025234_0087_0FCCAE972E3711E8"/>On this account, all civil liberty is limited by theÅ¿e two conditions, abÅ¿tinence from injury to others, and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to the laws enacted by the authority of political Å¿ociety. Whoever injures others is not a free man, but a tyrant, and, if he is free, others are Å¿laves<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence the propriety of the inÅ¿cription TIBERIAS on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons of Genoa.

As it is the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign of civil Å¿ociety to Å¿ecure men from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿tice and violence which would Å¿oon Å¿ubject all to the moÅ¿t powerful, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic authority Å¿hould circumÅ¿cribe the actions of each individual. While all are equally Å¿ubject to this authority, and the collective power of the whole community is centered in this point, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as a neceÅ¿Å¿ary conÅ¿equence of that equality, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the relation that all equally bear to the Å¿ocial body, that the actions of each Å¿hould be directed and limited by this relation. No mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is Å¿ubject to another, conÅ¿idered as a member, but every member is Å¿ubject to the whole in its collective capacity, and, when this capacity is tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any part, or to any number of parts of the Å¿ocial body, theÅ¿e deriving their pre-eminence and authority from the whole Å¿ociety, have a right to govern all its members, while in every inÅ¿tance

in which they appear as members themÅ¿elves, and act, not in a public, but in a private, capacity, they are equally Å¿ubject to the common will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed by public laws, with all the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community. In civil Å¿ociety, it is this alone that maintains that equality which Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts among all its different members, notwithÅ¿tanding the diverÅ¿ities which fortune, rank, or talents, have introduced. For, as theÅ¿e only diverÅ¿ify the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which each is to contribute his portion to the public good; Å¿o, when all are equally Å¿ubject to common laws, all are levelled by this common Å¿ubjection, and every one is reÅ¿tricted to that line of conduct, which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the preÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and welfare of the political Å¿yÅ¿tem. Unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freedom is unattainable not only in civil Å¿ociety, but in every Å¿pecies of aÅ¿Å¿ociation whatever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the actions of every individual of the Å¿ociety are limited by the actions of all the reÅ¿t, and by the general deÅ¿ign and conditions of aÅ¿Å¿ociation itÅ¿elf. The grand deÅ¿ign of every Å¿ocial union is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the co-operation of all its members for the common good. It is hence incumbent on every one of them, Å¿o to regulate his conduct, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the end propoÅ¿ed. Nay, perfect liberty, if, by that term, we underÅ¿tand the unreÅ¿trained indulgence of every deÅ¿ire and propenÅ¿ity, is as inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the rational conÅ¿titution of each

individual, as it is with the principles of civil union. For there is an order eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by nature among all our deÅ¿ires and paÅ¿Å¿ions; and reaÅ¿on is given both to diÅ¿cover and to maintain it. As the violator of civil order ceaÅ¿es to be a citizen, and becomes a public enemy, Å¿o he who violates the order of the moral and rational nature ceaÅ¿es to be a man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into a brute, and is the deÅ¿troyer of his own happineÅ¿s. As a man, he only is free, who, delivered from the yoke of paÅ¿Å¿ion, freely follows the dictates of his nobler faculties, and indulges every natural propenÅ¿ity in conÅ¿iÅ¿tency with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal order. In like manner, civil Å¿ociety is free, when delivered from arbitrary power, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Å¿hape it may exiÅ¿t, all its members are placed under the empire and dominion of laws, enforcing the grand principles of political union, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binding on the legiÅ¿lators themÅ¿elves as on the people. If any are raiÅ¿ed above law, or enjoy privileges and prerogatives, which have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public good, and are burthenÅ¿ome to the community, in proportion as they are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, to the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors of them, the principles of civil union are oppoÅ¿ed, political equality is Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, more or leÅ¿s grievous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of Å¿uch inequality, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>

                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:025234_0090_0FCCAE9BAC6ED508"/>As the limitation of law is inÅ¿eparable from the liberty to which every citizen has an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tible right; Å¿o this <hi>right</hi> implies that, in every inÅ¿tance, neither contrary to law, nor injurious to others, every innocent perÅ¿on, who has reached the years of maturity, and has not voluntarily Å¿ubjected his actions to the controul of others, Å¿hould enjoy the power of acting as he pleaÅ¿es. PerÅ¿ons of Å¿ound judgment, and of generous Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, will, in the uÅ¿e of this freedom, conÅ¿ult not only their own pleaÅ¿ure and advantage, but alÅ¿o, the felicity of all to whom their influence may extend. Their purÅ¿uits will be characterized by a dignity and beneficence, which will point them out as the ornaments of Å¿ociety, and the objects of general admiration and gratitude. Such will find their moÅ¿t delightful enjoyments in their own higheÅ¿t improvement, and in their moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive utility to others. Men of inferior capacity, or of a meaner turn of mind, will chiefly devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to Å¿enÅ¿ual pleaÅ¿ures, and to Å¿elfiÅ¿h purÅ¿uits; and thus with-hold from the public a great deal of benefit which they might otherwiÅ¿e contribute. On this account, however, they are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their liberty, as long as they remain within the bounds of that innocence which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deficient in a moral and religious light, is Å¿ufficient for the maintenance of public peace, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025234_0091_0FCCAE9D29571588"/>
of civil and political order. They are not amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to human, but to divine juÅ¿tice; and muÅ¿t be called to account, not in the preÅ¿ent, but in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, world. Argument, perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may be employed; and every good man will uÅ¿e them to the utmoÅ¿t of his power, in order to diffuÅ¿e virtue and happineÅ¿s among his Å¿pecies. But to uÅ¿e violence for this purpoÅ¿e, is both to diÅ¿appoint the end, and to exhibit an inÅ¿tance of that folly which is reprobated in others. Men may be conÅ¿trained to be harmleÅ¿s and juÅ¿t, but not to be virtuous and happy!</p>
               <p>In the right of liberty is included the free uÅ¿e of private judgment in every thing relative to the regulation of conduct, and eÅ¿pecially to religion, as well as the free communication of Å¿entiment within the bounds above Å¿tated. It is vain to think of enjoying liberty of action, if the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which action is to be directed are not alÅ¿o free. In fact, the right of private judgment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alienated or wreÅ¿ted from any human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any power on earth. The mind of man, conÅ¿tituted free by its Creator, will ever remain Å¿o, in Å¿pite of every endeavour to enÅ¿lave it. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance may darken, prejudice reÅ¿train, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption pervert, its powers; Å¿till the opinions which it really embraces, are Å¿uch, as appear to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025234_0092_0FCCAE9EE6461498"/>
it the beÅ¿t, according to the light which it enjoys. But to conceive any mortal adopting an opinion, for which he perceives no ground, is the moÅ¿t glaring contradictionâis to Å¿uppoÅ¿e him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and rejecting at once the Å¿ame propoÅ¿itions. With regard to religion, in particular, the right of private judgment, and the freedom of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are to be maintained, as neceÅ¿Å¿arily connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the equality of all men, above eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, although religion ever has been, and ever muÅ¿t be, the Å¿trongeÅ¿t bond of Å¿ociety, yet the Å¿trength of this bond depends on the united evidence of the religious opinions which are adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on the Å¿incerity with which they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. It is only when religious opinions are both true in themÅ¿elves, and ingenuouÅ¿ly profeÅ¿Å¿ed, that they can exert any auÅ¿picious influence on the actions of men.</p>
               <p>Now, to perceive truth is the operation of the underÅ¿tanding. To embrace it with becoming zeal, and to obey its dictates with undeviating conÅ¿tancy, is the operation of the heart. The underÅ¿tanding may be enlightened by reaÅ¿on, the heart may be affected by perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, and, in order that either may be produced, perfect freedom is neceÅ¿Å¿ary. To convince or to perÅ¿uade by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is the greateÅ¿t of abÅ¿urdities, is a manifeÅ¿t
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025234_0093_0FCCAEA02B872C58"/>
impoÅ¿Å¿ibility; and when there is neither conviction nor perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, where can religion Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t? Place it where it can only reÅ¿ideâin the underÅ¿tanding and the heart; it eludes all conÅ¿traint. Remove it from this habitation, it loÅ¿es its Å¿alutary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>As religion, therefore, muÅ¿t, from its very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be free, no man can have any right to dictate to the conÅ¿cience of another. All men are equally entitled to Å¿erve God, and all are equally bound to Å¿erve him <hi>in Å¿pirit and in truth.</hi> No man can Å¿erve him with another's Å¿pirit; and no man can diÅ¿cern truth with another's underÅ¿tanding. To Å¿ubject religion to conÅ¿traint, is, of conÅ¿equence, to deÅ¿troy its eÅ¿Å¿ence, and to annihilate its Å¿alutary tendency. EnthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m and bigotry, whoÅ¿e cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter it is to erect their own opinions as Å¿tandards for all the world, and to violate the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, never fail, if they are Å¿ucceÅ¿sful, to give birth to hypocriÅ¿y, as the heir to their uÅ¿urped dominion. Hence it is eaÅ¿y to account for the Å¿mall influence which religious opinions have on the conduct of their profeÅ¿Å¿ors, while pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled religion ought naturally to produce the moÅ¿t Å¿alutary effects not only in rendering men <hi>wiÅ¿e unto</hi>

The glory of God is thus promoted by defacing his image on the human Å¿oul, and by transforming his <hi>reaÅ¿onable Å¿ervice</hi> into childiÅ¿h pageantry and inÅ¿ignificant pomp. BeÅ¿ides, if any Å¿et of men aÅ¿Å¿ume to themÅ¿elves the power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribing to others in religious matters, others may, with as good a title, do the Å¿ame whenever they obtain the power. True religion may thus be Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed and deÅ¿troyed, without its profeÅ¿Å¿ors having any plea for its defence which is not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly competent to the moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd Å¿uperÅ¿tition. While men thus domineer in religious matters, according as they poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the power, all religious improvement is precluded; the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t and moÅ¿t pious of men may be obliged to Å¿ubmit, in obÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Å¿ilence, to the moÅ¿t ignorant and impious; and Å¿uperÅ¿tition, in all its hideous forms, is put on the Å¿ame footing, and enjoys the Å¿ame advantages for its maintenance and propagation, with divine revelation itÅ¿elf. This right of freedom of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment carries along with it that of free communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025234_0095_0FCCAEA3290C5CA0"/>
of Å¿entiment, within the limitations above laid down. As there is in man a Å¿trong natural propenÅ¿ity to communicate his feelings and Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to others, Å¿o the faculty by which he is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enabled to communicate them is one of the moÅ¿t powerful bonds of Å¿ociety, and one of the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments of its improvement. By Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ing this freedom of communication, the natural equality of men is deÅ¿troyed. ThoÅ¿e from whom it is wreÅ¿ted are degraded from the condition of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community, and, being Å¿tripped of this privilege, may be prevented from contributing that portion to the public good which it might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to afford. How much the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and felicity of mankind depend on the free diffuÅ¿ion of knowledge, is too evident to require any proof. Nor is it leÅ¿s certain that ignorance and prejudice, ever delighting in darkneÅ¿s, becauÅ¿e their Laponian eyes are too weak to endure the light, are extremely deÅ¿irous of excluding it from whatever quarter it may Å¿hine. They endeavour, therefore, violently to extinguiÅ¿h the lamp of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, and to Å¿ilence the voice of truth. If they Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, all the evils of barbariÅ¿m are perpetuated; if the precious right of free communication of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is maintained, private as well as public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s is the reÅ¿ult.</p>

The firÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry muÅ¿t be, whether Å¿uch opinions tend to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the principles of civil Å¿ociety, and to diÅ¿turb its order and peace. If any are Å¿o fooliÅ¿h, or Å¿o wicked, as to entertain Å¿entiments Å¿ubverÅ¿ive of thoÅ¿e fundamental truths on which the mutual obligations of men, and the practice of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and civil Å¿ociety itÅ¿elf, are founded; Å¿uch may be juÅ¿tly conÅ¿trained to abÅ¿tain from the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, or to remove from the Å¿ociety of which they are members; or, if they obÅ¿tinately refuÅ¿e to comply with a requiÅ¿ition which Å¿elf-preÅ¿ervation dictates, may be juÅ¿tly puniÅ¿hed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deter others from imitating their example.

It is undeniable that bigotry, and Å¿uperÅ¿tition, and enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m, whether religious or civil, have often produced the moÅ¿t direful calamities in the world. But it is to be obÅ¿erved, that this has entirely proceeded from the principle againÅ¿t which I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, namely, the right of any man to dictate to the conÅ¿cience of another.

Å¿erocious paÅ¿Å¿ions of the human breaÅ¿t! If, on the one hand, therefore, profeÅ¿Å¿ions evidently Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ive of the fundamental principles of Å¿ociety have no claim to toleration; Å¿o, on the other, the greateÅ¿t caution is to be uÅ¿ed not to claÅ¿s, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, opinions which have no connection with the intereÅ¿ts of civil Å¿ociety, but regard only theological or philoÅ¿ophical Å¿peculation.

               <p>IT is a falÅ¿e notion to Å¿uppoÅ¿e that governments are moÅ¿t firmly eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed when the liberty of the Å¿ubject, or of the citizen, is deÅ¿troyed.

               <p>To this Å¿ituation, diÅ¿mal even in its greateÅ¿t pre-eminence and Å¿plendor, all abuÅ¿es of power inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly lead.

For, when the bodies of men are neither effeminated by luxury, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by climate, nor their minds brutified by ignorance, they cannot fail, Å¿ooner or later, to Å¿hake off the yoke of tyranny, and to break her Å¿ceptre in pieces.

ThoÅ¿e who are placed in the higher Å¿tations, and inveÅ¿ted with offices of government and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as they owe the diÅ¿charge of theÅ¿e impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant functions to the public, are entitled, from this very conÅ¿ideration, to the obedience of thoÅ¿e who are Å¿ubjected to their authority. As mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Å¿ocial body they are bound to promote its intereÅ¿t by the moÅ¿t effectual means in their power. The peculiar direction of this utility is
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025234_0105_0FCCAEAD527EDD00"/>
determined by their offices themÅ¿elves. This line cannot be purÅ¿ued without the legal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion of the reÅ¿t of the community. Hence that equality of obligation which binds the former to the juÅ¿t and zealous diÅ¿charge of their functions, binds alÅ¿o the latter to a ready and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Å¿ubjection to their authority.</p>
               <p n="2">II. When the neceÅ¿Å¿ary balance of the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, or that encouragement of merit which tends Å¿o powerfully to promote its higheÅ¿t intereÅ¿t, have raiÅ¿ed a certain claÅ¿s of men to certain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and privileges; theÅ¿e are, by that equality itÅ¿elf which Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts among all in their common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the public good, entitled to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and reÅ¿pect which are annexed to their Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the public welware requires Å¿hould be maintained in becoming Å¿plendour and dignity.</p>
               <p>When, by political conÅ¿titutions, peculiar marks of diÅ¿tinction are aÅ¿Å¿igned to eminent talents and virtues, thoÅ¿e who diÅ¿play them have a juÅ¿t claim on the public to the diÅ¿tinction which is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and on every member of the community for the regard which that diÅ¿tinction requires. Views of public intereÅ¿t Å¿uggeÅ¿t Å¿uch diÅ¿tinctions as incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to merit, in order to extract from all the members of the Å¿ocial body the greateÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ible

Å¿um of exertion, and to diffuÅ¿e its influence over the whole. It is juÅ¿t, therefore, that thoÅ¿e who contribute in the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed degree to the common welfare Å¿hould enjoy a proportionable Å¿hare of honour and advantage, adapted to the peculiar manner in which their utility has been diÅ¿played. To deprive them of this would be to deÅ¿troy their relation to the community, and that <hi>equality</hi> which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the common obligation of all to contribute to its benefit, and to receive a proportionate return.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When riches, acquired by honeÅ¿t induÅ¿try, or enjoyed in virtue of thoÅ¿e laws which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate property, whatever be its value and extent, enable their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors to relieve want, to Å¿ooth affliction, to diffuÅ¿e around them a Å¿pirit of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to encourage induÅ¿try, and to make their Å¿uperfluity circulate through the general maÅ¿s of the community, they confer on the opulent a juÅ¿t title to conÅ¿ideration and influence, in proportion to the Å¿uperior benefits they beÅ¿tow on all who are placed within the Å¿phere of their action. It would be as unjuÅ¿t to deny them this conÅ¿iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it would be to with-hold from a day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer his hire, or from a good man the eÅ¿teem which is his due.</p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:025234_0107_0FCCAEAFE9F257A0"/>IV. The Å¿ame conÅ¿iderations give to the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ranks of Å¿ociety, and to the community in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, an equal right to demand that all delegated power and authority, as all civil power undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is, be employed Å¿olely for the ends for which it was conferred, and that all honorary diÅ¿tinctions be neither beÅ¿towed on the undeÅ¿erving, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the purpoÅ¿es of pride, of inÅ¿olence, and of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion. The community at large has a right to demand that the legiÅ¿lative power be conÅ¿tantly directed by views of general utility, and not by partial Å¿yÅ¿tems which injure and diÅ¿treÅ¿s the whole by throwing all advantages on one Å¿ide of the political body; that the executive power never exceed its legal bounds, and, by an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial adminiÅ¿tration of juÅ¿tice, maintain all in the equal enjoyment of their rights; that rank be Å¿upported with dignity, and tempered with the affability and condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion becoming every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen; that wealth be not abuÅ¿ed to introduce and foment profligacy of manners, or to abet injuÅ¿tice; and that talents be not perverted to diÅ¿Å¿eminate opinions and principles Å¿ubverÅ¿ive of virtue, and pernicious to Å¿ociety.</p>
               <p n="5">V. All men have an equal, though imperfect, <hi>right</hi> to thoÅ¿e offices of humanity which, while they coÅ¿t the performers of them little trouble,

are the Å¿weeteners of Å¿ocial intercourÅ¿e; and to the compaÅ¿Å¿ion and relief, of others, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their condition and circumÅ¿tances, when they are overpowered by diÅ¿treÅ¿s and calamity. This <hi>right,</hi> it is true, cannot be Å¿o defined as to admit of any individual's claiming a determined portion of the good offices of any of his fellow men; nay, the fulfilment of its obligations muÅ¿t from its very nature, be left to every one's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and feelings. But, as men aÅ¿Å¿ociate for their mutual benefit and comfort, as humanity is interwoven with the human conÅ¿titution, and as compaÅ¿Å¿ion with diÅ¿treÅ¿s is one of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t feelings of our nature, it is undoubted that, to every Å¿ituation which is calculated to call theÅ¿e feelings into action, a certain <hi>right</hi> is annexed to expect and require them, and a general obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies on all to advance the happineÅ¿s of their fellow men by every mean in their power. As the ordinary offices of civility muÅ¿t vary according to the different conditions and ranks of men; Å¿o the compaÅ¿Å¿ion which is due to their diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and the relief which it prompts to afford, muÅ¿t be greatly affected by the Å¿ame conÅ¿iderations. For, as a loÅ¿s which would ruin a man in narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances, would not at all affect a perÅ¿on of affluent fortune; Å¿o, on the other hand, there are Å¿ituations which would appear to one in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cure

What would Å¿eem to one perÅ¿on a Å¿ingular benefit, would, to another in different circumÅ¿tances, either be no benefit at all, or interpreted into a cruel affront.

               </head>
               <p>I HAVE now endeavored to enumerate, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, as conciÅ¿ely as poÅ¿Å¿ible, the different <hi>rights</hi> that flow from the natural <hi>equality</hi> of men, conÅ¿idered in its proper light. Some of theÅ¿e are Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿entially neceÅ¿Å¿ary to human happineÅ¿s, that they cannot be violated without overturning the firÅ¿t principles of Å¿ociety. They are the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental articles of the Å¿ocial compact, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of which mankind, if not explicitly, yet tacitly, and by the inÅ¿titution of civil Å¿ociety itÅ¿elf, have Å¿tipulated to relinquiÅ¿h Å¿ome portion of their natural liberty, and to commit, to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its members, the concentrated power of the community for the benefit of all. Civil Å¿ociety annihilates not the natural rights of men, but fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Å¿ecures, and improves them. By circumÅ¿crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by the limits which the political union
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025234_0111_0FCCAEB77528DF18"/>
requires, it condenÅ¿es, as it were, their eÅ¿Å¿ence, and gives it greater Å¿trength and Å¿olidity.</p>
               <p>Others of theÅ¿e rights flow, indeed, from the Å¿ame principles; but, as they cannot be Å¿o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ely aÅ¿certained as to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h an exact and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite claim in every particular caÅ¿e, they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a leÅ¿s rigorous obÅ¿ervance, without wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vitals of human aÅ¿Å¿ociation. If thoÅ¿e of the former claÅ¿s conÅ¿titute the foundations of the Å¿ocial fabric, thoÅ¿e of the latter indicate the means of its conÅ¿olidation and higheÅ¿t improvement. When all theÅ¿e rights are maintained, according to their reÅ¿pective importance, as far as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man condition will admit, Å¿ociety is flouriÅ¿hing and happy, under whatever form of political ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration it may be placed. There are, it is true, certain forms of government, which, as their conÅ¿titution itÅ¿elf threatens even the moÅ¿t impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of them with deÅ¿truction, are, therefore, eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entially bad. But, there are others which, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the grand prerogatives of human nature, have a direct tendency to advance Å¿ocial happineÅ¿s, though in different degrees. Under Å¿uch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mankind may always conÅ¿ider it as a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumÅ¿tance to be placed. That govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025234_0112_0FCCAEBA490D2380"/>
is the beÅ¿t in which all the inherent rights of human nature are inviolably Å¿ecured, legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is maintained, and reÅ¿tricted to its objects, the power of the Å¿tate is employed to promote the general happineÅ¿s; and <hi>inequality</hi> itÅ¿elf tends to preÅ¿erve <hi>equality</hi> of law, and <hi>parity</hi> of obligation, among all the members of the community.</p>

               <p>THE diviÅ¿ion of my Å¿ubject, on which I now enter, opens a field comprehending every Å¿ocial and civil duty, becauÅ¿e every duty of this claÅ¿s Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es reciprocal obligations founded on the terms of equality, on which men aÅ¿Å¿ociate. Nay, as in order to diÅ¿charge the duties we owe to our fellow men, and fellow citizens, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to reÅ¿train our Å¿elfiÅ¿h paÅ¿Å¿ions within juÅ¿t bounds; and, as the Divine authority Å¿anctions every human obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and religion is the firmeÅ¿t bond of Å¿ociety, the

duties of piety, as well as thoÅ¿e of Å¿elf-command and moderation, might be inculcated on the Å¿ame principles. Hence, a complete treatiÅ¿e of practical morality might be produced. But, as this EÅ¿Å¿ay has already Å¿welled beyond the bounds which I at firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ed to it, I Å¿hall confine myÅ¿elf to the conÅ¿ideration of theÅ¿e duties which directly flow from the principles of equality already eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, and from the rights which they confirm. The duties now to be illuÅ¿trated will, therefore, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿pond to the two grand diviÅ¿ions of <hi>rights</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the preceding Book <note n="*" place="bottom">Ch.

               </head>
               <p>AS the inherent <hi>rights</hi> of human nature are the fundamental articles of the Å¿ocial compact, for the maintenance and preÅ¿ervation of which civil Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is conÅ¿tituted, every violation of theÅ¿e is not only an atrocious injury to the individual who Å¿uffers it, but is a direct attack on Å¿ociety it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf. No pre-eminence or prerogative whatever can give a title to deprive an innocent member of the community of thoÅ¿e rights, without which his exiÅ¿tence is either precarious or miÅ¿erable; and every attempt to infringe them is, on the part of the aggreÅ¿Å¿or, a renunciation of his Å¿ocial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e advantages are inÅ¿eparably connected with the obÅ¿ervance of the <hi>rights</hi> now under conÅ¿ideration. It is to Å¿ubÅ¿titute force in the place of <hi>right,</hi> and, of conÅ¿equence, to acknowledge that Å¿uperior power is entitled to
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025234_0117_0FCCAEC15AE6A090"/>
make him Å¿ubmit in his turn. This principle, carried in every inÅ¿tance as far as it will go, tears aÅ¿under every Å¿ocial and civil tie, tramples under foot every dictate of juÅ¿tice, and introduces a Å¿tate of unceaÅ¿ing hoÅ¿tility and violence.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential are Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e <hi>rights</hi> to the very exiÅ¿tence of Å¿ociety, that they are fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Å¿ecured by the Å¿trongeÅ¿t civil Å¿anctions. Life and property cannot be directly attacked without expoÅ¿ing the aggreÅ¿Å¿or to the Å¿evereÅ¿t pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. But in what a variety of indirect ways may injuries of this nature be offered, without any riÅ¿k of human puniÅ¿hment? Life is deÅ¿troyed not only by the dagger, or by the bowl, but by with-holding the means of its Å¿upport. Life is not Å¿o deÅ¿irable on its own account, as on account of the enjoyments which it furniÅ¿hes. Property is withdrawn from its lawful poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or, not only by robbery, or by theft, but alÅ¿o by every Å¿pecies of unfair commerce. Every deceitful practice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereby advantage is taken, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever colour, of the ignorance or of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of men, to deprive them of their property with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an equivalent, is a violation of the right of property, and every oppreÅ¿Å¿ive act which cuts off or diminiÅ¿hes the means of a comfortable Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is an attack upon life itÅ¿elf. To reduce men
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025234_0118_0FCCAEC2AC6835B8"/>
to the diÅ¿mal neceÅ¿Å¿ity of dragging out exiÅ¿tence in miÅ¿ery and contempt, to make them curÅ¿e the day of their birth, and Å¿igh for that of their diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution, to render the tendereÅ¿t of nature's ties an aggravation of diÅ¿treÅ¿s; what is this but to Å¿pare life in order to perpetuate torment? And to this diÅ¿mal condition how great a portion of the human race is reducedâa condition more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than that of the brute creation, which nature has provided with the neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿upply of their wants, and given them deÅ¿ires for nothing more! Shall any rights whatever, derived wholly from political inÅ¿titutions, founded, for the moÅ¿t part, in barbarous ignorance and tyrannic oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, be oppoÅ¿ed to thoÅ¿e clear and permanent <hi>rights</hi> which the Creator has conferred on all men equally, by the gift of life itÅ¿elf, and by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties of providing for its Å¿upply! Shall he who cultivates the Å¿oil be deprived of an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Å¿hare of the fruits which his induÅ¿try pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and pine in want, while the labour of his hands feeds luxurious idleneÅ¿s? Shall the <hi>right</hi> of property be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed only for thoÅ¿e who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing to the general Å¿tock, but conÅ¿ume and waÅ¿te what the induÅ¿try of others has provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Å¿hall that property which nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed on her children, in the faculties of their
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025234_0119_0FCCAEC5B6D7CF68"/>
minds and of their bodies, be conÅ¿idered as a mark of degradation, and a badge of Å¿lavery?</p>
               <p>How contrary are Å¿uch Å¿entiments, and the conduct they produce, to that juÅ¿t notion of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity above eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, which repreÅ¿ents every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being as a conÅ¿tituent member of the Å¿ocial body, and in his peculiar Å¿tation, equally neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with every other, to the common welfare; which exhibits man to man as children of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parent, as brethren connected no leÅ¿s by one common intereÅ¿t, than by one common origin, and diÅ¿criminated, by different diÅ¿tinctions of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and place, merely that the general good may be more effectually advanced. For, although Å¿uch views of Å¿ociety may, by Å¿ome whoÅ¿e policy is but half wiÅ¿dom, be claÅ¿Å¿ed among the theories of moraliÅ¿ts, or the viÅ¿ions of divines, they are the only repreÅ¿entations that can Å¿tand the teÅ¿t of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, or bear the eye of inquiry.</p>
               <p>Equally incumbent, on all men, is the duty to reÅ¿pect the <hi>right</hi> which every innocent individual has to <hi>character</hi> and <hi>liberty.</hi> But, how little is this duty regarded? Civil laws cannot do Å¿o much for the Å¿ecurity of the rights, to which it relates, as for thoÅ¿e of life and property; becauÅ¿e it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿y to define, in every caÅ¿e, their exact extent,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025234_0120_0FCCAEC736AB4510"/>
and much more is, on that account, left to the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and virtue of individuals. That degree of character which is aÅ¿Å¿aulted by open and direct calumny, may, indeed, be always exactly aÅ¿cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and every infraction of it become the Å¿ubject of legal animadverÅ¿ion. This is alÅ¿o the caÅ¿e with regard to perÅ¿onal liberty. But, in how many inÅ¿tances may a character be ruined, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its being in the power of the injured perÅ¿on to find any legal redreÅ¿s; and how much may one's juÅ¿t liberty be circumÅ¿cribed and infringed without any ground of legal complaint? The daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of mankind towards one another, in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, is the Å¿trongeÅ¿t evidence both of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity of a civil government, and of its inÅ¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for the Å¿ecurity of human happineÅ¿s. It manifeÅ¿ts the malevolent propenÅ¿ities by which mankind are often actuated, and, of conÅ¿equence, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of coercive power; and, Å¿ince theÅ¿e evil propenÅ¿ities burÅ¿t out on Å¿o many quarters, notwithÅ¿tanding the authority of laws, this evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the great utility of philoÅ¿ophical and religious inÅ¿truction, which applies to the underÅ¿tanding and the heart, and, by purifying the Å¿ource of action, renders conduct more conformable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and more conducive to human feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>

                  <hi>Do unto others as you wiÅ¿h them to do unto you,</hi> is a maxim that anÅ¿wers every caÅ¿e in which we can have any intercourÅ¿e with our fellow men. It is founded on the equality of human nature, amidÅ¿t all the diverÅ¿ities of condition and circumÅ¿tances. It takes, as the rule of conduct, the feelings of every individual, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing his condition were exchanged with that of the perÅ¿on towards whom he acts. It could never, therefore, be a juÅ¿t Å¿tandard, if the Å¿ame duties were not equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all in the Å¿ame circumÅ¿tances. Now, with reÅ¿pect to reputation and liberty, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry human being Å¿o warmly cheriÅ¿hes, and Å¿o ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purÅ¿ues, this rule ought to have peculiar efficacy. Yet, in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, it is moÅ¿t Å¿hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and frequently violated. It is aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing to obÅ¿erve the general averÅ¿ion to reproach and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, and the general propenÅ¿ity to reproach and cenÅ¿ure others; the high opinion which moÅ¿t peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple entertain of themÅ¿elves, and wiÅ¿h the world to entertain of them, and their inclination to think ill of others, and to undervalue and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h their good qualities. It is natural to Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that, as the experience of diÅ¿treÅ¿s renders men prone to compaÅ¿Å¿ion <note n="*" place="bottom">Haud ignara mali miÅ¿eris Å¿uccurrere diÅ¿co.</note>, Å¿o the love of character, and averÅ¿ion from diÅ¿grace, which operate Å¿o

Every one wiÅ¿hes his opinion of his neighbour to be believed; and his wiÅ¿h is granted. But the fulfilment of this wiÅ¿h equally wounds the characters of all. The blemiÅ¿hes he diÅ¿covers in another, or imputes to him, are acknowledged; thoÅ¿e which another lays to his charge meet with the Å¿ame credit. Thus every one by endeavoring to exalt himÅ¿elf at another's expence, only points out the means of his own depreÅ¿Å¿ion, and, by Å¿etting the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, provokes the reÅ¿t of mankind to uÅ¿e them. Such however, is the faÅ¿cination of Å¿elf-love, that the generality of men Å¿uppoÅ¿e themÅ¿elves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little obnoxious to cenÅ¿ure; and, while they
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025234_0123_0FCCAECC8161F930"/>
are indulging the moÅ¿t vicious paÅ¿Å¿ions of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, envy or revenge, they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves with the vain notion that their turpitude is unobÅ¿erved. As often as I reflect on the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of detraction, of obloquy, and of Å¿lander, I find it difficult to determine whether it proceeds more from weakneÅ¿s or from malignity; whether it is more an object of contempt or of deteÅ¿tation. What can be more malignant than to delight in the deÅ¿truction of one of the deareÅ¿t of human enjoyments? What more fooliÅ¿h and ridiculous than for a perÅ¿on to aÅ¿Å¿ault others, and to Å¿uppoÅ¿e that the attack will not be returned?</p>
               <p>The Å¿ame abÅ¿urdity and injuÅ¿tice is conÅ¿picuous in the mutual conduct of men with regard to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How few are ready on every occaÅ¿ion to grant to others the Å¿ame freedom which they take to themÅ¿elves! Such is the Å¿pirit of domination univerÅ¿ally diffuÅ¿ed, that what Pope limits only to one Å¿ex, is equally applicable to bothâ<hi>the love of pleaÅ¿ure, and the love of power.</hi> Indeed, the one neceÅ¿Å¿arily draws after it the other. The love of pleaÅ¿ure produces the deÅ¿ire of the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, and of extending influence and power as far as poÅ¿Å¿ible. For why are men tyrants, but becauÅ¿e they wiÅ¿h freely to indulge their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unreÅ¿trained by juÅ¿tice, unlimited by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?

While Å¿elf-love, therefore, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant principle of the human heart, tyranny will not be confined to thrones and dominions, to principalities and powers, but Å¿pread through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Å¿phere and condition of life. It is not Å¿o much the inclination as the power that is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the temper, which is overbearing and unjuÅ¿t in private life, would be a Nero if Å¿eated on a throne. Let us only conÅ¿ider the fond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which moÅ¿t men have to their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and mode of life, their eager deÅ¿ire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e them on others, their impatience of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, their propenÅ¿ity to Å¿quare the actions of other men by their own rule, their luÅ¿t of homage and precedence, their eagerneÅ¿s to riÅ¿e above others, and to indulge their ambition in every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle manner which their Å¿phere preÅ¿ents to them, their reÅ¿entment of affronts and injuries, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well as real, their Å¿elf-conceit and averÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from amendmentâwe behold the Å¿eeds of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny lurking in almoÅ¿t every human breaÅ¿t; and Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e to wonder that, when great power is poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, it Å¿hould be Å¿o frequently abuÅ¿ed. How Å¿eldom is the freedom of Å¿peech and action enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in the freeÅ¿t Å¿tates of civil Å¿ociety!

Å¿entiments of his own heart, as by the opinions and prejudices of thoÅ¿e with whom he aÅ¿Å¿ociates, and his actions, not Å¿o much by the immutable rules of duty, as by the fictitious Å¿tandards of the world, and he will confeÅ¿s that none can enjoy the true freedom of a man, but he who has the fortitude to Å¿acrifice to this exalted privilege, his moÅ¿t valuable temporal intereÅ¿ts, and his chief Å¿ocial pleaÅ¿ures. Prejudices born of ignorance, or of pride, are nouriÅ¿hed by education, Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by intereÅ¿t, or Å¿upported by that Å¿elf-love which is humbled by the expoÅ¿ition of them.

The man who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umes to think, to Å¿peak, or to act, differently from the generality, even in matters of Å¿ingular importance to the common good, is looked upon as an unÅ¿ocial Å¿avage being, who, Å¿eparating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf from his Å¿pecies, is entitled to no Å¿hare of their regard and affection.

               <p>As individuals are actuated by a tyrannical Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Å¿o nations claim to themÅ¿elves the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of reducing to Å¿lavery others inhabiting a different climate, or diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by a different colour of countenance. AriÅ¿totle, in that very book where he eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes the grand principles of a free government<note n="*" place="bottom">Politic. lib. 1 mo.</note>, is not aÅ¿hamed to aÅ¿Å¿ert, that the Greeks were deÅ¿tined, by nature, to rule the other nations of the earth; and founds this right on their Å¿uperior genius and civilization. Had that philoÅ¿opher foreÅ¿een the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of his own country, and that of thoÅ¿e nations whom he conÅ¿idered as appointed to continue bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians to the end of time, he would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the futility of his argument. But the nations of Europe, who have exchanged bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariÅ¿m for refinement, have adopted the Å¿ame principle, and Å¿uppoÅ¿e that Å¿uperiority of art and policy carries along with it the right of oppreÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Å¿tate is Å¿till rude and uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The principles eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in this EÅ¿Å¿ay Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evince that no pre-eminence of Å¿agacity, wiÅ¿dom, ingenuity, or Å¿trength can entitle any human being, or any Å¿ociety of men, to deprive
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025234_0129_0FCCAED78680F290"/>
others of the inherent and unalienable rights of human nature.</p>
               <p>But, Å¿ince principles directly contrary to theÅ¿e influence the generality of mankind, the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of Å¿ociety is perfectly conformable. As few men have the courage to Å¿acrifice their intereÅ¿t, their pleaÅ¿ure, or their fame, to their regard for truth and juÅ¿tice, the great concern is, to Å¿peak and act, not as reaÅ¿on and virtue dictate, but as intereÅ¿ted views, in conforming to the opinions, humours, and manners of others, may require. For, how is the favour of the greater part of men to be caught, but by adulation and Å¿ervile reÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? and what Å¿o efficacious for incurring their diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, as that manly and generous conduct and converÅ¿ation, which indicate leÅ¿s Å¿olicitude to Å¿ecure favour than to enjoy Å¿elf-eÅ¿teem, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er love of mankind than reÅ¿pect for individuals? Hence, moÅ¿t men have an opinion for every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they frequent, and change their Å¿entiments oftener than their dreÅ¿s. The art of pleaÅ¿ing, reduced into Å¿yÅ¿tem, and practiÅ¿ed by every one who aÅ¿Å¿umes the character of politeneÅ¿s, has given the Å¿ame Å¿hape and coloring to the manners of all; and thoÅ¿e prominent features, which characteriÅ¿e and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h, are rubbed off by the file of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and faÅ¿hion.

demandsâpropriety impoÅ¿ing new lawsâmen are always the Å¿laves of cuÅ¿tom, and Å¿eldom fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bent of their own genius and temper. Society is a Å¿pecies of Å¿tage, on which the actors appear in their turns, and play their parts. The real character remains behind the Å¿cenes. The great conteÅ¿t is, who Å¿hall act with the moÅ¿t pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful effect on the Å¿pectators, and produce the completeÅ¿t illuÅ¿ion. He is, therefore, moÅ¿t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, and bears the higheÅ¿t price, who appears leaÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and perÅ¿onates moÅ¿t Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully the aÅ¿Å¿umed character. Should an uncivilized Å¿on of nature be introduced into our European circles, he would, at firÅ¿t, conclude that humanity and benevolence had there fixed their abode. But, as Å¿oon as he was informed that all this was but Å¿cenery and Å¿tage effect, he would be uncertain whether moÅ¿t to admire the Å¿kill with which the repreÅ¿entation was conducted, or to deteÅ¿t the duplicity which could Å¿o completely aÅ¿Å¿ume the appearance of qualities, of which the reality was wanting <note n="*" place="bottom">See RouÅ¿Å¿eau, DiÅ¿cours fur les Sciences et les Arts, p. 12.</note>.</p>
               <p>By theÅ¿e different infractions of the original rights of man above mentioned, Å¿ociety is reduced to its preÅ¿ent unhappy condition, in which the HobbeÅ¿ian Å¿tate of nature appears in the midÅ¿t of

For, if every man is at liberty to deÅ¿ert
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025234_0133_0FCCAEDDC54741E0"/>
the poÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿igned him, and to invade another's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, how Å¿hall the inferior Å¿tations be filled, which are not leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the general welfare than the more eminent? If, in the circumÅ¿tances in which any given number of men can be placed, there be unavoidable hardÅ¿hips and inconveniences, why Å¿hould theÅ¿e rather be Å¿upported by Å¿uch as have never been accuÅ¿tomed to them, and are therefore totally unqualified for their duties, than by thoÅ¿e whom education, and habit, have beÅ¿t adapted to Å¿uch Å¿ituations? Yet, unleÅ¿s theÅ¿e inconveniences be endured, theÅ¿e difficulties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered by Å¿ome, the Å¿tations in queÅ¿tion muÅ¿t be deÅ¿erted, and a void left in the order of Å¿ocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty equally pernicious to public and to private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Still, men complain of their Å¿ituation, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly aÅ¿pire to others more exalted! But, is there any real foundation for this diÅ¿content, for this reÅ¿tleÅ¿s deÅ¿ire of change? Is it, as people pretend, that their preÅ¿ent condition is more painful, more adverÅ¿e to virtue, more inauÅ¿picious to the devel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opment and exerciÅ¿e of their powers, than thoÅ¿e which they Å¿o fondly deÅ¿ire? Or is it that men are better acquainted with the difficulties and temptations of their preÅ¿ent Å¿ituation, than with thoÅ¿e of any other, have fondly magnified their
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025234_0134_0FCCAEDF2FF2B050"/>
own abilities, and ignorantly placed all excellence in the diÅ¿charge of the duties of Å¿uperior Å¿tations? If we examine the caÅ¿e with impartial attention, we Å¿hall find no reaÅ¿on to heÅ¿itate in determining the queÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>Men readily grant the complaints of thoÅ¿e who are placed above them to be ill founded, and aÅ¿cribe their diÅ¿Å¿atisfaction to their folly. They haÅ¿tily preÅ¿ume that, if they were fixed in their Å¿ituation, they would eaÅ¿ily Å¿urmount its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reÅ¿iÅ¿t its temptations, and fully diÅ¿charge its duties. Their inferiors pronounce the Å¿ame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with regard to them and their circumÅ¿tances, and, if they envy, they are envied in their turn. A convincing proof this, that, in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are advantages as well as difficulties; that, though none is exempted from inconvenience, none is abÅ¿olutely inÅ¿upportable; and that diÅ¿con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a preÅ¿ent Å¿tation, and impatient deÅ¿ire of a higher, proceed from miÅ¿taken notions of both.</p>
               <p>I beg that it may be conÅ¿idered that I am, at preÅ¿ent, Å¿peaking only of the different ranks and Å¿ituations of human Å¿ociety, as they are diverÅ¿ified for the common happineÅ¿s of mankind; and not of thoÅ¿e Å¿ingular conditions of diÅ¿treÅ¿s and miÅ¿ery,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025234_0135_0FCCAEE122F81E30"/>
which fall to the lot of individuals. In theÅ¿e, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and fortitude may be recommended as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and as conÅ¿olations; but contentment can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be required.</p>
               <p>But, in Å¿urveying the different Å¿tations of life, although men grant that there are difficulties and hardÅ¿hips in all of them, they Å¿till believe that theÅ¿e diminiÅ¿h in proportion to the degree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and fall, with the greateÅ¿t weight, on thoÅ¿e who occupy the loweÅ¿t places. They fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, that, if they could aÅ¿cend to a conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable height, they Å¿hould there find Å¿ome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Å¿pot, where, unmoleÅ¿ted and compoÅ¿ed, they might Å¿urvey the Å¿teep which they had climbed, and enjoy the delightful proÅ¿pect opened around them. But, they reflect not on the difficulty of the aÅ¿cent, on the giddineÅ¿s of the Å¿ituation, or, if they Å¿hould chance to Å¿lip, on the Å¿everity of the fall. The preÅ¿Å¿ure of corporeal wants, the burden of daily labour, and the humiliation of contempt, conÅ¿titute the primary pains of a poor and ignoble condition. It is further deprived of the enjoyments which reÅ¿ult from the cultivation of reaÅ¿on, and of the other nobler faculties of the Å¿oul, and is conÅ¿trained to toil amidÅ¿t the darkneÅ¿s of ignorance. If thoÅ¿e, to whoÅ¿e Å¿hare it falls, feel for the miÅ¿eries of others, they are deÅ¿titute
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025234_0136_0FCCAEE22FCFAB78"/>
of the means of relieving them, and muÅ¿t Å¿uffer the pangs of compaÅ¿Å¿ion, without the divine Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of beneficence. PreÅ¿Å¿ed with their own diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, feeling for thoÅ¿e in Å¿imilar, or in Å¿till more afflicting circumÅ¿tances, and obÅ¿erving the Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of the Å¿ons of fortune, they are apt to envy their proÅ¿perity, to murmur at the Divine diÅ¿penÅ¿ations, and to practice violence or fraud, in order to obtain what their Å¿ituation has denied them.</p>
               <p>They conÅ¿ider not, however, that the pleaÅ¿ures of life depend not Å¿o much on the externals of condition as on the diÅ¿poÅ¿itions of the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or; that what Å¿eems calculated to Å¿atisfy, and to limit, deÅ¿ire, Å¿erves often to inflame and extend it; that the enjoyments which are in men's power are not thoÅ¿e which they really taÅ¿te; and that to wiÅ¿h and to purÅ¿ue is the unceaÅ¿ing employment of man upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He who aÅ¿cends a mountain, and beholds the view unfolding around him, is fired with greater curioÅ¿ity to reach the Å¿ummit, whence the utmoÅ¿t bounds of the proÅ¿pect can be deÅ¿cried. In like manner, no moderare exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Å¿cale of Å¿ociety can Å¿atisfy men, whoÅ¿e ambition is kindled, and whoÅ¿e activity engaged.

Do not the heavens, the ocean and the earth, unfold their magnificent and numberleÅ¿s beauties to the eye of the peaÅ¿ant, as well as to that of the monarch; nay, do they not diÅ¿cloÅ¿e to the former many raviÅ¿hing Å¿cenes, which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can Å¿eldom behold? Are not many even of the moÅ¿t Å¿triking and admirable diÅ¿plays of art, which riches have produced, and continue to Å¿upport, equally enjoyed by the meaneÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿enger, as by the proprietor himÅ¿elf? It is a groÅ¿s miÅ¿take to Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that to provide for one's family by aÅ¿Å¿idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honeÅ¿t labour, is leÅ¿s meritorious than to Å¿upply the poor out of an opulent fortune; that patience is leÅ¿s commendable than generoÅ¿ity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ignation than munificence, meekneÅ¿s, than mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, contentment than condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion; that Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is leÅ¿s benefited by being furniÅ¿hed with the neceÅ¿Å¿aries of life, than by being adorned with the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025234_0140_0FCCAEE9A9A335D0"/>
refinements of art, and by the productions of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; that the public welfare is leÅ¿s promoted by dutiful Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to lawful authority, by an in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenÅ¿ive, regular, and Å¿erviceable conduct, than by the enaction of Å¿alutary laws, by the judgment and puniÅ¿hment of offenders, and by a zealous and diÅ¿intereÅ¿ted diÅ¿charge of public truÅ¿t. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts no leÅ¿s the artleÅ¿s devotion of the grateful, though uninÅ¿tructed, heart, than the copious and Å¿welling praiÅ¿es of the enlightened underÅ¿tanding. The coarÅ¿er and brawny muÅ¿cles are as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the perfection of the body, as the organs of the moÅ¿t delicate texture.</p>
               <p>It is thus evident, that real happineÅ¿s and virtue are not limited to any Å¿tation, but are equally open to all. If there is any exception to this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, it muÅ¿t be in favor of the middling Å¿pheres of lifeâin which neither power and opulence tempt to oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and diÅ¿Å¿oluteneÅ¿s of manners, nor poverty and ignorance lead to fraud and violence; in which neither pride hardens the Å¿oul, nor Å¿ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity debaÅ¿es it; in which the beÅ¿t enjoyments of life are offered, and its greateÅ¿t enticements to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption excluded.</p>
               <p>From all that has been Å¿aid on this Å¿ubject, it clearly appears, that as it is the duty, it is equally
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025234_0141_0FCCAEEB4DABEC78"/>
the intereÅ¿t of all who are placed in the inferior ranks of life, to diÅ¿charge, with diligence and aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iduity the humble offices of their Å¿tation, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate contentment with their lot, and to Å¿uppreÅ¿s the emotions of envy towards thoÅ¿e who are more exalted.</p>
               <p>It may indeed be objected, that the deÅ¿ire of riÅ¿ing is one of the moÅ¿t powerful motives to the honeÅ¿t and active diÅ¿charge of every Å¿ocial duty, that one great point of equality among men conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the opportunity which all ought to enjoy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ing their uÅ¿eful or elegant abilities, and that, if every one is to reÅ¿t Å¿atisfied with the condition in which his birth or his circumÅ¿tances have plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, exertion muÅ¿t be diÅ¿couraged, and the general welfare be deprived of the benefit which reÅ¿ults from honeÅ¿t and generous ambition. We have, moreover, Å¿hown above, that frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ranks and conditions Å¿eems to compoÅ¿e a part of the divine adminiÅ¿tration of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. If thoÅ¿e, therefore, whoÅ¿e Å¿ituation is at preÅ¿ent ignoble and depreÅ¿Å¿ed, are to conÅ¿ider it as a duty never to aÅ¿pire higher, one of the Å¿trong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t checks is removed from pride, namely, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of its elevation, while dejection and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty are deprived of one of their moÅ¿t powerful conÅ¿olationsâthe expectation of more proÅ¿perous days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:025234_0142_0FCCAEECDB75ADA8"/>It ought, however, to be conÅ¿idered, that the doctrine above inculcated tends not to preclude laudable ambition and induÅ¿try, but only to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s, on the one hand, diÅ¿content, avarice, and envy, and to remove every pretext for indulging theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ions under the Å¿pecious colorings of more elevated and generous motives; and, on the other, to comfort and Å¿trengthen thoÅ¿e who are apt to view their inferior Å¿tations with an undiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eye, which beholds affliction where hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s may be found, and degradation where true dignity may reÅ¿ide. Nay, if our limits admitted of it, it might eaÅ¿ily be Å¿hown, that the faithful diÅ¿charge of the duties of an inferior Å¿tation, and that contented and cheerful mind which partakes of its greateÅ¿t enjoyments, are the Å¿ureÅ¿t and Å¿afeÅ¿t means of advancement.

               <p n="1">I. THE deÅ¿ire of improving one's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances ought never to lead to encroachment on the rights of others, whether natural or acquired. By the violation of the former, the fundamental principles of Å¿ociety are Å¿ubverted; and, by that of the latter, the order neceÅ¿Å¿ary to its exiÅ¿tence, is deÅ¿troyed. Whoever, therefore, pretends to maintain any of the natural rights of man, by overturning that Å¿ubordination and juÅ¿t order, which is the Å¿oul and the life of Å¿ociety, defeats the very purpoÅ¿e which he has in view, and exhibits either egregious folly or egregious wickedneÅ¿s. In either caÅ¿e, he becomes a dangerous enemy to the public intereÅ¿t, who is to be reÅ¿trained and puniÅ¿hed, to prevent him both from injuring others by his practice, and corrupting them by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such, however, is the intemperance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025234_0144_0FCCAEF0EDC05378"/>
paÅ¿Å¿ions, even thoÅ¿e of the moÅ¿t generous kind, when they are Å¿trongly excited, that the ardor of liberty, and indignation at oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, often hurry men to purÅ¿ue a conduct directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the principles of equity and beneficence which they profeÅ¿sâto oppreÅ¿s others when they are contending for freedom; to be moÅ¿t iniquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in defence of juÅ¿tice; and, with a view to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare of Å¿ociety, to overturn its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. Let the times in which we live, declare, in many inÅ¿tances, the truth of this aÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The duties of the Å¿tation, which people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready occupy, ought to limit their endeavors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advancement. The co-operation of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual for the public good, muÅ¿t firÅ¿t diÅ¿play its energy in the Å¿phere in which he moves, and be thence tranÅ¿mitted to the other parts of the Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al body. By neglecting the duties of his preÅ¿ent Å¿tation, a perÅ¿on with-holds the portion he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to contribute to the general welfare, and, by encroaching on the province of others, may clog their exertion and fruÅ¿trate their utility. To arrive at a more agreeable or more honorable Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the faithful diÅ¿charge of the duties of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent one ought always to be the firÅ¿t means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. When theÅ¿e are fulfilled, every fair and honeÅ¿t exertion is not only lawful, but even high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025234_0145_0FCCAEF20344CAC0"/>
laudable, as the greateÅ¿t activity of the parts then advances more effectually the proÅ¿perity of the whole. By embracing the opportunities which occur, and by exerciÅ¿ing the talents with which men are endowed, they manifeÅ¿t their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to Providence, and they improve its gift to the greateÅ¿t advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The duties of any Å¿tation to which men aÅ¿pire, and their own ability to diÅ¿charge them, ought to be conÅ¿idered before they attempt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. For, to occupy a Å¿tation for which one has no capacity, or with the duties of which he is totally unacquainted, is both to expoÅ¿e his own folly, and to injure Å¿ociety, by betraying a truÅ¿t which is committed to him. Hence, it is of the utmoÅ¿t conÅ¿equence to acquire a complete know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own talents and qualities, which the generality of mankind are Å¿o apt to magnify, both to their own diÅ¿grace, and to the detriment of others. Inability to diÅ¿charge the duties of any Å¿tation, reÅ¿ulting whether from narrowneÅ¿s of underÅ¿tanding, from unhappineÅ¿s of temper, or from infirmity of body, Å¿hould be deemed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s declaration of the Divine will againÅ¿t the acquirement of it, and, of conÅ¿equence, a boundary not to be paÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:025234_0146_0FCCAEF42E636590"/>IV. Men's exertions to improve their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿hould be influenced by the conÅ¿ideration of the enlargement, or the contraction, of their utility. From the light in which every man appears as a member of human Å¿ociety, to whoÅ¿e benefit he is bound to contribute in the moÅ¿t ample manner poÅ¿Å¿ible, it is plain that it can never be lawful for any one to change his preÅ¿ent Å¿ituation for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which his utility muÅ¿t be impaired. This is to prefer private to public intereÅ¿t, to pervert the quality of member, to demand more than is compenÅ¿ated, and to loÅ¿e all that dignity and real enjoyment which reÅ¿ult from the moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive beneficence.</p>
               <p>If, in the Å¿tation deÅ¿ired, men may be equally uÅ¿eful, as in that which they occupy, private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t may be allowed its full force. If, together with advancement, opportunities of utility increaÅ¿e, every private and public conÅ¿ideration happily unites in Å¿timulating to the purÅ¿uit of it, and every generous heart will wiÅ¿h and applaud the Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
               <p>Thus, the rights of others, the duties of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent Å¿tation, the talents requiÅ¿ite for a higher, and the more extenÅ¿ive utility, are the limits within which men ought to confine their exertions for the improvement of their circumÅ¿tances. Thus,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025234_0147_0FCCAEF5A9CE2218"/>
juÅ¿tice, diligence, ability, and public Å¿pirit, Å¿hould be the conÅ¿tant attendants in the path of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the chief forwarders of the progreÅ¿s.</p>
               <p>But, how little are theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! When intereÅ¿t or pleaÅ¿ure are conÅ¿tituted the Å¿ole Å¿prings of action, every duty that has no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to advance their ends is neglected, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, inÅ¿tituted for the benefit of mankind, are Å¿hamefully perverted to their prejudice. When the project is formed of riÅ¿ing to preferment without regard to merit, birth, intereÅ¿t, or party-attachments, are the only valid grounds of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenÅ¿ion. To the moÅ¿t Å¿elfiÅ¿h conÅ¿iderations the moÅ¿t important intereÅ¿ts of Å¿ociety are Å¿acrificed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore children can diÅ¿cover either inclination or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, offices are deÅ¿igned for them, and kept conÅ¿tantly in view; nor were this to be cenÅ¿ured, if proper care were taken to give them a Å¿uitable education, and their deÅ¿tination changed, when their temper and talents were perceived to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with it. But theÅ¿e things are Å¿eldom much conÅ¿idered. Whatever be the genius or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the perÅ¿on in queÅ¿tion, he muÅ¿t move in the particular Å¿phere which has been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en for him. The public welfare is treated as a chimera, which it is the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of a man well Å¿kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ways of the world to uÅ¿e as a color to
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025234_0148_0FCCAEF799868008"/>
varniÅ¿h the moÅ¿t intereÅ¿ted deÅ¿igns, but which none, but an enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿tic or vulgar mind, can think of adopting as a real object of purÅ¿uit. When the public welfare, however, is obÅ¿tructed, private happineÅ¿s cannot long be enjoyed. For, as one chief cauÅ¿e of the diÅ¿order and corruption, which Å¿o often lay waÅ¿te civil Å¿ociety, is the little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is Å¿hown to adapt men's condition to their abilities and tempers; Å¿o the miÅ¿ery of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals frequently Å¿prings from the Å¿ame Å¿ource. Men moving in a Å¿phere for which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deÅ¿igned by nature, Å¿oon grow diÅ¿guÅ¿ted with their lot, and, finding the duties of their Å¿tation irkÅ¿ome and oppreÅ¿Å¿ive, either neglect them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to their own irretrievable diÅ¿grace, or continue to diÅ¿charge them, in Å¿uch a manner as is equally painful to themÅ¿elves, and detrimental to others. Thus, Divine Providence takes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on mankind for infringing its appointments, by allowing them to be bewildered in their errors, and the victims of their own infatuation.</p>

               <p>IT is certainly no eaÅ¿y matter for a perÅ¿on not to conÅ¿ider himÅ¿elf as greatly Å¿uperior to the reÅ¿t of his Å¿pecies, when every one of thoÅ¿e who Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him pretends that his honor and dignity, his pleaÅ¿ure and Å¿ervice, are the only objects which occupy himÅ¿elf, and ought to occupy every other; when every one applauds, with Å¿ervile adulation, his moÅ¿t inÅ¿ignificant Å¿ayings, and moÅ¿t ridiculous actions, and adores him as the Å¿ource of wiÅ¿dom, and the centre of power. When a perÅ¿on has Å¿o many occaÅ¿ions of beholding his fellow men in a contemptible light, it muÅ¿t require angelic mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to abÅ¿tain from treating them accordingly; to neglect thoÅ¿e advantages which his circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their Å¿ervility put into his hands for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his own paÅ¿Å¿ions and caprice, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their moÅ¿t valuable intereÅ¿ts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:025234_0150_0FCCAEFA2D67CF50"/>When, therefore, I conÅ¿ider this Å¿tate of things, far from being Å¿urpriÅ¿ed at the pride, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of contradiction, which often characteriÅ¿e the higher ranks of life, or any Å¿pecies of diÅ¿tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eminence, I am more diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to admire the condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion and humanity which they Å¿o frequently exhibit. For, theÅ¿e vices, though more obÅ¿ervable in the higher Å¿pheres, becauÅ¿e they are diÅ¿played in a more conÅ¿picuous point of view, are by no means confined to theÅ¿e, but pervade every rank, every Å¿ituation and profeÅ¿Å¿ion of life. Hardly any attainments Å¿o low, any circumÅ¿tances Å¿o cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿cribed, as not to afford Å¿cope for Å¿elf-Å¿ufficiency and oÅ¿tentation. Who will not Å¿eem great, if he is as highly exalted as his ideas of greatneÅ¿s reach, and compares himÅ¿elf only with his inferiors: if he eÅ¿timates his own knowledge by another's igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, his own wiÅ¿dom by another's folly, his own power by another's impotence, his own wealth by another's poverty, his own virtue by another's depravity? On what other foundation, than on this partial mode of compariÅ¿on, are built the pride and arrogance of even the moÅ¿t exalted of mankind? But, if we abandon this magical glaÅ¿s, which transforms the cottage into a palace, and the infant into a man, and contemplate objects in the true light of nature, we Å¿hall find, that the great diÅ¿pute only is, who Å¿hall be eÅ¿teemed the

               <p>Would men, diveÅ¿ting themÅ¿elves, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the prejudices which birth, education, or luxurious habits, have fixed in their minds, Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, with the eye of reaÅ¿on, the conÅ¿truction of Å¿ociety, the principles on which it reÅ¿ts, and the ends which it purÅ¿ues, and then contemplate the nature and perfections of the univerÅ¿al parentâ what a different light would be thrown on their condition and circumÅ¿tances, and how different a proÅ¿pect be diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed to them, from that which

light than in that of the moÅ¿t atrocious rebellion againÅ¿t the Divine government?âA perÅ¿on, raiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a high office, placed in exalted rank, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned by diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed abilities, is eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed on an eminence that his views of the general good may be more extenÅ¿ive and correct, and that he may apply, to its advancement, the powers he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es with the greater advantage and Å¿ucceÅ¿s. As on an eminence therefore, the eye is diverted from proximate to remoter objects; Å¿o, in an exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿tation, the narrow concerns of Å¿elf Å¿hould be leÅ¿s regarded than the grand and magnificent range which the public welfare preÅ¿ents to the mind.</p>
               <p>Nor does this view of things diminiÅ¿h, in the Å¿malleÅ¿t degree, the advantages reÅ¿ulting from eminent rank, fortune, or abilities; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it greatly enhances them. For, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the opportunities which theÅ¿e afford of widely diffuÅ¿ing beneficent influence, and, with the imitation of the divine perfections, of Å¿haring in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure the divine felicity; what elÅ¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but the meaneÅ¿t gratifications of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but an augmentation of miÅ¿ery with an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of vice, and a total degradation of all that diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hes man from the brutes? If the rich enjoy not the pleaÅ¿ure of munificence, of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Is there in theÅ¿e any thing which a man of judgment would value, deÅ¿ire, and purÅ¿ue, as primary objects? Were Å¿uch a perÅ¿on informed, on his firÅ¿t Å¿etting out in life, that Å¿uch would be all the enjoyment he Å¿hould reap from the fondeÅ¿t
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025234_0155_0FCCAF03EC04B510"/>
objects of his purÅ¿uitâwould he conÅ¿ider the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaÅ¿e as a Å¿ufficient recompenÅ¿e for his toil and anxiety, his frequent mortifications, and aÅ¿Å¿iduous Å¿tudy? I aÅ¿Å¿ert not that the man, who devotes wholly to Å¿elfiÅ¿h purpoÅ¿es the advantages he poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es, has no pleaÅ¿ure, no enjoyment. The Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ualiÅ¿t, the miÅ¿er, the vain, the ambitious, the proud, have each their particular gratifications. But theÅ¿e gratifications are unmanly and baÅ¿e, and fall infinitely Å¿hort of the delights of a faithful diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty, and of the Å¿ublime enjoyments of beneficence. Nor can it be alledged that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being matters of taÅ¿te, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain their comparative values; becauÅ¿e every man will be partial to his own, and, while the generous extol the joys of beneficence, the Å¿elfiÅ¿h will ever find their happineÅ¿s in thoÅ¿e which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in themÅ¿elves. For, in order to compare the different Å¿ources of felicity, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to taÅ¿te them; and this can only be done by men of an exalted and capacious Å¿oul, who can reliÅ¿h in the higheÅ¿t degree both the pleaÅ¿ures which attach to Å¿elf, and thoÅ¿e which reÅ¿ult from benevolence. By feeding the hungry, does any man Å¿poil his own appetite? By relieving the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, does he diminiÅ¿h his own reliÅ¿h of eaÅ¿y circumÅ¿tances? By maintaining peace and order in Å¿ociety, does he contract his imagination, or diminiÅ¿h its powers?

By comforting the afflicted, by inÅ¿tructing the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or by adviÅ¿ing the perplexed, does he render his conception leÅ¿s clear, his judgment leÅ¿s Å¿olid, or his memory leÅ¿s tenacious? On the other hand, it is certain that a contracted Å¿elfiÅ¿hneÅ¿s weakens and extinguiÅ¿hes the benevolent affections, and excludes the pleaÅ¿ures they confer. The man who Å¿eeks in wealth only the means of indulging his Å¿enÅ¿uality, and promoting his convenience, who aÅ¿pire at power, only to gratify his pride and ambition, or who purÅ¿ues knowledge only for his own amuÅ¿ement or vanityâÅ¿uch a man can have but little reliÅ¿h of the joys that Å¿pring up and flouriÅ¿h in a Å¿ocial and benevolent heart<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence AriÅ¿totle very juÅ¿tly aÅ¿Å¿erts, in Å¿everal places of his Ethical writings, that the good man is the only proper judge of happineÅ¿s.</note>.</p>

Nay, the leÅ¿s he enjoys of the advantages, and the more he Å¿uffers of the evils, of life, the more glorious will he appear! But no favorable concurrence of circumÅ¿tances, neither the gifts of nature, the accompliÅ¿hments of arts, nor the Å¿plendors of fortune will ever be able to bribe our eÅ¿teem in behalf, I Å¿ay, not of the Å¿enÅ¿ualiÅ¿t, the villain, or the tyrant, but even of the unÅ¿ocial Å¿olitary mortal, who, though he offers no poÅ¿itive injury to his Å¿pecies, yet with-holds his endeavors for their happineÅ¿s! Nay, if Å¿uch a Å¿uppoÅ¿ition be not impious, remove good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s from all the other divine attributes, and Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Supreme Being unconcerned for the happineÅ¿s of his creation, and Å¿ay whether his nature would then appear as amiable, adorable, and tranÅ¿cendently excellent, as it now appears to every reflecting mind. And if goodneÅ¿s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute the Å¿upreme glory of the divine nature, that which gives to every other perfection its true beauty and light, and completes the real character of Deityâis it poÅ¿Å¿ible that any human

excellence or advantage Å¿hould compenÅ¿ate for the abÅ¿ence of this primary virtue?</p>
               <p>If the true excellence of human nature, thus, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in benignity, if this neceÅ¿Å¿arily attracts the regard of the Å¿elfiÅ¿h themÅ¿elves, how comes it to paÅ¿s that Å¿o many, who have the nobleÅ¿t op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of gratifying a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition Å¿o beatific and glorious, can be reconciled to a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductâto Å¿enÅ¿uality, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and perverÅ¿ion of the fineÅ¿t abilities? The weakneÅ¿s, the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and the corruption of human nature, are the only Å¿atisfactory cauÅ¿es that can be alledged.</p>
               <p>But, even in actions the moÅ¿t apparently Å¿elfiÅ¿h and groveling, a diÅ¿cerning eye will be able to diÅ¿cover Å¿ome faint gleams of generoÅ¿ity which illumine and recommend them. SenÅ¿uality is clothed with the Å¿pecious coloring of Å¿ociality, of pleaÅ¿ure communicated as well as received, of jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity and mirth, of freedom, and contempt of Å¿ervile reÅ¿traint. OppreÅ¿Å¿ion and tyranny are preÅ¿ented to the mind under the appearance of dignity, of a high Å¿enÅ¿e of honor, a noble ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attachment to party, nay, even of a love of juÅ¿tice.

                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:025234_0160_0FCCAF0E83F30068"/>It appears, then, that the dignity of human nature conÅ¿iÅ¿ts not in the greatneÅ¿s of men's abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, wealth, or dominion, but in expanÅ¿ion, and benignity of Å¿oul; that the former are only means of promoting the purpoÅ¿es of the latter, and Å¿igns that their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors are particularly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by Divine appointment, to generous and elevated action; that one, who poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Hence, to be filled with pride and contempt of thoÅ¿e below us, on account of our talents, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal circumÅ¿tances, without any regard to the right application of them, is both to act unjuÅ¿tly, by acting inconÅ¿iÅ¿tently with the character of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community, and uÅ¿urping the rights which belong to it alone, and to overturn the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿is on which true Å¿uperiority muÅ¿t ever reÅ¿t. It is to content ourÅ¿elves with the Å¿hadow, without the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, of greatneÅ¿s; and, while God and men unite in calling us to a pre-eminence and happineÅ¿s which neither time, nor fortune, nor

In a word, it is the duty of thoÅ¿e who are raiÅ¿ed to the higher Å¿tations of life, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of the gifts of fortune, or endowed with Å¿uperior abilitiesâto maintain juÅ¿tice, order and peace, in Å¿ociety; to Å¿tudy and purÅ¿ue the public good; to relieve diÅ¿treÅ¿s, to encourage induÅ¿try, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward merit, to exerciÅ¿e condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility towards their inferiors; to cultivate and extend uÅ¿eful and elegant knowledge; to eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿h, and inculcate, the grand principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion, to enlighten, humaniÅ¿e, and improve mankind, and to lead them to virtue and happineÅ¿s.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e who employ in this manner the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and talents with which they are furniÅ¿hed by Divine Providence, are entitled to the higheÅ¿t veneration of mankind.

bearing the reÅ¿emblance of God as far as human nature will permit, Å¿hare alÅ¿o his felicity, and claim the homage of the world. Let them be diÅ¿played as the inÅ¿truments of beneficence, they will reign with an irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible and permanent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which neither envy, nor malice, nor faction, nor tumult, will be able to overturn; for it is founded in the hearts of men who, feeling, and rejoicing in, its bliÅ¿sful influences, muÅ¿t ceaÅ¿e to love themÅ¿elves, before they can wiÅ¿h to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their reÅ¿pect and obedience.</p>
               <p>But, when riches are only the fund of a Å¿ordid avarice, or the fountain of licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy; when wiÅ¿dom is perverted into craft, and abilities transformed into the miniÅ¿ters of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and intrigue, of deception and ignoble policy, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, uphold, or extend, civil or religious deÅ¿potiÅ¿m; when reÅ¿plendent genius is employed in rebellion againÅ¿t God, and in the corruption of men, by propagating irreligion and immorality; when pre-eminence and authority are, in civil life, uÅ¿ed as the inÅ¿truments of pride, injuÅ¿tice, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and cruelty, or Å¿upreme power, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by inÅ¿atiable ambition, deluges the earth with blood, and Å¿preads devaÅ¿tation and miÅ¿ery through the habitations of menâreaÅ¿on eaÅ¿ily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates the falÅ¿e glitter that Å¿urrounds them,

She declares their luÅ¿tre to reÅ¿emble that of thoÅ¿e noxious vapours, which, riÅ¿ing from the earth, are kindled into a flaÅ¿h in the Å¿ky; and terminate in noiÅ¿e and deÅ¿truction; while thoÅ¿e who apply their talents, their riches, or power, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent ends for which they are deÅ¿tined, are like that glorious luminary in the heavens, which Å¿hines with a conÅ¿tant and Å¿alutary light.</p>
               <p>Thou proud inÅ¿olent mortal! who lookeÅ¿t down from thy lofty Å¿tation on thy brethren of men, and imagineÅ¿t them only formed to bring their gifts to thy altar, and to bend before thee with Å¿ervile homage, know that thy elevation only renders thee more conÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly contemptible!

Should they only withdraw their Å¿upport without inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any poÅ¿itive evil, thou wouldÅ¿t precipitately Å¿ink into a degradation lower than that of the meaneÅ¿t laborer. LeÅ¿s inured to want, thou wouldÅ¿t be leÅ¿s able to provide for its Å¿upply, and have leÅ¿s reaÅ¿on to expect it from the benignity of others. ConÅ¿ider that, even in thy preÅ¿ent
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025234_0164_0FCCAF15289B9588"/>
elevation, thou art really more dependent than the moÅ¿t ignoble of the Å¿ons of men. If he is leaÅ¿t dependent who Å¿tands leaÅ¿t in need of others, he is Å¿urely moÅ¿t dependent who Å¿tands moÅ¿t in need of them. With our rank, our neceÅ¿Å¿ities, our demands, our cares, increaÅ¿e. The links by which we are joined to our fellow men are multiplied, and the very circumÅ¿tance which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges our influence diminiÅ¿hes our internal Å¿trength. He, therefore, who has the greateÅ¿t number of dependents, has only the greateÅ¿t num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoÅ¿e to whom he is indebted for conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and power. The more lofty and Å¿pacious the edifice is, with the greater precipitation, if its pillars are Å¿apped, does it ruÅ¿h into ruin. Learn then to Å¿eek thy importance and dignity, where only thou wilt find them, by diÅ¿charging every duty which thy Å¿tation requires, and by diffuÅ¿ing, by thy affability and beneficence, happineÅ¿s among mankind. RelinquiÅ¿hing the phantoms of pride enjoy the Å¿ubÅ¿tantial pre-eminence of virtue.</p>

               <p>WHOEVER attentively examines the human conÅ¿titution will diÅ¿cover in it Å¿everal inconÅ¿iÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily accounted for. Thus, mankind have a Å¿trong propenÅ¿ity to Å¿ociety, and are miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable without it; yet in Å¿ociety they are prone to indulge the moÅ¿t unÅ¿ocial diÅ¿poÅ¿itions. Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly draws them to their Å¿pecies, and points out their Å¿weeteÅ¿t enjoyments, as Å¿olely derivable from this Å¿ource; yet the Å¿elfiÅ¿h part of our frame, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting this dictate of nature, corrupts the grand Å¿treams of happineÅ¿s, by turning them into its own channel, and, inÅ¿tead of allowing the individual to act as a member of the Å¿ocial body, and to receive from this capacity his higheÅ¿t dignity and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, endeavours to render Å¿ociety Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to the individual. There is in all men a wonderful
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:025234_0167_0FCCAF1B2E11CED8"/>
fondneÅ¿s of independence, and a no leÅ¿s Å¿urpriÅ¿ing deÅ¿ire of the Å¿ervice and reÅ¿pect of others. This is, in fact, to join the greateÅ¿t contradictions, to force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to union things abÅ¿olutely incompatible; for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence can only be Å¿ecured, by an entire Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from mankind, by relinquiÅ¿hing every claim to their good offices and regards, by renouncing every Å¿ocial enjoyment, and by deriving happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s from the Å¿tores of Å¿elf. As Å¿oon as man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Å¿ocial circle, and Å¿hares its beneficial influences, he relinquiÅ¿hes his Å¿eparate exiÅ¿tence, and, forming a part of a Å¿yÅ¿tem, is limited by the relations which he bears to the other parts, and to the whole, becomes bound to contribute to their Å¿upport and perfection, according to the Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and benefit which he receives from them, and is required to exert a beneficial activity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the influence he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es. Whoever with-holds from the general good any portion of uÅ¿eful effort he is able to beÅ¿tow, is unfaithful to the conditions, on which he enjoys the benefits of Å¿ociety, and violates that equality of obligation which Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts among all mankind. He alÅ¿o fruÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, as far as lies in his power, that plan of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiÅ¿dom, whereby the general felicity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For it is certain that the UniverÅ¿al Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent has diÅ¿tributed among men Å¿uch a portion of abilities and powers, as, duly cultivated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:025234_0168_0FCCAF1CB0E75538"/>
would render the condition of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, in every reÅ¿pect, and happy. In the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of Å¿ociety, Å¿ome are, indeed, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened with labour, and enjoy but a Å¿mall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of convenience; while others loiter in indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and conÅ¿ume the fruits of induÅ¿try. This, however, could never be the caÅ¿e, did every one cultivate with diligence his peculiar talents, and diÅ¿charge the duties of his peculiar Å¿tation. It is the neglect of this alone that makes it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to overload Å¿ome, in order to Å¿upport that part of the common burden, from which others have treacherouÅ¿ly withdrawn themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>Hence the principle of <hi>equality,</hi> above illuÅ¿trat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, requires not only that all men Å¿hould religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly regard the rights of others, but that they Å¿hould exert themÅ¿elves, to the utmoÅ¿t of their ability, for the common benefit. Whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects this requiÅ¿ition deÅ¿cends below the rank of a member of Å¿ociety, and, inÅ¿tead of riÅ¿ing, as is fooliÅ¿hly Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, above the reÅ¿t of mankind, by a life of idleneÅ¿s and diÅ¿Å¿ipation, degrades himÅ¿elf to the condition of a begger, who lives on the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of others, without making any juÅ¿t return for it. For, however Å¿trange it may Å¿ound, it is undoubted, that Å¿ociety has a right to the beÅ¿t exertion of all its members, of the higheÅ¿t as well
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:025234_0169_0FCCAF1F501EFBD0"/>
as of the loweÅ¿t, of the moÅ¿t opulent as well as of the pooreÅ¿t, for the common good.</p>
               <p>The queÅ¿tion is not, what advantage every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual is content to reap from his own powers and opportunities, but what degree of general u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility he can effectuate. TheÅ¿e powers have not been beÅ¿towed on him, by their divine author, Å¿olely for his own uÅ¿e, but chiefly for the benefit of the human race, to whoÅ¿e happineÅ¿s he is deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to contribute. This proper exerciÅ¿e of the powers of every individual all the other members of Å¿ociety have a right to demand, on fair and equal terms. The equivalent every individual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains by the advantages and comforts which he receives from Å¿ocial life, and Å¿till more by that Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity which enables any one to live in Å¿loth. He is a debtor to the grand community of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and his creditors can call him to repay.</p>
               <p>It is true that, Å¿ince it is Å¿o difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the extent of every one's capacity, and the exact meaÅ¿ure of the Å¿ocial advantages he enjoys, no preciÅ¿e claim can be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caÅ¿e. But, the general obligation remains equally Å¿trong on all, and none can wilfully vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it without incurring the blame of his own mind, and the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of the author of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence.
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:025234_0170_0FCCAF2089384290"/>
The principle, therefore, on which Å¿ome ancient legiÅ¿lators prohibited any citizen, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever condition or rank, from living in idleneÅ¿s, was perfectly juÅ¿t in itÅ¿elf, although the execution of any law grounded upon it muÅ¿t ever be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult, and might occaÅ¿ion greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences than thoÅ¿e which it Å¿hould be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obviate.</p>
               <p>As indolence, and the neglect of opportunities of utility, are highly unjuÅ¿t, Å¿o they are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemptible. For, what character can be more the object of contempt, than that of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on who, though endowed with active powers, and furniÅ¿hed with ample opportunities of benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that particular Å¿ociety to which he belongs, and from which he receives conÅ¿tant defence and protection, yet lives on the labour either of his predeceÅ¿Å¿ors or contemporaries, without teÅ¿tifying any approbation of their induÅ¿try, by which he Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts, or making any efforts to imitate their laudable example? What can degrade a man more in his own eyes, than the conÅ¿ideration that he has done nothing to benefit his friends, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige his neighbours, to educate and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h his children, or to promote the intereÅ¿t and honour of his country; that he has buried his talents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the end of Providence in beÅ¿towing them,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025234_0171_0FCC92AD96AF1D18"/>
and that, when he is cut off by death, the world will be delivered from an unneceÅ¿Å¿ary burden, from a putrid excreÅ¿cence?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, what can convey, to any perÅ¿on, a higher idea of his own worth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, than the reflection that, though but an individual endowed with one claÅ¿s of abilities, yet, by their improvement, he not only enlarges his own enjoyments, but diffuÅ¿es around him the moÅ¿t joyous influences, and promotes the welfare of the whole human race; that, though retired from public view, he appears in the uÅ¿eful productions of his application and genius; that, though infirm in body, he renders, by his inventions, the labour of the Å¿trong and hardy both more eaÅ¿y to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and more beneficial to others; and that, though devoid of public authority, he Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the political union, and advances public order by the juÅ¿t principles which he eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes and elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidates; that, taking another view of the caÅ¿e, though ignorant and illiterate, yet he contributes, by his toil and dexterity, to the inÅ¿truction and improvement of mankind, while he provides Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and leiÅ¿ure for thoÅ¿e who are endowed with genius and learning, or placed in thoÅ¿e Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where plans of general welfare can be beÅ¿t conceived, and propoÅ¿ed with the greateÅ¿t proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:025234_0172_0FCCAF24E9B21668"/>
of Å¿ucceÅ¿s? In fine, it is an exalting conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that, however obÅ¿cure a perÅ¿on is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, he is an inÅ¿trument in the hand of Providence for communicating to mankind, not only the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿aries of life, but alÅ¿o its higheÅ¿t ornaments and delights, and even of raiÅ¿ing their views a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this terreÅ¿trial abode, and directing them to a Å¿tate of endleÅ¿s felicity, the certainty of which cannot fail to produce the moÅ¿t Å¿alutary effects on every part of their conduct. No perÅ¿on is Å¿o mean and inÅ¿ignificant, as not to affect Å¿ome part of the community. In a grand piece of machinery, the Å¿maller wheels and pins, though leÅ¿s obÅ¿ervable, are not on that account leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary than others to the juÅ¿t motion an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffect of the whole. In like manner, the conduct of the inferior members of Å¿ociety not only affects their own happineÅ¿s, or that of their immediate connections, but diffuÅ¿es its influence, though in a leÅ¿s perceptible manner than that of the higher ranks, through the whole Å¿ocial body. Nay, I may aÅ¿Å¿ert that, as theÅ¿e compoÅ¿e the greater part of the community, their uÅ¿eful induÅ¿try is Å¿till more requiÅ¿ite to the general happineÅ¿s, and that the meaneÅ¿t labourer, who diligently and honeÅ¿tly exerts himÅ¿elf in his Å¿phere, is entitled to Å¿hare, with the moÅ¿t exalted of the Å¿ons of men, the glorious appellation of the friend of mankind, and of the approved of God! Should
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025234_0173_0FCCAF2680951FC8"/>
any whom fortune depreÅ¿Å¿ed, or inÅ¿olence laughs to Å¿corn, but whoÅ¿e Å¿oul, riÅ¿ing above his Å¿ituation, feels the intrinÅ¿ic dignity of man, and laments the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneÅ¿s of his terreÅ¿trial Å¿phere, caÅ¿t his eye on theÅ¿e pages, let him be comforted and Å¿trengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reflections above mentioned. There is Å¿omething in the idea that exalts the mind, that kindles the deÅ¿ire of uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s, that rouÅ¿es activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and puts every faculty in motion. When we conÅ¿ider it, we Å¿eem deÅ¿irous of breaking the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious chains of indolence, and pant for Å¿ome worthy object, Å¿ome important purÅ¿uit, to exerciÅ¿e the generous energies of the Å¿oul!</p>
               <p>If the conÅ¿ideration of the importance of the meaneÅ¿t member of Å¿ociety Å¿hould prove a Å¿trong argument to uÅ¿eful diligence, how much greater force muÅ¿t this argument acquire with regard to thoÅ¿e whom fortune and rank particularly diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Their influence, either good or bad, is very extenÅ¿ive. FirÅ¿t communicated to nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous connections and dependents, it is conveyed through them to other contiguous relations, till it reach at laÅ¿t the extremities of the Å¿ocial Å¿yÅ¿tem. Were this influence always of a beneficial nature, Å¿ociety would feel its Å¿alutary effects through all its frame, and, inÅ¿tead of that diÅ¿tempered and deformed face which it Å¿o frequently wears, would
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025234_0174_0FCCAF29ECC63C08"/>
aÅ¿Å¿ume the moÅ¿t healthy and Å¿miling aÅ¿pect. The face of nature, long hid in fog, or ravaged by tempeÅ¿ts, receives not a more delightful transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the returning Å¿un, than Å¿ociety would receive from thoÅ¿e benignant lights which thus illumined and invigorated it.</p>
               <p>In what light, then, muÅ¿t thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons appear, who, becauÅ¿e their external circumÅ¿tances free them from the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of labouring for their Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tence, imagine themÅ¿elves exempted from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿pecies of uÅ¿eful exertion; who, becauÅ¿e they are provided with the abundant Å¿upply of every corporeal want, think themÅ¿elves under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to improve their minds, or to engage in any purÅ¿uit conducive to the common welfare; who either yawn away their time in the moÅ¿t le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargic indolence, or devote it to the moÅ¿t inÅ¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, frivolous, or vicious enjoyments; who waÅ¿te ingenuity in mere oÅ¿tentation, degrade rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on to purvey for appetite, and make recreation their Å¿tudy, and amuÅ¿ement their buÅ¿ineÅ¿sâin a word, whoÅ¿e whole life is either a blank, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion of exiÅ¿tnece. The phantom of pleaÅ¿ure, like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> inÅ¿tantly diÅ¿appears, when they think they can Å¿eize it. The Å¿ame inÅ¿ipid round is run over a thouÅ¿and times. The Å¿enÅ¿es are jaded, the appetites cloyed. Tired at laÅ¿t
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025234_0175_0FCCAF2AE8EE7C30"/>
with the tedious purÅ¿uit, thoÅ¿e votaries of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, like the top that has long been laÅ¿hed, doÅ¿e in the arms of indolence. When they wake at times from their inÅ¿enÅ¿ibility, their minds are haunted with all the chimeras, all the monÅ¿ters of vapour and Å¿pleen, which often drive them to burÅ¿t, by death, the ponderous fetters with which they are loaded.</p>
               <p>I will not aÅ¿Å¿ert, that all who live in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are Å¿enÅ¿ible of the criminality of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and perceive that, however averÅ¿e from injuÅ¿tice, breach of truÅ¿t, and cruelty in their dealings with particular perÅ¿ons, they yet involve themÅ¿elves, by this negative vice, this neglect of the due improvement of their talents and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities in theÅ¿e crimes with reÅ¿pect to their Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in general. No; I am convinced that, if they clearly perceived the tendency of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, many of them, at leaÅ¿t, would review it with Å¿orrow and diÅ¿guÅ¿t. Ignorance, and wrong habits contracted in early life, more than any vicious diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, are the cauÅ¿es of a courÅ¿e of action Å¿o diÅ¿graceful and unhappy to themÅ¿elves, and Å¿o detrimental to Å¿ociety.</p>
               <p>This reflection, however, if it diminiÅ¿h their criminality, augments the folly of neglecting to
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:025234_0176_0FCCAF2D40407BD0"/>
cultivate thoÅ¿e rational faculties, which would afford them juÅ¿t notions of their duty, and diÅ¿cloÅ¿e an elevated region of purÅ¿uit and happineÅ¿s. For, if they rightly apprehended the relation in which all the members of Å¿ociety Å¿tand to each other, they would perceive that it is not only the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invader, or the Å¿ecret purloiner, of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who muÅ¿t be reputed injurious, but alÅ¿o the indolent and the diÅ¿Å¿ipated, who deprives his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men of any benefit which he is called to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tow. They would Å¿ee that they are under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations not only to abÅ¿tain from poÅ¿itive violations of juÅ¿tice, but alÅ¿o to diÅ¿charge many duties of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed utility to mankind. To theÅ¿e they would acknowledge themÅ¿elves particularly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appointment of Heaven. Relieved from the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of providing for their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real wants, their minds are furniÅ¿hed with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er freedom for the exerciÅ¿e of its nobler powers, and with a more extenÅ¿ive range for the diÅ¿cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and proÅ¿ecution of Å¿chemes of public good. And as thoÅ¿e clouds that obÅ¿cure their underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing began to remove, an hundred untaÅ¿ted Å¿prings of felicity would open on their hearts. For, if every perÅ¿on of fortune and rank employed his moÅ¿t active endeavors to excite and maintain a Å¿pirit of induÅ¿try and virtue among his dependents, his neighbors, and fellow-citizens, he would
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:025234_0177_0FCCAF2F3B0E06D8"/>
find his time and attention Å¿o happily engaged, that he would Å¿urvey with contempt his former pleaÅ¿ures; he would Å¿eem to breathe a purer air, and to live in a region of perpetual Å¿unÅ¿hine, while the vapours of low ambition and of Å¿enÅ¿ual indulgence rolled below his feet!</p>
               <p>Man can only be happy in as far as his powers are duly exerciÅ¿ed; and thoÅ¿e powers, which are the moÅ¿t elevated and capacious, afford the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t Å¿um of felicity. The Å¿ame means, therefore, which render any man moÅ¿t highly beneficial to others, alÅ¿o increaÅ¿e the Å¿um of his own enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Å¿uperadd to them that moÅ¿t delightful of all Å¿atisfactionsâthe conÅ¿ciouÅ¿neÅ¿s of having diÅ¿charged, to the utmoÅ¿t of his power, his duty as a member of the community, and fulfilled the intention of his Creator in Å¿ending him into the world. The neglect of the due improvement of any power, or of any opportunity of honorable action, detracts juÅ¿t Å¿o much from perÅ¿onal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As want of circulation corrupts the air, and Å¿tagnation the water, Å¿o, indolence Å¿uperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a torpor on the mind, which unfits it even for the more refined pleaÅ¿ures of Å¿enÅ¿e, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives it of that great Å¿weetener of every enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the reflection that it is the produce of our own exertions, and the natural recompenÅ¿e of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025234_0178_0FCCAF302D1B2A38"/>
merit. With regard to diÅ¿tinction, acquired by Å¿ucceÅ¿sful exertions of abilities, it is certain, that the Å¿ame obligation which demanded the firÅ¿t diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of them, requires their continuance while any benefit can thence reÅ¿ult to mankind, and their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors are able to confer it. He who has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exerted powers, by which the aggregate of common good has been increaÅ¿ed, has pledged himÅ¿elf to a courÅ¿e of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed utility, and, if he relaxes or ceaÅ¿es his efforts, while his faculties are Å¿till vigorous, is more culpable than if he had never entered on the honorable career; becauÅ¿e practice procures facility, and Å¿ucceÅ¿s Å¿hould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to freÅ¿h enterpriÅ¿e. If Å¿elfiÅ¿h ambition Å¿hould, as is in this caÅ¿e moÅ¿t probable, be the Å¿ole motive to action, let it be conÅ¿idered, that it is perhaps more difficult to preÅ¿erve than to purchaÅ¿e reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and homage. The enÅ¿igns of honor attract the public eye; elevation places men in a more conÅ¿picuous light, where every defect, as well as every virtue, is more clearly diÅ¿cerned, and more nicely Å¿crutinized. If thoÅ¿e, therefore, who are thus diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, are not able to Å¿upport their Å¿ituation with dignity, their diÅ¿grace will, from the diÅ¿appointed expectations of mankind, be more humiliating, and the contempt which they incur more general. Envy will magnify every fault, annihilate every virtue, and laÅ¿h them with the

laurels which Å¿he has torn from their brows. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for themÅ¿elves, and happy for the world, whoÅ¿e intereÅ¿ts are always hurt by the degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of merit, if they had never riÅ¿en above the vulgar level!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII. CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THE view of Å¿ociety, and of the principles on which it is founded, diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed in this EÅ¿Å¿ay, evinces the obligation of all its members, of whatever rank or deÅ¿cription, to contribute their moÅ¿t active and honeÅ¿t endeavors for the common good. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this obligation is Å¿ufficiently inculcated on the lower claÅ¿Å¿es, by the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of laboring for their daily Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence, and by the dreadful conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which idleneÅ¿s produces to them and their families. With regard to theÅ¿e, it is, therefore, leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary to unfold the full force of this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, than with reÅ¿pect to thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e eaÅ¿y cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances, Å¿eeming to render them independent of their fellow men, Å¿eem alÅ¿o to exempt them from every debt beyond the limits of Å¿trict juÅ¿tice. This independence we have Å¿hewn to be purely imaginary, and utterly incompatible with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Å¿ocial union. The chain of dependence
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025234_0181_0FCCAF356DB33FD0"/>
runs equally through all the orders of Å¿ociety, and binds every individual in theÅ¿e orders. While it excludes the extravagant claims of Å¿elf-love, and Å¿ubjects men to more generous and Å¿alutary principles, it eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes at the Å¿ame time a Å¿yÅ¿tem which, if univerÅ¿ally obÅ¿erved, would fully Å¿ecure the moÅ¿t eÅ¿Å¿ential intereÅ¿ts of each individual, by Å¿ettling them on the broad and immoveable baÅ¿is of general welfare. For, did the rich employ their wealth to Å¿upply the wants of the poor; the poor, their labor to adminiÅ¿ter to the eaÅ¿e and convenience of the rich; the great, their power and authority to protect the weak and defenceleÅ¿s; the wiÅ¿e, the ingenious, and the learned, their abilities to inÅ¿truct and counÅ¿el the ignorant and illiterate; did every one, in Å¿hort, impart to his fellow men a portion of the fruits of his talents and advantages; it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible that any Å¿hould repine at another's poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing what was employed for his own benefit, nay, was made more Å¿ubÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his uÅ¿e, than if he himÅ¿elf were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor. For no individual could Å¿o perfectly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate all the different talents, neceÅ¿Å¿ary for his Å¿upport and welfare, which are diÅ¿tributed among the Å¿pecies, and, while Å¿ome particular one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to each, are all carried to the higheÅ¿t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of which they are Å¿uÅ¿ceptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:025234_0182_0FCCAF3703F8F3D8"/>Thus, the principles of equality which we have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, at the Å¿ame time that they repreÅ¿s the inÅ¿olence of pride, the outrages of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and the diÅ¿Å¿ipation of Å¿enÅ¿uality, confirm, nevertheleÅ¿s, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿ubordination, and the juÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of lawful authority. They maintain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate every natural and every civil diÅ¿tinction, draw more cloÅ¿ely every Å¿ocial tie, and unite all in one harmonious and juÅ¿tly proportioned Å¿yÅ¿tem, which brings men together on the even ground of the inherent rights of human nature, of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal obligation, and of a common relation to the community. Yet, for the maintenance of this equality itÅ¿elf, they Å¿eparate them into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent claÅ¿Å¿es, and inveÅ¿t them with different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and offices. Thus are the poor and the mean reconciled to their circumÅ¿tances, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted under themâthe opulent and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are excited to beneficence and condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion; the ingenious and acute are directed to the beÅ¿t uÅ¿e of their abilities; and all are linked together by the powerful ties of common intereÅ¿ts, and of reciprocal duty. Happy thoÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e Å¿ouls are capable of riÅ¿ing to Å¿uch enlarged views of things, and are animated by them to a conduct worthy of human nature, worthy of ChriÅ¿tianity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ents men to each other as children of one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as members of one family, as journeying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:025234_0183_0FCCAF39752FFF50"/>
through the checkered Å¿cenes of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itory world, towards a region where; all the diÅ¿tinctions of poverty and riches, of obÅ¿curity and Å¿plendor, of power and meanneÅ¿s, Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e, every inequality diÅ¿appear; where virtue alone Å¿hall be exalted, and vice degraded forever!</p>
               <p>It muÅ¿t, indeed, be acknowledged, that this theory is too pure and exalted to admit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete conformity of practice. But man is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for endleÅ¿s improvements in knowledge and virtue, and the happineÅ¿s which he attains will exactly correÅ¿pond to the degrees of his progreÅ¿s. In every art and Å¿cience there is an ideal model, which can never be reached even by the moÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and beautiful execution. What Cicero ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erves with regard to a perfect orator, that he had never Å¿een any Å¿peaker that could come up to his notions of eloquence, is not limited to that art, but is equally applicable to every other. It is, however, to be obÅ¿erved, that even the excellence which is attained, is wholly referable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Å¿tandard previouÅ¿ly exiÅ¿ting in the artiÅ¿ts mind. In proportion, therefore, as clear and elevated ideas of excellence are entertained in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in morality, and in politics, and action is directed by theÅ¿e, human conduct and happineÅ¿s will be improved and exalted. If, on the other
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:025234_0184_0FCCAF3AB4BAD720"/>
hand, low and groveling Å¿tandards are adopted, and principles are regulated by eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, not practice reformed by the genuine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of nature, mankind will continue to tread in the old and muddy path, and the progreÅ¿s of the world will be marked with degeneracy and degradation.</p>
               <p>It is the conÅ¿tant objection of thoÅ¿e, who are either averÅ¿e from improvement, or too indolent and too timid to begin or advance it, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection aimed at is too high for human nature. They thus employ the exiÅ¿tence of abuÅ¿es and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as a reaÅ¿on for perpetuating them. But, if the Å¿ame reaÅ¿oning had always been conÅ¿idered as juÅ¿t, mankind would, at this day, dwell in caves, feed upon acorns, fall down before the works of their own hands, and be bound in the heavy chain of Heathen ignorance and Å¿uperÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The inÅ¿titutions and refinements of civil Å¿ociety muÅ¿t appear to a Å¿avage as extravagant and impracticable, as the fineÅ¿t theory of moral Å¿entiment and action appears to thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Å¿ouls are immerÅ¿ed in Å¿enÅ¿uality, or fettered by Å¿elf-intereÅ¿t. The queÅ¿tion is not, what is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent practice of mankind, but what they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ultimately to attain; not how far any theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is conformable to the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of things,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:025234_0185_0FCCAF3D42DF84F8"/>
but how far it is founded in nature, adapted to the human faculties, and conducive to human felicity.</p>
               <p>If the principles illuÅ¿trated in this EÅ¿Å¿ay Å¿hould be devoid of every other recommendation, they have at leaÅ¿t, that which is no inconÅ¿iderable one, of being conformable to the doctrines of ChriÅ¿tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<note n="*" place="bottom">Romans, xii. 3.4.5.6.7. 1Å¿t Cor. xii.</note>. For, although Å¿ome philoÅ¿ophers, who have pretended great zeal for the rights and the happineÅ¿s of mankind, have manifeÅ¿ted, at the Å¿ame time, a Å¿trange antipathy to every kind of religion, and particularly to the ChriÅ¿tian, it will be found, by every impartial inquirer, that the religion of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t inculcates and Å¿anctions every principle on which public and private hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s can be built. It is true that ChriÅ¿tianity has frequently been moÅ¿t Å¿hamefully corrupted, and, in that corrupted form, produced the moÅ¿t dreadful calamities. But, to explode ChriÅ¿tianity on this account, is juÅ¿t as Å¿enÅ¿ible as to forbid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the uÅ¿e of water, air, or fire, becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e elements have often been the vehicles of deÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whoever attempts to erect any Å¿yÅ¿tem of policy to the excluÅ¿ion of religion, betrays great ignorance of human nature, and great indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for human happineÅ¿s. Man is a religious creature, and is drawn to his Creator by all the

The grand requiÅ¿ite, then, is to procure for him a religion pure, Å¿imple, beneficent, and conÅ¿olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. This will be found only in the religion of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, as it is exhibited in the Å¿acred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Here the moÅ¿t perfect Å¿tandard of duty is erected, in order to engage man to an endleÅ¿s progreÅ¿s in virtue; a Å¿ufficient remedy is provided for his deviations from it, when accompanied with penitence; the moÅ¿t glorious rewards are offered to his perÅ¿evering endeavors; and the Å¿trongeÅ¿t Å¿uccours are provided for his weakneÅ¿s. Such a religion powerfully Å¿trengthens every Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and civil obligation, and prepares men for heaven, by rendering them uÅ¿eful on earth.</p>
