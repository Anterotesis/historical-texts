            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MY friends, at a ſolemn marriage-ſupper there is uſually a friendly company who meet together; and when, at ſuch an occaſion, all things are managed with ſobriety and decency, it is very joyful and pleaſant to the parties concerned, to ſee the members of the meeting, with mutual kindneſs to one another, harmoniouſly gracing the ſolemnity: Even ſo <hi>at the marriage-ſupper of the lamb,</hi> I mean, the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, which we have been celebrating, there is a joyful company, not of men and women, for that would make but a poor earthly meeting; not yet of ſaints and angels, for that would make but at beſt a mean creature-meeting; but it is a glorious delightful company of divine attributes and perfections, in the ſweeteſt concord meeting together, and embracing one another. This wonderful conjunction of divine excellencies is the friendly company that meets to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to put honour upon this nuptial ſolemnity; and to ſee them thus harmoniouſly embracing one another in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040455_0003_101645CC33AD3F80"/>
ſalvation of ſinners, <hi>is the ſweeteſt ſight that the bride, the lamb's wife, ſhall ever ſee at the marriage-ſupper,</hi> whether it be at the lower or upper table. There is a great meeting in <hi>this houſe,</hi> but an infinitely greater in this <hi>text</hi>; a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine excellencies, to grace the ſolemnity of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-ſupper of the lamb: <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> When God made heaven and earth out of nothing, he made them by a word, without any other ceremony; but, when he made man, there was ſome particular ſolemnity, a grand council, as it were, of the glorious Trinity called; <hi>Come, let us make man after our image.</hi> But now man having unmade himſelf, if God hath a mind for the praiſe of his own glorious grace to make him up again, <hi>by a new creation in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> there muſt be a more glorious ſolemnity yet; not only a council of the adorable Trinity, but a grand meeting of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, to conſult their own glory that was marr'd, and reconcile their own intereſts, and ſeemingly contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory claims: For the ſin of man had brought real confuſion among all the creatures of God on earth, yea, and ſeeming war among all the attributes of God in heaven, concerning the execution of the ſentence of the law upon mankind, the tranſgreſſor thereof; ſome of theſe attributes, ſuch as <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſaying, if the ſentence of death be executed upon them, how ſhall I be glorified? Others, ſuch as <hi>Truth,</hi> ſaying, if the ſentence be not executed, how ſhall I be glorified? Is it to be expected that ſuch oppoſites can meet together? Or, if they meet, that they will agree together cordially? Yea, tho' it be beyond the expectation of men and angels, yet behold, it is here celebrated with a ſong? <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Pſalm</hi> conſiſts of a <hi>prayer of faith,</hi> and an <hi>anſwer of peace.</hi> 1ſt, The Church's <hi>prayer,</hi> from the beginning to the 8th v. where they are praying for the removal of many tokens of God's diſpleaſure they were under, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040455_0004_101645CEA6582980"/>
their return out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity. 2<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>anſwer of peace</hi> that is made to their prayer, from v. 8. and downward. We have here the pſalmiſt liſtning and waiting for the anſwer; <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak</hi>; the anſwer itſelf in general is peace, <hi>He will ſpeak peace to his people,</hi> &amp;c. If he give not outward peace, yet he will ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt inward peace, ſpeaking that to their hearts by his Spirit, which he had ſpoken to their ears by his word. Whatever other ſort of peace and proſperity they enjoyed, when at length the children of the captivity, after a great deal of toil, had gained a ſettlement in their own land, yet peace with God, and ſpiritual proſperity under the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was the great thing here promiſed, and propheſied of; and that is a peace that lays the ſoul under the ſtrongeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to keep at a diſtance from all ſin, which is the greateſt folly, and to beware of backſliding thereto. <hi>But let them not return again to folly:</hi> For true peace with God brings in war with ſin. But this is further explained in the main leading part thereof, namely, <hi>ſalvation</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Surely his ſalvation is near to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.</hi> Now, whatever other ſalvation be here imported, Chriſt is the great ſalvation intended. When he is near in view, then the believer cries out, with old <hi>Simeon, Now mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation</hi>: And, whatever other glory and honour be here imported Chriſt is the chief glory here intended: When he goes away from a land, then <hi>Ichabod, the glory is departed</hi>; but, <hi>where he abides, glory dwells</hi>: for he is called, <hi>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people</hi> Iſrael. But now, if we would know what ſort of glory it is that appears when Chriſt is revealed, why it is even the glorious harmony of all the divine attributes illuſtriouſly ſhining in him, who is both <hi>our ſalvation</hi> and <hi>our glory; Mercy and truth are met together; righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> Now, tho' theſe words may be applied to the happy meeting of graces in men, upon the revelation of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040455_0005_101645D3C0FB01D0"/>
Chriſt in the ſoul, which I may afterwards obſerve in the ſequel, and in which ſenſe ſome interpreters underſtand it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I take it mainly to import <hi>the happy meeting of perfections in God to be glorified in the ſinner's ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is a gloſs that no interpreter I have had occaſion to conſult does neglect or omit; and, if any of them ſhould miſs it, I think they would miſs the very ground-work and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other happy meetings: <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words you may obſerve, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The <hi>members</hi> of the meeting. 2<hi>dly,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of the meeting. 3<hi>dly,</hi> the <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of the meeting. 4<hi>thly,</hi> The <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, I ſay, 1. The <hi>members</hi> of the meeting, <hi>mercy, truth, righteouſneſs, peace.</hi> I hope I need not caution ſome in this aſſembly that they beware of imagining theſe various perfections of God, under the names of <hi>mercy, truth, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> as if they were really diſtinct and different things in God; or, as if they were really different parties, making a formal conſultation, in order, to their agreement; <hi>For God is one,</hi> and cannot be divided; <hi>he is one infinite, eternal and unchangeable Being</hi>; there are not diſtinct and different things in his nature and eſſence, however his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be thus repreſented to our weak, finite capacities, which cannot underſtand the perfections of God but in ſeveral parts, as it were. By <hi>mercy</hi> then, here, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand God himſelf, as he is a <hi>merciful and a gracious God:</hi> By <hi>truth</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>the ſame God,</hi> as he is a <hi>true and faithful God:</hi> By <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> we may underſtand his <hi>juſtice,</hi> or God himſelf, as he is a <hi>juſt and righteous God</hi>; and, by <hi>peace,</hi> the ſame God, as he is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> and a <hi>God reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> So that the whole comes to this; it is the great and eternal God himſelf, conſulting with himſelf, in a manner becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his infinite and adorable perfections, how to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all his glorious attributes in the way of ſaving ſinners in and by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> and remarkableneſs of this meeting? For the agreement of theſe parties met together is the more remarkable, in regard of their jarring and oppoſite claims: For that <hi>mercy and peace ſhall meet together,</hi> and agree in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſave us, and that <hi>truth and righteouſneſs</hi> ſhould meet together, and agree in juſtice to deſtroy us, were not ſo ſtrange and remarkable. And, if they had kept ſeparate and remain'd ſo, man had been for ever ſeparate from God, and ſome darling attributes had never been glorified in man's ſalvation, our ſin and rebellion having in a manner ſet the attributes of God at ſuch variance, as nothing elſe than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom could provide a ſufficient anſwer to all their contradictory claims and intereſts, which behoved to be done ere the propoſal concerning the ſalvation of any ſinner could be gone into. Why, ſays <hi>mercy,</hi> it is my intereſt that the ſinner live and not periſh, that I may be magnified, ſince I have ſaid, that <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> Well, but, ſays <hi>truth,</hi> it is my intereſt as a God of truth that the ſinner die, ſince I have ſaid, that <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> Yea, and ſays <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> I muſt join with <hi>truth,</hi> and claim the ſinner's damnation for the advancement of my

No, no; <hi>angelical</hi> wiſdom ſays, <hi>It is not in me.</hi> Well, ſince creature wiſdom fails, may we addreſs the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom of the Deity, and enquire at a higher hand? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, now we have taken upon us to ſpeak unto the Lord, who are but duſt and aſhes</hi>: What ſayſt thou, O infinitely wiſe Jehovah? Can theſe oppoſite claims be reconciled, to the ſatisfaction of all parties, and the ſalvation of the ſinner? Yea, it is done, <hi>it is done in a crucified Chriſt,</hi> whom we have been remembring at this ſolemnity; and therefore we may ſing this marvellous ſong upon an after review of it, ſaying, <hi>Glory, glory, glory to God, that mercy and truth are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION. <hi>That in the ſalvation of ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt the glorious attributes and perfections of God do harma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly conſpire and embrace one another.</hi> Or thus, <hi>That in Chriſt crucified for the Redemption of ſinners, all the glorious
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040455_0008_101645D9260A8298"/>
attributes of the divine Majeſty do harmoniouſly conſpire, and embrace one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God is well pleaſed, no perfection of God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed; <hi>but God is well pleaſed in Chriſt</hi>: And therefore every perfection of his nature is well pleaſed, none of them diſpleaſed or diſſatisfied, but all pleaſed and ſatisfied to the full. See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. This is declared by an audible voice from heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3. laſt. And why? Even for the reaſon you have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21. We ſee <hi>he hath brought in a righteouſneſs</hi> anſwering the demands of all that ſtood in the way of our ſalvation: Did divine <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſay, that the threatning of the law muſt be executed, ſo ſure as God is true, as well as its precept obtemperated and obeyed? Well, can a righteouſneſs, ſatisfying both theſe demands, do the buſineſs? Yea, ſays <hi>juſtice</hi> itſelf, in concert with <hi>mercy,</hi> if there be but one righteous man in the <hi>Sodom</hi> of this earth, that can ſatisfy my broken and violated law, in its command of perfect obedience, and in its demand of complete ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then I will ſpare all the elect world, for the ſake of that one righteous man, and, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſervant juſtify many.</hi> Well, ſays <hi>mercy,</hi> here is one whoſe name is <hi>wonderful,</hi> and whom they call <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God-man, who hath <hi>brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> both active and paſſive, ſuiting the precept and penalty of the law: Why then, might one attribute ſay to another, we are all pleaſed, and with one conſent let it be proclaimed on earth, that <hi>the Lord is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake; for he hath magnified the law, and made it honourable.</hi> And now the great affair of man's ſalvation is ſo well concerted and contrived, that God may have mercy upon them, and be at peace with poor ſinners, without any wrong to his truth and righteouſneſs: The attributes of God have met and agreed, and ſealed their agreement with a kiſs of infinite

kindneſs, harmony and ſatisfaction; <hi>Mercy and truth have met together, righteouſneſs &amp; peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>

            <p>Now, that I may ſpeak to this Purpoſe a little more fully, the method I propoſe is,
<list>
                  <item>1. To touch a little at this queſtion, who are the <hi>members</hi> of this meeting? Or, what are theſe <hi>attributes of God,</hi> which do thus harmoniouſly conſpire together, propoſing their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious claims?</item>
                  <item>2. I would enquire, <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it is that <hi>they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> and embrace one another?</item>

                  <item>4. <hi>Why,</hi> or for what <hi>reaſon</hi> it is that they have met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus harmoniouſly?</item>
                  <item>5. Make ſome <hi>application.</hi>
                  </item>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would ſpeak a little of the <hi>members</hi> of this meeting, or the attributes of God that thus harmoniouſly conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. We need not aſk, at whoſe <hi>inſtance</hi> this meeting is called? It is at the inſtant, and by the order of JEHOVAH, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, one God; his ſovereign will and pleaſure reſolving, in a manner like himſelf, to concert with himſelf. Neither need we aſk, what is <hi>the occaſion</hi> of the meeting? Why, man had ſinned, and all mankind, by their ſin, was involved under the curſe of the law, and wrath of God; and yet God had reſolved and decreed, for the glory of his grace and mercy, to ſave a world of ſinners, <hi>elect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foreknowledge of God.</hi> And while <hi>grace mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are upon this loving deſign of ſaving ſinners, it was fit that <hi>juſtice, truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſhould be called into the ſame council, to appear for their intereſt; ſince the propoſal of ſuch a ſalvation of ſinners ſeem to encroach upon their honour, which required the vengeance due to be executed upon the <hi>ſinner.</hi> Well, the meeting being called, theſe glorious perfections, <hi>mercy, truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> full of pity, <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> full of fury, which made a ſeeming controverſy in heaven. We
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040455_0010_101645DF26C0FD70"/>
may ſuppoſe <hi>Adam arraigned in the name of all mankind, and ſtanding as a trembling priſoner at the bar</hi>; yea, his very tongue chained up in ſilence, by reaſon of ſin and guilt, and he ſentenced to eternal death, and ready to have the ſentence executed upon him and all his poſterity. We may ſuppoſe, next, <hi>the ſeveral members of the meeting opening the aſſembly,</hi> by putting in their ſeveral claims; and we may obſerve them in the order of the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. MERCY, being full of pity towards the miſerable, comes walking along <hi>in the cool of the evening,</hi> and meekly craving leave to ſpeak, notwithſtanding that <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> be preſent at the meeting: <hi>It is true,</hi> ſays MERCY, <hi>That man hath ſinned, and juſt that man ſhall die; but art not thou, O Lord, full of pity and compaſſion, the Lord, the Lord God, pardoning iniquity tranſgreſſion and ſin? What tho' man hath ſinned and is all over be ſmeared with mire and blood? yet look upon him in love, and deſtroy not the work of thy own hand; he was made a child after thy own image: Tho' now his garment be rent and all bloody, yet ſee, is not this thy ſon's coat?</hi> JOSEPH <hi>is gone, and wilt thou loſe</hi> BENJAMIN <hi>alſo? Angels are gone, and ſhall men be loſt alſo? Miriads of angels are fallen, and that irrecoverably; and ſhall man pereſh alſo? O ſpare him! is he not a little one? and his ſoul ſhall live. I ſee,</hi> might MERCY ſay, <hi>that</hi> TRUTH <hi>and</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS <hi>or</hi> JUSTICE, <hi>which have the poor ſinner in their chains, are here preſent ready to ſpeak in this aſſembly for their intereſt and honour againſt the criminal: But let it be marked in the minutes of this court, that</hi> MERCY <hi>craves to be magnified and muſt have honour at this meeting.</hi> Well, MERCY having ſpoken her mind,</p>
            <p n="2">2. TRUTH comes in naked and open-mouthed, <hi>in favour of God's faithfulneſs,</hi> and in oppoſition to man's perfidy and treachery, ſaying, <hi>I have heard what</hi> MERCY <hi>craves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this criminal; but, O thou faithful and true God, the word is gone out of thy mouth, and there is no revoking of it; thou
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040455_0011_101645E25E8E4FB8"/>
haſt ſaid to</hi> Adam, In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely die; <hi>and now he hath eaten, he hath ſinned, and ſhall he not die? What, is there</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay <hi>with God, who hath faithfulneſs for the girdle of his loins? Muſt not God's word of threatning take effect? Yea, heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but a jot of his word ſhall not fall to the ground: And therefore, whatever be the demand of</hi> MERCY, <hi>let it be marked in the records of this meeting, that</hi> TRUTH <hi>craves to be magnified; and that it's honour be not infringed in the leaſt, by any claim or plea that</hi> MERCY <hi>had brought in.</hi> Well, TRUTH having ſpoken, gives way to her ſiſter <hi>juſtice</hi>; and thereupon,</p>
            <p n="3">3. RIGHTEOUSNESS or <hi>juſtice</hi> comes in, and impleads againſt the rebel ſinner: <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> I ſay, bringing her ſcales in her hand, in which ſhe had tried him, and found him lighter than vanity itſelf: <hi>he is weighed in the balances, and found wanting</hi>; yea, not only wanting and deſtitute of all that perfection and obedience which the law requir'd, but full of all that rebellion which the law diſcharged, having <hi>ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God</hi>; and ſo is righteouſly ſubjected to the ſanction of the law, and ſentence of eternal death: And therefore, ſays RIGHTEOUSNESS,
<q>O thou infinitely righteous and juſt judge, MERCY can have no hearing in this court to the prejudice of thy honour and glory, as a juſt and righteous God. As TRUTH hath pronounced the ſentence of wrath &amp; vengeance againſt ſin; ſo, if thou be a juſt God, the infinite vengeance due to ſuch an infinite evil muſt be executed to the full. This criminal is my priſoner, and looſed he ſhall not be, till I get full ſatisfaction, and my ſword be drunk with blood; for, vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, ſaith the Lord; and I will by no means clear the guilty: And therefore let it be regiſter'd in this court, that RIGHTEOUSNESS craves to be magnified, &amp; JUSTICE to be glorified in a full ſatisfaction; and this is claimed and demanded in the name of the righteous and juſt judge of the univerſe; and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040455_0012_101645E4D8259848"/>
ſhall not the judge of all the earth do right?</q>
Here is the language of <hi>juſtice.</hi> What then? O! ſhall the demand of <hi>mercy</hi> be utterly run down by theſe powerful oppoſing pleas of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>? Is there no friends in this court to take <hi>mercy</hi>'s part? Yea, there is: Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. PEACE immediately ſteps in with an olive-branch in her hand ſaying,
<q>Fury is not in me; and may I ſpeak a word in behalf of forlorn mankind? may I offer a meek anſwer to the claim of TRUTH and RIGHTEOUSNESS, which they have advanced in oppoſition to the demand of MERCY? for a ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath.</q>
Well, PEACE being allowed a hearing, propoſes a healing overture ſaying,
<q>O thou God of peace, may not an atonement be made, a reconciliation thought of betwixt thy Majeſty and and thy creature? May not one befound out to ſtand in the gap, and bear off this wrath, to become ſurety for the great debtor, to acquit and liberate this poor miſerable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and criminal? May not one be found out that will make up the breach, by vindicating the honour of TRUTH and ſatisfying the demands of JUSTICE, and ſo making way for the claim of MERCY; and then all differences may be peaceably compoſed, ſo as we may harmoniouſly agree and kiſs one another? O! may not then a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker be found out, in whom we may find all our demands ſatisfied at once, without prejudging one another; why, if ſuch an one can be found, ſurely his name ſhall be called wonderfull, counſellor, the prince of peace.</q>
Well, the overture and propoſal of <hi>peace</hi> being recorded amonſt the reſt of the archives of the glorious court; and it being ſuch a peaceable overture, no members of the meeting could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it: But the great Queſtion then is, how it could be effectuate: For, if one man ſin againſt another, a man might determine; but, if a man ſin againſt <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him? For when an infinite majeſty is offended, who among <hi>finite creatures</hi> is able to ſatisfy it, or,
<q>What can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040455_0013_101645E65D69D0D0"/>
the king's loſs? Wherewith <hi>then</hi> ſhall <hi>he</hi> come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, or bow <hi>himſelf</hi> before the moſt high God? Will thouſands of rams <hi>do it,</hi> or ten thouſands rivers of oil, or the fruit of the body for the ſin of the ſoul? <hi>No, no</hi>; ſacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not; <hi>for</hi> it is impoſſible that the blood of bulls or of goats ſhould take away ſin;</q>
Heb. 10.5. What then, will angels become ſurety for the ſin of man? No, no; tho' they had a will, they have not power, they have but oil enough in their veſſels for their own lamps. What then ſhall be done? Why, might <hi>Peace</hi> ſay, let us not ſtand in a demur; we have infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> here preſent with us at this meeting, let us hear her judgment concerning this peaceable propoſal, if it be poſſible that ſuch a perſon can be found in whom we may harmoniouſly centre at laſt. Then WISDOM ſits down upon the privy-council bench, &amp;, being full of eyes, does gravely determine this doubtful <hi>caſe</hi> with a happy iſſue:
<q>It is expedient, ſays WISDOM, that one die for the people, that the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind periſh not; but he muſt be ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, that can juſtify many; yea, he that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this, muſt be finite, that he may die; and infinite, that he may conquer death, and ſatisfy infinite juſtice: But lo, there is no ſuch to be found among all the creatures that ever God made, neither can ſuch an one be found, unleſs the Son of God himſelf, the ſecond perſon of the glorious Trinity, ſhall be pleaſed, by an unſpeakable myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to become fleſh, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, that they may receive the adoption of ſons, Gal. 4.4. <hi>That ſo, when he, that hath no ſin, ſhall become ſin for man; man who hath no righteouſneſs, may become the righteouſneſs of God through him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. laſt: <hi>And thus</hi> MERCY <hi>may be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,</hi> TRUTH <hi>juſtified,</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS <hi>cleared,</hi> JUSTICE <hi>ſatisfyed,</hi> PEACE <hi>concluded, &amp; all contented.</hi>
               </q>
WISDOM hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined how this propoſal of peace might be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040455_0014_101645E9B330E390"/>
all parties hearkned, as it were, with pleaſure, and willingly ſubſcribed to the happy overture; and then heaven and earth conſpired together in ſolemn thankſgiving, ſaying, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, and good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi> Thus the jarring attributes of God are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; and behold, the members of the meeting, that ſeemed to be at the greateſt variance, are embracing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in their Arms; <hi>Mercy and truth are met together,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing was, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> did theſe bleſſed parties meet together? When we ſpeak of a remarkable meeting, it is uſual to enquire into the time and place of the meeting. Now, the <hi>place</hi> where, and the <hi>time</hi> when, as to this wonderful meeting, are two queſtions, which I put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for they may both be anſwered at once, becauſe of their near relation.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Then, in general, the <hi>meeting-place,</hi> or the place of meeting, is CHRIST; and the time of the meeting was when Chriſt put himſelf in our room, or ſubſtitute himſelf in the place of the ſinner, to anſwer all the demands of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the meeting, who had any objection againſt our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or any thing to lay to our charge. Where then, and when did they <hi>meet together and kiſs each other</hi>? Why, it was even in Chriſt, when he took our law-room, to pay our debt, and purchaſe our liberty in ſuch a manner as <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> might have their intereſts advanced, without injury to <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>; that <hi>mercy</hi> might have vent to the credit of <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> might be proclaimed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and the ſinner ſaved to the ſatisfaction of <hi>juſtice.</hi> They meet together and embrace each other in him as the ſurety, <hi>the ſurety of the better teſtament,</hi> Heb. 7.22. We were <hi>debtors</hi> to the mandatory and minatory part of the law, arraigned at the inſtance of divine <hi>juſtice</hi> to pay the debt; Chriſt ſubſtitutes himſelf in our room, and comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law to pay the whole debt. It is true, the debt was perſonal, and <hi>juſtice</hi> had a demand upon the perſon that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040455_0015_101645EC5AA78450"/>
by virtue of the covenant of works; but that covenant never excluded a ſurety, tho' it provided none. The law promiſed life, upon our perſonal obedience; but, in caſe we fail, it revealed no ſurety to make out an obedience in our room. There behoved indeed to be a ſecret reſerve in the covenant of works, whereby the perfect obedience of another was not excluded: For, if the covenant of works had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excluded a ſurety in our room, then the covenant of grace had been excluded, and our ſalvation had been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible after our fall; but tho' the covenant of works did not exclude a ſurety, yet that covenant did neither provide nor reveal a ſurety: This is done in the covenant of grace, which is Chriſt as ſurety fulfilling for us the covenant of works, in all the articles of it. Now, is truth and faithfulneſs at any loſs here? No, the truth of the promiſe &amp; threatning both of the law of works, is fulfilled. On the one hand, the promiſe of eternal life made to perfect obedience; which, tho' we forfeited in our own perſon, yet we recover in the perſon of Chriſt; the promiſe of life upon the ground and condition of perfect obedience being fulfilled to us in him, who hath yielded that perfect obedience in our room: On the other hand, divine <hi>truth</hi> and faithfulneſs, in the threatning of the law, which was death, is glorified, in that it is fulfilled upon the ſurety; while we, who came under the ſentence of death in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> undergo that death in the ſecond. Again, is <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> at any loſs by this ſurety in our room? No, no; whether we look upon it as vindictive or retributive juſtice, vindictive juſtice is diſplayed in its utmoſt ſeverity upon Chriſt; <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and the man that is my fellow</hi>: And ſo the ſword is drunk in his blood to infinite ſatisfaction. Retributive juſtice is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplayed alſo, in the ſinner's being rewarded, juſtified, ſaved upon this ground. It is true, might JUSTICE ſay,
<q>I could have demanded ſatisfaction upon the ſinner himſelf in his own perſon; but, as I can ſuſtain no injury to my
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040455_0016_101645EF04B21278"/>
honour by ſuch a ſurety as this, whom they call EMMANUEL' God-man, ſo I find my honour &amp; intereſt, inſtead of being impaired, is advanced by this exchange of perſons: For, tho' I ſhould damn the ſinner to all eternity, I'll never get ſuch full and compleat ſatisfaction upon any finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I will get by one ſtroke of my avenging ſword upon that perſon of infinite dignity; and ſo it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</q>
Why then, they meet together and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another in him, as a ſurety; and, if <hi>truth</hi> &amp; <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> be both pleaſed to the full, the parties cannot but all agree &amp; embrace each other. Again they meet together and embrace one another in him, as a ſacrifice <hi>a ſacrifice &amp; offering of a ſweet-ſmelling favour unto God,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Why <hi>he offered up himſelf by the eternal Spirit.</hi> O great! Even by his eternal Godhead; a valuable ſacrifice indeed! They meet together in him, as a propitiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Behold him righteous in ſhewing mercy; here is the atonement, the propitiation, that very word which the <hi>ſeptuagint</hi> calls the <hi>mercy-ſeat</hi> in the old teſtament; and it is the word that the poor publican made uſe of, when he was ſeeking mercy, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> He remembred this mercy-ſeat and propitiation. It is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mercy that he ſought, but mercy through a propitiation; he looked to the blood of atonement, to the ſacrificed lamb of God, ſaying, Give me mercy for this; by that ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation be thou propitious to me. Here it is, that <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> meet together. They meet together in him, as a ranſom, <hi>Job</hi> 33.24. <hi>Deliver his ſoul from going down to the pit; I have found a ranſom.</hi> In a word they have met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and kiſſed one another in a crucified Chriſt, whoſe death was the payment of our debt, the puniſhment of our ſin, the price of our redemption, and a purchaſe of our life, liberty and eternal ſalvation. Here is the meeting-place then of theſe glorious perfections of God; here is the perſon in whom
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040455_0017_101645F17397D320"/>
they centre, that they may be all glorified to the higheſt: <hi>Mercy, truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> all are pleaſed. <hi>Mercy</hi> is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and conſtitutes him to be the mercy-ſeat; <hi>truth</hi> is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and centers in him as the <hi>way, the truth and the life; righteouſneſs</hi> is contented, and declares him to be the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs; peace</hi> is pacified, &amp; proclaims him to be the <hi>prince of peace.</hi> Yea, not only are all the members of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſed and ſatisfied for themſelves, in the advancement of their own particular intereſt, but they are infinitely well pleaſed in each other, and that the intereſts of their ſeemingly oppoſite parties are advanced, as well as their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular claims: <hi>Mercy</hi> is pleaſed that truth hath got all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and truth is pleaſed that <hi>mercy</hi> hath got all her deſire, and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is pleaſed that peace is proclaimed, and peace is pleaſed that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is honoured. <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> rejoice that they are magnified to the infinite glory of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> rejoice that they are glorified to the infinite pleaſure of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>: and hence they not only meet together, but kiſs one another. Here you ſee where they meet together: So much for an anſwer thereto more generally.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> More particularly, as to the <hi>meeting-time,</hi> you may take theſe <hi>following paticulars</hi> for the further clearing of it. Altho' this <hi>bleſſed meeting</hi> once taking place is ſtill continued, and cannot be ſaid properly to adjourn from <hi>time</hi> to <hi>time,</hi> and from <hi>place</hi> to <hi>place</hi>; for this aſſembly never diſſolves: Yet, in a ſuitableneſs to our weak capacity and finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which cannot rightly conceive of a meeting that never had a time to meet, becauſe they met in eternity, and never ſhall have a time to part, becauſe they meet to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; we cannot conceive of it, I ſay, but by taking it, as it were, into ſo many parts, or conſidering it in ſo many peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods: And there are theſe eight remarkable periods: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> meet with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and kiſs each other.</p>

The firſt remarkable period is this, they meet together at the council-table of the <hi>covenant of redemption</hi> from all eternity, before ever the foundation of the world was laid; and ere ever the morning-ſtars ſang together, <hi>mercy and truth met together, righteouſneſs and peace kiſſed each other</hi>: For the council of peace did then meet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. and all was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed by infinite wiſdom, how <hi>mercy</hi> ſhould be magnified, <hi>truth</hi> cleared, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> vindicated, &amp; <hi>peace</hi> concluded, and all in Chriſt, who according to the tenor of that covenant (whereof the covenant of grace is but a tranſcript) was to give <hi>his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> &amp; then was to <hi>ſet his ſeed,</hi> &amp; <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord</hi> to <hi>proſper in his hand.</hi> Then it was that this pleaſant meeting in him was firſt conſtituted, as you may ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30.31. <hi>He</hi> being <hi>ſet up from everlaſting; ere ever the earth was,</hi> God in all his glorious perfections was delighted in him, and in him his <hi>delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> This was the grand meeting, at which the time and place of all the ſubſequent meetings were concerted, and all the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars we are to mention are but the reſult of this, and as it were emanations therefrom, for it is a meeting that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſſolves, tho' in ſeveral periods it appears like a new meeting unto us. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> after man had made himſelf naked and obnoxious to the flaming ſword of divine juſtice. Mercy comes walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the guilty criminal being examined in open court, behold <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meet together in the happy ſentence that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent,</hi> Gen. 3.15. Behold <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> kiſſing one another in the righteous vengeance that was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the devil and his works, in order to effectuate a happy peace betwixt God and man. This meeting was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually cleared up under the old teſtament, and in the legal ſacrifices, pointing out the great propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:040455_0019_101645F668B9E358"/>3. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at <hi>Bethlehem Ephratah,</hi> upon Chriſt's Incarnation, <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at the banks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> when Chriſt was baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> when Chriſt, <hi>being in an agony, did ſweat great drops of blood,</hi> under the preſſure of avenging juſtice; every drop of blood was an ocean of mercy: And, while he was preſt in the wine-preſs of God's wrath, <hi>mercy</hi> was expreſt. No mercy to Chriſt; for <hi>God ſpared not his own for,</hi> even when he cried, mercy, mercy, God's mercy; ſaying, <hi>Father, if it be thy will remove this cup from me.</hi> No, no, no mercy was ſhewn to him, otherwiſe no mercy had been ſhown to us: Juſtice muſt have its due from him, that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might have vent towards us; and ſo here <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meet together.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another remarkable period is their meeting on mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where Chriſt was crucified. It was upon the croſs of Chriſt that <hi>mercy and truth meet together,</hi> that <hi>righteouſneſs and peace kiſſed each other</hi>; for there it was that he paid all the elect's debt to the laſt farthing that truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could demand, until <hi>he cried with a loud voice, and ſaid, It is finiſhed.</hi> Having done all that the law could injoin, he ſuffered all that the law could threaten, ſo as it cannot crave a farthing more. It is finiſhed; all that was ſtipulated for with the Father in that federal tranſaction; all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in that eternal compact is finiſhed; every article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to in the counſel of peace was finiſhed. The bargain that he had ſigned with his hand, he now ſealed with his blood; and in his appearance upon the croſs, or in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the death, did all the attributes of God meet, as in a centre: And on this account was mount <hi>Calvary</hi> more glorious than mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; for in mount <hi>Sinai</hi> God appeared
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:040455_0020_101645F858E72EE0"/>
in his terrible majeſty, making the mountain to tremble, and the earth to ſhake; but here in mount <hi>Calvary</hi> he appeared, not only in his terrible majeſty, but in his tender mercy; in his terrible fury againſt ſin, &amp; in his tender favour towards the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; &amp; now, the controverſy betwixt <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> ſeems at a criſis. Here was the critical juncture, wherein their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent demands behoved to be decided; and it was done with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſolemnity, as made the whole univerſe, as it were to tremble and quake: For then did God <hi>ſhake, not the earth only, but alſo heaven</hi>; for, when Chriſt was under the mighty load of this terrible wrath in the ſinner's room, there was a great earthquake, and the heavens grew black, the ſun was eclipſed, and that at a time contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rules of nature; which made a heathen philoſopher, at a diſtance, cry out, <hi>That either the frame of nature was on the point of diſſolution, or the God of nature was ſuffering</hi>: And indeed he was ſuffering unto blood, and unto death. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the living and eternal God here, in our nature, wounded to death and bleeding out his life, to be a ſacrifice for ſin, that juſtice might be ſatisfied, and mercy might be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and all the attributes of God glorified to the higheſt. O wonder, that <hi>Golgotha,</hi> the place of a ſcull, ſhould be ſuch a famous meeting-place for the divine perfections? It was a place of the greateſt ſhame and ignominy; but in him <hi>who endured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> it was made a place of moſt reſplendent glory: For, in the croſs of Chriſt, <hi>mercy and truth, righteouſneſs and peace met and embraced each other.</hi> God's attributes did harmoniouſly join together, ſo as the one does not blacken, but illuſtrate the glory of the other, while they ſhined gloriouſly in the face of Chriſt crucified, as a beautiful and bright conſtellation; for he was <hi>ſet forth to be a propitiation, to declare the righteouſneſs</hi> and juſtice of God, together with his other glorious names.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another remarkable period is there meeting together at the bar of God's great juſtice-court in heaven, <hi>within the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:040455_0021_101645FD03364BD0"/>
vail, whither the forerunner hath for us entred, even Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 6. <hi>laſt.</hi> When Chriſt was upon the croſs, <hi>the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,</hi> &amp; a way was made for entring into the holy of holies. And as the prieſts under the law were not only to offer the ſacrifice without the camp, but after that were to enter the holieſt of all, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, but with the blood of the ſacrifice, <hi>to ſprinkle the mercy ſeat,</hi> Lev. 16.14, 15. Even ſo <hi>Chriſt, having offered himſelf a ſacrifice, and ſuffered without the gate,</hi> Heb. 13.12. <hi>He is entred into the holy place by his own Blood,</hi> Heb. 9.12. there to appear as our high prieſt, in the power and virtue of his blood, to make a full atonement, and ſprinkle the mercy-ſeat. Hence believers are ſaid <hi>to be come to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling.</hi> And where is this? Even in heaven, as you ſee in the context, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23, 24. Now, in this work, Chriſt carried the price of his blood into the very preſence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. and paid it down before him; and, in this act, juſtice hath its ſatisfaction brought home; and, by this act, mercy and juſtice actually are met: For hereby Chriſt ſprinkled the very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat with blood all over, both <hi>upon</hi> it, and <hi>before</hi> it, as the forecited <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. repreſents: For the mercy-ſeat of old ſtood ſo, that it could be ſeen but two ways, namely, upon it, and before it, as a table next to the wall; and ſo this points out, that whatever way we look to mercy by faith, we may ſee mercy and blood mixt, mercy and juſtice met together, and all ſorts of mercy conveyed thro' the blood of Chriſt, top-mercies, and ſide-mercies, upper-mercies of a ſpiritual nature, and lower mercies of a temporal nature; for the mercy-ſeat is ſprinkled with the blood upon it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and whatever way you look to it. The ſacrifice was finiſhed on the croſs, and all ſacrifices finiſhed therein; but the blood of the ſacrifice behoved alſo to be carried within the vail in order to the full atonement, that what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in blood upon the croſs, might be ſealed in the preſence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:040455_0022_101645FFAC4F7D98"/>
of God at the heavenly bar: And we act not our faith far enough for redemption, unleſs we follow Chriſt from the croſs to the bar of God's juſtice-court in heaven, to ſee all ſealed and ſecured there within the vail, where this blood is expoſed, as it were, and pled at the bar; where <hi>mercy and juſtice meet together, and embrace each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at the bar of conſcience, God's lower court, on the day of actual reconciliation betwixt God and the ſinner: For then, <hi>the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit did offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God, doth purge the conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9.14. And <hi>the blood of ſprinkling, wherewith the conſcience is purged from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> doth put forth it's purgative power and virtue by a certain internal ſpeech; and what doth it ſpeak in the conſcience? <hi>It ſpeaks better things than the blood of</hi> Abel; that ſpeaks <hi>vengeance,</hi> but this ſpeaks <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> in conjunction with <hi>truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi>: For, wherever juſtice ſatisfying blood cries for mercy and peace, there <hi>mercy and truth, righteouſneſs and peace meet, and embrace each other.</hi> This blood is the cement whereby they are joined together. Before this blood be applied, the conſcience of the convinced ſinner is all in a flame, like mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; thunder and lightning, and ſmoak and darkneſs, and fear of hell and vengeance, compaſſing the ſoul about, while it is arraigned at the inſtance of the fiery law, to pay the double debt to the mandatory &amp; minotary part of the law, that is, perfect obedience upon the pain of eternal death and damnation. The ſinner finds himſelf loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever by this law: But then, whenever the blood of ſprinkling comes in, and appears at the bar of conſcience, it ſpeaks better things; it is a better ſpeaker than the law: And what ſays it? Why, the language of it is, By your leave, O <hi>law,</hi> you have nothing to crave; for Chriſt the Son of God was arraigned at the inſtance of divine juſtice, to pay
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:040455_0023_101646032F334080"/>
all this debt, becauſe he was this ſinner's ſurety and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; and he actually paid it, by obeying the command, and undergoing the penalty of the law: And for this I produce the ancient records of God; <hi>In the volume of</hi> his <hi>book it is written of</hi> Chriſt, that <hi>when ſacrifice and offering would not, he ſaid, Lo, I come, I delight to do thy will</hi>; and that <hi>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</hi>; That <hi>he was made a curſe for us</hi>; yea, that <hi>he was made ſin for us,</hi> even he <hi>who knew no ſin, that we might become the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> And therefore, O <hi>law,</hi> tho' thou haſt <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> on thy ſide, yet <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> have met with <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and they have concerted matters, and agreed harmoniouſly, and kiſs'd one another, in token of their full agreement in Chriſt; ſo that in Chriſt all charges are anſwered, and thus in the believer's conſcience parties meet together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> thing propoſed was <hi>how,</hi> and after what <hi>manner</hi> is it that they meet together, and kiſs each other? We are to conceive of it after the manner of God; for it is more than a meeting of ſaints, it is more than a meeting of angels, it is a divine meeting of all the glorious attributes of God; And we may obſerve theſe following qualities of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>myſterious</hi> meeting, it is above our comprehenſion and conception; O how wonderful a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this! The very <hi>name</hi> of the perſon, which is made the place of appointment, the meeting place, is called <hi>wonderful!</hi> Iſa. 9.6. Becauſe the meeting is about us, <hi>his name is called</hi> Immanuel, <hi>God with us.</hi> O how myſterious is this meeting, <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. that is, all the attributes of God meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and harmoniouſly embracing one another in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God, who hath aſſumed our nature into his own perſonality; this is the moſt wonderful myſterious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ever was in heaven or earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>joyful</hi> meeting, they meet with infinite pleaſure
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:040455_0024_10164607619FFC88"/>
and ſatisfaction in one another; <hi>Behold my ſervant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. As the perfections of God are glorified in Chriſt, ſo they rejoice and are delighted in him: <hi>For</hi> Jehovah <hi>is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake</hi>; and therefore <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall ſee the travail of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied.</hi> Surely, if God hath his pleaſure, and Chriſt his ſatisfaction, no attribute of the divine majeſty, no member of the meeting is diſpleaſed or out of humour; no, no: <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> My juſtice is pleaſed, my mercy is pleaſed, and all my other attributes are pleaſed. O it is an exceeding pleaſant and joyful meeting! May all that hear me be well pleaſed to ſee it; no joyful meeting, but what hath a reſpect to this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>holy</hi> meeting. Some meetings among men, that are called joyful meetings, yet are very unholy and ſinful meetings; but here is an infinitely holy meeting: <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> is the motto of it. A meeting of holy ſaints and holy angels is not ſuch a holy meeting as this meeting of the holy attributes of God, to advance the great deſign of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite holineſs. All the holy meetings that ever were, or will be, are the reſult of this, and the effect of ſome portion of holineſs ſent from it; for all holineſs iſſues from it. Here <hi>mercy and truth meet together</hi> in a holy manner, <hi>righteouſneſs and peace ſalute</hi> each other in a holy way, and <hi>greet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a holy kiſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>happy</hi> meeting. All happineſs and bleſſings flow from this meeting; Chriſt the meeting-place is the centre <hi>of all ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> Eph. 1.3. Many unhappy meetings have been in the world ſince ſin entred into it, and ſinful unholy meetings are ever miſerable and unhappy meetings; but this holy meeting muſt be a happy meeting; and this holy kiſs muſt be a happy kiſs. If <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> had not met together, we had never met with God; if <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> had never kiſſed each other, we had never got a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:040455_0025_10164608E682FE58"/>
kiſs of the fair face of the Son of God, nor ever been taken into the divine embraces.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>free</hi> meeting. <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> met together freely, without being conſtrained; <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>peace</hi> kiſſed each other freely, without being forced. No motive from without could ever take place to move God to call this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from eternity; it was according to <hi>his own purpoſe and grace, which is given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Free ſovereign grace is the original of the meeting. It is alſo ſuch a free aſſembly, where every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber might freely ſpeak, and not one to interrupt another, as is uſual in meetings among men, where ſome cry one thing, and ſome another, in a confuſed manner, like that aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.32. where it is ſaid, <hi>The aſſembly was confuſed, and the greater part knew not wherefore they were met together; and ſome cried one thing, and ſome another.</hi> No, this meeting is free, in oppoſition both to all conſtraint and compulſion from without, and to all confuſion and commotion from within. Where ſovereign free grace is the maſter-convener, there can be no compulſion; and, where the God of order is the great manager, there could be no confuſion; and, where the God of peace was all in all, there could be no diſſention.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>harmonious</hi> meeting. Whatever different claims and pretenſions the members of the meeting ſeem to have, yet they harmoniouſly concur in advancing one another's honour and glory; and hence, as they mutually met together, ſo they affectionately embrace one another. There was no diſcord at this aſſembly, no proper variance or ſtriving for ſtate, but gloriouſly conſpiring with joint hearts and hands to glorify each other in the ſalvation of a company of ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt. The divine eſſence is undivided: And, as <hi>there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and theſe three are One</hi>; So the attributes of God, however manifold to our apprehenſion, yet there is no
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:040455_0026_1016460AC26F1BA0"/>
diviſion among them, they are all one, and their conſpiring together in Chriſt, for our redemption, is called <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> The manifold perfections of God meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, with one conſent, and with one heart. Behold <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> in one another's arms; and ſo cloſe in the embracement, that they are juſt one. Tho' it is a fall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all parties preſent, yet their is no war, no jar, no diſſention, no diviſion, but all harmony and concord, and love and affection; it is the moſt peaceable meeting that ever was. And yet,</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is a <hi>bloody</hi> meeting; and never was, and never will there be, ſuch a bloody meeting in heaven or earth. <hi>The mercy-ſeat muſt be ſprinkled with blood</hi>; mercy cannot be vented without blood, and truth cannot be cleared without blood, righteouſneſs cannot be vindicated without blood, and peace cannot be purchaſed without blood; <hi>Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood there is no remiſſion,</hi> no mercy to be vented, no peace to be proclaimed; <hi>Chriſt hath made peace by the blood of his croſs,</hi> Col. 1.20. <hi>A bloody huſband haſt thou been unto me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Zipporah</hi>; but, O how much more may Chriſt ſay, a bloody meeting hath this been unto me! <hi>Who is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, <hi>with dyed garments from</hi> Bozrah? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1. Why, what is the matter that his garment is dyed with blood? Why? when <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> met together, they preſs'd to be ſo near one another in him, that they preſs'd the blood out of his veins; and ſo it was a bloody meeting: And, when <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> kiſs'd each other, it behoved to be in Chriſt; and ſo the ſword of juſtice behoved to pierce him thro' and thro', that ſo theſe ſacred lips might meet and kiſs each other in his heart; and ſo it was a bloody kiſs. They kiſs'd each other with ſuch good will, that Chriſt was, as it were, bruiſed betwixt their lips, that the blood might cement and glue them together. One would think, ſuch a bloody kiſs would be no pleaſant kiſs; nay, but <hi>it pleaſed the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:040455_0027_1016460CA3118230"/>
Father to bruiſe him.</hi> They met together on a ſea of blood: Thus it was a bloody meeting. Again,</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is an <hi>efficacious</hi> meeting. Many meet and aſſemble together, and yet do nothing for their meeting, it is to no effect; but <hi>here mercy and truth meet together</hi> efficaciouſly, co-operatively: All is done at the meeting that God propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done, and all is done that concerns the glory of God and ſalvation of men; their meeting together is their working together, and that to perfection; <hi>For God the Lord is a rock, and his work is perfect.</hi> There meeting together is their building together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.2, 3. <hi>I have ſaid, mercy ſhalt be built up for ever: Thy faithfulneſs ſhalt thou eſtabliſh in the very heavens.</hi> There is <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> both building, and the foundation of the building is laid in Chriſt; <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is an <hi>unexpected</hi> meeting, it is beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men and angels. If friends and intimates ſhould meet, and ſalute one another, it would not be ſurprizing; but to ſee oppoſites, antipodes, and antagoniſts meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and embrace each other, this were ſurpriſing and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: So, to ſee light and darkneſs, love and enmity, life and death meeting, how unexpected were that? Thus it is here, <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> theſe attributes of God, with reſpect to us, were oppoſites and antipodes. The language of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſinner; the language of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> is, life and ſalvation to the ſinner: And, when a ſinner finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf purſued to death at the inſtance of divine juſtice, and the truth and veracity of a God engaged againſt him, according to the threatning of the law; O how <hi>unexpected</hi> a rencounter is it, when he finds <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> meeting with <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and ſtopping the purſuit, according to the promiſe of the goſpel, to the credit of the oppoſite parties, ſaying, <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſoul from going down to the pit; I have found a ranſom,</hi> and ſo all odds are made even, all oppoſites reconciled, to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:040455_0028_10164611EB0D7048"/>
infinite ſurpriſe, and beyond the expectation of all created beings! No wonder then, upon this meeting diſcovered, the poor ſouls cries, <hi>Is this the manner of men, O Lord? O, who is like unto thee!</hi> Nay <hi>there is none like unto the God of</hi> Jeſurun,, <hi>that rides on the heaven for their help, and in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency on the ſkies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. It is an <hi>everlaſting,</hi> indiſſolvable meeting. Other meetings will adjourn their meetings from time to time and from place to place; yea, other meetings muſt part; and, when they part, they may never meet again; and we that are here met, muſt part, and never all meet again in time; even as ſome others that met together with us the laſt year, are away to eternity. But O, this meeting betwixt <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> is a meeting where there is no parting; the meeting is from everlaſting to everlaſting: Their meeting together, and kiſſing each other, is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unchangeable meeting, and an eternal and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kiſs; it is every way like God, without beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ending, and without ſucceſſion. Whatever beginning, iſſue or increaſe it hath with reſpect to its manifeſtation to us, yet in itſelf it is ſtill the ſame in Chriſt Jeſus, who is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to-day and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>without any vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs or ſhadow of turning.</hi> The meeting never breaks up, it is a continued meeting never to be diſſolved, and there they kiſs one another to all eternity: <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever, and his righteouſneſs to all generations</hi>; and <hi>becauſe of truth, meekneſs and righteouſneſs, in his majeſty he ſhall ride proſperouſly</hi>; and <hi>of the increaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end. I have ſaid, mercy ſhall be built up for ever</hi>; and I have ſaid, <hi>Truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the heavens.</hi> Why, what is the meaning of all theſe expreſſions? The language is as if one glorious attribute of God ſhould ſay to another, O the ſin of man ſets us all as it were at variance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the whole creation knows not how to reconcile God with himſelf, if he ſhall ſave one ſinner; but, behold, we having
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:040455_0029_101646136FCD07B0"/>
met together in Chriſt the righteouſneſs, the ranſom, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, the propitiation, having met together, we ſhall never part again; having embraced one another in behalf of theſe poor miſerable ſinners, our arms ſhall never ſeparate, that are claſped together. <hi>Mercy &amp; truth have met together,</hi> ſaying, you and I ſhall never part; <hi>righteouſneſs &amp; peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> ſaying, you and I ſhall never ſunder, nor ſuſpend the embracement; neither death nor life, nor hell, nor devils, nor ſin itſelf, ſhall ever ſeparate us. It is a bargain among us, a divine match; they have met together by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting covenant, ſealed the bargain with an everlaſting kiſs, &amp; caſt a knot in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, which is the band of the union, even Chriſt; <hi>for the covenant does ſtand faſt with him,</hi> Pſal. 89.28. where you will alſo ſee how this everlaſting meeting is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Juſtice &amp; judgment are the habitation of thy throne,</hi> or the eſtabliſhment of thy throne, as it may be rendered; <hi>And mercy and truth ſhall go before thy face.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>With him my hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, &amp; my faithfulneſs and my mercy ſhall be with him.</hi> And, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for ever.</hi> Thus it is an everlaſting meeting.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing propoſed was, <hi>why</hi> or for what <hi>reaſons</hi> they have met together, and kiſſed each other? Why have the prefections of the glorious God conſpired ſo harmoniouſly, and met together in ſuch a ſweet ſolemnity? Surely ſuch a meeting as this muſt have noble deſigns in view; and I'll tell you theſe four reaſons of the meeting, or four things that were to be concerted at this great aſſembly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They met together, to concert meaſures for advancing the glory of God to the higheſt. This parliament of heaven met together upon ways and means, for bringing in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt revenue of praiſe and glory to the crown of heaven, to Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, &amp; all the glorious attributes of this great and eternal God. Theſe attributes conſpired har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly to ſet forth &amp; glorify themſelves moſt illuſtriouſly.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:040455_0030_1016461515368EA8"/>
They met together, and kiſſed one another, that they migh glorify each other. The glory of God, was the firſt and laſt end of the meeting: What is the chief end of man, but to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever? And O, what is the chief end of God! It is even to glorify himſelf in all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to enjoy himſelf for ever. And, how does God glorify himſelf moſt brightly? It is even in Chriſt the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of theſe perfections, with a view to our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. And how does he enjoy himſelf moſt ſweetly? It is even in Chriſt, <hi>Behold mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth. I was daily his delight,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>while my delight was with the ſons of men,</hi> Prov. 8.30. They met together to put a crown of glory and honour upon each other. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin and rebellion, and your ſin, my friends, and my ſin (O that God diſhonouring, evil, ſin!) which had pulled off that crown of glory as it were, from the head of the great King eternal and immortal, and caſt it into the mire, and ſtained it with filth and dirt: But, behold, theſe attributes of God meet together to take up the crown, to rub off the duſt and dung that ſin had caſt upon it, and to add ſome more ſparkling jewels to it than ever, &amp; ſet it upon the head of their ſovereign, to the higheſt praiſes of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, juſtice, truth, righteouſneſs and grace, and love, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and wiſdom, and all his other excellencies; that men &amp; angels might ſing and ſay, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> &amp;c. that all the ſaints might ſing a conſort in praiſe of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth, juſtice</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.14.

They met together, to put a <hi>crown of glory</hi> upon the head of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. in whom they met. This aſſembly did convene <hi>for the coronation of the ſon of God:</hi> For, <hi>he having humbled himſelf, and become obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs, God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name,</hi> Phil. 2.10. <hi>That at the name of</hi> JESUS, <hi>every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> Chriſt hath glorified the Father, and therefore the Father <hi>glorified him,</hi> Joh. 13.31, 32. <hi>And now is the ſon of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</hi> And, <hi>if God be glorified in him, God ſhall alſo glorify him in himſelf. Him that honoureth me, I will honour,</hi> ſays God. And in whom does this take place to perfection? It is in Chriſt: God is honoured moſt highly by him; and therefore he is honoured moſt highly of God. <hi>Amen, ſo let it be, and ſo it ſhall be.</hi> And therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed in that meeting, that all the ſaints ſhall glorify him; Hence that royal edict comes forth, <hi>He is thy Lord, worſhip thou him,</hi> Pſal. 45.11. And ſo we find them doing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the ſeals; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi> It is concerted in that meeting, that all the angels ſhall glorify him: Hence that edict comes forth, <hi>Let all the angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. And ſo we find them doing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>I heard a voice of many angels, and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voice, Worthy is the lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſings.</hi> It is concerted in this meeting, that all the creatures in heaven and earth, ſea and land, ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:040455_0032_101623F8AC2D76A8"/>
him; as we ſee v. 13. But leſt the ſinful creatures upon earth, like you and me, ſhould not glorify him, or ſee his glory, it is concerted in that glorious meeting, that the Holy Ghoſt, the eternal Spirit, one God equal in power &amp; glory with the Father and the Son, ſhall be ſent down to the earth to glorify him, Joh. 16.14. <hi>He ſhall glorify me; for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you.</hi> O, hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God been ſhewing any thing of Chriſt among you this day? Any thing of his grace, fulneſs, righteouſneſs, ſo as to glorify him, and make him glorious above all things to you? Why then, we may reckon that you have found ſomething of the ſaving fruits of this glorious meeting; for the grand deſign of it was to glorify God in Chriſt, by the ſpirit. They met to concert all things relating to the glory of the Father, in the Son, by the Holy Ghoſt. They met to conſult their own glory in Chriſt, that mercy and truth might be glorified in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They met together to concert their proper work, in carrying on this great end, of the glory of God, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. They do not meet together to ſit idle, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; no, they meet together to concert each of them their proper buſineſs: As Chriſt ſaid to his friends, <hi>Wherefore was it that ye ſought me? Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my father's buſineſs?</hi> So may I ſay here, the attributes of God met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they might go about God's buſineſs. What bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? What work belongs to each of them ſeverally? Why, mercy and truth meet together, that they may be ſent upon an ambaſſy together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.3. <hi>God ſhall ſend forth his mercy and his truth</hi>; his mercy to give in the promiſe of the goſpel, and his truth to make out the ſame: Thus mercy and truth meet together, that they may be ſent forth upon ſome gracious expedition, particularly both to be leaders and followers to the remnant, whom God appointed unto life. On the one hand, to be leaders; hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cries,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:040455_0033_1016461AED294398"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3. O <hi>ſend forth thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, and bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacle. Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy.</hi> Behold the wonderful buſineſs of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and the work they are ſent out upon, even mercifully to lead blind ſouls to a God in Chriſt. On the other hand, it is to be, not only leaders, but followers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall follow me all the days of my life.</hi> If the child of God, under any temptation, refuſe to be led by <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and give up with them as his leaders, yet, for all that, he ſhall not hinder them to be his followers: He may run out of God's way, but <hi>mercy</hi> will follow and bring him back; and, when <hi>mercy</hi> follows, it is even in company with <hi>truth</hi>: And O, what think you of this wonder! <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meet together, that they might go forth together, like two pages, to follow you, believer, thro' all the ſteps of your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs journey; <hi>goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life.</hi> Here is a piece of work, that <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> have met together for, even to be ſent forth, as leaders and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of poor elect ſinners, till they be out of all hazard, <hi>in</hi> Emmanuel's <hi>land where glory dwells:</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.7. But then, as <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> have met together, to purſue their proper work; ſo <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> have kiſſed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for purſuing of theirs. Well, ſay you, what is the work of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>? You have a word in the laſt verſe of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> where our text lies; <hi>righteouſneſs ſhall go before him, and ſet us in the way of his ſteps.</hi> Divine <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> diſplaying itſelf in Chriſt Jeſus the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goes before him to prepare his way, and to bring us to God, and to our duty. And to be ſure, whenever <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> goes before, <hi>peace</hi> will follow after: <hi>for the fruit of righteouſneſs is peace,</hi> whether it be imputed or implanted. Here then the work of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> kiſſing each other, is to bring in theſe bleſſed effects in their order: We
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:040455_0034_1016461D58D63B08"/>
conſider them as divine perfections in the text: And, in theſe effects, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> leads the van, and <hi>peace</hi> comes up with the rear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe attributes conſpire harmoniouſly, they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and kiſs each other, for this reaſon, that, by their meeting together, they may concert the diſſolving of ſome unhappy meetings. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes of God meet together, that ſome intimates may be ſeparate, and ſad and ſinful agreements may be broken up. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28 15. there is a ſad meeting and agreement we read of; <hi>We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement.</hi> Why? Is not this the caſe of all men by nature? Yea; but, how is this ſad and miſerable meeting diſſolved? See v. 16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation: Judgment alſo will I lay to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet.</hi> Well, when judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſs mercifully meet in Chriſt, the ſure foundation, what will be the effect? It follows, v. 17, 18. <hi>The hail ſhall ſweep away the refuge of lies, and your covenant with death ſhall be diſannulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not ſtand.</hi> Whatever ſad aſpect this ſcripture may have to the diſpiſers of Chriſt, yet it hath a merciful aſpect to all the choſen of God, and all that deſire to cleave to the Lord Jeſus; yea, there is here a foundation of faith laid for all that here the joyful ſound, that whatever ſinful and miſerable meetings and agreements there are betwixt hell and them, betwixt death and them, yet it cannot ſtand before this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meeting, which was deſigned to break up and diſſolve the oppoſite meetings that ſtand in a contrariety thereto. There are many black unions which this bleſſed union does diſſolve, and there is no diſſolving of them but by this bleſſed meeting. There is the black union betwixt the ſinner and the law, which is the foundation of the black union betwixt the ſinner and his ſin; For, when the union betwixt him and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:040455_0035_101646201A9F1BF8"/>
the law is diſſolved, then the union betwixt him and his ſin is diſſolved; according to <hi>Rom</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> Now, what is the covenant of grace? Why, <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meeting together, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> kiſſing each other in Chriſt Jeſus, is the ſubſtance, the marrow, the kernel of the covenant of grace; and it is this bleſſed meeting that diſſolves the union betwixt the ſinner and the law, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſinner and his ſin. O view the glorious deſign of this meeting! They met together, that you might be ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from your ſad aſſociates. By nature you and the devil had met together, and you was a ſlave to him; and it is the virtue of this meeting in Chriſt, that diſſolves that; <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent.</hi> The world and you had met together, and you took pleaſure in your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed companions, or elſe was wholly drowned in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; O it is the faith of this meeting that diſſolves that! <hi>This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.</hi> The curſe of God and you had met together, and you lie under that curſe, till, in the faith of this meeting, you ſhall ſee, <hi>that Chriſt hath become a curſe for us.</hi> This meeting is deſigned for the breaking up of all theſe, and the like unhappy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They met together in a glorious band, to looſe all the knots the devil had tied.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe glorious attributes of God do conſpire harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, they meet together and kiſs each other, that they might concert and carry on ſome happy meetings, and make up ſome bleſſed matches. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes harmoniouſly meet, that oppoſites and irreconcileable things might meet together harmoniouſly, and kiſs each other, whether real or ſeeming oppoſites.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There are real oppoſites that meet together harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, by virtue of this glorious meeting; particularly theſe ſix,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:040455_0036_1016462287A46008"/>1. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes meet together harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that oppoſite natures might meet together, even that God and man might meet together, and embrace each other. And there are theſe two meetings betwixt God and man, that were concerted at this meeting: The one is the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt God and man, in the hypoſtatical union of the two natures of Chriſt, our <hi>Emmanuel God-man</hi> in one perſon; this is the <hi>great myſtery of goodlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh</hi>; and this is the foundation of all other ſaving and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful meetings betwixt God and man: The other is the meeting betwixt God and man, in the ſpiritual union betwixt Chriſt and his members, in one myſtical perſon, by the bond of the ſpirit; <hi>For he that is joined to the Lord is one ſpirit</hi>; And this union is the foundation of all ſpiritual communion with God. We were not only at an infinite nature diſtance from God, as we are creatures; but at an infinite moral diſtance from him, as we are criminals and ſinners: But the attributes of God met together and kiſs'd each other in Chriſt, that God and man might meet together in a cloſe ſpiritual union, and kiſs each other in a ſweet ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Whatever ſpiritual communion you have with God, believer, this day, it flows from this glorious meeting of the divine attributes in Chriſt; and this union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is indeed a meeting of oppoſite natures: God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, and took on our nature, and he makes us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes met together, and kiſs'd each other, that oppoſite wills might meet and embrace each other. God's will and ours are oppoſite; this is indeed a branch of the former, but our wills are the great forts of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, that ſtand out againſt God and his will: <hi>We are enmity againſt God, and not ſubject to the law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be.</hi> Now, how comes the will to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God's will? It is only by Chriſt, in whom the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:040455_0037_1016462518830E10"/>
of God meet together: <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes met &amp; kiſs'd each other, that oppoſite perſons <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> man and man, that were enemies and haters of one another, might meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> might meet together, and men at variance with men might meet together: Hence it is ſaid of him, in whom the attributes of God do meet, <hi>He is our peace,</hi> Eph. 2.14. <hi>who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition: Having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity,</hi> &amp;c. If any thing ſlay the enmity to God or man, this is it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes of God meet and kiſs each other, that oppoſite climates might meet together; I mean, that heaven &amp; earth might meet together, the church militant and the church triumphant. Heaven and earth were at variance by our ſin; but now, in Chriſt, ſaints in heaven and ſaints on earth meet together; Hence we are ſaid to be <hi>come to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born that are written in heaven, to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> All believers are ſaid to be thus <hi>come to mount</hi> Zion, <hi>the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, Heb. 12.22. Yea, in Chriſt, angels in heaven, and men on earth, do meet together: Hence alſo believers are ſaid to be <hi>come to the innumerable company of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>; and <hi>the angel of the Lord encamps about them,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, all things in heaven and earth do meet together, and kiſs each other in Chriſt, the meeting-place, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Having made peace by the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf, whether things in heaven, or things in earth,</hi> Eph. 1.10. See how, upon the back of this meeting in the text, heaven and earth are ſaid to meet together in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe; <hi>Truth ſhall ſpring out of the earth, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall look down from heaven</hi>; which I inſiſt not upon here.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:040455_0038_101646277AB47528"/>5. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes of God meet and kiſs each other, that oppoſite covenants might meet &amp; embrace each other, even the covenant of works, and the covenant of grace, in Chriſt the meeting place of the divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe two covenants do, as it were, join hands and agree. Did the covenant of works command perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? and, being broken, did it demand complete ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Behold, Chriſt's obedience to the death anſwers both; God's covenant of grace, diſpenſed to us, is juſt Chriſt fulfilling for us the covenant of works: And ſo in him they meet, and kiſs each other; <hi>For he is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Theſe oppoſite-like attributes of God meet and kiſs each other, that oppoſite tho'ts might meet together, and embrace each other, even God's tho'ts and our tho'ts. How oppoſite theſe are, you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9. <hi>For my tho'ts are not your tho'ts, nor your ways my ways; for, as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thot's than your tho'ts.</hi> Some have preſumptuous thot's while they look only to God's mercy, and ſo they think cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God will have mercy upon them, tho' yet they are ſtrangers to Chriſt; theſe are oppoſites to God's tho'ts, he hath no tho'ts of ſhewing mercy that way. Others have deſpairing tho'ts, while they look merely or moſtly to God's juſtice, and ſo their tho't is, O, will God have mercy on ſuch as I am; and, he cannot in juſtice ſave ſuch a one as I! Theſe tho'ts are alſo oppoſite to God's tho'ts: <hi>My tho'ts are not your tho'ts.</hi> O then, how ſhall theſe oppoſite tho'ts meet together? Why, let a man view the mercy and juſtice of God met together, and harmoniouſly kiſſing each other in Chriſt, ſo as to ſee God in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf. If your tho'ts be ſpiritualized, to diſcern mercy venting itſelf thro' the ſacrifice that ſatisfies divine juſtice, then God's thoughts and your thoughts meet together, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:040455_0039_10164629FAC5C6C0"/>
kiſs each other. Thus the divine attributes meet together harmoniouſly, that real oppoſites may meet together harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly: This glorious meeting lays a foundation for theſe happy meetings.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There are ſeeming oppoſites, that meet together harmoniouſly, by virtue of this glorious meeting; as,</p>

Theſe oppoſite-like perfections of God meet together, and kiſs each other harmoniouſly, that oppoſite-like <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> might <hi>meet together and kiſs each other.</hi> There are frowning <hi>providences</hi> and ſmiling <hi>providences,</hi> croſſes and comforts in the believer's lot; here is a <hi>providence</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the promiſe, and there is a <hi>providence</hi> that ſeems to contradict the promiſe; here is an up, and there is a down: Well, how ſhall theſe walk together? Why? They meet and embrace each other in Chriſt, the meeting-place; for <hi>all things work together for good to them that love him, and are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Hence we will find, not only light and darkneſs in the believer's lot, but ſometimes light and darkneſs meeting together, Zech. 14.7. There you read of a day, that is <hi>neither day not night</hi>; yet <hi>a day known to the Lord neither clear not dark, but at evening time it ſhall be light</hi>: There evening-darkneſs uſhering in the morning light. Hence they have occaſion both to <hi>ſing of mercy and of judgment,</hi> becauſe of their meeting together, and kiſſing each other, and working together for good: Behold the croſs and the crown meeting together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe oppoſite-like perfections of God meet together, and kiſs each other, that oppoſite-like deſires may meet, and embrace each other. While <hi>mercy</hi> deſire, our life, and <hi>juſtice</hi> ſeems to demand our death; theſe are reconciled only in Chriſt, in whom <hi>mercy</hi> &amp; <hi>truth, righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>peace</hi> meet and embrace each other. But look to our own deſire of God's glory, and our ſalvation, men and angels could never have contrived how theſe two deſires could be reconciled, if <hi>mercy</hi>

and <hi>truth</hi> had not met together, and kiſs'd each other; for the glory of God's truth and righteouſneſs, in the threatning of his law, ſeems to reſt ſatisfied with nothing leſs than our deſtruction; and therefore to deſire God's glory, would <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe ſeemingly oppoſite attributes meet and kiſs each other, that ſeemingly oppoſite graces might meet and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other; for example, <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>confidence.</hi> How ſhall <hi>fear</hi> &amp; <hi>reverence</hi> meet together with <hi>faith</hi> &amp; <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi> Why, <hi>truth</hi> &amp; <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> are at the meeting, and therefore fear &amp; reverence becomes us; but <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are alſo on the bench, therefore faith &amp; holy confidence may boldly ſtep in, <hi>We have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

Praiſe ſuppoſes our enjoyments to be great, otherwiſe, why ſhould we praiſe? Well, <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> theſe awful attributes, preſent at the meeting, ſay, we have nothing in ourſelves, therefore we ought to pray; but <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> ſay, we have all, we have enough in Chriſt, and therefore we ought to Praiſe. <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>gloriation</hi> ſeem oppoſite duties; but the ſeemingly oppoſite attributes of God meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, bring alſo theſe duties to meet and embrace each other. Is <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> in the company with <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>? Then humiliation is our duty; but is <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in company with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs?</hi> Then
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:040455_0041_1016462E797E5688"/>
gloriation is our duty; <hi>let him that glories, glory in the Lord.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Theſe ſeemingly oppoſite attributes of God meet and embrace each other, that ſeemingly oppoſite experiences may meet and embrace each other, and be reconciled, though ſeemingly irreconcileable. There are <hi>ſad</hi> experiences, and <hi>

Can ever that be reconciled with the experience of holy peace, pardon and victory? Yea, here is a foundation laid for the reconciliation of theſe oppoſites. If <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> have met together, then a guilty conſcience and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat may meet together; a prevalent corruption and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning purifying blood may meet together: as they did in the Pſalmiſt's caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me: But as for our tranſgreſſions, thou wilt purge them away.</hi> The ſad experience of fatherly anger, or of the feeling of divine wrath may meet with the ſweet experience of felt love and favour; for <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> are met together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8. The ſad experience of perplexing thoughts may meet with the ſweet experience of ſpiritual conſolation, &amp; be ſwallowed up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſince <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> have met with <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace:</hi> Hence it was that theſe two met together in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 94.19. <hi>In the multitudes of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my ſoul.</hi> O! Is ſuch a ſad experience conſiſtent with an intereſt in Chriſt? Why? Both terrible and amiable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God meet together in Chriſt, and therefore it is not ſtrange that the ſadeſt and ſweeteſt experiences meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as not to be inconſiſtent with the ſtate of a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is in Chriſt. To ſee awful <hi>juſtice</hi> and lovely <hi>mercy</hi> meeting together in a ſweet-ſmelling ſacrifice, is a greater wonder, than to ſee your ſadeſt &amp; ſweeteſt experiences meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, to make up a Hallelujah, <hi>praiſe ye the Lord</hi>; and the former meeting in the reaſon of this.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Theſe irreconcileable-like attributes of God meet and

Then he will juſtify the ungodly on that ground; <hi>Deliver his ſoul from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom.</hi> Now, he can juſtify the ſinner, and be juſt in ſo doing, while he draws him in to Chriſt by ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. Thus you ſee the reaſons of the meeting. In a word, they meet together upon a deſign to bring the greateſt good our of the greateſt evil, and the higheſt glory out of the deepeſt miſery, to the praiſe of all God's glorious perfections.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing propoſed was the <hi>application</hi> in a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. Is it ſo, that, in the ſalvation of ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt, the glorious attributes and perfections of God do thus harmoniouſly conſpire and embrace each other? Then hence we may ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a dreadful evil <hi>ſin</hi> is, which ſets all the attributes of God, as it were, at odds, and puts all the world into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, &amp; every thing out of order; it ſets heaven and earth and all things in them, at variance one againſt another. To think light of ſin, is to think light of this glorious meeting of divine attributes, that met together to break this rebellion, and take order with this horrid inſurrection againſt heaven. O what a great matter is the ſalvation of a ſinner! Ere that can take place, this grand meeting muſt be called; all the occured attributes of God muſt have an honourable reparation.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:040455_0043_101646349015F738"/>
               <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be ſatisfied, <hi>truth</hi> vindicated, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And, in order to all this, a ſurery muſt be provided, even a God in our nature; the guilt muſt be imputed to him, and <hi>the iniquity of us all muſt be laid upon him</hi>; and then a bloody tragedy muſt be acted upon his ſoul and body, till he ſink to death under the weight of infinite wrath. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence ſee what a wonderful perſon our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is, in whom ſo many wonders meet together. It is in him that <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace do meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and kiſs each other.</hi> Here all the bright perfections of the divine nature do gloriouſly conſpire; here is the bright conſtellation of all the divine attributes ſhining forth in him, and every ſtar performs its revolution in this orb. Behold in him the bright glory and excellency of God's grace and love, a whole Trinity in concert, each perſon to perform his own part, and each attribute its own work; and <hi>Chriſt the image of the inviſible God ſet forth to be a</hi> glorious theatre, on which men and angels might ſee the ſplendor of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action;
<q>He is the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon. <hi>Here is the</hi> great myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</q>
and all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes meeting together, and kiſſing each other, in our <hi>Emmanuel, God-Man.</hi> There are two things meet in Chriſt, which ſhould make him wonderful to us: The one is, all our ſins meet together on him, that they may be condemned, according to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> or made them to <hi>meet</hi> on him: The other is, all the attributes of God meet in him, that they may be glorified: And indeed there is no ſaving or ſatisfying knowledge of any property of God, but what is to be had in Chriſt. To ſee God to be a merciful, juſt, true, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, good and holy God, is neither a ſaving, nor a ſatisfying ſight, unleſs we ſee theſe attributes meeting in Chriſt for our ſalvation; and to ſee this, is to ſee <hi>the glory of God in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

face of Chriſt.</hi> Here ſee the glory of divine mercy! What is pardoning mercy? It is God's free gracious acceptance of a ſinner, upon ſatisfaction made to his juſtice, in the blood of Jeſus; Nor is any diſcovery of mercy, but as relating to the ſatisfaction of juſtice, conſiſtent with the glory of God; mercy cannot be ſeen ſavingly, but as meeting with juſtice in Chriſt. Here alſo we ſee the glory of divine truth in the exact accompliſhment of all his threatnings and promiſes. That original threatning and commination, whence all other threatnings flow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. 'In the day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſhalt ſurely die, <hi>backed with a curſe,</hi> 'For curſed is 'every one that continues not in all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in him accompliſhed fully, and the truth of God therein cleared to our ſalvation, while <hi>he taſted death death for us, and was made a curſe for us</hi>; ſo that, in every threatning his truth is made glorious. And, as to the promiſes, <hi>they are all</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Amen <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, to the glory of God by us.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. And ſo of all the other attributes of God, they are made glorious and exalted in Chriſt to our ſalvation. Hence when Chriſt deſired his father to glorify his name, <hi>John</hi> 12.28. to make his name, that is, his nature, and properties, and perfections all glorious in the work of redemption, that he had in hand; he was inſtantly anſwered from heaven,
<q>I have both glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it and will glorify it again;</q>
I will give my attributes their utmoſt glory in thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence ſee the difference betwixt the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> One great difference betwixt them lies in this, that, in the law, the ſinner that hath violated the ſame, may ſee <hi>truth</hi> ſtanding engaged againſt him, but no <hi>mercy</hi> in company with <hi>truth</hi>; and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> in arms againſt him, but no <hi>peace</hi> in company with <hi>righteouſneſs. Juſtice without mercy,</hi> and <hi>war without peace,</hi> to the ſinner, is the <hi>motto</hi> of the law: For therein <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> meet together, but <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are not at the meeting; and ſo the language of the law,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:040455_0045_101646396C3828F0"/>
to you that are out of Chriſt, and under the law, is, no mercy, no peace, but the wrath of God, the vengeance of God, the curſe of God upon you, and that ſo ſure as God is a God of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>: There is the <hi>law.</hi> But in the <hi>goſpel, mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> come into the <hi>meeting,</hi> and make up a <hi>match</hi> betwixt all the <hi>oppoſite-like parties, to the higheſt glory of God, and the greateſt happineſs of the ſinner; and they ſeal the match with a kiſs of infinite complacency,</hi> ſo that the ſum of the goſpel is this, <hi>mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we may ſee what is the fountain-head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all true <hi>communion</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with God and man. This glorious meeting is the foundation of all other happy meetings; fellowſhip with God, &amp; an happy meeting with him, is a ſtream that flows from this fountain. We could never have met with God, or got a kindly kiſs or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace in the arms of his favour and love, if this divine meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and embracement had not made way for it. Fellowſhip with man, or the communion of ſaints, is a rivulet that flows from this ſpring. When ſaints meet together for prayer or praiſes, under the influence of the ſpirit, and under a gale of heaven; when their hearts are fired with love to God, and to one another in him; what is this? It is juſt a live-coal caſt in among them from the altar, Chriſt Jeſus, where all the attributes of God meet together, and kiſs each other; and hence true fellowſhip with God, and with the ſaints, are both declared to be in and thro' Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3.
<q>That which we have heard and ſeen, declare we unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us: And truly our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Chriſt.</q>
The harmony of the attributes of God in Chriſt, is the fountain of all the harmony among the ſaints: The little harmony that takes place among them in our day, and the rarity of holy fellowſhip meetings, flows from the little faith of this
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:040455_0046_1016463B42BC12C0"/>
heavenly divine meeting; for all the ſaints, that are under the lively views thereof, cannot but deſire to meet together and embrace eaach other harmoniouſly, in the arms of mutual love.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence ſee the malignity of the ſin of <hi>unbelief,</hi> the great employment whereof is, to <hi>ſpoil the harmony</hi> of the divine perfections, and to do its utmoſt to <hi>diſſolve</hi> that glorious meeting, and <hi>ſeparate</hi> what God hath joined, ſaying, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they have not met together, nor kiſſed each other. This we may diſcern in the unbelief, whether of ſecure or awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſinners: See it in the unbelief of the ſecure ſinner, who ſets <hi>truth</hi> &amp; <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> out of the meeting, ſaying, God, is a merciful God, <hi>&amp; I ſhall have peace, tho' I walk in the immagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own heart, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt</hi>: Thus <hi>they hope in God's mercy,</hi> &amp; ſpeak peace to themſelves, while they never view the truth and righteouſneſs of God, and how the credit thereof ſhall be ſaved, or the honour thereof repaired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hence, as faith is ſaid to <hi>ſet to the ſeal, that God is true,</hi> or that he is a God of truth, ſo unbelief is ſaid to <hi>make God a liar.</hi> To fancy that God will have mercy on their ſouls, without regarding the truth of his threatnings, is to make God a liar, and ſay, mercy and truth have not met together; to think that God will be at peace with them, while his righteouſneſs and juſtice are not ſatisfied, is to make God a liar, and ſay, righteouſneſs and peace have not met together. Thus the unbelief of the ſecure ſinner puts <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> out of the meeting. Again, on the other hand, the unbelief of the awakened ſinner puts <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> out of the meeting, ſaying, O he is a God of truth, and how ſhall he have mercy on the like of me? He is a God of awful juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and how will he be at peace with me? What is the language of this, but that <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> have not met with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>? Here is a making God a liar alſo, and ſeparating what God hath in the goſpel declared to be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:040455_0047_1016463FAB32D680"/>
joined. Behold then the malignity of unbelief; it breaks the glorious meeting, and will not let them kiſs one another. The preſuming ſinner will not let God have the glory of his truth and righteouſneſs, the deſpairing ſinner will not let God have the glory of his mercy and grace; both are in a concert with the devil to break the harmony of the meeting. But O, may virtue come from that glorious meeting in Chriſt, to the poor ſinful meeting in this houſe, for daſhing your unbelief to pieces, that we may ſee <hi>mercy and truth meet together, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace kiſſing each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Hence ſee ſure and noble ground for the <hi>boldneſs</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of faith in Chriſt; <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the faith of him,</hi> Eph. 3.12. Here's an anſwer to all the objections of unbelief and diffidence, the chief whereof lies here; O, ſays unbelief, may I, ſinful guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I, lay hold on the promiſe of mercy and peace in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when I ſee the great ordnance of the divine threatning hard charged with the truth and righteouſneſs of God, and ready to be diſcharged againſt me with thunder and lightning, ſaying, no mercy, no peace; <hi>He that made thee will not have mercy upon thee</hi>; and <hi>there is no peace, ſays my God, to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Mercy and peace in the promiſe then, ſays unbelief, cannot take place with reſpect to me; for truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the threatning ſtand in the way, <hi>like a flaming ſword, to keep the way of the tree of life.</hi> Nay, but, ſays faith, here the promiſe and the threatning have met together, and kiſſed each other in Chriſt; mercy in the promiſe, and juſtice in the threatning, have met and agreed in him, <hi>in whom all the promiſes are Yea and Amen,</hi> and in whom all the threatnings are fully executed, by drawing out his heart-blood. Thus then, <hi>we have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 10.19. <hi>By a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the vail of his fleſh: Therefore let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of ſaith.</hi> O what
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:040455_0048_101646413189CB10"/>
ground for the boldneſs and aſſured confidence of faith, with particular application, notwithſtanding the threatning! The threatning hath nothing to ſay to me, ſaith faith, for Chriſt hath ſpoken with it already, and ſpoken it out of breath; he hath left it ſpeechleſs and breathleſs; not a breathing of wrath in it towards me. The believer may have a million of doubts, while his unbelief keeps the chair; but let gallant faith come in, and take the room, it will diſpel them all. Let once unbelief break the harmony of this meeting of divine attributes in Chriſt, and then nothing but doubts of God's favour and mercy muſt enſue; but let faith view the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſee them meeting and kiſſing each other, and then, according to the meaſure of faith, ſuch will be the meaſure of holy boldneſs, confidence and perſwaſion of the favour, mercy and good-will of God in Chriſt, with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application to the perſon himſelf. Take away unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from faith, and then not a ſingle doubt will remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: Unbelief creates all the doubts that are in the believer, his faith hath no part in them. The general doubtful faith of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is not faith, but unbelief; and therefore no wonder that our forefathers abjured it in our national cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Behold the ſure ground and firm bottom that faith ſtands upon, even the mutual meeting and embracement among the divine perfections in Chriſt. If you break and ſeparate the meeting by unbelief, then your confidence is broken, and your peace with God marr'd; but, if you keep them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your view by faith in Chriſt, then you have boldneſs confidence and affiance on this ground: yea, then God in Chriſt and you meet together, and kiſs each other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence we ſee what is the <hi>beſt mark</hi> of a believer in Chriſt, for your trial and examination: Try it juſt by this, What view have you got of this <hi>glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of the attributes of God meeting and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing each other in him? Have you ſeen the <hi>glory,</hi> and felt the <hi>virtue</hi> of this happy meeting?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:040455_0049_10164644834AFCB0"/>1. Have you ſeen the <hi>glory</hi> of it? When once in a day you had ſeen the attributes of God in arms againſt you, becauſe of your ſinful rebellion againſt God, and when you had ſeen the truth of God pronouncing the ſentence of the law, and his righteouſneſs and juſtice ready to inflict the ſentence, and execute the ſame with curſes and vengeance, making you deſpair of mercy, and give up with all hope and expectation of peace with God by the law of works; have you thereupon got a view of the harmonious meeting of theſe attributes of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, as the ſurety, the ſacrifice, the ranſom, the propitiation, in whom the truth and veracity of God is accompliſhed, and the righteouſneſs and juſtice of God ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? And ſo mercy and peace vented gloriouſly, without detriment to any other excellency or perfection of God. Hath nothing ſatisfied your conſcience, but the view of this meeting betwixt <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> in the death of Chriſt, and kiſſing each other in his mediation? Hath God and you met together this way, and made your heart joyful to kiſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this wonderful device, as worthy of God, and ſuitable to you? Have you ſeen his glory at this rate? Then, in God's name, I pronounce you a believer in Chriſt; <hi>For God, who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into your heart, to give you the light of the knowledge of his glory, in the face of Chriſt</hi>; and Chriſt and you met together, and kiſſed each other! Whether it was in the day of firſt believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when you fled to him for refuge, or in the day of after-manifeſtation, when, upon the back of diſmal hiding on God's part, or grievous backſliding on yours, the Lord drew aſide the vail, and gave you a glance of his glory; whether it was by ſome word of grace, ſweetly and powerfully coming in, and opening your underſtanding, to ſee this harmonious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by ſome ſweet droppings of the blood of ſprinkling upon your conſcience, by which blood the meeting is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together. Have you ſeen this glory, whether in a ſecret corner, or publick ordinance; whether at the market-croſs

            <p n="2">2. Have you felt the <hi>virtue,</hi> as well as ſeen the glory of this harmonious meeting of the divine attributes in Chriſt? 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>Behold, as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> Surely, if you have ſeen this glory, you have felt ſomething of this virtue, by <hi>changing</hi> you <hi>from glory to glory.</hi> It is true, many that have got a diſcovery of this glory of the Lord, can never think that they have felt the ſanctifying virtue thereof, and this keeps them down in the pit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; it is true, they that are not ſanctified, and made holy, they diſcover, that they never beheld this glory of the Lord: For this meeting of attributes makes a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of graces in the perſon that ſees it ſavingly. But you muſt remember, that this virtue will never be perfectly felt, 'till this glory be perfectly beheld in heaven, where <hi>we ſhall be like him, becauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is</hi>: And therefore, ſince you cannot judge and try yourſelf by a perfect ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, try it by the beginnings of it; this transforming virtue, this ſanctifying virtue is preſent with you, though you cannot diſcern it. But, that you may thro' grace diſcern ſomething of it, let me ask you, What makes you wreſtle in ſecret ſometimes againſt ſin, if it be not ſome ſanctifying virtue? What makes the prevalency of ſin to humble you to the duſt? What makes you lament your own unholineſs and impurity? What makes you long and groan for compleat victory over, and freedom from, ſin,? What makes you glad of any victory over your corruption, when this glory ſhines? What makes your heart to riſe againſt ſin? and, when ſin prevails, what makes you find yourſelves uneaſy, and continually out of your element, 'till the Lord return, and until you get a new dip in the <hi>Jordan of the blood of the Lamb</hi>? You have no mercy on your luſts, and are at no

peace with them, but ſtill crying vengeance upon them! Why, it is juſt the ſanctifying virtue that flows from this view of the glory of God in Chriſt, in whom <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> meet with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> If you fall and ſtumble at any time, believer, is it not like the ſtumbling of a horſe, that makes you run the faſter? So as you get more good of one fall, than a natural man will get of a hundred duties, while it makes you ſtill the more humble and watchful, and circumſpect and dependent. Why, by all this, it appears (whatever be the defect of your ſanctification) that <hi>having beheld the glory of God, you are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory</hi>; you have ſeen the glory, and felt the virtue of this harmonious meeting of divine attributes in Chriſt. But then again,</p>

Hence we may ſee ground of <hi>terror</hi> to all chriſtleſs, unbelieving ſouls, that never have ſeen the glory, nor felt the virtue of this harmonious meeting, and live careleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout either of theſe. What ſhall I ſay? <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into them.</hi> May be, you are preſuming upon the mercy of God, while yet your eyes are blinded, that you do not ſee the truth of his threatnings ſtanding againſt you: And therefore, O blaſphemer, do not think that he will be a God of <hi>mercy,</hi> and not a God of <hi>truth?</hi> Nay, his mercy will never be vented, unleſs the glory of his truth be ſaved. May be you are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace to yourſelf, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have peace</hi>; while yet your eyes are blinded, that you do not ſee how God's being at peace with a ſinner is conſiſtent with his righteouſneſs in taking vengeance upon ſin. O then, blaſphemer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer, do you think that God will be a God of <hi>peace,</hi> and not a God of <hi>righteouſneſs?</hi> know it then, in the Lord's name, O ſinful unbelieving wretch, that, as there is no mercy for you, to the diſcredit of God's truth; ſo no peace,

But, becauſe you do not ſee the terrible curſes and threatnings that you are under, remember that, in a ſhort while, death and you will meet together, and its cold arms and you muſt embrace each other; and, if this goſpel be hid to you, then, after that, hell and you will meet together, and the flames of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath and you will embrace each other to eternity; and the <hi>motto</hi> written upon the door of your hell will be, <hi>The vengeance of truth and righteouſneſs, for the abuſe of mercy and peace.</hi> Let this word of terror ſink into your conſcience, O graceleſs, chriſtleſs, unbelieving ſoul, that never ſaw the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor felt the virtue of this bleſſed meeting, and, <hi>Galio</hi>-like, <hi>care for none of theſe things.</hi> But on the other hand,</p>

Then I can ſay, that all the comforts, that iſſue from that glorious meeting in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you; and God allows you <hi>ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to the hope ſet before you:</hi> For <hi>that city of refuge, to which you have fled,</hi> is the cencre of the meeting, and the place appointed, where <hi>they kiſs one another</hi> harmoniouſly. Why, ſay you, <hi>What concern have I in their meeting and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing each other?</hi> O believer, they met together for your ſake, and kiſſed one another out of kindneſs to you: For there was no real jarring among them, but all the apparent jarring was about you, and how they ſhould be glorified in your ſalvation; and when infinite wiſdom found the ranſom and ſo the way how they ſhould all be glorified in your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, then they hugged each other in their arms, as it were, in a rapture of joy, for your ſake. Prov. 8.31. <hi>His delights were with the ſons of Men.</hi> It was not one attribute only, that had its delight, ſatisfaction and glory, 'tis <hi>delights</hi> in the plural number; for all the <hi>attributes of God</hi> had their <hi>delights</hi>: And about what was it?

This meeting and embracement is founded upon the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious meeting and embracement of the divine attributes in Chriſt; and therefore it ſhall be ſure, abiding and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all theſe attributes are engaged for your comfort and ſupport, and <hi>this glory of the Lord you ſhall for ever behold</hi>: For Chriſt, in whom all theſe glorious perfections meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, hath prayed for it, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will, that

Here then, believer, is ground of comfort to you, in every caſe: comfort againſt <hi>deſertion.</hi> Is it long ſince Chriſt and you met together, and kiſſed each other? Behold, here is the reaſon, why, <hi>he will never altogether leave you, nor forſake you</hi>; but ſtill meet with you now and then, when he ſees it fit, and give you the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiſs of his infinitely bleſſed lips, &amp; embrace of his arms, till you come to the intimate, immediate embracements of his love in glory; why, becauſe <hi>mercy and truth are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> So ſure as mercy and truth are met together, as ſurely will the Lord meet with you. Here is comfort againſt the <hi>law,</hi> when it comes in as a covenant upon your conſcience, ſaying, <hi>Pay what thou oweſt, or otherwiſe thou art curſed, and muſt go to hell</hi>; and the law, ſpeaking in the name of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> ſeems terrible: But you may ſoon anſwer by faith, and ſay, <hi>O law, the demand is juſt indeed, and agreeable to</hi> truth <hi>and</hi> righteouſneſs; <hi>but you miſtake the perſon: For</hi> truth <hi>and</hi> righteouſneſs <hi>have already met with</hi> mercy <hi>and</hi> peace, <hi>in the perſon of Chriſt my huſband, who endured all my hell, and became a curſe for me; and therefore I have no ground to fear the hell thou threatneſt, nor the curſe thou denounceſt, nor any liableneſs thereto.</hi> Here is comfort againſt <hi>Satan</hi> &amp; his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For this bleſſed meeting in Chriſt did concert his ruin, and the bruiſing of his head. Here is comfort againſt <hi>church-diviſions</hi> and <hi>commotions</hi>: When neither miniſters nor private chriſtians do meet together, or embrace one another with love and amity; is this ſad and afflicting to you? Here is a meeting, that may give you comfort in that caſe: For no member of that meeting will ever fall out among themſelves, or fall out with you. Here is comfort againſt your jarring with friends: What do I know but there is ſome here that cannot get lived in peace with ſuch a friend or relation, nor their chriſtian liberty enjoyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their frowns? And may be they are as aliens to you,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:040455_0055_1016465532F91668"/>
not in ſpeaking terms with you; you cannot meet together with them <hi>cordially,</hi> nor embrace one another <hi>amicably</hi>: But let this be <hi>your comfort</hi> in that caſe, <hi>mercy and truth are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other</hi>; and you have got a kiſs by the by, and that is better than all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all the friends in the world. Here is comfort againſt <hi>publick calamities</hi> that ſeem to be approaching, or perſonal trials that may be coming upon you. Here is a cordial, though affliction and you meet together; tho' in a little time death and you meet together; yet this meeting of divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in Chriſt, your glorious head; ſpeaks comfort and ſafety to you in every caſe. Though you ſhould die diſtracted, this meeting cannot be diſſolved; and you, having ſeen the glory, and felt the virtue thereof, ſhall be ſure to enjoy the benefit of it to eternity: <hi>Yea, ſurely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow you all the days of your life, and you ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi>

Surely, the news of ſuch a glorious and harmonious meeting of the divine perfections, about the ſalvation of ſinners in and by Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould be joyfully received.

Your duty is, not only to rejoice in this matchleſs harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conjunction of divine attributes in Chriſt, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify the ſame, by an harmonious conjunction of graces and holy virtues in you. Let <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as divine attributes, in Chriſt, be exemplified by <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> meeting together, as divine virtues in you: Let <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>peace</hi> kiſſing each other in him, be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>peace</hi> kiſſing each other in you: Let the meeting of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> engage you to be merciful and true; <hi>merciful,</hi> becauſe <hi>your heavenly Father is merciful</hi>; and <hi>true,</hi> becauſe <hi>he deſires truth in the inward parts.</hi> Let the embraces of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> engage you to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peaceable, that is, to be ſtudents of purity and peace: <hi>For the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, and then peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Jam 3.17. It is declared in the verſe following our text, that it is the deſign of theſe perfections of God, looking down <hi>harmoniouſly</hi> from heaven, to make ſuitable graces ſpring up from the earth: <hi>Truth ſhall ſpring out of the earth, and righteouſneſs ſhall look down from heaven.</hi> When <hi>the Son of righteouſneſs,</hi> in whom all the excellencies of God do ſhine, looks down; then as the natural ſun, ſheddings its influences, makes fruit to ſpring up from the earth; ſo the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs looking down, and ſhedding abroad his influences, makes <hi>truth,</hi> and all the reſt of <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> to ſpring out of the earth, out of the heart, the ſoil where they are ſown, in regeneration.

For the word is nigh thee, even in your mouth, and in your heart,</hi> Rom. 10.8. <hi>q. d.</hi> So near is he in this word, that you may kiſs him with your mouth, as it were, and embrace him in your heart; and to take in his word of grace, and Chriſt in it, is to embrace him. What do you ſay againſt Chriſt? Are you afraid that <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> conſpire againſt you, and hinder <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> from ever meeting with you, and embracing you? O no, fear not; only believe, <hi>that mercy and truth are met together,</hi> and that <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace have kiſſed each other</hi> in Chriſt. <hi>Truth</hi> will not ſtand in the way of <hi>mercy</hi>; for they have met together: <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> will not ſtand in the way of <hi>peace</hi>; for they have kiſſed each other. He is indeed an infinitely juſt God, to take vengeance upon ſin; but <hi>juſtice</hi> will not hinder <hi>mercy</hi> from coming to you: Only believe that <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> are reconciled in Chriſt, ſo as <hi>mercy</hi> can vent itſelf towards you, to the credit of <hi>juſtice.</hi> But O! may ſuch a blackmouthed ſinner as I, as black as hell and the devil, expect a kiſs of ſuch an infinitely fair Jeſus? Is that to be expected, that ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites ſhould meet in one another's arms? Ye, allow me, tho' a black ſinner like yourſelf, to be the happy meſſenger, to tell you in God's name, that be you as black as you will, ſuch a meeting and embracing betwixt Chriſt and you is more to be expected, than ever men or angels could have expected that infinite <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> ſhould have met together, and kiſſed each other in a God-man; and this unexpected meeting

is the very ground upon which your expectation of a meeting with, &amp; embracement of God in Chriſt, is to be founded: O then, come, &amp; kiſs the Son. Why but I cannot, ſay you; I think I would fain do it; but I cannot get at him, to kiſs and embrace him. Indeed this kindneſs muſt begin on his ſide; and therefore, O pray that he would come, &amp; meet you with a kiſs of infinite love. Say with the church, <hi>Song</hi> 1.2. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth: For his love is better then wine.</hi> If that be the language of your ſoul, O I cannot embrace him; but my heart ſays, O let him come &amp; embrace me, and draw me out of the embracements of all my former lovers and luſts that I may never kiſs any idol in the world again, but may live &amp; die in the arms &amp; embraces of the Son of God; is that the language of you ſoul before the living GOD? why then the embracement betwixt Chriſt and you is begun, that ſhall never have an end; for it is a pledge, that he and you ſhall meet together in heaven, and embrace each other to eternity.</p>
            <p>Now, though I hope that this glorious meeting of divine perfections in Chriſt hath put forth ſome vitrue to draw in ſome poor ſoul to the match; yet I fear that the moſt part are yet but idle hearers &amp; ſpectators, as if they were not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But O unconcerned ſoul, be who you will, O yet, will you come and ſee this great ſight! O come and ſee the <hi>greateſt ſight that ever was,</hi> or will be, in heaven or earth, <hi>a buſh burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not conſumed</hi>; all the burning and ſhining attributes of God meeting together with infinite harmony in the buſh of our nature, and yet the buſh able <hi>to bear the glory,</hi> Zech. 6.13. O come and wonder! Here is the wonder of men and angels! For this is a wonderful meeting to them: And the name of the meeting-place is juſtly called, <hi>wonderful</hi>! O come and partake; for the meeting is concerning your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt: <hi>His delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> O come and ſing to the praiſe and glory of this wonderful harmonious embracement of divine perfections in Chriſt, eſpecially you

that partake, ſo as to ſee the glory, and feel the virtue thereof O will you ſing with your hearts, and lips, and lives, ſaying. <hi>Glory to God,</hi> that his attributes have meet together, and kiſſed each other, in Chriſt; and that ever the like of me got a kiſs by the by: <hi>Glory to God,</hi> that there is no breaking off this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ting, nor parting of theſe embraces, by ſin, <hi>Satan,</hi> earth or hell; but that they meet and embrace each other to eternity. And tho' you cannot remmember to ſing all that hath been ſaid, yet I hope the weakeſt memory may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſing the beſt note of all the ſermon every day, ſaying, <hi>Glory, glory, glory, to God, that mercy and truth are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
