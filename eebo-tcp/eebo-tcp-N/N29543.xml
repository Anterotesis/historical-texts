         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS Day Shines moſt happily upon us, wherein we ſee and enjoy Your Excellency Seated in the Chair of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over this His Majeſties Province, and Entered upon the Exerciſe thereof, to the great content of all.</p>
            <p>I may well ſay this day, inaſmuch as this Your Excellency's Preſence is that which makes it to be more Day with us than lately it hath been, ſince it cannot more properly or fitly be lookt upon than as the Riſing of that greater Light of a more conſpicuous Orb, and proportionable Influences, which nature hath appointed to diſtinguiſh and rule the day,</p>
            <p>We may truly ſay, That our long Expectation of Your Excellency hath been an Expectation with Deſire; and we now begin to find that true which the Wiſe man tells us, <hi>That when the Deſire cometh, it is a Tree of Life</hi>; Long may it Root and Flouriſh, that we may long ſit under the Shadow, and Enjoy the Fruit thereof.</p>
            <p>Had not Your Excellencys particular Inſtructions, and His Majeſties more Eſpecial Service in another Province belonging to Your Lordſhips Government, neceſſarily prevented, we had much ſooner Enjoyed this days happineſs: For ſure we are, Your Lordſhip hath put no needleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays upon us, having more than redeemed all the time that hath been ſpent elſewhere, in doing thoſe great and neceſſary things there brought to paſs;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039346_0002_10141E67AACF2AE0"/>
and in the mean time not omitting to give unto us early and repeated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of Your Lordſhips favourable inclinations and forwardneſs to be coming to us, and of Your having Entertained us very far into Your good Opinion and Good-Will, for which we do moſt humbly return our moſt Sincere Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>And ſince our Turn is ſo happily come at laſt, we will not begrudge, but Congratulate unto our Neighbours, that they have been ſo long the firſt in reaping the ſignal Fruits of your Lordſhips Government amongſt them Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred with ſo much care and indefatigableneſs; ſo much Wiſdom and Juſtice, and ſuch a fixed reſolution and zeal expreſſed againſt things evil, and to be diſcountenanced. And this we do the more freely, becauſe that from this experience of theirs, it comes to paſs, that we now receive Your Excellency more nearly known and underſtood, unto the greater, not only Confirmation, but alſo Enlargement of all our Expectations for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All men muſt needs take notice, but none can with the like Senſe and Concernment as our ſelves, how highly His Majeſty hath honoured &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified this Province in placing over us Your Excellency, a perſon of ſo high and great Quality, noble in degree, and much more noble otherwiſe; who have ſtood ſo much in publick view for Merits and Services greater than ordinary, and who have in most Honourable Imployment ſtood ſo near, and been ſo acceptable to His Majeſty, and His Late Royal Conſort our late Soveraign Lady. Your Lordſhips Honour ſhall be ours, and the Luſtre of Your Name and Character ſhall be reflected upon us, ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance &amp; encreaſe our reputation from this day forward in the world. And ſince <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the great diſtance that we His Majeſties Subjects here do ſtand in from His Sacred Perſon: Your Lordſhip is placed as the Great Medium of Intercourſe and Communication: We moſt thankfully and joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ſelves poſſeſſed this day of a greater advantage than ever heretofore, by reaſon of Your Excellencys Interpoſition, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Your Intereſt for us both in making our moſt humble Addreſſes and Applications to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and in the obtaining thence all thoſe Favours, Supports and Cheriſhings of Supream Authority, which we do, and ſo often ſhall ſtand in need of, without the leaſt doubt of Succeſs; Having KING <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Third, the Glorious Deliverer and Reſtorer of Three Kingdoms, the Bulwark of the true Proteſtant Religion, and all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties: Moſt Princely, moſt Juſt, moſt rightfully appointed, Heavens Care, the Father of all His People, and the beſt of Kings, to Reign over us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good people of this Province (as hath already been more publickly ſignified) cannot, nor indeed ought they to forget that great difference of Intereſt and Deſign, upon which their Fathers and Predeceſſors, truly Great and Good Men in this reſpect, did with ſo much coſt and hazard, tranſport themſelves and ſettle this wilderneſs: Moſt other Plantations declared for nothing more than Trade and Gains; but thoſe good men publickly Owned that of Religion. That they and theirs might more freely Enjoy the Worſhip and Ordinances thereof; That their Children might be Educated more free from the growing Vices and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of other places, that they might be brought up in a Land where
<pb facs="unknown:039346_0003_10141E69795DB6F8"/>
the Examples of Piety, Sobriety, Diligence, Strict Obſervation of Gods Holy Sabbaths; and all other Vertues and Good Behaviour might be more abundantly in their View. The Settlement of theſe things under the Government and Royal Charter then obtained, was the Firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement which they chiefly laboured in. The Enjoyment of theſe was the firſt and principal Enjoyment which they took contentment in. And from thoſe times, SIR, until now, the ſame Intereſt and Deſign hath (Thanks be to God) continued in ſome good meaſure the great Standard and Rule whereby this people have made an Eſtimate of all their Concernments. By this they have judged of Things and Perſons, of themſelves and others, and of the Times and Providences that have paſſed over us. Whilſt they have kept up to this great Deſign, they have reckon'd themſelves to be going forward, but otherwiſe to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward: When Divine Providences have Smiled on them as to theſe things, they have ever thought themſelves to enjoy much of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven; but otherwiſe to be under its Frowns. When it was in their power, they have ever Choſen ſuch to be Over them in chiefeſt place as were Lovers, and would be Promoters of this Great Intereſt and Deſign, and the great things mentioned under the ſame. And all this I take the boldneſs thus plainly to mention to Your Lordſhip, that I may alſo as plainly ſay, that one great and principal cauſe of the joy and thankfulneſs of this day, is, that God and the King have made ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Choice for us, that in the Perſon of Your Excellency we do at this time receive a Captain General and Governour in Chief, who hath given ſo many and great proofs of His great Eſteem of Sincere Love to, and Care for all theſe Things; and by whoſe Example and Authority, as a Patron and Favourer, they may be promoted and ſecured to us; and all that which is contrary and deſtructive of them, Diſcouraged and Suppreſſed.</p>
            <p>As to the State of the Province, Your Lordſhip will ſoon fully acquaint Your Self therewith, and therein I am not ſo confident that you will not find many things, and ſome material ones, out of order, as I am, that by Your Excellencys Authority, Happy Conduct, and Univerſal Influence, a favourable, proper and ſpeedy Remedy will be given to them all: Each Order and Degree amongſt us, co-operating with Your Excellency thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as in Duty we are bound: Nor do we doubt, but that in judging of our Affairs, and of the Management of the laſt Years, Your Lordſhip will make favourable Allowances for the Emergencies, Difficulties and Diſtractions of the late War, that continued ſo long, and did ſo ſorely preſs upon us; from all which we rejoyce, that Your Excellency, in Your Time, ſhall be ſo happily delivered; and that we ſhall ſo ſeaſonably receive Your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencys Aſſiſtances unto the Improvement, better Settlement and Enjoyment of that Peace, which through the proſperouſneſs of His Majeſties Great and Glorious Undertakings in <hi>Europe,</hi> we do at this day ſo far ſee the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of</p>
            <p>We muſt not now call them Enemies whom we have found to be the moſt pernicious of all other. I mean our <hi>French</hi> Neighbours; but Your Excellency underſtands them well enough; and will as well watch and counterwork them in all their ſiniſter and crafty methods and underminings; Since they cannot but everlaſtingly adhere to all their Envyings of us, and

of our Proſperity; and to their moſt unjuſt Deſigns of Encroaching upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the Bounds, Rights and Priviledges, of this and all other His Majeſties Provinces bordering upon them.</p>
            <p>But by this time I have too long delayed Your Lordſhip and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Occaſions of the Day. I have only therefore to add for my ſelf, that as it was a great Honour done me, and far greater than I could reaſonably ever aſpire unto, to be placed in the Government of this Province, by His Majeſties Moſt Gracious Command; firſt during the abſence of the late Governour, and then to be continued therein during the Vacancy of the Place, till Your Excellencys moſt happy Arrival: So I do now moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely own it to be the greateſt Honour that ever I do in this World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that I have Reſigned it into ſo Noble Hands as thoſe of Your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and ſo much the more, becauſe the latter is of ſo much greater advantage unto the Publick, than the former could be capable of.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> let the Station that I have Held, which hath much increaſed the intenſeneſs of my Affection unto the good people of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with whom I have long been Joyned; both in Proſperity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and unto whom (I mean thoſe that ſhall be gone before) I muſt ere long nextly be gathered as unto my people: Let this excuſe my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and boldneſs, that I do now by way of affectionate Requeſt, moſt humbly and earneſtly Recommend them to Your Excellencys moſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Favourable Regards; whom by way of Authority, GOD and the KING have Committed unto Your Charge and Government, which I pray may be long and proſperous; both to Your Self, and to us all.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>My Lord,</hi> (which indeed ſhould have been the firſt thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at this time) we do all moſt humbly Thank Your Excellency for all the moſt kind and obliging Expreſſions of Favour to us in Your Lordſhips Speech made this Day.</p>
