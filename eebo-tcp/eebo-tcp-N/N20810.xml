            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>TO be ever reſtleſs and diſſatisfied, is natural to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and this diſpoſition impells us to ſeek plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in variety, and happineſs in ſomething unpoſſeſſed. That deſirable ſomething none ever attain, but all find amuſement in its purſuit. Our time being thus engaged and our paſſions employed, we paſs through life in a continual agitation, and often enjoy in idea, what Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027335_0003_0FD40AF30E8D24B8"/>
never permits us to taſte in reality, during the period of our mortal exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it ſit we ſhould be entirely happy in this world, for if we were, we ſhould think of no other; and the neceſſary thoughts of futurity would be ſacrificed to the preſent enjoyments; permanent bleſſings would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the captivating charms of tranſitory pleaſures; and mankind loſt to active bliſs, would place all their happineſs in a ſerene apathy, and find their greateſt lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury in lazineſs.</p>
                     <p>But Providence, very wiſely, to prevent the whole world from <hi>running to ruſt,</hi> if I may be allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, hath implanted in our natures a perpetual deſire of change; an impulſive principle which renders the ſame objects ſatiating, and the ſame ſituations irkſome. It is this principle which hath occaſioned the riſe and fall of empires in all ages, and furniſhed the materials for all the hiſtories and biographical productions that ever were written. This hath impelled to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant diſcoveries, and the nobleſt atchievements; and a more than ordinary ſhare of this fire of impatience or active principle, is what forms the hero, philoſopher, poet, or any other character which renders itſelf ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or performs what is remarkable. Thus we may perceive, if order is heaven's firſt law, action is its, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt agent.</p>
                     <p>But though this active principle is diffuſed through the whole human race, yet it has not a ſimilar operation in every individual; we find many whoſe natures are more heterogeneous, and whoſe imaginations are more eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric than the generality of mankind. It is the actions of ſuch that furniſh entertainment for the more phlegmatic, the more fedate, or the more ſedentary part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr. Pope very juſtly obſerves, that
<q>
                           <l>Moſt ſouls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,</l>

                           <l>Dim lights of life that burn a length of years,</l>
                           <l>Uſeleſs, unſeen, as lamps in ſepulchres,</l>
                           <l>
                              <pb n="5" facs="unknown:027335_0004_0FD40AF673743208"/>Like eaſtern kings a lazy ſtate they Keep,</l>
                           <l>And cloſe confin'd in their own palace ſleep.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such form the bulk of mankind, who, if they can in the leaſt vary their daily amuſements, never wiſh to change the place of their reſidence. Their paſſions are domeſtic, their curioſity limited, and the daily occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may happen in the courſe of their buſineſs, or in the circle of their acquaintance, is all the variety they deſire to know. The ſtrange and furprizing they are content to take at ſecond hand, and being perfectly ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied with reading and hearing of things that are uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they never wiſh to run any hazard in ſeeing or knowing experimentally what others relate. The actions of ſuch are ſo little intereſting, that a recital of their lives would appear extremely inſipid and unentertaining.</p>
                     <p>But we may naturally expect a fund of amuſement, as well as inſtruction from the authentic memoirs of ſuch whoſe lives have been a continual ſcene of variety. Whoſe active ſpirits have perpetually impelled them to a change of place, as well as ſentiments, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe ſouls, ſcorning to be prejudiced by vulgar cuſtoms, tranſmitted by received opinions, or biaſs'd by common ſyſtems, hath led them to ſearch for happineſs, or ſeek amuſement in various countries and in different capacities.</p>
                     <p>We have no doubt but as the extraordinary character of the late honourable Mr. Wortley Montague hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited curioſity in many nations, and among all ranks of people, that it will prove infinitely agreeable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, to lay before them an authentic narrative of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remarkable travels, entertaining adventures, and ſingular amours, which having all the merit of fact, are at the ſame time ſo ſurprizing as to exceed the moſt celebrated productions of fiction.</p>
                     <p>But as this reſtleſs and uncommon phaenomenon was the ſon of a lady, whoſe perſonal and mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have made a great noiſe in the world, and whoſe various adventures were likewiſe very extraordinary, it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027335_0005_0FD40AF7E331DF58"/>
may not be amiſs to preface the life of Mr. Montague, by mentioning a few particulars relative to his noble mother. This ſeems the more neceſſary, as a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtance previous to his birth, and which was indeed the <hi>primitive cauſe of his exiſtence,</hi> ſeems ſo intimately connected with theſe memoirs, that we could not with propriety begin them without it.</p>
                     <p>Some time in the year 1716, the celebrated Lady Mary Wortley Montague ſet out with her huſband, who was appointed to go to Conſtantinople in a public capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, for that famous city.</p>
                     <p>They proceeded through Holland, Germany, Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. to the place of their deſtination: the particulars of their journey and the principal curioſities of the places through which they paſſed, are frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the lady herſelf in a courſe of admirable letters written to many perſons of the firſt diſtincton.</p>
                     <p>In a letter written at Vienna, dated Sept. 20, 1716, ſhe ſays, ſpeaking of the ladies of that court, <q>I have not ſeen any ſuch prudes as to pretend fidelity to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who are certainly the beſt natured ſet of people in the world, and took upon their wive's gallants as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably as men do upon their deputies that take the troubleſome part of their buſineſs off their hands.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In what light this lady might hold that part of prudery called chaſtity, or how ſhe might eſtimate her huſband's temper, we cannot pretend to ſay; a little farther how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe inſinuates, that ſhe had not imbibed the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian cuſtoms, by telling us the following tale: <q>One of the pleaſanteſt adventures I ever met with in my life, was laſt night; and it will give you a juſt idea in what a delicate manner the <hi>belles paſſions</hi> are managed in this country; I was at the aſſemply of the counteſs of—, and the young count of—, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me down ſtairs, aſked me how long I was to ſtay at Vienna; I made anſwer that my ſtay depended on the emperor, and it was not in my power to determine it.

Well, Madam, (ſaid he) whether your time here is to be longer or ſhorter, I think you ought to paſs it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and to that end you muſt engage in a little affair of the heart. My heart, (anſwered I, gravely enough) does not engage very eaſily, and I have no deſign of parting with it.

You may judge in what manner I ſhould have received this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my own country, but I was well enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this to know that he really intended me an obligation; and I thanked him with a very grave courteſy, and only aſſured him, that I had no occaſion to make uſe of it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if this be fact, and who would be ſo impolite as to doubt the veracity of a lady, in ſuch a caſe eſpecially, what concluſion muſt the mind, acquainted with her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's character draw? We muſt naturally conjecture that either the abruptneſs or indelicacy of the addreſs, or the perſon from whom it came, diſpleaſed her, or that ſhe certainly was, as ſhe ſays in a ſubſequent letter of the 26th of the ſame month, <q>already infected with the phlegm of the country,</q> for it is moſt certain that the prolific and warm climate of Turkey greatly altered her ladyſhip's ſentiments ſoon after, and rendered her not quite ſo ſcrupulous and phlegmatic.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be conſeſſed, that if ſhe had even <hi>a little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the heart,</hi> it would have impeached her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to have conſeſſed it, as not to have informed her fair correſpondent that ſhe had been addreſſed by a lover, would have ſeemed a tacit confeſſion that her charms had been neglected; an idea which her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's natural vanity could not on any account ſuffer to take root.</p>

                     <p>We ſhould not have taken the liberty to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on letters which art to be admired for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of their compoſition, and the accuracy of their information, nor to have ſcrutinized the conduct of a lady, whoſe great abilities we venerate, and whoſe faults none were to anſwer for but herſelf, had not our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and truth rendered ſuch crititical inquiries abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Though the lady herſelf, or her friends who publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her letterſ after her death, took infinite pains not to betray ſecrets, yet circumſtances that have ſince tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and ſeveral paſſages in the epiſtles themſelves, have given foundation to more than bare ſurmiſe.</p>
                     <p>What are we to think of the expreſſions uſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing her viſit to the lovely <hi>Fatima,</hi>the <hi>Thabya's</hi> lady when her young damſels are ordered to dance before our modern <hi>Sapho</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This dance (ſhe ſays) was very different from what I had ſeen before: nothing can be more artful, or more proper to raiſe <hi>certain ideas,</hi> the tunes ſo ſoſt, the motions ſo languiſhing, accompanied with pauſes and dying eyes, half falling back, and then recovering themſelves in ſo artful a manner, that I am very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive, the coldeſt and moſt rigid prude upon earth could
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027335_0008_0FD40AFC294CEBF8"/>
not have looked upon them without thinking of <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not to be ſpoken of.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Does not the ſoul of the lady ſpeak in theſe words? Warmed by the ſubject, her inclination appears without diſguiſe; her prudence is loſt in paſſion, that frigid turn of thinking contracted in the dominions of the Houſe of Auſtna, ſeems to have vaniſhed before the captivating ſoft muſic, and languiſhing dances of the Turkiſh <hi>harams.</hi> We have no doubt but theſe ſoft and foothing incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives might overcome the purer reſolutions which her cooler reaſon might have wiſhed to cheriſh. And that aided by ſach blandiſhments, <hi>that</hi> love inſpiring climate had ſacrificed ſentiment at the throne of ſenſation, and by giving birth to certain ideas had ſtimulated the fair voluptuary to <hi>ſomething not to be ſpoken of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In her 43d letter, ſhe again ſays, <q>it is certain what we <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> is properly (if any thing is properly) our own; but the good of ſame, the folly of praiſe, are hardly purchaſed, and when obtained, poor recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for the loſs of time and health. We die, or grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labours; conſidering what ſhort-liv'd weak animals men are, is there any ſtudy ſo beneficial as the ſtudy of preſent pleaſure?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is it not naturally to be ſuppoſed, that a perſon who held out ſuch a ſyſtem as rational, and ſeemed ſo fond of the theory, would adopt the practical part, and miſs no preſent opportunity of enjoying a more ſubſtantial ſatisfaction, than what would accrue from the mere intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual pleaſures of platonic gratification.</p>
                     <p>In another place ſhe informs us that ſhe is no enemy to pleaſure <q>when it is properly ſeaſoned, and of a good compoſition.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The above paſſages are ſufficient to evince the nature of the lady's ideas, and the bent of her inclinations.</p>
                     <p>We do not wiſh to build upon what has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027335_0009_0FD40AFE0248B398"/>
of her by <hi>common fame,</hi> as <hi>common fame</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a very great <hi>magniſier of facts,</hi> as well as <hi>inventor of falſehoods.</hi> Without therefore recurring to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerations of the chronicles of ſcaindal or ſpleen, if the public only believe a fiftieth part of what hath been aſſerted concerning this remarkable perſonage, it will be ſufficient to corroborate what we mean to advance.</p>
                     <p>This lady in her writings frequently inſinuates that ſhe never ſaw the inſide of the imperial <hi>ſeraglio</hi>; yet ſhe tells as, that ſhe was informed by the <hi>Sultana Hafiten</hi> favorite of the <hi>Emperor Muſtapha</hi> who was depoſed, <q>that the ſtory of the Sultan's throwing a handkerchief is altogether fabulous, and the manner upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion no other than this; He ſends the <hi>Kyſter Age</hi> to ſignify to the lady the honour he intends her, ſhe is immediately complimented upon it by the others, and led to the bath, where ſhe is perſumed and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the moſt magnificent and becoming manner; the emperor precedes his viſit by a royal preſent, and then comes into her apartment. Neither is there any ſuch thing as her creeping in at the bed's foot. Sometimes the Sultan diverts himſelf in the company of all his ladies, who ſtand in a circle around him; when they were ready to die with envy and jealouſy of the <hi>happy ſhe,</hi> that he diſtinguiſhed by any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of preference.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are ſorry to be under the diſagreeable neceſſity of not aſſenting implicitly to what is advanced by a lady, but the character of a <hi>faithful biographer,</hi> and a ſtrict adherence to facts render a contrary conduct abſolutely requiſite.</p>
                     <p>We cannot condemn our modern <hi>Sapho</hi> for the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent concealment of an error, which perhaps was not intentional; but we muſt beg leave to ſay that the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana <hi>Hafiten</hi> did not tell her the above particulars.</p>
                     <p>This may ſeem a bold aſſertion, but there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption of its being a fact, for the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of both ſexes would ſooner loſe their lives than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal

                     <p>THE huſband of our modern <hi>Sapho</hi> had not been long at Conſtantinople, before he was attacked by a kind of malignant diſorder, which confined him for ſome weeks to his bed, and for ſome months to his chamber.</p>
                     <p>His lady behaved with great reſpect, and indeed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs during his illneſs; but ſhe was neither ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately tender as to fall ſick to keep him company, nor ſo doatingly fond as to become his nurſe.</p>
                     <p>She knew that there were plenty of thoſe about him who were much better qualified than herſelf to preſcribe remedies, or adminiſter neceſſaries to him. Knowing therefore that the utmoſt human care was taken of him. ſhe left the event to Providence with ſingular reſignation, and, gave way to the propenſities natural to her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, ſhe purſued knowledge with unwearied

diligence, and then to ſoſten the ſeverity of her ſtudies, fought the relaxation of the amuſements and pleaſures of the caſt, or took every means to gratify her curioſity, which was exceſſive.</p>
                     <p>She had frequently intimated a ſtrong deſire to gain admiſſion into the imperial <hi>ſeraglio,</hi> that ſhe might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the internal wonders of that celebrated place. But all whom ſhe ever mentioned this to, repreſented the thing as impoſſible, except a Jew merchant, who informed her, that ſuch favour he believed, might be procured, but the utmoſt privacy and precaution muſt be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Eager to gratify her curioſity, ſhe did not recur to conſequences, and ſtimulated by the idea, perhaps mixed with vanity, of beholding ſo remarkable a place, from which all except thoſe doomed to reſide there, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſhe did not give herſelf time to reflect on a ſtep, if not dangerous, at leaſt indiſcreet.</p>
                     <p>It may not be here amiſs to mention, that ſoon after her arrival at Conſtantinople, ſhe aſſumed the Turkiſh habit, in order, upon any occaſion to gratify her curioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with greater caſe and privacy, and without being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, as ſhe muſt have been in her own dreſs.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the facility of a lady's going undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered wherever ſhe pleaſes in a Turkiſh dreſs, and the caſe with which the females of thoſe eaſtern countries manage their intrigues, take her own words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>As to their morality, meaning the Turkiſh ladies, or good conduct, I can ſay like Harlequin, that it is juſt as it is with you, and the Turkiſh ladies, do not commit one ſin the leſs for not being Chriſtians. Now that I am a little acquainted with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring either the exemplary diſcretion, or extreme ſtupidity of all the writers that have given an account of them: it is very caſy to ſee, they have in reality more liberty than we have; no woman of what rank ſoever is permitted to go into the ſtreets without two <hi>marlins,</hi> one that covers her face all but her eyes,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027335_0012_0FD40B049BC30670"/>
and another, that hides the whole dreſs of her head, and hangs half way down her back; their ſhapes are alſo wholly concealed by a thing they call a <hi>ferigce,</hi> which no woman of any ſort appears without, this has ſtrait ſleeves that reach to their ſingers' ends, and it laps all around them, not unlike a riding hood; in winter it is of cloth, and in ſummer of plain ſtuff or ſilk. You may gueſs then, how effectually this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes them, ſo that there is no diſtinguſhing the great lady from her ſlave. It is impoſſible for the moſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous huſband to know his wife when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the ſtreets.

                     </p>
                     <p>The before mentioned Jew was as good as his word, and in the above drſcribed diſguiſe ſhe was introduced into the <hi>ſeraglio</hi> of his ſublime higneſs, that <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> of voluptuous gratification, and grand repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of terreſtrial beauties.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had gratified her curioſity by examining the elegance of the apartments, the ſplendour of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the beauties of the garden, and the charms of the ladies, ſhe was given to underſtand that no female was ever permitted to enter that place without being ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the inclinations of his ſublime highneſs; that as it was a ceremonial never diſpenſed with, it was expected in the preſent inſtance, that it would be complied with without reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Whether the lady made a virtue of neceſſary, and ſubmitted with a good grace to what ſhe had no power to prevent, whether ſhe affected to expoſtulate, yielded with reluctance, or was compelled into a compliance, we cannot pretend to aſſert; ſuffice it to ſay, that in the ſpring of the year 1718, our hero came into the world.</p>

                     <p>AS young Montague's years increaſed, the ſhining qualities of his mind were the admiration of all who knew him. He poſſeſſed all that elegance of wit and vivacity which diſtinguiſhed his illuſtrious mother; together with the voluptuous diſpoſition and love of pleaſure that marked the character of the great peiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from whom he was always proud to deduce his origin.</p>

                     <p>His perplexity was inexpreſſible. He fancied the people of the houſe knew the whole affair, and could read the miſdemeanor he had been guilty of in his face, and began to be apprehenſive that they were about to ſeize him, and deliver him up to the maſter of the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary, from which he had eloped.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections alarmed him ſo much that he aſked what was to pay, in great diſorder, and being told, threw down the money in haſte, and decamped with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt precipitation, frequently looking behind him with the greateſt confuſion and terror.</p>
                     <p>After he had run himſelf out of breath, and out of danger, as he fancied, he began to moderate his pace, and to conſider what was to be done in his preſent dilemma.</p>

                     <p>Montague replied in the affirmative, provided he could have a good maſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>As for that (replied young <hi>Sable</hi>) I'll take you to my maſter, you can't have a better; he'll fill your belly, if he beats your back.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This information did not intimidate young Montague. The idea of commencing chimney-ſweeper tickled his imagination, and ſuited exactly with his natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for novelty.</p>
                     <p>His new comrade immediately conducted him to his maſter, who was ſitting by the fire-fide with his wiſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſingularity of their appearance threw the ſooty couple into great conſternation; they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning of ſuch ſtrange metamorphoſes; fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to the imagination a boy as black as ſoot could make him, dreſſed in an elegant ſuit of light coloured cloaths, white ſilk ſlockings, and a ſilver-laced hat, while a comely youth appeared by the ſide of him, with a ſkin as fair as alabaſter, yet clad in the ſable garments of a chimney-ſweeper, and whoſe fine head of hair was cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with a dirty woollen night-cap full of holes.</p>
                     <p>But their doubts were ſoon ſolved by their appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, who informed them of the particulars of the whole affair, and of young Montague's deſire to commence a brother of the bruſh.</p>
                     <p>The maſter immediately conſented to receive him as one of the fraternity, and to initiate him in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the profeſſion. But deeming our hero's cloaths
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027335_0017_0FD40B0C53FA2E78"/>
to be too good a prize for his boy, he determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to his own uſe: Therefore, ordering the boy to ſtrip, he gave him the ſame kind of apparel as he had lately parted from to young Montague, and promiſed to keep the others ſafely for him, till he was out of his time.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>DISAGREEABLE as this dirty profeſſion may ſeem, young Montague grew fond of it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo great a proficient in the ſooty buſineſs, that his maſter was very nappy in having met with him.</p>
                     <p>Add to this, his comical humours and whirnſical ways diverted all that he came near; ſo that wherever he went to ſweep chimneys he was ſure to be well treated, and often had money given him as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. for the mirth he occaſioned; this money he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſpent upon his ſable comrades, which made them exceedingly fond of his company, and always ready to oblige him: thus he lived much happier than the idea of ſuch an employment could permit one to ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>A publican who was an acquaintance and neighbour of his maſter, had ſome company in his houſe one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who refuſed to leave the houſe when he wanted to retire to reſt.</p>
                     <p>They were in a back parlour pretty much intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and buſily employed in gaming: a large ſum of money was depoſited on the table, dependent on the play; while the effects of the liquor tney had drank, with the eagerneſs and anxiety on account of their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027335_0018_0FD40B0DC9737AB8"/>
ſtakes, occaſioned them frequently to utter the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imprecations.</p>
                     <p>The landlord expoſtulated with them in vain, they poſitively refuſed either to quit the houſe or ceaſe from ſwearing.</p>
                     <p>At length it came into the landlord's head to apply to our hero's maſter for one of his boys to execute a ſcheme which he had conceived.</p>
                     <p>Young Montague was ſent with him: he led him into a room adjoining to that in which the gameſters were at play, and directed him to aſcend the chimney there and deſcend through that which belonged to the parlour where they were ſo buſily engaged.</p>
                     <p>Our hero followed his inſtructions, and deſcended the chimney without their hearing him, when creeping ſoftly into the midſt of the room unperceived, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cried out with a loud voice, "My maſter Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer has ſent me for you all." Hearing the words, they all inſtantaneouſly turned their eyes to the place from whence the ſound proceeded, and perceiving his ſable appearance, a general panic ſeized them, they ſtarted up ſuddenly, crowded to the door with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt terror, and made their eſcape with the greateſt precipitation.</p>
                     <p>This whimſical method of driving away troubleſome campany was attended with theſe further good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. The fright cured every individual of them of the itch for gaming, and the habit of ſwearing.</p>
                     <p>As they were too much ternflod to reſlect, and in too great a hurry to make their eſcape, they never thought of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As there was ſomething whimſical in another of our
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027335_0019_0FD40B0ED097C5B0"/>
hero's adventures while he remained in the capacity of a chimney-ſweeper, we ſhall recite it.</p>
                     <p>Being ſent to ſweep ſome chimneys at a houſe in Golden-Square, he got out of the top of the chimney, and after looking about for ſome time from the leads of the houſe, curioſity at length prompted him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend a chimney which belonged to the next houſe.</p>
                     <p>He deſcended into an elegant bed-chamber, where he perceived a fine down bed, which the lady of the houſe had juſt quitted.</p>
                     <p>As he had lodged but indifferently for ſome time paſt, he determined to give his limbs a quarter of an hour's indulgence, by creeping into the lady's place, and covering himſelf over head and ears, where he lay for ſome time buried in down, and exulting in the ſucceſs of the whim.</p>
                     <p>At length a chamber-maid came into the room to make the bed, and place every thing in its proper order.</p>
                     <p>This girl it ſeems had for a long time made a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſtealing her miſtreſs's marmalade, and other ſweetmeats, which were depoſited in a cloſet in this bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and which the girl got at by means of a ſalſe key ſhe kept for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>According to cuſtom ſhe went to the cloſet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed herſelf as long as ſhe thought proper, with what ſhe fancied the moſt delicious.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe was ſatisfied, ſhe careleſsly approached towards the bed in order to make it, when pulling off the cloaths, up ſtarted young Montague, who retreated towards the chimney, and ſcrambling up with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and dexterity, got into the next houſe, finiſhed him buſineſs, and went home.</p>
                     <p>As for the poor girl ſhe was ſo exceedingly terrified, that ſhe gave only one violent ſeream, and fainted away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:027335_0020_0FD40B11F3AC60D8"/>Alarmed by the noiſe, the reſt of the ſervants ran to ſee what had occaſioned it.</p>
                     <p>When they perceived her condition, they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to recover her, and ſoon ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>She had no ſooner recovered her recollection, than ſhe haſtened to her miſtreſs, and throwing herſelf at her feet, with tears in her eyes, implored her forgiveneſs for the wrong ſhe had done her, confeſſing in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and how long ſhe had ſtolen her ſweetmeats, and delivering up the falſe key with which ſhe had perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the crime. At the ſame time ſhe ſolemnly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed never to repeat that or any offence of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince a judgement had befallen her for what ſhe had already done.</p>
                     <p>She then in a moſt pitiful tone gave an account of the devil's having appeared to her, exaggerating every circumſtance, and giving all that dreadful magnitude to the ſuppoſed apparition, which a terrified imagination could conceive. She declared he was upward of ſeven feet in height, that his eyes were as large as ſaucers, and as fierce as fire, that blue flames iſſued from his mouth and noſtrils, that his tail was as big as a ſhip's cable, and his cloven foot, of which ſhe gave a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was much larger than the foot of the largeſt ox. She concluded this monſtrous detail by aſſerting that he vaniſhed away in a flaſh of lightning.</p>
                     <p>The other ſervants corroborated what ſhe ſaid, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome circumſtances, ſuch as the room and bed being covered with a ſort of black dirt, which as they were wonderfully ſagacious, they ſuppoſed muſt be <hi>brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone aſhes</hi>; and the ſooty ſmell they inſiſted could proceed from nothing but ſulphur.</p>
                     <p>Whatever the lady thought, ſhe pretended to credit the whole ſtory, and took an occaſion to give them a lecture on the moral duties, dwelling largely on the old proverb, that <hi>honeſty is the beſt policy,</hi> and expatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027335_0021_0FD40B13AFA40798"/>
on the dreadful conſequences attending a breach of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> commandmen</p>
                     <p>This whimſical adventure however, luckily reformed the girl; who was naturally d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſpoſed to pilfer whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came in her way, but the sight ever after rendered her conſcientiouſly honeſt. Thus many of young Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's whims, which were infinitely diverting to himſelf, became beneficial in the end to others.</p>
                     <p>As our hero was exceedingly liberal to his ſable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades upon all occaſions, he ſoon exhauſted not only what money had been given him, but all which he had gained by frightening the gameſters.</p>
                     <p>Many of the chimney-ſweepers with whom he had contracted an intimacy, deſigned to celebrate the enſuing 5th of November. They had prepared ſome faggots for a bonfire, and purchaſed fire-works according to their reſpective abilities.</p>
                     <p>Our hero, who was naturally ambitious, wiſhed to outdo them all, in the article of fire-works, by making a ſuperior purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>But not having any money left, he determined to gratify his inclination by diſpoſing of a gold watch, which had formerly been given him by a relation, and which he had not parted with when he changed apparel with the chimney-ſweeper's boy.</p>
                     <p>To this end, he went into a watch-maker's ſhop, without having the leaſt apprehenſion that he ſhould meet with any difficulty, and aſked the maſter of the ſhop, if he would purchaſe a watch.</p>
                     <p>The watch-maker finding it to be a very valuable one, could not conceive that it came honeſtly into the poſſeſſion of a chimney-ſweepers boy; in fact, he had no doubt but he had ſtole it from ſome houſe, where he had been employed to ſweep the chimneys.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:027335_0022_0FD40B14EA08BE00"/>Full of this idea, he kept young Montague in talk while one of his men fetched a conſtable, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately carried him before a magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>Our hero was now frightened out of his wits; in vain he pleaded that it was his own—the Juſtice ſo far from beliving him, was about to commit him to goal, that he might be tried for ſtealing it.</p>
                     <p>Reduced to this dilemma, he was obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his birth and family, who he had the watch as a preſent from, and his elopement from Weſtminſter School.</p>
                     <p>The Juſtice immediately ſent an account of the whole tranſaction to his relations, and the head maſter of the ſchool, who all very ſoon made their appearance.</p>
                     <p>The magiſtrate was ſincerely thanked by his friends— the maſter chimney-ſweeper was ſent for, and ſeverely rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimanded for having concealed a youth of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in a clandeſtine manner; and young Montague was again committed to the care of the reverend gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who then preſided over that ſeminary of learning.</p>
                     <p>It required a great deal of trouble and a conſiderable time to bring his ſkin to its natural colour again, and to eradicate the particles of ſoot which had penetrated into the very pores.</p>
                     <p>As ſevere methods had been formerly found to be ineffectual with young Montague, his maſter judiciouſly determined to try what lenient meaſures would do, and therefore, inſtead of chaſtiſing him for abſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſchool, he was forgiven, careſſed, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every kind of indulgence.</p>

                     <p>BUT a diſpoſition conſtitutionally volatile, and a mind naturally roving, can only be checked for a time. Such a temper when curbed or reſtrained, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly breaks out and evinces itſelf with a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of violence.</p>
                     <p>Thus our hero, who had behaved pretty circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly for a few months, began again to grow tired of the regularity of ſchool-diſcipline, and to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another excurſion without the leave of his preceptor.</p>
                     <p>His imagination had lately been fired by the accounts he had heard of the horſe races at New-Market. He determined to be an eye-witneſs of what in deſcription appeared ſo pleaſing.</p>
                     <p>To this end, he again abſented himſelf from ſchool òne morning early, a few days previous to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the races, and having enquired the road to New-Market, he made haſte to quit the town, and being overtaken by the New-Market ſtage-coach, he got into it, and arrived there that evening.</p>
                     <p>Nor had he forgot the principal article, a large ſum of money: For he had been plentifully ſupplied by an uſurer, who made it his buſineſs to get acquainted with the young noblemen and gentlemen of Weſtminſter ſchool, that by adminiſtering to their propenſity to vice, he might take the advantage of their follies, and by the help of his own cunning and artifice, reap the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſit of their careleſſneſs and inexperience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:027335_0024_0FD40B17D9436C28"/>The races at length began; young Montague was wonderfully delighted with them, and perceiving with what ardor the betts were laid, he was deſirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing adventurer; but did not know who to addreſs himſelf to, or how to proceed.</p>
                     <p>He was not ſuffered long to remain in this ſtate of uncertainty and perplexity. Some ſharpers had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the elegance of his dreſs, and a certain noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deportment by which, from his infancy, he had always been peculiarly diſtinguiſhed. They juſtly jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he was of ſome conſiderable family, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from his being at New-Market, that he was hardly deficient in point of caſh. Theſe ideas were ſufficient to induce them to mark him as a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to be made a prey of.</p>
                     <p>One of the ſharpers was therefore deputed from the reſt to try the experiment. He addreſſed himſelf to young Montague, by aſking him if he would bett and chooſe to take odds.</p>
                     <p>Though our hero was ignorant of what he meant by odds, he did not chooſe to betray his ignorance, but anſwered briſkly in the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>They began to bett with great ſpirit, and our hero loſt his money with the greateſt good temper, and much ſeeming ſatisfaction. Indeed they found him to uſe the ſharpers own technical phraſes, <hi>a willing Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, mighty eaſy to be plucked.</hi> We ſcarce need to add that he was ſtripped of every ſhilling which he had about him.</p>
                     <p>His youth and inexperience, the little knowledge he had of the uſe of money, and the novelty of the thing, prevented him from perceiving his loſſes in any other light, than as occurrences that muſt happen upon ſuch occaſions of courſe. Nay, ſo far was he from ſuppoſing that he had heen defrauded, or any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage taken of his ſimplicity or ignorance of ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that he very willingly diſpoſed of his watch, and a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027335_0025_0FD40B19533B6A88"/>
valuable ring he had with him, in order to continue the ſport, as he called it, and indeed he did continue it, till he had nothing left.</p>
                     <p>In the evening he retired from the courſe much fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and repaired to the inn where he had hitherto put up, when he ſoon went to bed.</p>
                     <p>The next morning he ſeemed rather chagrined, that he had not money to repeat his diverſions. He however repaired to the courſe at the uſual time, thinking that he might meet with thoſe who had won his money the day before, and not doubting but they would lend him a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle to try his luck again.</p>
                     <p>He had however not been above a quarter of an hour upon the courſe, before he was perceived by the very relation, who as before mentioned, gave him the gold watch, which he had the preceding day entirely parted with.</p>
                     <p>This gentleman had been apprized of young Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue's elopement from ſchool before he left London, and was very happy to have an opportunity of ſecuring him, and ſending him to town again.</p>
                     <p>He ſeized him immediately, and taking him to an inn, ſtrictly interrogated and ſeverely reprimanded him. Montague confeſſed the truth of every thing with great candour, except the borrowing of the money of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and the ſum he had loſt; he told his relation in deed that he had loſt all he brought with him, as well as his watch and ring.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman now explained to him in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had been defrauded; informed him, that thoſe he had betted with, were no other than common ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and warned him in the moſt lively manner againſt gaming in general: he then determined to take our hero to the courſe again, that he might, if poſſible, point out thoſe honeſt gentlemen, who ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027335_0026_0FD40B1B41B6CC08"/>Young Montague accompanied his relation upon this expedition with great pleaſure. As his pride was piqued to think he had believed thoſe to be gentlemen, who in reality were only ſharpers, and to have been defrauded at a time he fancied he had loſt his money fairly.</p>
                     <p>They had not been long upon the turf, before our hero perceived the black legged gentry who had ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſſy impoſed upon him: he pointed them out to his noble relation, and thoſe that were with him; they were eaſily ſeized upon, and ſenſible of the conſequence and dignity of thoſe in whoſe power they were, they gladly compounded for their releaſe, by a reſtitution of the watch and ring; they would indeed have reſtored the money, but that was generouſly refuſed, and very glad our hero was that it happened ſo, as the reſtitution would have occaſioned his intercourſe with the uſurer to have been detected, for the largeneſs of the ſum would have cauſed an enquiry into the manner by which he became poſſeſſed of ſo much caſh.</p>
                     <p>In a few days his relation returned with him to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, having during the remainder of his ſtay at New-Market, cauſed him to be narrowly watched to prevent his eſcaping from him, if he meditated any ſuch thing.</p>
                     <p>On his arrival in town, he underwent a great number of ſevere lectures, and at length was returned to ſchool with particlar directions to his maſter to chaſtiſe him with tne utmoſt ſeverity.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe directions were punctually complied with, and he felt the terrors of ſchool-diſcipline in their greateſt rigour.</p>
                     <p>This, inſtead of changing his diſpoſition, only ſerved to confirm him in a determination to quit the ſchool en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the firſt opportunity, and to take ſuch meaſures as would effectually prevent his being again retaken.</p>

                     <p>He made the beſt of his way to Wapping, where he enquired for the captain of a trading veſſel, of whom he had been previouſly informed.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon found him. The captain was bound to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz, and intended to ſail the next day, if the weather permitted.</p>
                     <p>Young Montague had a paſſionate deſire to ſee Spain from the accounts he had heard and read concerning it; he determined to take this opportunity, and promiſed the captain to become a paſſenger.</p>
                     <p>Willing to paſs the laſt evening that he intended to remain in England in a convivial manner; he went into a tavern, and ordered an elegant ſupper. The people were ſurprized at his youth, but did not heſitate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his deſire, as they perceived he was poſſeſſed of money, and had other valuables about him.</p>
                     <p>The maſter of the tavern was himſelf a notable ſharper and perceiving the ſimplicity and inexperience of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile gueſt, he determined to <hi>make the moſt of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027335_0028_0FD40B1D82FF41F8"/>Young Montague anticipated his deſires by requeſting him to give him his company at ſupper. This requeſt he not only complied with, out introduced two of his intimates who were as great rogues as himſelf, to aſſiſt in the execution of his ſcheme.</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, the glaſs was puſhed briſkly about, and cards introduced, intoxication ſoon baniſhed our hero's reflection; he loſt his money without repining. What little precaution, or prudence he might have poſſeſſed when ſober, was drowned in copious bumpers of claret. At length he was ſo inebriated, as to ſink down ſenſeleſs on the floor.</p>
                     <p>This was what the honeſt gentry with whom he was in company wanted; what they had not cheated him of before, they now robb'd him of, and then left him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt farther concern, to ſleep off the fumes of thoſe copious libations, which had reduced him to ſuch a ſhameful ſtate of inſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>When he came to himſelf in the morning he ſcarce recollected where he was; for never having been uſed to intemperance before, the exceſs had almoſt obliterated the remembrance of every thing that had happened.</p>
                     <p>He however called aloud; when the waiter appeared, he deſired ſome coffee, which was preſently brought him, accompanied by an enormous bill of the preceding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ight's expences.</p>
                     <p>When he had read the bill, he put his hand into his pocket to diſcharge it. Words cannot expreſs his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, nor imagination paint his agonies, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he had been plundered, not only of every ſixpence he poſſeſſed, but of his watch, ring, and every other moveable value about him.</p>
                     <p>He called for the landlord with an air of deſperation, which ſufficiently evinced the horror of his mind.</p>
                     <p>The landlord appeared—he recited his misfortune—
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027335_0029_0FD40B2060BA6B00"/>
the landlord affected to fly into a violent paſſion, called him a ſharper—told him he came there with a deſign to bilk his houſe, and that he would ſend for a conſtable; ſaying theſe words, he haſtily flung out of the room.</p>
                     <p>The miſtreſs now appeared, and with an affected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, pretended to have great compaſſion upon his youth, and to pity his indiſcretion, ſhe repreſented her huſband as a moſt terrible man, litigious and raſh to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and exceedingly malicious when provoked; ſhe therefore adviſed him to make his eſcape during her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's abſence, as he was gone for a conſtable, for, ſaid ſhe, in a very moving accent, <q>If you are carried before a magiſtrate, and committed to Newgate, heaven knows what will be the conſequence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Her artifice ſucceeded; the very name of Newgate was ſufficient to terrify young Montague, to whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement ſeemed terrible, though under the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable circumſtances; and he was too much of a novice to ſee through the fineſſe of theſe conſederated ſharpers.</p>
                     <p>He thanked the miſtreſs for her kindneſs, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ed it, and haſted from the houſe; winged by his fears, he hurried to the place of the captain's reſidence, with whom he had converſed the day before. Here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his diſmal tale, and with the moſt doleful accen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Mr. James. for that was the captain's name, ſaw into the whole affair immediately, he well knew the houſe and the people, and conſequently could give a pretty near gueſs at the nature of the colluſive tranſaction.</p>
                     <p>Without ſaying a word to our he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> (whom he left at his houſe)he repaired to the tavern, and calling the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſide, flatly accuſed him of the whole affair, telling, him that the young gentleman whom he had defrauded, was of a great family, and had moſt powerful friends, that the conſequence of a diſcovery of this iniquitous tranſaction, would be his inevitable ruin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:027335_0030_0FD40B2330D0FE78"/>After a little more converſation, the landlord perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the captain had taken this trouble upon himſelf, not as an advocate for juſtice, but on the more ſordid motives of ſelf intereſt.</p>
                     <p>They were not long now in underſtanding each other. Upon a promiſe of ſecrefy, the captain was admitted to partake liberally of what young Montague had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled, and became in reality an <hi>acceſſary after the fact.</hi> In return for this generoſity of the landlord, he promiſed to let our hero work his paſſage to Spain, during which voyage, he would take care to uſe him ſo ill, that he ſhould be glad to run away from the ſhip as ſoon as he landed, and then it would be a miracle if ever he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to England again, to accuſe them of defrauding him.</p>
                     <p>Thus we may perceive that Captain James was no honeſter than his worthy neighbours.</p>
                     <p>That evening our hero embarked on board the ſhip, on the ſtipulated agreement of working his paſſage.</p>
                     <p>During the voyage, the captain punctually performed the promiſe he had made to the landlord, for he uſed poor Montague ſo exceeding ill, that when they arrived at Cadiz, he took the firſt opportunity of quitting de ſhip.</p>
                     <p>The repeated misfortunes he had met with at ſo early an age, one would imagine, ought to have cured him of his roving diſpoſition; but it had the contrary effect; his inclination increaſed with difficulties, and a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which never forſook his mind, ſupported him under all misfortunes.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>YOUNG Montague though of ſo volatile a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had made an amazing progreſs in his ſtudies. The ſtrength of his memory, and quickneſs of his pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration enabled him to make greater literary acquiſitions than many of a much more ſedate turn of mind, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>He was exceedingly well acquainted with the Latin claſſics, and had ſome knowledge of the Greek. He was well verled in French, having been taught to ſpeak it from his infancy; and had a tolerable ſmattering of the Spaniſh: ſo that he was not at ſo great a loſs as might at firſt be conceived.</p>
                     <p>Luckily in plundering him, the ſharpers had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked a pair of Mocoa ſleeve buttons ſet in gold. Theſe he ſold at Cadiz, and by that means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rocured ſubſiſtence for ſome days.</p>
                     <p>When his money was juſt exhauſted, he by chance fell into converſation with a Muleteer, who wanted an aſſiſtant. Montague readily offered his ſervice, which was accepted.</p>
                     <p>This employ though one of the meaneſt in Spain, ſeemed the moſt eligible and pleaſing to our hero, as it would give him an opportunity of travelling unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unmoleſted, and of ſeeing many parts of the kingdom at his leiſure.</p>
                     <p>In travelling with his now maſter be found great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as every day preſented him with ſomething new,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027335_0032_0FD40B261911ADC8"/>
and every object was food for his curioſity; but his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was daſh'd with ſome difficulties and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. There are no beds in the inns to accommodate travellers; he was frequently obliged to lay on the boards, and even there, was almoſt tormented to death with vermin.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes by choice, he lay in the ſtable with the mules, but here another plague attended him, for he was ſo peſtered with rats and mice, that he very ſeldom could get a wink of ſleep.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the inns in Spain, it is remarkable that you enter the houſes through the ſtables, nay, even the ſtairs that lead to the different bed chambers are in the, ſtables, and always exceedingly dark and dirty.</p>
                     <p>Another diſagreeable circumſtance was the article of food. Every thing the Spaniards eat is ſo full of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſaffron, ſpice, and pepper, that it is impoſſible for thoſe who are not uſed to ſuch high ſeaſoning, to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their food; and unluckily, his maſter happened to be fond to an exceſs of ſuch reliſhing diſhes, ſo that poor Montague was often obliged to go without his dinner, or to eat only a piece of dry bread, which was as black as a coal, and often ſo ſtale and hard that he was forced to dip it in water to ſoften it before he was able to bite it.</p>
                     <p>The exceſſive heat in Spain occaſions a copious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; this young Montague, who was naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to corpulency, found! exceedingly troubleſome. He, however frequently relieved himſelf by wiping the ſweat which trickled down his face, with a very fine and beautiful India handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>His maſter frequently ſaw this handkerchief with an envious eye. One day he aſked to look at it.</p>
                     <p>Montague gave it him. He admired it for ſome time, and at length kiſſing it very devoutly, put it into his pocket, ſaying at the ſame time, that he did not think our hero of ſo liberal a temper; but that he ſhould for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027335_0033_0FD40B278F75CF38"/>
ever eſteem him for a preſent which ſhewed at once his generoſity and good nature. He then kiſſed his thumb, laid acroſs one of his fingers, and ſwore to be his friend as long as he lived.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the cuſtom of Spain, and is looked upon as a moſt ſolemn manner of ſwearing. The Spaniards hold anoath ſo made, as ſacred, and ſeldom or never break it.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our hero was aſtoniſhed at this proceeding; but ſaid nothing to his maſter; he was however ſorry for the loſs of his handkerchief, as the want of it proved a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.</p>
                     <p>To account for this tranſaction of his maſter, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that young Montague afterwards found that it was cuſtomary in Spain, for any one who had a deſire for ſomething belonging to another, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to ſee it, when, if they chuſe to keep it, they kiſs it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks for it, as if it had been given them. This method of converting one perſon's property to the uſe of another, is ſo common in Spain, that the natives take no notice of its inconveniency.</p>
                     <p>Being once near Berberana, a town in Old-Caſtile, our hero perceived a gentleman lying in a ditch, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in his blood; he would fain have gone to have ſeen if he was quite dead, but his maſter would not let him, telling him to take no notice of it, but to keep on his way, and not to mention a ſyllable about the matter to any perſon.</p>
                     <p>This at once alarmed young Montague, and excited his curioſity; he began to enquire more particularly into the cuſtoms and manners of the country than he had hitherto done; and his maſter, who was not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in point of underſtanding, gave him a very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious account, which in ſubſtance was as follows:</p>
                     <p>That the Spaniards affect a ſolemn deportment, flow and ſteady pace, and ſerious countenance, that this ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied gravity is only a veil to cover an infinite fund of wit
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027335_0034_0FD40B2947052A38"/>
and humour. They ſpeak with great deliberation, and a majeſtic tone, which, when they utter a joke or piece of raillery, gives it a double force. They are brave without being raſh, for they do not love to attack, but to ſtand on the defenſive; and this indolent intrepidity they aſcribe to prudence. They are oſtentatious in pageantry and ſhow, yet unaffectedly liberal; revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without appearing angry, libidinous and luxurious with reſpect to women, but temperate and ſober, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to eating and drinking. They are tenacious of their honour, and great obſervers of tneir words, though it coſt them their lives. Patient, obſtinate, and great humouriſts; they are vivacious, penetrating, fluent in ſpeaking, but jealous to an exceſs; exceedingly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and very bad oeconomiſts. Their behaviour is affected, formal and ſtiff, they are naturally ingenious, but too lazy to employ their ingenuity, and of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable diſpoſition, that they never forgive an injury, or fail to reſent an affront, which is ſeldom done in an honourable manner, but uſually by aſſaſſination. Nay, they not only cauſe thoſe to be murdered who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted them, but likewiſe ſuch as they have affronted, leſt they ſhould take the ſame advantage, for their max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is, <hi>kill or be killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One great reaſon of the frequent murders in Spain, is the eaſineſs with which the aſſaſſin can ſcreen himſelf from juſtice; for if he flies to a church or a convent, he is ſafe; and he generally takes care to commit the crime near ſome ſanctuary. Theſe fanctuaries are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniard are ſhort and lean. Leanneſs indeed is deemed a beauty among them, but they are well made, and have fine features. They have indeed a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or duſky completion, but their eyes are remarkably bright, and their teeth regular and well ſet they have large legs and ſmall feet, their hair is parted in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, ſtrait cut, and tucked behind the ears.</p>
                     <p>They wear a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> their cloaths are always black, over which they have a black ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:027335_0035_0FD40B2B50869F10"/>They have ſtrait breeches and hanging ſleeves a long ſword and a poinard.</p>
                     <p>Our hero found one advantage however in belonging to a Muleteer, which was, being better treated at the inns than even people of faſhion, for as the Muleteers are conſtant cuſtomers and take their paſſengers to what inn they pleaſe, they are more careſſed by the innkeepers, than genteeler perſons whom they may never ſee again.</p>
                     <p>They have ſeldom above one cup in an inn, and if the mule driver gets hold of it, even a nobleman muſt ſtay with patience till he has done with it, or drink out of a wooden bowl or earthen pitcher.</p>
                     <p>As there are no chimneys in the inns, but in lieu thereof a hole in the cieling to let the ſmoke through, people in cold weather are almoſt choaked and blinded. Beſides, every thing muſt be paid for before you have it, for the inn-keeper is only allowed to lodge ye, but not to find you either in eating or drinking. He is therefore (being very poor himſelf) obliged to aſk the traveller for money, to go for what he wants, to the butcher, baker, fruiterer, vintner, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The innkeepers are great extortioners, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud you if they can, though at the ſame time they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do you the greateſt honour; for as ſoon as ever you enter their houſe, they run to dreſs themſelves in their beſt, being perhaps the pooreſt and the proudeſt publicans in the univerſe, the good woman of the houſe then brings all her children, if ſhe has any, about you, and obliges them to touch your cloaths, and rub their eyes, throats, checks and hands with them.</p>
                     <p>In noblemen and gentlemen's families, the ſervants all live upon board wages, which are very low, and in fact, though naturally abſtemious, they are half ſtarved; this renders them ſo ravenous, that they pilfer as much as they can from what is dreſt for their maſter's tables; to prevent which, the grand dinners in Spain are uſually ſent up in diſher and covers, which are padlocked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027335_0036_0FD40B2EBAC019A0"/>
to prevent the depredation that would otherwiſe be made between the kitchen and dining-room.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SPAIN it certainly the region of love and gallantry; the tender paſſion is here carried to its utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of refinement; no people in the univerſe, are by nature more amorous than the Spaniards; the climate and manner of living, increaſes their natural diſpoſition for voluptuous pleaſures, and the great reſtraint under which the women are kept, is a ſpur to their ingenuity, and adds to the extacy of every amour, by giving it the air of a deep intrigue.</p>
                     <p>The inclinations of young Montague were naturally as amorous, and his diſpoſition to the full as voluptuous, as the moſt libidinous Spaniard exiſting.</p>
                     <p>He could not but perceive, that in this country, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> found employment for many who were much youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than himſelf, for he was now conſiderably turned of fifteen years of age, and here it frequently happens, that a youth of fourteen is married to a girl of twelve, he therefore could not but upbraid himſelf for having lived to <hi>ſo advanced an age,</hi> without having had a miſtreſs, or engaging in an amour.</p>
                     <p>It was his nature to be ardent in whatever he took in his head, theſe ideas were therefore no ſooner eſtabliſhed in his imagination, than he began to ſigh for every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he ſaw, or to languiſh after ideal miſtreſſes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he never ſaw any woman but what was veiled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027335_0037_0FD40B2FD45CA580"/>
a few by chance, who were either miſerably poor, or very old and ugly.</p>
                     <p>As he had not the liberty of indulging himſelf with a ſight of their features, or permiſſion to admire their complexions, he determined to do in fancy what the cuſtom of the country denied him the enjoyment of in reality. He therefore never met a woman, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unveil her, (in imagination) and to ſtrip her (ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) from thoſe envious robes that prevented him from gazing on her native charms, and we muſt do the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of his fancy in this reſpect, the juſtice to ſay, that he never beheld any Spaniſh nymph, by this method, but what was a perfect beauty, for he took care to figure to him ſelf, on theſe occaſions, nothing but paragons of perfection.</p>
                     <p>But this amorous diet was of too thin a conſiſtency, to gratify the warmth of his appetite long; he found ſpeculative paſſion not at all ſuitable to the ardor of his diſpoſition, and longed very much to reduce the theory of love to practice.</p>

                     <p>OUR hero could not keep his eyes from being fixed on the agreeable <hi>Jeanot,</hi> who, for her part took every opportunity to exchange glances with him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we cannot be ſurprized at this, as it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſhe never in her life before, beheld ſo comely a youth. For Montague was very genteel in his perſon, and perfectly well made; his features were fine and regular, and though he was a little fun-burnt with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling about, his complexion ſtill far exceeded what was to be ſeen among the natives of Spain. Add to this, he was ſprightly in his converſation, engaging in his manner, and had a moſt inſinuating addreſs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was her eye diſguſted by ſeeing him in a dreſs to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027335_0039_0FD40B32D905DA70"/>
which ſhe was not familiarized; for a little before, his maſter had made him adopt the Spaniſh habit.</p>
                     <p>Our hero, by means of the quickneſs of his genius, and ſtrength of his memory, had ſo well improved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Spaniſh tongue, that he could ſpeak it almoſt as fluently as a native, and was ſcarce to be diſtinguiſhed for a foreigner by his accent. Thus he was under no apprehenſion of being miſunderſtood, if he could but procure an opportunity of addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Jeanot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fortune was propitious to his wiſhes—the hoſteſs was called out of the houſe to a daughter of her's in the neighbourhood, who was ſuddenly taken ill. The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord had employment enough in the ſtable, to keep him far ſome time from interrupting them, and with reſpect to his maſter, the only remaining ſpy, <hi>Morpheus</hi> ſtood his friend by cloſing his eye-lids with a leaden ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Montague did not let ſlip this favourable opportunity. He poured forth the moſt rapturous expreſſions of love, with an amazing volubility; and took very cloſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which though not authorized by the cuſtoms of Spain, yet were by no means diſpleaſing to the blyth, blooming and amorous <hi>Jeanot</hi>; in fine ſhe let him know the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of her bed-chamber, and gave him to underſtand that if he ſhould happen to miſtake it for his own in the night, that ſhe ſhould not be terrified, or fancy him to be a ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Montague was quite in raptures at theſe innuendo's. He impatiently wiſhed for the hour of retiring to reſt, and could eat no ſupper, for the thought of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching happineſs, as he deemed it.</p>
                     <p>At length the family retired to reſt. Montague was obliged to lay with his maſter, as there was no other bed vacant. And happy was he, as ſoon as he found by the melody of his noſe, that he was in a profound ſleep.</p>
                     <p>He now crept ſoftly from his maſter, and purſued, as he thought, the directions given him by the pretty <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:027335_0040_0FD40B3567CD3D50"/>
He entered the room, and felt about for the bed. Having found it, he called his miſtreſs by the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing epithets, and began to embrace her as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, when he received a box in the car that almoſt ſtunned him.</p>
                     <p>Putting his hands out to guard himſelf from another ſalute of a ſimilar nature, if ſuch a repetition ſhould be intended, he was amazed at encountering a rough face, and a pair of muſtachios; theſe he was convinced could not appertain to the lovely <hi>Jeanot,</hi> he therefore perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had made a very eſſential miſtake, and thought it expedient to retreat with as much expedition as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>He made the beſt of his way towards the door of the chamber, but unluckily in his hurry ran his noſe againſt it, he not only felt an extremity of pain by the blow, but was coverd with blood in a moment. To add to his embarraſſment, his whiſkered antagoniſt had purſued him to be revenged for having his repoſe diſturbed, and was diſtributing convincing prooſs of his reſentment upon the back, ſhoulders, and head of poor Montague.</p>
                     <p>Our hero at length opened the door, and precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fled he knew not which way nor whither, as his principal concern was to eſcape the fury of his ſilent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant, for the perſon who was ſo liberal in the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>But he made haſte in vain, for the other purſued him with equal celerity, when a thought came into his head to throw himſelf ſuddenly down, which would occaſion his purſuer to fall over him, and by this he imagined he might probably eſcape.</p>
                     <p>He put this ſcheme into execution and it ſucceded to admiration. His antagoniſt had a, terrible fall, and brake his forehead againſt the wainscot. He did not however bear his miſfortune with that degree of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic

patience which young Montague had ſhewn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeverity of his blows, but roared out with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vociferation. The noiſe alarmed the whole houſe; our hero's maſter heard it. He called Montague, but receiving no anſwer, he felt about the bed for him; not being able to find him, he began to conjecture that he was either the cauſe of the diſturbance, or by ſome means intereſted in it. He determined to be convinced of the truth of this ſurmiſe, ſo quitting his bed and room, he made as much haſte as the darkneſs would permit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place from whence the found ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and pacing along a gallery, drew nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it.</p>
                     <p>This noiſe was made by the muleteer, who as before mentioned, was upon his return fron Madrid to Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca. Our hero having miſtaken his room for <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>'s was the occaſion of this terrible <hi>fracas,</hi> which in the ſequel was ſtill more whimſical than what had been already related. For the muleteer having made a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable noiſe, and curſed our hero, himſelf, and the inn ſufficiently, was about to ſeek his chamber again, when turning ſuddenly round, his head came exactly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with that of Montague's maſter, and their foreheads rung and rebounded with the violence of the blow. The luckleſs muleteer fancied that he was indebted for this new inſult to the ſame perſon as firſt diſturbed him, and afterwards threw him down, the additional pain ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him outrageous; He bellowed like a wounded bull in the <hi>Sierra Ronda,</hi>

At length they cloſed with each other, and, falling together againſt a door in the gallery, they burſt it open, and both fell into the room with a terrible noiſe.</p>
                     <p>This was the bed-chamber belonging to the maſter and miſtreſs of the inn, who as ſoon as they heard the

                     <p>But finding the danger ſo near them, they grew fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and began to verify the old proverb, which ſays that <hi>cowards will fight valiantly when drove to deſperation.</hi> They jumped from the bed in a kind of phrenzy, left off ſaying their prayers to utter imprecations, and threw away their beads that they might have a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of uſing their hands, which they did in a moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, ſo that the engagement now became what is uſually termed <hi>a battle royal,</hi> for as they fought at random, it was impoſſible to diſtinguiſh friend from foe; in fine, the noiſe of blows, oaths and cries in concert made an inexpreſſible confuſion.</p>
                     <p>During theſe athletic adventures and manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the dark, the reader may be curious to know what became of young Montague; to ſay the truth, he was employed much more to his ſatisfaction, than his maſter, or the reſt of the combatants; for after having eſcaped from the ſeverity of the muleteer's reſentment, he very prudently thought it the moſt judicious thing to retreat with all poſſible expedition to his chamber again but endeavouring to execute this resolution, he again miſtook another chamber for his own. This ſecond miſtake was however much more pleaſing than the firſt, for his error conducted him to the bed-ſide of the lovely <hi>Jeanot,</hi> who had long expected him with impatience, but on hearing the various diſturbances of the night, had lain for a conſiderable time panting for fear.</p>
                     <p>In going to ſtep into bed, our hero by chance put his hand upon her face; he was pleaſingly ſurprize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>An extatic <hi>feaſt</hi> was denied them, the golden inſtant Only juſt permitted them to <hi>taste</hi> of bliſs.

                     <p>He at length gained his bed before his maſter, and <hi>Jeanot</hi> having lighted a lamp, repaired to the field of battle, where the combatants were mutually aſtoniſhed at the bloody ſpectacle each other made, ana equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged on account of what they felt.</p>

only one in the houſe not externally marked, was pretty <hi>Jeanot,</hi> who appeared as demure as a veſtal virgin.</p>
                     <p>The inn-keeper appeared with a large plaiſter over one eye, and the other ſo bruiſed that he could ſcarcely ſee out of it. His wife had covered her face almoſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with gold-beater's ſkin, to hide the marks of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which had disfigured it; ſo that ſhe cut a very whimſical figure; the muleteer had bound up his head and jaws with as much cloth, as would have made a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban for a Turkiſh Baſhaw; and young Montague made his appearance with a noſe as big as his fiſt, and one eye entirely cloſed up; he however, with the other, took care to ogle <hi>Jeanot,</hi> who now and then returned him a gracious glance.</p>
                     <p>But our hero concealed his being the primitive cauſe of this fracas; he averred that he had never been out of bed during the whole night, and that he received ſeveral blows, which awaked htm from his ſleep, and had done him the injury that was ſo extremely obvious on his countenance.</p>
                     <p>As the maſter gave implicit credit to young Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, he leſt the inn, firmly perſuaded that it was haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fully determined never to put up there again, whenever he happened to travel that road.</p>
                     <p>The ſame evening they arrived at Madrid, very ſort with the bruiſes they had ſo recently received, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatigued with their journey.</p>
                     <p>Madrid, which is about two Engliſh miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, has a pretty appearance from the country to a ſtranger as he approaches it. The number of ſpires, cupolas, and other large edifices, look very noble at a diſtance; but the idea of magnificence and ſplender grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually decreaſes as the traveller enters the town.</p>
                     <p>Its river, called the Manzanares, is for ſeveral months in the year quite dry, at other times a muddy ſtream; but in the ſpring it contains a prodigious quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027335_0045_0FD40B3E910C9BD8"/>
and indeed frequently overflows, by means of the torrents of rain and the melted ſnow which pour down from the neighbouring mountains.</p>
                     <p>There is a magnificent ſtone bridge over this river, which was built by Philip II. Many travellers who have ſeen the Manzanares only at the time of its being dried up, or at leaſt a muddy puddle, have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very merry at that monarch's expence for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo large a bridge, where there was no water; but had theſe critics ſeen the river at the time of its ſwell; they would have been convinced, that their raillety was premature.</p>
                     <p>Madrid is a very offenſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the ſtreets are pretty ſtraight and tolerably wide, and the houſes handſome enough to look at, on the outſide; but then the ſtreets are ſo duſty in dry weather, and ſo dirty in wet weather, that you are either choaked and blinded, or up to your knees in mud. <note n="*" place="bottom">Since young Montague was in Spain, the city of Mudrid has been greatly improved the ſtreets have been paved, the filth removed, and proper regulations made to preſerve it from the above inconveniences, ſo that at preſent, it is one of the cleaneſt cities in Europe.</note>

                     <p>THERE is ſuch a ſameneſs in the towns and houſes, A and ſuch a ſingularity of manners among the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards in general, that, according to the beſt writers, thoſe who have ſeen one town, the houſe, or one Spaniard, may entertain a. pretty tolerable idea of the towns, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and people in general.</p>
                     <p>The houſes of the Grandees and other capital people, are magnificently furnſihed, particularly with immenſe quantities of plate; but every thing is rather intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally valuable than well executed; ſuperb than elegant.

                     <p>As the cultivation of the land is much neglected, through the natural indolence of the Spaniards, and as they are careleſe about, or rather deſpiſe commerce, their tables are not over well ſupplied, either with their own, or the commodities of other countries. Indeed the poorer ſort, though naturally very abſtemious have ſcarce enough to ſupply even their temperate deſires.</p>
                     <p>Our hero, though young and volatile, yet had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded curioſity, and took care to minutely obſerve whatever was in his reach.

curious which occurred to him, or any thing remarkable which he ſaw, or any thing ſingular which befel him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed in Spain he laboured under very great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as the low ſtation in which he appeared, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from obtaining admittance into the houſes of the great, which, had his real rank in life been knowr, his illuſtrious birth would undoubtedly have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled him to: but his indefatigable enquiries of the moſt intelligent people he could meet with, made, in ſome meaſure, an atonement for what he could not poſſibly come perſonally at the knowledge of.</p>
                     <p>Madrid was not the place to occaſion a decreaſe of young Montague's natural warmth of diſpoſition and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous temper.

                     <p>THE impatient <hi>Lucilla</hi> could not poſſibly be more impatient to ſee her lover, than young Montague was for the hour of ten, to make if poſſible an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her meſſenger's miſtake.</p>
                     <p>He deemed this a fair opening of an intrigue, and his heart was in the utmoſt palpitation, as he entered in the Alcazar Street at the preſcribed time.</p>
                     <p>The billet unluckily did not mention, whether the houſe was on the right or left hand ſide of the Fontana d'Ora. Montague however perceiving a door open on the left hand ſide, did not in the leaſt doubt but that was the paſſage through which he muſt ſterr to the Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium of his fair and amorous <hi>Lucilla</hi>'s apartment.</p>
                     <p>Without heſitation he entered the houſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting on the conſequences, crept ſoftly up ſtain.</p>
                     <p>He perceived a glimmering light to iſſue from a door, which was left a-Jar.</p>
                     <p>He puſhed it open, and entered, but for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could ſcarce perceive what was in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a ſmall wax taper being the only light, it threw ſo diſmal a gloom around, as to caſt a damp upon the flame of our hero's ſanguine expectations. After rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his eyes for ſome time and advancing a ſtep farther into the room, inſtead of a beautiful young lady, ready to throw her veil aſide and receive him with open arms,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027335_0050_0FD40B4613537AB0"/>
as his imagination had painted in the moſt glowing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours on the canvas of nope, he perceived at the farther end of the aparment, (which was entirely hung with black) a coffin, containing a corpſe in a winding-ſheet, decorated with abundance of flowers. On each ſide ſat a female dreſt in deep mourning, and covered with a long black veil, under which they frequently wiped the, tears from their eyes with a white handkerchief. Theſe ladies beat their breaſts, and ſighed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Our hero indeed ſpoke no more than they, for he was dumb with aſtoniſnment.<note n="*" place="bottom">The cuſtom in Spain of keeping ſilent upon ſuch occaſions is ſtrictly obſerved; nor would the mourners who ſit by a dead corpſe either ſtir or ſpeak, even if they ſaw a ruffian enter to rob the houſe. If a lady goes to condole with another for the loſs of her huſband, neither the viſitor nor viſited ſpeak a ſyllable, but both ſit down and weep, ſigh, and beat their breaſts; then the viſitor departs without having uttered a word.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole was a ſtrange contraſt to what he naturally expected, from the contents of the billet-doux, and a diſmal reverſe to a perſon of his amorous diſpoſition, in the midſt of his exaltation on the ſtilts ot <hi>flattering fairy hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Young Montague was exceedingly puzzled to account for ſo extraordinary a ſcene, which ſo little coincided with the nature of the invitation contained in the billet-doux; and as it is very probable that our readers may be as much puzzled as he was, we will not hold them any longer in ſuſpence, but unriddle the whole affair.</p>
                     <p>Our hero had miſtaken the houſe, the habitation of <hi>Lucilla</hi> being on the right hand ſide of the Fontana d, Ora, inſtead of the leſt, which he had entered, and which had been the reſidence of an eminent jeweller,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027335_0051_0FD40B47DC90D5F0"/>
lately deceaſed, whoſe widow and ſiſter were mourning by his coffin.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſs they were ſurpriſed and even alarmed at his appearance, but complying with their cuſtom neither to ſtir nor ſpeak, our hero was ſuffered to depart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned, and unmoleſted for his intruſion.</p>
                     <p>As he left the jeweller's houſe he began to blame himſelf greatly for his avidity, in gratifying his paſſions at the expence of his prudence, and even ſafety, and was juſt about to enter into an abundance of wiſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which he deſigned to regulate his future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, curb his voluptuous diſpoſition, and repreſs his inordinate curioſity; but juſt as he had determined to be vaſtly philoſophic and ſage, a female tapped him upon the ſhoulder.</p>

                           <hi>Cavellero,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you have been very dilatory; one ſhould not think that one of your age would be tardy, when a young lady of a noble family and at once ſo beautiful and fond is in the caſe.

                     <p>At theſe words all our hero's new formed reſolutions of being mighty wiſe vaniſhed in an inſtant, ſo little are

we to depend on any of our determinations, formed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of paſſion.</p>
                     <p>By the words of his conductneſs, he eaſily perceived his previous miſtake, and reſolved, ſince fortune had now thought proper to be propitious, to make himſelf amends for his late chagrin and diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>He was led into a ſuperb apartment, where his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductreſs left him for a few minutes to fetch the lady.</p>
                     <p>He paſt this interval in viewing the richneſs of the furniture, and elegance of the tapeſtry, till the entrance of the lady preſented him with an object more worthy of his admiration.

He totally forgot every ſyllable of a one compliment which he had taken great pains to form, in order to addreſs her; nor had he remembered it, was he able to utter it.</p>
                     <p>The lady no ſooner advanced towards young Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; but ſhe perceived the error of her confidant, and ſtarting back greatly alarmed, ſhe ſaid with a tremulous voice, "you have ruined me, this is a ſtranger." Then ſinking into a chair, ſhe appeared to be much terrified.</p>
                     <p>Our hero having now a little recovered, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the lady's feet, and entreated her not to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herſelf with needleſs fears, ſaying that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly afflicted to find that the accident which made him the happieſt of mortals, was to her a cauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027335_0053_0FD40B495F315DE8"/>
That the interview was certainly founded on a miſtake, but fortune, who was the author of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, to make amends for the errors ſhe had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, generally rendered them of a propitious kind.</p>
                     <p>Our hero was naturally an orator, his action was graceful, and his eloquence became him exceedingly, nor were his talents loſt on an inanimate ſtatue; the lady was not compoſed of ice, and the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her life will evince, that fortune had not directed young Montage to an object, on whom his endowments were unlikely to make an impreſſion, or his eloquence to be unavailing.</p>
                     <p>This lady, as we have already mentioned, might be deemed a perfect beauty; the natural warmth of her conſtitution rendered her pretty amorous, and a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition eaſily ſuſceptible of the tendereſt impreſſions, made her a willing victim to the ſhafts of gallantry.</p>
                     <p>Her family was noble but not rich, which made her father, while ſhe was yet very young, readily liſten to the overtures of a gentleman, illuſtrious by deſcent, and in poſſeſſion of an ample fortune.</p>
                     <p>Though ſhe felt no particular tendemeſs for this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, as her heart was not pre-engaged, ſhe made not the leaſt objection to the match. The union preſented her with theſe two ideas, viz. from the gallantry of the gentleman a greater degree of ſenſual felicity than a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life could admit of, and from his large poſſeſſions, a full indulgence of all her vanity could ſigh for, or her ambition aſpire to.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may perceive ſhe was ſtrongly influenced by thoſe two paſſions, which Mr. Pope ſays, predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate through the whole ſex.
<q>
                           <l>Two principles alone the ſex obey,</l>
                           <l>The love of pleaſure, and the love of ſway,</l>

                     <p>She daily grew fonder and fonder of her huſband and fancied the entertained the moſt unbounded affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him; but he had too much philoſophy not to perceive that her aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>This was the paſſion he wiſhed to find. But this ſublimity of affection was what his youthful ſpouſe was not qualified to beſtow. She was more ardent than delicate, and as a connubial partner, was formed at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The gentleman, with the ſcrupulous nicety of a Spaniard, was alarmed for his honour; he deemed the warm diſpoſition of unexperienced frailty, but a brittle tenure for its ſecurity. Such, and a thouſand ſimilar ideas paſſing through his imagination, continually ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his temper, rendered him ſuſpicious and watchful, while his inward anxiety of mind, deſtroyed that feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which had been his only object in the marriage, ſo little do we know the conſequencc of poſſeſſing what ſeemſ moſt deſirable, and what we moſt eagerly purſue, and ſo totally ignorant are we, of what would prove conducive to our real happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:027335_0055_0FD40B4CE4D69290"/>A profeſſed libertine, in the early purſuit of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, is groſs in his appetites, and ſeeks the ſenſual gratifications of his wiſhes, with a kind of indelicate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciouſneſs or brutality of craving; but with ſatiety he grows delicate, and his libidinous pleaſures looſing their novelty, and conſequently their zeſt, he becomes nice and difficult. Whenever he ſeriouſly ſettles, he is more particular than a more temperate perſon: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the utmoſt refinement of paſſion, the greateſt delicacy of affection can pleaſe him; while a man of moderate diſpoſition who has lived a regular and chaſte life, makes few objections, and even cannot ſo cafily perceive what is groſs. Nothing far ſhort of angelic purity can ſatisfy the reformed libertine.</p>
                     <p>Thus, our gentleman from being particular, became cautious; caution ſoon degenerated into ſuſpicion; ſuſpicion bred jealouſy, and jealouſy rendered him completely miſerable.</p>

                     <p>Our hero was much about the ſize of <hi>Don Carlos. Lucilla</hi>'s emiſſary fuund him walking in the ſame place where that Cavalier uſually ſpent an hour or two every evening.

                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:027335_0059_0FD40B5615A7EA30"/>His mind, it is true, was full of love and admiration, but the finer paſſions had not deſtroyed his appetite; he therefore eat very heartily of a diſh, compoſed of pilchards, chick-peas, and garlick, fryed together in oil, then retiring to reſthe ſlept as ſoundly as if he had never met with an adventure unlike, the Knidhts-Errant of old, who when they fell in love, could not help watching and faſting, till they became mere spectres.</p>
                     <p>The next evening, young Montague was punctual to his time. The <hi>Duenna</hi> ſoon appeared, and introduced him to <hi>Lucilla,</hi> who condeſcended to receive him gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and like the queen of love on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er Cyprian throne,, ſuffered him to pour the incenſe of adulation on his knees, with wonderful complacency.</p>
                     <p>As the raphſodies of lovers are exaltedly pleaſing to the parties concerned, but extremely inſipid to every body elſe, we ſhall omit our hero's converſation with the lovely <hi>Lucilla,</hi> and proceed to the mutual ſtipulation.</p>
                     <p>It was agreed that young Montague, before the lady could admit him as a gallant with propriety, ought to give ſome inconteſtible proof of the violence of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her.</p>
                     <p>This he readily promiſed to do, proteſting that there was no torment he would not undergo, no torture he would decline bearing, nor any death but what he would willingly ſuffer, to ſerve the object of his affction, or gratify her wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Though this language is the common cant of lovers, and they utter it with vehemence, and under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of innumerable proteſtation, yet nothing is farther from their intention, than to do as they ſay, or from their will, than to ſuffer as they pretend they readily would do. They fancy as they are words of courſe, that they may be forgotten at pleaſure. Hence the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027335_0060_0FD40B578F7A0D28"/>
cients uſed to ſay, that the gods themſelves laughed at the perjuries of lovers.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Lucilla</hi> took our hero at his word, in a more lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral manner than he either expcted, or deſired; for ſhe declared that ſhe would never admit him to her preſence again, unleſs he appeared the next day in the character of a <hi>Diſciplinarian,</hi> and ſcourged himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her window, to evince his affection.</p>
                     <p>As he knew it was the ſeaſon of the year when the ladies expect ſuch ſanguine proofs of gallantry, and as he was ſenſible that he could not refuſe without nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the amour in the bud, he promiſed to comply with a good grace.</p>
                     <p>To make the above requeſt of the lady more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, it is proper to obſerve, that during Paſſion-week, particularly from Wedneſday to Friday, it is a cuſtorm in Spain, for the men to laſh themſelves heartily about the ſtreets, but more particularly before their miſtreſſes windows.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe their faces are hid, and their bodies covered with a garment, which leaves their ſhoulders, back, and ſides bare. They are provided with whips, whoſe laſhes are compoſed either of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHEN our hero returned home, he entertained ſome qualms in his mind, relative to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined flagellation; he could not help thinking it a very fooliſh cuſtom, nor could he conceive how a

lover's cutting his fleſh to pieces, could be of any uſe to his miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, he found, though he loved <hi>Lucilla</hi> much, he loved himſelf more, and diſcovered, that a lover may ſay a great deal, and mean little, promiſe much, and deſign to perform nothing.</p>
                     <p>His determination was therefore, neither to hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor loſe his miſtreſs; he had an abhorrence for the one, and a contrivance for the other.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of ſupplying himſelf with one of the uſual whips, he ſubſtituted in its place, a whip to all outward appearance ſimilar, but in effect, totally different.</p>
                     <p>The handle was like the common ones, but in lieu of three leather thongs, he had faſtened three ſmall eel-ſkins filled with blood, to the end of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus provided, he repaired the next day to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cazar Street, and having juſt before he approached <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi>'s window, pricked tne ſkins in ſeveral places, he began to laſh himſelf to all appearance, in a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful manner.</p>
                     <p>The blood plentifully iſſued from the apertures in the eel-ſkins: his ſhoulders, back, and ſides were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully crimſoned over, and appeared in a condition ſo ghaſtfully ſanguine, that even <hi>Lucilla,</hi> uſed as ſhe had been to ſuch a cuſtom, and cruelty vain of ſuch a token of reſpect, thought he had ſuffered too much, and given a proof ſufficiently bloody of a ſervent, affection.</p>
                     <p>She beckoned him to ceaſe laſhing himſelf and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared perfectly well ſatisfied with his exceſſive gallantry.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE enſuing evening, our hero repaired to the uſual place, the duenna met him as before, and introduced him to the lady, into whoſe preſence he came, in full expectation of a reward for his ingenious deception; and indeed it muſt be admitted, that he was much more deſerving of it, than if he had really laſhed himſelf as ſhe fancied he had, in compliance with a cuſtom, at once ſo cruel and abſurd.</p>
                     <p>As for the lady, ſhe was ſatisfied with the diſcipline ſhe imagined he had given himſelf; this conſideration, joined to the natural warmth of her diſpoſition, and a kind of prepoſſeſſion in favor of young Montague, was ſufficient to make her recede from any more punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ios; ſhe thought he had ſacrificed enough at the ſhrine of decorum, and therefore as a juſt ſaint, to whom as a votary, he had appeared aſſiduouſly fervent, ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reward the ardency of his vows.</p>
                     <p>In fine, our hero was as happy, as <hi>pleaſures mereby ſenſual</hi> could make him.</p>
                     <p>But as the lovers became mutually pleaſed, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna grew diſpleaſed. In the courſe of her miſtreſs's amour with <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> ſhe had received many valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble douceurs; but this was not the caſe with our hero, he had nothing worth her acceptance to give, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027335_0066_0FD40B5F68581C18"/>
did he entertain the idea that ſuch preſents were neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> by the means of friends, and evincing his innocence, he ſoon obtained his liberty.</p>
                     <p>The duenna no ſooner underſtood this, than ſhe made him acquainted, that a happy rival had during his confinement, ſupplanted him in the affections of his miſtreſs; though this rival, ſhe cunningly added, was far his inferior, not only in family and fortune, but in perſonal and mental accomptiſhments.</p>
                     <p>This information was ſufficient to rouze the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who was a true Spaniard as far as a poſſeſſion of all the local follies oi Spain could go. He thought his honour concerned, he felt his heart touched, and his pride exceedingly hurt. He therefore ſwore by the blood of an old Chriſtian, to have revenge. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Spaniards in general, are exceedingly proud of arrogating to themſelves this appellation; by which they inſinuate, that they are deſcended from an ancient Chriſtian family of Old Caſtile, the blood of which hath not been contaminated by any intermarriage, or intermixture with Moors o Jews.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have already mentioned, that when the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards fancy themſelves groſly affronted, they do not ſeek what in other parts of Europe is called <hi>an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able revenge,</hi> but without remorſe, have recourſe to aſſaſſination.

                     <p>DON <hi>Carlos,</hi> deeming the office of aſſaſſin too mean for himſelf, employed a Bravo, (that is, one who lets himſelf out for hire, to execute the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable office of murderer) to diſpateh his rival.</p>
                     <p>However, on the evening in which the fatal deed was to be perpetrated, young Montague's fortunate ſtar happened to predominate; the Bravo, who way-laid him coming from <hi>Lucilla</hi>'s intended to ſtab him in the heart with a dagger, but our hero luckily giving a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtart, he only ſlightly wounded him in the ſhoulder.</p>

                     <p>This timely benevolence happened to be extended to him by the domeſties of the Engliſh Ambaſſador, near whoſe hotel he was attacked.</p>

                     <p>This rejoiced him exceedingly, his misfortune had leſſened his avidity for Spaniſh intrigues, and the loſs of his blood had cured him very expeditiouſly of his paſſion for <hi>Lucilla.</hi> He therefore without ſcruple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ſurgeon who he was, and of every thing which had befallen him ſince his laſt elopement from ſchool.</p>

                     <p>His youth, and the ſkill of the ſurgeon who attended him, ſoon re-eſtabliſhed his health; and the difreliſh which he now began to entertain for Spain, made him fall into the ambaſſador's propoſal of ſending him to England, with great pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>He accordingly embarked for his native country, and after a pleaſant voyage, arrived there in very good health and high ſpirits.</p>

                     <p>It was concluded, that he ſhould no more go to Weſtminſter ſchool, or any other public ſeminary of learning, but regain what he had loſt, and complete the remainder of his education at home, under the inſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome gentlemen, eminent in every branch of uſeful and polite literature, who were employed as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate preceptors for that purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>YOUNG Montague's private tuition anſwered the moſt ſanguine wiſhes of his relations and friends. His preceptors took uncommon pains, with a genius naturally bright and penetrating, and he repaid their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity by an improvement and perſoverance in ſtudy little expected from one of his volatile turn of mind. In fine, he happily blended the polite arts with the more abſtracted ſciences and ſolid parts of philoſophy, and gave the faireſt promiſe of becoming the complete gentleman.</p>

                     <p>He determined to enter into converſation with her. At firſt ſhe appeared very coy, but at length gave him pertinent anſwers to every queſtion he aſked.</p>
                     <p>From the converſation he had with her, he found that ſhe was only the daughter of a waſher-woman; that her mother, who was a widow, had ſufficient buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enable them to live comfortably; that ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her mother, and was going to Pimlico to fetch a gentleman's linen for whom they waſhed.</p>
                     <p>He would fain have engaged her to meet him again, but this ſhe abolutely refuſed, alledging that ſhe would do nothing without the knowledge of her mother; ſhe however at length agreed that he ſhould call upon her, and gave him her addreſs accordingly.</p>
                     <p>He frequently viſited her, and having gained upon her affections, made ſeveral flattering propoſals to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

her from her virtue. But he found his endeavors in vain; ſhe had too much modeſty to become the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of his artifices, and her mother too much affection for her child, as well as vigilance, not to prevent his ſucceſs by an illicit means.</p>
                     <p>A negative he had never expected, was a double ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative to his diſpoſition, naturally amorous and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; the obſtacles thrown in his way, increaſed the ſlame that began to conſume him.</p>
                     <p>He determined to enjoy the fair <hi>Patty,</hi> (for what was our juvenile waſher-woman's name) at any rate. He, therefore, mad with his paſſion, an careleſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, propoſed marriage.</p>
                     <p>This propoſal was joyfully <hi>received</hi> both by mother and daughter and the only ſtipulations which his ſmall remains of prudence ſuggeſted, were to keep the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This reſtriction was acceded to by both, for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons, as they imagined that the marriage being known would be the means of hunting both him and themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Our hero was not only become a poet, put a mighty eſſayiſt, and having quitted his bed one morning much earlier than uſual, he ſpent about an hour in penning an <hi>Eſſay on Prudence,</hi> then dreſſed himſelf, and repaired to his pretty waſher-woman, with an intent to commit one of the moſt <hi>Imprudent actions</hi> he had ever done in his life, for he immediately took her to the Fleet and married her.</p>
                     <p>Though both mother and daughter had promiſed, and indeed knew it to be their intereſt, to keep this indiſcreet ſtep of our hero's a ſecret; yet it did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:027335_0072_0FD40B6BE1C93738"/>The old woman, who was always fond of exhilarating her ſpirits, and cheriſhing her heart with a vivifying cordial in ſecret, thought upon her daughter's good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that ſhe could not be too bountiful in regaling her neighbours, and pouring forth her thanks in copious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations to <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One day in the fulneſs of her joy and plenitude of her cups, ſhe could not forbear communicating her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ſome of her moſt particular aſſociates. She informed them not only of her daughter's ſecret mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but of our hero's rank, family, and expectancies.</p>
                     <p>This information, inſtead of giving pleaſure, raiſed the envy of her neighbours; without conſidering her hoſpitality, they hated her for her good fortune, and moſt of them having daughters, could not without ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſee the ſucceſs of poor <hi>Patty.</hi> Such is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of human nature, that our neighbours good ſeems our bane.</p>
                     <p>On receiving the intelligence, they had promiſed the old woman the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, but as they could not imagine that ſo unequal a match was concluded with the approbation of our hero's family, they determined it ſhould not long remain a ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Malice is ſeldom dilatory in effecting its purpoſes; it may therefore be naturally ſuppoſed, that young Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's relation and friends were very ſpeedily apprised of his imprudence.</p>
                     <p>This information gave them more concern than any of his former follies, as it appeared irreparable, the fleet marriage at that time being good in law, and no reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act having then paſſed to prevent the indiſcretion or minors.</p>
                     <p>But to preſerve as much at poſſible the dignity of their family, and the credit of our hero, they thought
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027335_0073_0FD40B6E91092CF0"/>
proper to enter into a negociation with our newly exalted waſher-woman and her mother, who being threatened, perſuaded, and promiſed, and finding what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful people they had to deal with, at length agreed to relinquiſh all manner of claim to and upon the young gentleman, to forego his name, preſerve the moſt inviolable ſecrecy in future, and retire upon a decent penſion into the country.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were no ſooner ſent from the metropolis, than they thought proper to diſpatch young Montague to the continent, under the conduct of a gentleman every way qualified for ſo important a charge.</p>

uſed to mention it in his maturer years, that it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mere than it performed, and only revealed to its diſciples a few ſecrets that were either futile or danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be put in experiment.</p>
                     <p>As it is uſual at the French <hi>Comedy</hi> to ſup in the boxes, our hero having been one evening to ſee the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated comedy of <hi>Tartuffe</hi> and the entertainment of <hi>Le Medicin malgre lui,</hi> ordered a cold collation.</p>

                     <p>Good-humour gave a reliſh to their entertainment, and their converſation was enlivened by repartee.</p>

                     <p>She accepted his propoſal, but ſlipped from him in the crowd, and on his return home he miſſed his watch, his purſe, and his pocket-book; he had no doubt, but the lady who had partook of his collation, had made free with his property, and his only conſolation was, the reflection that he might ſend ſufficiently early in the morning to his banker to ſtop the payment of ſome drafts to a conſiderable amount, which his pocket-book contained.</p>

                     <p>Our hero let the peaſant know as much of the affair as he thought proper: the poor fellow took him into his cottage, and refreſhed him with all the place could afford; he then conducted him towards Paris, which was at the diſtance of about a league.</p>
                     <p>Montague, who was naturally generous, took him home to reward his hoſpitality.</p>

                     <p>The artificers of this courtezan, and reſolution of her Myrmadons, were too freſh in his memory to permit him to entertain any idea of redreſs; for he had no doubt, but was he to attempt to ſtir in the affair, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination would be the inevitable conſequence; and being releaſed from the terrours of the Baſtile, ſeemed a ſolatary conſolation for his heavy loſſes.</p>

                     <p>At Amſterdam he became intimate with a Jew bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who tranſacted buſineſs for him.</p>
                     <p>This broker had a daughter who, though a brunette, poſſeſſed the moſt regular ſet of features imaginable, and had killing eyes.</p>
                     <p>She was vivacious and witty, but very poſitive and mighty fond of the ceremonials of the Moſaic law.</p>

                        <hi>Judith,</hi> knowing his rank and fortune, was proud of her conqueſt, and fond of his propoſal, as ſhe could not be indifferent to his perſon and accompliſhments.</p>
                     <p>It is true, ſhe was ſcarce turned of thirteen years of age, but that made no difference to nither. For, as on his part, youth could he no objection to a voluptuary; ſo on her's the want of a lover appeared more terrible than want of years.</p>

                     <p>ONE ſtipulation, however, the old Jew inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was, that our hero ſhould conſent to be married after the Jewiſh ceremonial, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chriſtian ritual.</p>
                     <p>To this, Montague had no objection; his fondneſs of novelty, without any other motive, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to come into the propoſal; but in fact he well knew that he was legally married to his pretty waſher-woman, and that it was immaterial by what ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony he joined himſelf to any other woman.

pretty Jeweſs, and left to her and her father to fix upon the form by which he was to obtain the gratification of his deſires.</p>
                     <p>The preleminaries being ſettled, the nuptial ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was ſoon after performed.</p>
                     <p>As there is ſomething very curious in a Jew marriage, and as many of our readers may be unacquainted with that ceremony, we ſhall preſent them with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
                     <p>Previous to the marriage, ſeveral of the friends meet in a convenient place, each having in his hand an ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> en veſſel; the contract is then read, notice given of the day of marriage, and a declaration made, that the party who ſhall not ſtand to what is agreed, is to pay to the other a ſtipulated ſum.</p>
                     <p>Then wiſhing happineſs to each other, the young Jews throw their veſſels upon the ground, concluding (as the Jews ſay) that the breaking of them portends plenty and good fortune. But we are rather inclined to think, that this part of the ceremony is an emblem of the frailty of our worldly purpoſes and delights.</p>
                     <p>On their departure a perſon at the door preſents ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one with a glaſs of wine, and ſome comfits. This is emblematical of chearfulneſs and plenty.</p>
                     <p>He that is to bleſs the marriage takes a glaſs of wine, and having given it his benediction, preſents it to the married couple to drink; this is to ſignify that we owe a grateful acknowledgment of all our plenty to the bounty of the Almighty. The young couple then muſt not ſtir abroad for eight days, during which ſpace their friends are, however, permitted to viſit and make merry with them.</p>
                     <p>The day previous to the marriage, the woman is put
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027335_0084_0FD40B861F827F70"/>
into a bath of cold water, by the reſt of her ſex, who make a hideous noiſe while they are bathing her.</p>
                     <p>The bridegroom then ſends a matrimonial girdle to the bride, with a gold buckle; the bride returns a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar preſent, with this difference, that the buckle is ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; this ſignifies that the man does more honor to the woman by taking her to be his wife, than ſhe does to him, by admitting him to be her lord and maſter.</p>
                     <p>On the nuptial day, the bride is conducted to a chamber appointed for that purpoſe, by women who ſing and dance before her, for a double motive; as they look upon ſuch chearfulneſs to be both acceptable to God, and a preventive of gloomineſs or low ſpirits, which would appear as bad omens.</p>
                     <p>When the bridegroom is to receive the benediction, four young men carry a canopy into a garden or open place, beneath which the ſolemnity is performed.</p>
                     <p>The bridegroom, accompanied by the males, and the bride by the females, preceded by muſic, meet under the canopy; every one ſaying, <q>

                     </p>
                     <p>The bridegroom then walks three times round the bride, and takes her by the hand.</p>
                     <p>The company then ſcatter corn on them both, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating at the ſame time the ſcripture phraſe, <hi>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The bride then holds the bridegroom by the hand, and turns her face to the ſouth, or to the meridian ſun, which is the emblem of genral and procreative power.</p>

                     <p>Then taking another glaſs of wine, and giving thanks to God, that the new married couple have plighted their troth, he preſents it them to drink again; the bridegroom having drank, throws the glaſs with all his force againſt the wall of ground, in order to break it in remembrance of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem.</p>
                     <p>Then black caps are placed on both their heads, to ſhew they are afflicted for the deſtruction of the temple, even in their greateſt rejoicings.</p>
                     <p>Being led to a banquet, the bridegroom ſings a kind of a hymn, then an egg and a hen, ready dreſſed are ſet before him; he preſents a ſmall piece to his bride, and immediately the company ſcramble for the reſt, and whoever gets the largeſt piece, is eſteemed the moſt fortunate.</p>
                     <p>The egg is then preſented to the bride, as a prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of her bearing children, as eaſily as the hen her eggs.</p>
                     <p>They then ſit down to a feaſt; after which a dance begins; the nobleſt perſon in the company takes the bridegroom by the hand, he another, and ſo the reſt till they all join.</p>
                     <p>The principal woman takes the bride by the hand, and the reſt of the women join, in a ſimilar manner to the men. Thus the dance is long and confuſed, and the wedding, or rather the rejoicings, continue eight days.</p>

                     <p>But it behoved him to proceed with great caution; the old Jew was crafty, and from being naturally a rogue, was naturally ſuſpicious.</p>

his caſh and notes out of the Jew's hands; not but the broker, though he deemed him his ſon-in-law, made him pay ſeverely for having ever put any confidence in him.</p>

Nor, indeed, as ſhe was indulged in every pleaſure and amuſement, did ſhe in the leaſt ſuſpect has deſign.</p>
                     <p>Having every thing on board, which he thought proper to take, he embarked himſelf, and ſet ſail, (not for England, as ſhe imagined, but for Italy) leaving the houſe and furniture, with a ſum of money, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to <hi>Judith</hi> for the loſs of her ſuppoſed huſband, and to make her ſome amends for his infidelity.</p>

He was, (as is uſual with young travellers) aſtoniſhed at the Roman anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; in raptures with the paintings of the Italian maſters: in extacies with their muſic; in admiration of their women, and intoxicated by their wines.</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:027335_0088_0FD40B8C1182F4B8"/>He made ſome ſtay at Genoa, which, from the ſea, he obſerved affords one of the fineſt proſpects in the world, as it ſtands partly on the declivity of a hill, and partly on a flat next to the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The houſes are very lofty, and ſinely painted on the outſide, which gives them a fine and ſplendid appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Genoeſe are induſtrious, cunning and more hardy than the reſt of the Italians.</p>
                     <p>As for jealouſy, of which the Italians are generally accuſed, the Genoeſe ought to be exempted from the charge, for their women are allowed as many liberties, and indeed take as many, as any ſet of people in the world. Hence the Italian proverb, which ſays, that the <q>Genoeſe have a ſea without fiſh! land without trees! men without faith! and women without ſhame!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here our hero was under the neceſſity of uſing the arts of ſeduction, or making matrimonial propoſals.</p>
                     <p>Money ſoon procured him a miſtreſs, who was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and witty, but licentious in her principles, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable in her temper, ſo that Mr. Montague ſoon grew tired of her; for though ſhe took whatever free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhe thought proper, without the leaſt modeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſhe was jealous of him to an exceſs, and ſo exceedingly capricious, that he determined to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the uneaſineſs ſhe gave him, by quitting the place.</p>
                     <p>He proceeded to Sicily, and traverſed the whole of that territory. He found the Sicilians polite, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, fond of magniſicence, and generous, but vindictive to the laſt degree; to evince which, the following fact will be ſufficient. For the ſpirit of the modern Sicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians greatly reſembles that of their anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:027335_0089_0FD40B8C1570B178"/>In the reign of the emperor Charles the Vth, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was formed at Trapani, under the title of "The ſociety of St. Paolo;" the members of which, made a vow to take cognizance not only of the proceedings of their neighbours, and the lower order of the inhabitants of the town, but even of their magiſtrates and nobility.</p>
                     <p>Whoever was condemned by this ſociety, was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of death; for one of the members was deputed to aſſaſſinate the obnoxious party, and the perſon ſo choſen to the office of murderer, was obliged without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, privately to deſtroy, the perſon, ſo clandeſtinely condemned.</p>
                     <p>The women of Sicily are beautiful, amorous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fruitful, for ſome of them have been known to have had three ox four and twenty children.</p>
                     <p>Sicily is likewiſe deemed the granary of Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, the richeſt place for grain in the univerſe.</p>
                     <p>From Sicily our hero failed in a little bark, manned by one helms-man and two rowers, to the iſle of Ghoz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo.

                     <p>PROCEEDING to Malta, he found that iſland cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated much in the ſame manner as Ghozzo.</p>
                     <p>The Knights of Malta have rendered the manners of the inhabitants ſo depraved, that there is ſcarce an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt female in the whole iſland, except what belongs to the ſailors.

The women belonging to all the other inhabitants are at their diſpoſal.</p>
                     <p>The town of Catania at the foot of mount AEtna, which was deſtroyed by the dreadful earthquake in 1693 is now rebuilding, not with ſtone or brick, but with, the <hi>lava</hi> diſgorged from the mouth of that tremendous mountain.

in rank; at length he married her, but two months after marriage ſhe was delivered of a ſon; from a motive of ſhame, the parents determined to deny the child, and to truſt its education to a peaſant.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>This was kept a ſecret till the mother, on her death bed, diſcovered it. The youth being ſent for, ſhewed more ſurpriſe than joy, on being informed of his rank; but declared, that unleſs he was permitted to marry a young country girl, with whom he was in love, he would not accept of any advantage they might offer him. This article being denied him, he willingly reſigned his claim, in favour of his brother, returned to the country, and lived happily with the object of his heart in the ſtation in which he had been brought up.</q> A rare example of conſtancy! and worthy of imitation. Our hero made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to viſit this happy couple, at their little town, and was mightily pleaſed with their apparent conjugal felicity.</p>
                     <p>Our hero obſerved, that though the power of the Pope was greatly on the decline, and his domination, in Italy conſiderably circumſcribed, yet the eccleſiaſtical patrimony is exceedingly fruitful and rich, which gives riſe to the Italian ſaying, <q>That the Pope has the fleſh, and the Great Duke of Tuſcany the bones of Italy.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At Naples a very fine lady would willingly have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him as her Ceciſbeo; that is, (as an obſequious gallant) to play with her, and loſe what money ſhe ſhe thinks proper to win; to be at a thouſand expences in order to indulge her caprices; to murder all his time in her ſervice, eſcort her to every place of public reſort, and privately to adminiſter to her libidinous Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>This lady was the wife of a principal Neapolitan no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman. For the ladies in Italy are permitted, by their huſbands, to entertain lovers of this character. Cuſtom

hath eſtabliſhed this infamous practice; the women look upon it as one of their privileges, and the men are ſo afraid of offending againſt ſo prevalent a faſhion, that they quietly acquieſce with their diſhonor, and even ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs their wives gallants.</p>
                     <p>Our hero however thought proper to reject the favor deſigned him; though he was not over delicate in his amours, yet he had too much ſentiment to bear the idea of dividing the affections of a woman with another, or ſharing her perſonal charms, with a rival; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that rival might be entitled to her principal conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Nor could he bear the thoughts of having his liberty ſo much abridged, as ſuch a piece of gallantry would have rendered neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>He loved to purſue pleaſure, not to be purſued by it, nor, however, pleaſing ſuch cuſtoms may be to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, could he approve of being a ſlave at all times to the ſatisfaction of another, when, perhaps his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation pointed a different way.</p>

                     <p>OUR hero's delicacy, however, in rejecting the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Italian lady, had very near coſt him his life. For the huſband took it as an affr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nt, that any man ſhould have the inſolence to refuſe becoming the Ceciſbeo of a lady of his wife's rank and diſtinguiſhed beauty; he, therefore, ſent him a formal challenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:027335_0093_0FD40B92CCBA5CA0"/>Our hero was ſurpriſed at the unaccountable humour of theſe people, and that the manners of even poliſhed nations ſhould be ſo diametrically oppoſite to each other. In England, Holland, France, Germany, and Spain, if one man attempts the honor of another's wife, he runs the hazard of having his throat cut; but in Italy if you refuſe to cuckold a man, according to the polite cuſtom of the place, you are liable to be run through the body, even by the huſband himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Our hero, who was not deficient in perſonal courage, accepted the challenge; the parties met, fought, and the huſband was diſarmed. Thus fortune decided, that his brow ſhould not be equipped either by laurels or horns, at leaſt upon that occaſion; as doubtleſs from the natural temperature of the lady, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he did not die without the latter dignity.</p>
                     <p>The lady was greatly exaſperated to be diſappointed both in her deſires and revenge, and therefore determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (according to the Italian mode) to take off our hero by poiſon; of this intention he was ſecretly apprized by a friend, which determined him to leave, with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a place where the inhabitants were ſo abſurd in their notions, and ſo litigious and revengeful in their tempers.</p>
                     <p>For the bigneſs of the place, there are perhaps, more lawyers in Naples than any other part of the world; a certain proof of the litigious ſpirit of the people. It is aſſerted, that when <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> XI had deſired the <hi>Marquis de Carpio,</hi> the viceroy at Naples to furniſh him with 30,000 head of ſwine, the Marquis replied, that with reſpect to his ſwine, he could not ſpare them; but if his holineſs had occaſion for 30,000 lawyers, they were at his ſervice.</p>

                     <p>The enſuing night he was called upon deck, to ſee the famous Strombolo, a mountain which ſtands in the ſea, like a ſugar loaf, and emits continual flames from its ſummit. At ſea it appears even more terrible than either Veſuvius or AEtna.</p>

                     <p>The markets are plentifully ſupplied, and the beſt regulated in the world, which is owing to their being inſpected by the Grand Vizier himſelf, at certain times.</p>
                     <p>Their police is excellent, perhaps the beſt in the univerſe. They have very few phyſicians here, fewer apothecaries, and no ſurgeons at all.</p>
                     <p>They act in direct oppoſition to the European cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, in many particulars; thus, they ſit, lie, eat, and even write low; we high.</p>
                     <p>Their cloathes are long; ours ſhort.</p>

                     <p>We have many public proſtitutes; they none; but it muſt be admitted, that no part of the world contains more libidinous females, or a greater number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>demireps.</hi>

                     <p>When we mourn for the dead, we wear black. They wear blue or violet colour; indeed In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, many countries differ. For in China their mourning is white, in Egypt yellow, in Ethiopia brown, while kings and cardinals mourn in purple. Indeed all theſe colours appear to be allegorical; for <hi>black</hi> being a privation of light, expreſſes the darkneſs of the grave; <hi>white</hi> denotes purity, and is typical of the ſoul's being freed from the droſs of the body; <hi>blue,</hi> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the ſky, ſignifies the happineſs, we hope the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed enjoys in heaven; <hi>yellow</hi> allude to the leaves of the trees, which become of that colour when they fall to the ground; <hi>brown</hi> denotes the earth, whither the dead return; and <hi>purple</hi> expreſſes both ſorrow and hope, being a mixture of <hi>black</hi> and <hi>blue.</hi>

                     <p>The titulary honour of <hi>Aga</hi> was leſs pleaſing to our hero, than the permiſſion to marry a Turkiſh lady, of which he was very deſirous, both from the native warmth of his diſpoſition, and from motives of curioſity.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MR. Montague ſoon made uſe of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's permiſſion, by entering into a matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial negociation with a rich <hi>Emir,</hi> who had a daughter remarkable for her ſingular beauty, and every accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment which the politeſt oriental education could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>The marriage being concluded on, the nuptials were performed with great pomp. To gratify the reader's curioſity, we ſhall deſcribe the various ceremonies uſed at Turkiſh weddings.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place the friends on both ſides meet to ſettle what dowry the huſband is to give his intended wife; for the parents give nothing to their daughters. This renders a woman deſirable only for herſelf. For on the contrary, he that has no other conſideration for a woman in marriage than what ſhe has, will ſeldom regard what ſhe is.</p>
                     <p>The following is an exact tranſlation of a Turkiſh ſong, which ſeems to ſatirize the breach of the above cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There was a man had a daughter, whom he brought up to ſpinning, and alſo he married her, in hopes that both by her work and her marriage, ſhe would curich his family; but he found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhe ſpent the price of her labour before ſhe had earned it, and that her huſband being poor, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="unknown:027335_0100_0FD40B9C1A6BD6F8"/>The ſum being agreed upon, it is ſent to the father, or next relation. The bride continues covered eight days before marriage; on the wedding day ſhe bathes, and is waſhed by two or three women, with great form; nay ſo ſolemn is this bathing, that her neareſt relations walk before her to the bath with lighted torches in their hands.</p>
                     <p>To make the bride's hair red, which they look upon as the moſt glorious colour, they ſprinkle it with a duſt called. <hi>elcana.</hi> They likewiſe make her nails, the palms of her hands, her feet, and her heels red.</p>
                     <p>The nuptial day being come, the bridegroom ſends a preſent to the <hi>cadis</hi>; then the <hi>ſagois,</hi> or manager of the nuptials, accompanied by all the gueſts with muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtruments, goes to the bride's houſe, where he and the company with him are entreated to ſit down.</p>
                     <p>After a banquet, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The <hi>ſagois</hi> then ſets her on ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The bride rides with a veil over her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

During the cavalcade, ſhe may ſalute every one ſhe meets, which Turkiſh women are never permitted to do but on the day of their marriage.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe arrives at the bridegroom's houſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts her into a chamber, diſtinct from the reſt; after ſupper, the <hi>ſagois</hi> takes her by the hand, and leads her
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027335_0101_0FD40B9D5417D838"/>
to the bridgroom's chamber, and delivers her to the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, who look after till he comes.</p>
                     <p>When he is with her, he takes off her veil, then the reſt of her cloaths; the pretending ſome reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The enſuing day, the <hi>ſagois</hi> compliments and jokes with the bridegroom, while the bride is taken by her relations to the bath.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Montague was mighty fond of his Turkish wiſe, and though of an amorous diſpoſition, and naturally prone to change, did not entertain a thought of availing himſelf of the privilege allowed by the laws of that country, which permits a man to marry four lawful wives, and keep as many Miſtreſſes as they can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Nay, a Turk may marry his ſiſter, provided he begins with the eldeſt, (for if he begins with the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he muſt not marry the others.)</p>

                     <p>THE only time that Mr. Montague, during the courſe of his life, ſeemed inclined to conſtancy, Fortune appeared determined to croſs his laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, by depriving him of the beautiful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed <hi>Fatima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This lady died in child-bed, as did the infant of which ſhe was pregnant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:027335_0102_0FD40BA05DC49330"/>Our hero was ſenſibly affected by this loſs, as he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loved this lady.</p>
                     <p>As his melancholy grew upon him, and ſeemed to injure his health, his friends adviſed him to travel, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to blunt the edge of affliction.</p>
                     <p>This advice he the more readily received, as he had always found travelling, not only agreeable to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral curioſity, but a certain ſpecific againſt melancholy of every kind.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of this reſolution, he begged the Grand S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gnior's permiſſion to depart from Conſtantinople.</p>
                     <p>His ſublime highneſs was unwilling to part from him, but out of regard to his health, gave him leave to go, and furniſhed him with proper paſſports to all parts of his extenſive empire.</p>
                     <p>His curioſity led him to ſee all that was curious in Greece, and to compare the ruins and miſerable ſtate of that now wretched country, with its former ſplendor and magnificence.</p>
                     <p>He viſited all the places which are uſually viſited by ſtrangers, and examined all thoſe remarkable antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have been ſo frequently and minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by travellers.</p>
                     <p>He perceived that the Greek ladies were remarkably handſome, and that their limbs were formed with that beautiful ſymmetry of proportion, which is obſervable in the works of their ancient ſtatuaries. Indeed noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be more majeſtic or lovely than their perſons; but to balance their beauty, they are exceedingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, very proud, and very coquettiſh; not but a kind of natural politeneſs makes ſome amends for their want of the poliſh of education.</p>
                     <p>He had the curioſity to aſcend the celebrated mount
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027335_0103_0FD40BA060994A88"/>
Ida, but was greatly diſappointed, for inſtead of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe beautiful proſpects, which the exagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated deſcriptions of the ancients naturally led him to expect, he found it to be nothing but a prodigious large barren rock, without the leaſt landſcape to be ſeen, to make any amends for the trouble of climbing it.</p>
                     <p>After having ſeen the famous labyrinth of Gortyna, he proceeded to Candia, which city, when in the hands of the Venetians, ſuſtained a ſiege by the Turks, which laſted above twice as long as that of Troy, that is, from the year 1645 to 1669.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of Candia, (or Crete, as it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called) were always celebrated as excellent arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and even to this day are ſkilled in the uſe of the bow, as Mr. Montague ſaw upon ſeveral occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The Greek peaſants here, wear a red leather cap, a veſt, and a pair of blue callico drawers, very wide, and ſo deep behind, as to be ridiculous. In the country they wear ſhort boots of Turkey leather, which are very neat and laſting; but in the towns they wear pumps or ſlippers.</p>
                     <p>The women wear an upper garment of reddiſh cloth, full of plaits, with long ſleeves, but put on in ſuch a manner, as to leave their breaſts naked.</p>
                     <p>He then proceeded to Naxia, which is deemed one of the moſt fertile and agreeable iſlands of the Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago; as the country is ſo pleaſant, every one who can afford it, keeps a country houſe.</p>
                     <p>As the gentlemen of Naxia frequently retire to their villa's, it is humorous enough to obſerve the whimſical vanity of the Greek ladies, who, on retiring to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or to the town, are attended by thirty or forty women, ſome on ſoot, ſome mounted upon aſſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſome article of her miſtreſs's cloaths, or of the moveable furniture, which is expoſed to the view of every one. For inſtance, one carries a pair of ſtockings. another a petticoat, a third an earthen diſh, &amp;c. Thus they enter the city, the lady riding at the head of the calvacade, the children in the middle, and the huſband on his mule, cloſing the pompous proceſſion.</p>
                     <p>After having taken a view of the iſle of Paros, which produces the fineſt marble in the world, Mr. Montague proceeded to Thermia, which receives its name from ſome remarkable hot ſprings with which the iſland abounds.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. Montague ſaw a beautiful Greek girl, whoſe charms eaſily made an impreſſion on a heart ſo ſuſceptible of tender emotions, and ſeemed at once to baniſh his melancholy, and obliterate the memory of the lovely <hi>Fatima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the Greeks are not ſo reſerved as the other nations, ſubject to the Ottoman ſovereigns, yet their women are modeſt.</p>
                     <p>Our pretty Grecian, therefore, ſtood upon punctilios, when Mr. Montague, not to loſe time, or have any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary trouble, had recourſe to his old maxim, and freely propoſed marriage: Matrimony now being ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to him, that the moſt triſling inclination would have induced him to marry almoſt any woman, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it was in a country where the law could not take cognizance of the affair.</p>
                     <p>The moſt remarkable circumſtances in the marriage ceremonies of the Greeks are theſe.</p>
                     <p>The bride is obliged to let her huſband know what fortune ſhe has, and he is under the neceſſity of acting in the ſame candid manner: the men ſitting round a long table, the women on benches raiſed behind it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="unknown:027335_0105_0FD40BA2E52EDC20"/>When the bride receives the uſual preſents from the relations and gueſts, ſhe ſits with a gilt crown on her head, in the midſt of the <hi>gincco,</hi> or women's apartment.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as they have all drank wine and eaten ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, they make an excurſion to take the air, then they return to ſupper, after which, the new married couple go to bed together, without any farther ceremony or publication, as among the Roman Catholicks.</p>
                     <p>This compendious method of marrying was mighty pleaſing to our hero, who was no friend to long ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the young Greek underſtood ſo well the art of pleaſing, that ſhe fixed his wavering heart to conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy much longer than could have been expected; for her beauty and blandiſhments prevailed over his ſickleneſs, during the ſpace of two years, in which he never left her, except to make a few excurſions, in order to take a ſurvey of thoſe parts of Greece, which he had not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeen.</p>
                     <p>At Athens he could not ſee, without ſome painful reflections on the uncertainty of all ſublunary things, the ſtupendous ruins of thoſe beautiful ſtructures, which were once the admiration of the univerſe; n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Though the Anchorites live very retired and the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits very auſtere lives, yet the Greek nuns know noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeverities of a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Four things ſhould never flatter us, <q>Familiarity with princes, the careſſes of women, the ſmiles of our enemies, and a warm day in winter!</q> for theſe things are not of long duration.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Montague did not find Egypt to be that fertile country which it has been repreſented.</p>
                     <p>By Egypt is underſtood a narrow tract of land, divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two by the river Nile, incloſed with high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the eaſt and weſt, beginning at the cataracts and ending near Cairo, together with what is called the Delta.</p>
                     <p>The length of Egypt from north to ſouth, is about 600 miles, the breadth in the Delta is 120 miles, but in the middle of the other part only 21.</p>
                     <p>They have but one harveſt in the year in Egypt, any more than in other places, though it hath been errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reported that they have two.</p>
                     <p>Egypt can hardly ſupply its inhabitants with corn; many of the people live chieſly upon barley-ſlour, mixed with water; indeed half of them do not eat bread above once a week, and that bread is not made of wheat, but of coarſe millet.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil is clayey, mixed with ſalt petre, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:027335_0108_0FD40BA9544A4A48"/>
the land ſo ſterile, that few plants or ſhrubs grow upon it; neither tree or wood will vegetate there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being frequently watered; therefore neither timber nor wood for fuel grow in Egypt.</p>
                     <p>The vaſt rains which fall in Abyſſinia and Ethiopia, occaſion the overflowings of the Nile. This river be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſwell at the latter end of May or beginning of June, when the north winds ſet in, and about the 24th of September, the waters begin to fall.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſaid that it never rains in Egypt, but that is a miſtake, it frequently rains in lower Egypt, but in middle Egypt very rarely, and in upper Egypt never.</p>
                     <p>The air of this country is very unhealthy, moſt of the people are afflicted with bad eyes, the humour of which is ſo inveterate, that abundance loſe their ſight, ſo that Egypt may well be called proverbially the <hi>Land of the blind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A few hours after Mr. Montague's arrival at Grand Cairo, he was witneſs to the opening the canal, when the waters of the Nile entered that city. The joy of the people was inexpreſſible, and indeed it is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral it ſhould, as they are much in want of water.</p>
                     <p>In the road from Minie to Cairo there is a fine pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid at Beniſuef. The Arabs ſay, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jacob</hi> built it. Fifteen miles lower there are two more, in the form of a hat; and about nine miles far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at Sacarra, are thirteen large and a great number of ſmaller pyramids, but the greater part of the latter are fallen into ruins.</p>
                     <p>Cairo is ſuppoſed to contain as many inhabitants as London. There are ſeven hundred and twenty moſques in it with prieſts, four hundred and thirty without, and ſeventy public baths.</p>

                     <p>He accordingly ſet out for Terane, a place about 42 miles, diſtant from Cairo, ſituated on that branch of the Nile which goes to Roſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They joined a drove of camels, who were bound to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:027335_0110_0FD40BAC9AC30B30"/>
the deſart of Scete, to procure Natrum. On the road they ſaw the ruins of various towns; after paſſing along a ſandy plain, interfected by torrents, they arrived at the lake, which is 24 miles long, and two broad.</p>
                     <p>The ſalt had formed a cruſt over the lake, which bore the whole company, and their camels.</p>
                     <p>Having paſſed over, Mr. Montague left the caravan and went to a Coptic Monaſtery, where the monks ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a ſtone, which greatly reſembled wood, and which, they ſaid, was part of a maſt belonging to one of the petrified ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The next day he arrived at the lake without water, which is only a number of torrents united in one, and dry all the ſummer. The petrified ſhips are nothing but pointed rocks, buried in the ſand; they reſemble ſhips at a diſtance, and look very much like wood. Some pieces are ſcattered about, which are ſix or ſeven feet in length, and five or ſix inches in diameter, and theſe are what are taken for pieces of maſts.</p>
                     <p>At the Coptic Monaſtery, which is very mean, and does not deſerve a deſcription, they told him this ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſtory; That formerly ſome Arabians arrived in ſhips, in their lake without water; that theſe Arabians having been very troubleſome to the hermits of the place, St. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who was then abbot of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, prayed to God to dry up the lake; this God not only granted, but changed their ſhips into ſtone.</p>
                     <p>On the road from this place to the monaſtery of St. <hi>Macarius,</hi> there are three deſerted glaſs houſes.</p>
                     <p>It may not be improper to remark, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians are of a very dark complexion, with very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able features; they are timid, effeminate, incapable of hardſhips, have a very down look, owing perhaps to their ſore eyes, are conceited, ſuperſtitious and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten treacherous.</p>

                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:027335_0111_0FD40BAFD9805DB8"/>The forbidding aſpect of the people of this country did not, however, deter our hero from engaging in ſome amours, eſpecially from the Arabian girls, with whom he diverted himſelf in maay parts of Egypt.</p>
                     <p>Having joined company with ſome gentleman, who where going to Suez, he determined to viſit that place.</p>
                     <p>At Heliopolis they were entertained by a Turk.

                     <p>After dinner the company were ſerved with coffee, ſherbet, and a pipe of tobacco.</p>
                     <p>At noon they ſat off with ſome other travellers, who had joined them.</p>

Theſe were followed by two hundred camels, laden with money and merchandizes; thoſe which carried the money, were adorned with buſhes of feathers, and other ornaments, and went firſt, the kettle drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before them.</p>
                     <p>In the evening they paſſed a dangerous deſil, where the Arabs uſually watch, when they intend to attack the caravans going to or coming from Mecca.</p>
                     <p>In two days they arrived at Suez, which is a very ſmall town, ſituated on a pcninſula, at the extremity of the Red Sea. There is a governor, with a garriſon of three hundred men; the inhahitants get all the neceſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Here they have a curious method of catching fiſh, by means of a bird. Having ſet their nets, the fiſhermen let two tame pelicans ſwim in the lake; they faſten a piece of thread to their eyelids, by which means they can tie up their eyes during the whole fiſhery; this precaution is neceſſary, to prevent them from eating too many fiſh. The pelican having a ſtrong ſeent, purſues the fiſh around him, and the fiſhermen prevent their going off ſideways, ſo they are driven into the net.</p>
                     <p>In ſome parts of the lake, the dolphins purſue the fiſh into little ponds, full of reeds, from whence they cannot return, becauſe the fiſhermen immediately ſhut up the entrance into the lake with large nets. The benefits which theſe people reap by means of the dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, induces them to look upon that fiſh with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reverence; nay, ſome of them go ſo far as to deem dolphins good ſpirits, ſent on parpoſe to do them a ſervice; on which account, they would not deſtroy a dolphin by any means.</p>
                     <p>From hence our hero paſſed to Damiata, which, next to Cairo, is the fineſt and largeſt city in Egypt.</p>
                     <p>Twenty-three miles from this city is Roſetta, a town of great trade, in flax, cottons, linens, rice, and leather.</p>
                     <p>There is-no other place of any great conſequence in Egypt, except Alexandria, a town of conſiderable trade, ſuppoſed to contain about 15,000 inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall here notice a circumſtance which our hero thought worthy of a memorandum.</p>
                     <p>On the eaſt ſide of the Nile lies a village, called Eridy, where a <hi>ſheik</hi> of the ſame name reſides.</p>
                     <p>It is famed through Egypt for a ſnake, of which many miraculous ſtories are related.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:027335_0113_0FD40BB41EC44050"/>The vulgar believe it to be the devil, baniſhed into the mountains of upper Egypt, by the angel <hi>Raphael,</hi> to prevent his ſtrangling young <hi>Tobias,</hi> as he had done with the ſix former huſbands, which his bride had married.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſheik</hi> keeps this ſerpent in poſſeſſion, as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors for time immemorial has done. It is an inch thick, two fee 'ong, and the ſkin is ſmooth and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh; it plays thouſand tricks, and will twine about the arms or neck of any perſon; without hurting them; what is remarkable, it is fonder of women than men. An annual feaſt is held in honour of this ſerpent. The <hi>ſheik</hi> pretends that he can cut it in pieces at night, and find it whole in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Montague looked upon this ſerpent to be noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a tohbam, a ſerpent common enough in Egypt; it hath more ſagacity than the European dogs, and may be taught a great variety of tricks.</p>
                     <p>The land crocodile of Egypt reſembles the water crocodile in form, but it is ſmall and harmleſs. The water crocodile, or that which is commonly underſtood by the name, inhabits the Nile, and is particularly fond of the lakes, formed by channels, derived from thence; they fly from thoſe parts which are near towns and from boats which contain many men; but will attack a ſingle man, or a boat with a ſingle man in it. This creature is to the laſt degree, voracious, terrible, and cruel; it is ſometimes thirty feet in length; it runs ſwift, but cannot caſily turn, and iu chief ſtrength lies in its tail.</p>

                     <p>Before his departure, he made a preſent of ſomc cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious medals and other antiquities to the Royal Society; on which account, he was made a member of that learned body.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon after embarked on board a merchant-ſhip, bound for Turkey, and on his arrival at Conſtantinople preſented himſelf to the Grand Signior, by whom he was, as uſually, moſt cordially received.</p>
                     <p>He had formerly adopted the Turkiſh habit, but now he thought proper to aſſume the Armcnian, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not only ſuperior to the Turkiſh, but to all other dreſſes in the univerſe.</p>

                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:027335_0116_0FD40BB89448FA58"/>As Mr. Montague never after appeared in any other habit, it may not be improper to deſcribe it.</p>
                     <p>The Armenian dreſs, then, conſiſts of a magnificent turban; and it is to be obſerved, that the Armenians have a particular maxion to keep their heads very warm, ſo that they never pull off their turbans out of reſpect to any one; the other parts of their dreſs are ſimple, neat and elegant; next to their ſkin they wear callico ſhirts, then a veſt, which rcaches below the knee, girt with a ſaſh, and over that a looſe garment, ſomewhat ſhorter.</p>

                     <p>On their legs they wear looſe boots, and ſlippers on their feet; they wear a dagger in their ſaſh, and linen trowſers; their clothes and the collar of their ſtrits are open, ſo that their health is better adapted to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of health and activity, than the dreſs of the Turks.</p>

                     <p>MR. Montague, whoſe diſpoſitions was ever reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and his imagination always upon the wing, could not long remain inactive; he therefore made the tour of Perſia, and ſaw as much of that country as the diſtracted ſtate of affairs would permit.</p>
                     <p>He perceived that the ſoil itſelf was exceedingly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:027335_0117_0FD40BBE59126560"/>
fruitful; but the government was ſo arbitrary that the inhabitants could neither enjoy plenty or ſafety.</p>
                     <p>There are vaſt mountains in this country, ſuch as Caucaſus, Ararat, and Taurus; but no country in the world hath ſo few rivers.</p>
                     <p>The women are ſufficiently handſome, but they are coquetts, mad continue to heighten their beauty as much as poſſible, by art.</p>
                     <p>Ispahan, the capital city of Perſia, is 12 miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, but the ſtrects are narrow and crooked: the chief amuſement of the inhabitants is to walk upon the flat roofs of the houſes, when the weather will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; the houſes are but of one ſtory, and ſince the late troubles in Perſia, not above five thouſand of them are inhabited.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to Aſia, the Perſians ſtand in the ſame predicament us the Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ch do in Europe; that is, they are the models of politeneſs, and not to imitate their manners, and underſtand their language, argues low breeding. Indeed their manners are the moſt refined of any people in the eaſtem countries, and their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is the moſt poetical and nervous. In ſhort, in Aſia the Arabic is to be conſidered as the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Perſian as the polite, and the Turkiſh or the Coptic as the vulgar language.</p>
                     <p>The wornen are ſo far from being reſerved as in moſt other eaſtern countries, that they will not ſcruple to make advances to thoſe they like. Of this our hero had a proof, while at Iſpahan. A widow lady had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken particular notice of him, and not being able to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle her paſſion, ſhe ſent him a billet doux, written from the right hand to the left, (for the Perſians, like the Hebrews, write in that manner.)</p>
                     <p>Mr. Montague was too much a cavalier not to dis

To this requeſt the lady complied with great difficulty, for in her heart ſhe was a <hi>gaur</hi> or worſhipper of fire.</p>
                     <p>This lady was ſo extremely ceremonious in her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that the intrigue became troubleſome to our hero, who leſt lſpahan, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This is a combuſtible ground, filled with fiery and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable particles being the chief ſcene of the <hi>guebres</hi> devotion. Theſe <hi>guebres</hi> are the prieſts of the <hi>gaurs</hi> or fire worſhippers. Several temples are ſcattered about this ground, in one of which the <hi>guebres</hi> pretend to preſerve the ſacred ſlame of the univerſal fire. This riſes from the end of a large hollow cane ſtuck into the ground, and filled with the pureſt ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The Perſians certainly exceed all the manufacturers in the univerſe, in ſilk, woollen carpets, leather and mohair. They do not, however, purſue trade with that avidity which might be expected from people ſo excellently well ſituated for commerce.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved, that foreigners, who are not Mahometans, pay a ducat a head for being permited to reſide in the Perſian territories. Though this tax ſhould only be paid once, yet the officers take care to exact it in almoſt every town, alledging that they are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it has been paid in any other place. Thus our hero was under the neceſſity of paying the tax above fifty different times.</p>

Mr. Montague determined to remain for ſome time. The country is fruitful to the laſt degree, and the wines the beſt in Aſia.</p>
                     <p>Here our hero fell in love with, or rather conceived a ſtrong inclination for a beautiful Circaſſian lady. Not being able to obtain her for a miſtreſs, he as uſual addreſſed her for a wife; he pretended to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian merchant, and lived in a very proſuſe mannor, to captivate her by generoſity.

                     <p>This method of wooing was not at all agreeable to our hero; be could flatter, ſwear, and embelliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the truth, as well as any man, but a red hot iron did not fall in with his ideas of pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Montague lived next door to a conſiderable merchant who uſed to trade to Surat.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>OUR hero could not conjecture on what account he was apprehended, nor could he get any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſoldiers, who ſaid they had received orders to ſeize him, but for what reaſon they could not tell.</p>
                     <p>When he came before the governor, he ſhewed the Grand Signior's paſſport and protection.</p>
                     <p>The governor however, treated them very lightly, and informed our hero, that they were given to protect him from the outrages of others, but not to ſcreen him in injuring others with impunity.</p>
                     <p>He begged to know who he had injured, as he was not ſenſible that he had given the leaſt offence to any perſon.</p>
                     <p>A ſlave was then diſpatehed to call the perſon who was to exhibit the charge againſt him, from another apartment.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time his next door neighbour, the Surat merchant appeared.</p>
                     <p>The myſtery was now explained; he preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the crime alledgcd againſt him, was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſents, and writing to that gentleman's daughter, and having ſeen her face to face.</p>
                     <p>The governor informed him, that they were moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offences; that now he had ſeen the young lady, and made her preſents, nobody elſe would marry her;
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:027335_0125_0FD40BCED3E9DEB0"/>
that therefore he muſt either marry her himſelf, or loſe both his eyes.</p>
                     <p>As this was the alternative, the reader may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the choice, which a man of our hero's conſtitution would naturally make. He did not heſitate a moment to conſent to the marriage.</p>
                     <p>He was immediately diſcharged; all parties were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and the nuptials were ſoon after ſolemnized.</p>
                     <p>The marriage ceremony was the ſame as that among the Turks, with this addition, that the bride preſents the huſband with a bearded arrow, which ſhe calls her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This preſent is meant to ſeal the fidelity of her promiſe, as ſhe gives him an inſtrument to uſe, either againſt herſelf, it ſhe ſhould prove untrue, or againſt them who ſhould aſſault her virtue.</p>
                     <p>When as uſual, he grew tired of his Arabian wife, he found more difficulty in getting rid of her than he had ever done with reſpect to any of the former. As a foreigner he was naturally ſuſpected, and the idea of having been compelled to marry, increaſed the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of the Arabians.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon perceived that he was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a priſoner at large, and that all his wife's relations, and even his neighbours, were ſo many ſpics upon him; the reflections which ſuch a ſituation naturally gave riſe to, were exceedingly diſagreeable, and being under a conſciouſneſs of reſtraint the time appeared extremely irkſome.</p>
                     <p>At length an Engliſh Eaſt-India ſhip arrived in the port, his ſpirits began to revive at the event, and he now conceived hopes of a ſpeedy deliverance, from what he deemed an abſolute captivity.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon let the captain underſtand who he was, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the nature of his conſine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <pb n="128" facs="unknown:027335_0126_0FD40BD04EDF9630"/>The captain promiſed to do him every ſervice that lay in his power; but the utmoſt precaution was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. On account of an Engliſh ſhip being in the port, he was more cloſely watched than ever.</p>
                     <p>The captain having taken a houſe near the ſtrand, our hero repaired to it, when he was on the eve of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Mocho. He was ſent on board the ſhip in a cheſt, with holes bored in it to give him air, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was not even ſuſpected untill the ſhip was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der weigh.</p>
                     <p>Indeed he was obliged to leave the property he had at Mocho behind him; but that he thought but triſling, when ſet in competition with the liberty he obtained.</p>
                     <p>During the voyage they met a ſhip bound to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople; he immediately went on board this veſſel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter making the captain of the Eaſt-India ſhip a preſent of a draft on a banker at London, for his civility, and being the inſtrument of his deliverance as he termed it.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon arrived at Conſtantinople, the emporium of the eaſtern part of the world, and our hero's favourite metropolis.</p>

                     <p>MR. Montague, ever reſtleſs in his diſpoſition, made another excurſion into Egypt.</p>
                     <p>From Grand Cairo he ſet out on a journey to the celebrated written mountains in the deſart of Sinai. But
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:027335_0127_0FD40BD31C57A550"/>
as he has given an ample account of that journey in a letter to the Royal Society, we ſhall tranſcribe his own words.</p>
                     <p>A letter from <hi>Edward Wortley Montague,</hi>Eſq. F. R. S. to <hi>William Williamſon,</hi> M. D. F. R. S. containing an account of his journey from Cairo in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, to the written mountains in the deſart of Sinai, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived January 3 <hi>d,</hi> and read before the Royal Society, March 13, 1776.</p>
                     <p>"It is with a good deal of difficulty that I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon myſelf to write to you, for as coming now to Italy was quite unforeſeen, and I am immediately going back to the eaſt, I have not my journal with me, but luckily have the famous inſcription. I am ſenſiple every paper I ſend to the Royal Society, expoſes more and more my incapacity; however, as theſe inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are much wanted, I cannot avoid ſending them. I ſhall only ſpeak to ſome of the points the biſhop of Clogher mentions, but cannot avoid being now and then a little prolix.</p>
                     <p>I ſat out from Cairo by the road known by the name of Tauricke Beni Iſrael; after twenty-four hours trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling, at about three miles an hour, we paſſed by an opening in the mountains on our right hand, viz, the mountains Maxattec. There are two more roads, one to the northward of this, which the Mecca pilgrims go, and one to the ſouth between the mountains, but never travelled, (as it does not lead to Saez, which is thirty hours march from Cairo,) Through this breach the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to have entered the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and not to have taken the moſt ſouthern road, which I think moſt probable; for thoſe valleys, to judge by what are now ſeen, could not be paſſable for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s chariots. This breach, the inhabitants told me, leads directly to a plain called Badeah, which, in Arabic ſignifies ſomething new or extraordinary, as the beginning of every thing is new which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:027335_0128_0FD40BD42D4FABA0"/>At Suez I found an opportunity of going to Tor, by ſea, which I gladly embraced; that by going nearer the place, at which the Iſraelites are ſuppoſed to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the gulph, and having a view from the ſea as well an that of the oppoſite ſhore, I might be a little better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ble to form a judgment about it; beſides, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have the views, bearings, and ſoundings, which I took.</p>
                     <p>When we were oppoſite to Badeah, it ſeemed to me (for I was not on ſhore) a plain capable of containing the lſraelites, with a ſmall elevation in the middle of it. I ſaw ſomething too like ruins; the captains and pilots told me, that this was the place where the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites entered the ſea, and the ruins were thoſe of a convert (I ſuppoſe built on the ſpot in commemoration of the fact;) they added that there was good water there. There is here a ſtrong current, which ſets to the oppoſite ſhore, about ſouth-eaſt; it forms by its ſtrength a whirlpool, where the ſailors ſaid ſhips were loſt, if forced into it for want of wind, by a current. This pool is about ſix miles northward of Cape Karon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eel, and juſt below this pool there is a ſand, a flat iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at low water, which runs eaſt and weſt about three miles. This ſand, I ſuppoſe, is thrown up by the force of the curent, and the ſame current by the reſiſtance it meets with from this bank, being forced back into the ravity made by this excavation, forms the whirlpool. This pool it called Birque Pharoone, the pool or well of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and here they affirm his hoſt was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhall ſay more of this, as I travel back by land. We came to an anchor in is fathom wather, within a mile and a half of the ſhore, to the ſo thward of this ſand, and in the Birque Karondel, to the northward of the cape; here the eaſtern ſhore is already mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which near this place is a ſandy beach. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian ſhore from Suez to Badeah is likewiſe rocky and ſteep, ſo that there is no entering upon the gulph from that ſhore, but at Bddeah or Suez.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:027335_0129_0FD40BD671082B78"/>It is high water always when the moon is at her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian height, and it ebbs ſix hours. At Suez it flows ſix feet, the ſpring tidies are nine, and in the variable months, from the beginning of November to the end of April, ſometimes twelve. From the beginning of May to the beginning of October a northerly wind gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally riſes, and goes down with the ſun; it is often very ſtrong. This wind never fails in theſe months, unleſs there be ſome violent ſtorm. The reſt of the year the winds are variable, and when they blow hard at S. and S. S. E. theſe winds ſet up the ſea through the narrow ſtreight of Babel Mandel, and up this gulph through its mouth, between C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bel at Zait on the weſt ſide of this ſea, and the ſouthernmoſt point of the bay of Tor, on the eaſt ſide of this weſtern branch of this ſea, where it is not above twelve or fourteen miles over. I ſuppoſe ſuch a wind hindering the water from going out, cauſes this extraordinary increaſe in the ſpring tides. The ſame thing happens with the ſame winds at Venice, both gulphi running nearly in the ſame direction.</p>
                     <p>The Egyptian, weſterm, or Thebaic ſhore, from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deah ſouthward to oppoſite Tor, on the eaſtern ſhore, is all mountainous and ſteep, and at Elim, the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernmoſt point of the bay of Tor, ends the ridge of mountains, which begin on the eaſtern ſhore of this weſtern branch at Karondel. I ſay nothing of Elim or Tor, or the marine productions of this gulph, as this paper is intended to give an account of Sharme, Meenah el Dazhab Kadeſh Barnea, the ſtone which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtrucle twice, and the inſcriptions; I however muſt ſay, that from this place Mount Sinai, properly ſo called, cannot be ſeen, but only the ridge or groupe of mountains in which it is, and which altogether form that part of this tongue of land, called in general Mount Sinai, The garden of the monks of Mount Sinai at Elim, renders in dates, &amp;c. 20,000 piaſtres per annum, or 2,500 pounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="unknown:027335_0130_0FD40BD8400226C8"/>We from thence croſſed the plain in about eight hours, and entered the mountains of Sinai; they are of granite of different colours. At the entrance of the narrow breach through which we paſſed; I ſaw on a large looſe granite ſtone, an inſcription in unknown characters, given, I think, by Doctor <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ock,</hi> biſhop of Oſſory. However as the Iſraelites had no writing that we know of, when they paſſed here, I did not think it of conſequence enough to ſtop for. The Arabs told me it was relative to a battle fought here between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs, and indeed I did not ſee what points of hiſtory it can illuſtrate, beſides, there are not above five or ſix words. We arrived at the convent of Mount Sinai, after the uſual difficulties mentioned by other travellers, were received as uſual, and ſaw the uſual places. I muſt ſay that the monks were far from owning to me, that they had ever meddled with the print of the foot of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s camel. I examined it narrowly, and no chiſſel has abſolutely ever touched it; for the coat of the granite is intire, and unbroke in every part; and every body knows, that if the coat of leſs hard ſtones than granite is once deſtroyed, it never returns. It is a moſt curious <hi>luſus natura,</hi> and the Mahometans turn it to their uſe.</p>
                     <p>Meribah is, indeed ſurprizingly ſtriking; I examined the lips of its mouth, and found that no chiſſel had ever worked there. The channel is plainly worn by only the courſe of water, and the bare inſpection of it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince any one it is not the work of a man; amongſt the innumerable cracks in rocks, which I have ſeen in this as well as other parts of the world, I never met with any like this, except that at Jeruſalem, and the two which are in the rock which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtruck twice, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>I had enquired of the captain and the two pilots of our ſhip, about Sharme and Dzahab, on the weſtern ſhore of the eaſtern branch of the Red Sea; they told me that they were often forced up the Elanitic gulf, the eaſtern branch of the Red Sea, and generally went to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:027335_0131_0FD40BD972A9CD88"/>
Sharme, and ſometimes as high as Dzahab. That they generally ran from Cape Mahomet, the ſouthermoſt part of the peninſula, between thoſe two gulfs to ſharme in fix hours; becauſe they made as much more way as they commonly do, they very ſeldom going there but in a ſtorm. They generally run four knots, ſo that makes 48 miles, which brings it to the northward of Tor. Tor is in latitude 27 deg 55 min. Cape Mahomet 30 ſouthward, latitude 27 deg. 25 min. Sharme 48 miles, nearly north latitude 23 deg. 13 min. conſequently about north-eaſt of Sinai. The port is pretty large, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mountains, the entrance very narrow, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deep quite to the rocks, which are ſo very ſteep that a ſtone dropped from the ſummit falls into the baſon. No wind can be felt here; they do not caſt anchor, but faſten their cables to the rocks. There is good water; ſome habitations are found on the ſides of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and a pretty large village at top. This ſeems to anſwer the idea of <hi>Neſt-Ken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dzahab lies as high again up the gulf, ſo 48 miles more, or in lat. 29 deg. This port is conſiderably lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the former, and very good, but not ſo cloſely ſurrounded with mountains; it is however ſafe. There is a well of great antiquity, with very good water; very conſiderable ruins are found, and they ſay there was a great city formerly, but no inhabitants now, except an Arabian camp of 2000 men. There is a road from it to Jeruſalem, formerly much frequented. Thus far the captain and pilots. I enquired from the Monks as well as Arabs, about theſe places, as well as about the ruins, ſuppoſed by my learned friend the biſhiop of Oſſory, to be Kadeſh Barnea. The former could only tell me, they had not received any fiſh from thence many years; that it was two eaſy days journey off, but the road was mountainous; ſo one may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uppoſe the diſtance leſs than 40 miles. The Arabs agreed as to the road, but they ſaid it was once a large place, where their prince lived, whoſe daughter <hi>Moſes</hi> married; that <hi>Moſes,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their prince, and the greateſt of all prophets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:027335_0132_0FD40BDAD9AED828"/>Theſe Arabs place <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt, <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the fourth, and then the prophets of the bible. As to Dzahab the monks only knew the diſtance to be four days journey, and that there was a rond from it to Jeruſalem; (the Arabs told me the ſame) ſo the diſtance is about 80 miles, I enquired of them all about the ruins. They told me there were confiderable ones about half way to Dzahab, about 40 miles from Sinai; but I ſhould think Kadeſh muſt have been much nearer to Jeruſalem. I would willingly have gone to theſe places, but as the four clans of Arabs, which inhabit this promontory, were then at war with the other, I could get no conductor. In any other journey I hope to be more lucky, or this is all hearſay; however, combining the whole together, and comparing it with what we collect from ſcripture, I think we may conclude Sharme to be Midian, and Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah el Dzahab to be Eziongeber; what the interjacent ruins are, I cannot, conjecture; but I believe have found Kadeſh Barnea to be elſewhere; I think it cannot be here, for the Iſraelites were on the borders of the holy land, or land of promiſe, when they were ordered back, and when they were ſtopped by the Moabites. They are ſaid to have been brought up from Kadeſh Barnea, and I meet with no place in ſacred writing, or any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient geographer, neither <hi>Strabo</hi> nor any other, that draw the line between this promontory and the land of promiſe ſo low down; nor could they do it, as theſe ruins are within almoſt 70 miles of the extremity of it.</p>
                     <p>There and two roads from mount Sinai to Jeruſalem, the one through Pharan, the other by the way of Dza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.

This ſeems to be a ſituation oppoſite Kadeſh Barnea, as the line drawn by all the geographers; it is without mount Sinai, (taken for this whole tract) and juſt before the Moabites, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed by mount Hor, now Acaba, leaving the Aſphaltic lake on their left hand to the north-weſt. The tradition too of the Arabs is, that they paſſed this way; therefore I think Kadeſh Barnea muſt be near this ſpot. There are here conſiderable ruins, and I know of no city that ever was here, for Petra lay more to the eaſt, Aſphaltic lake and and the Elanitic gulf. To leave no enquiry wanting, I aſked the rabbins of Jeruſalem where they placed Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſh Barnea, and they ſaid theſe ruins.</p>
                     <p>We ſet out from mount Sinai by the way of Scheich Salem, and after we had paſſed <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s ſtone, came to the beautiful valley mentioned in the journal. I lay there, and did not ſet out before day light, that I might not paſs the rock which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtruck twice; I ſearched and enquired of my Arabs, but could neither hear nor ſee any thing of it. I ſaw ſeveral ſhort inſcriptions ſtained on ſome parts of the mountains; the characters being the ſame as thoſe on mount Sinai, Meribah, &amp;c. given by the biſhop of Oſſory. About four miles before we arrived at Pharan, we paſſed through a remarkable breach in a rock, each ſide of it is perpendicular as a wall, about 80 feet high, and the breach is about 40 broad. It is at this breach I imagine, the Horites were ſmote, four miles beyond the preſent ruins of Pharan, for having paſſed this breach, they could make a ſtand, nor could they be purſued. Here on the tops of the mountains, to our right hand, were ruins of buildings, and one ſeemed a caſtle. From Meribah to near this place we had always rather d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Between thin breach and Pharan there are ſeveral ſprings and one at Pharan, where we encamped. There is the bed of the river mentioned by the journal; the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account of which agrees with what is ſaid by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Waters ſeem to have run from Meribah, to within about ſix miles of this place; the bed of a ſtream is here again very plain, and a ſpring at the upper end of it, which does not yield water enough to make a ſtream, the bed then is dry; four vallies terminate here, and form a large area. I enquired about the road to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; the people agreed in the diſtance and ruins.</p>

It ſeems much eaſier to ſay what the inſcriptions are not, than what they are. They can ſcarce be of St. <hi>Helen</hi>'s time, for they would have ſome analogy with Greek characters, and they have none. Perhaps ſome gentlemen think them ancient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, written by the colony, which, they ſuppoſe, went to inhabit China; but ſuch colony, if ever there was ſuch a one, probably went the ſtrait road, from the head of one gulf, to the head of the other, from Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis to Eloth, the way the Mecca pilgrims now go. This place would have been far out of their way, being at leaſt. ſixty miles to the ſouth of the pilgrims' road, unleſs they were ſuppoſed to have had tranſports at Dza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab or Sharme. Here are on other parts of this rock, ſome Greek and Arabic, as well as Saracen inſcriptions, and an Hebrew one. The Saracens and Arabic only ſay, "Such an one was here at ſuch a time." The ſame ſay the Greek ones, except one, which ſays, as I remember, for I have it not with me, <q>The evil geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the army wrote this,</q> which can only prove that ſome body of the Greeks were worſted here.</p>

                     <p>AFTER this excurſion to the written mountains, we find that Mr. Montague reviſited Italy: ſince the ingenious Mr. <hi>Samuel Sharp,</hi> in his letters from Italy, in the year 1767, makes the following mention of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>One of the moſt curious ſights amongſt the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at Venice, was the famous Mr. Montague. He was juſt arrived from the caſt, he had travelled

through the Holy Land, Egypt, Armenia, &amp;c. with the Old and New Teſtament in his hands, he had viſited Mount Sinai, and flattered himſelf he had been on the very part of the rock where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake face to face with God Almighty: his beard reached down to his breaſt, and the dreſs of his head was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian. He was in the moſt enthuſiaſtick raptures with Arabia and the Arabs: his bed was the ground, his food rice, his beverage water, his luxury a pipe and coffee.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This abſtemious method of living in imitation of the Arabs and Armenians, our hero adopted in the latter part: of his life, for he had formerly indulged himſelf in all the luxuries and ſenſualities of the eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Having rather blunted the edge of his curioſity hy continual travel, he reſided ſeveral years at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. With reſpect to eating and drinking he affected great temperance, but he was never without a ſeraglio filled with the beauties of Georgia, Circaſſia, and Greece; as he deemed a plurality of women conſonant to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the patriarchal ages of which he was ſo fond.</p>
                     <p>At length growing very infirm, he began to fear an approaching diſſolution; this determined him once more to reviſit England, in order to ſettle his temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. He reflected with conſiderable chagrin, that his ſiſter, the wife of the preſent Earl of Bute was his heir at law. For his enmity to that nobleman and his family continued, or rather, had im realed with his years, and he ſeemed to have gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>On the receipt of this intelligence, a thought ſtruck his imagination, which gave him a ſenſible ſatisfaction, as it preſented him with the idea of throwing his eſtate into another channel, and diſappointing thoſe obnoxious relations who were in ſanguine expectation of its falling to them.</p>
                     <p>His ſcheme was to marry ſome young woman of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent circumſtances, who was pregnant that the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born in wedlock, might become his heir. For he was too ſenſible of his own imbecillity from age and infirmities to ſuppoſe he ſhould ever have a child of his own.</p>
                     <p>Warm with the idea of this novel method of ſhewing the moſt permanent reſentment to thoſe he ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed, he wrote to a friend in England to procure a proper young woman in a ſtate of pregnancy, with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>This requeſt to his friends occaſioned an advertiſement to be inſerted in the morning papers.</p>

                        </gap> ones applied, who had been more prolific than their circumſtances rendered convenient, and having been forſaken by their faithleſs ſwains, thought by the tenor of the advertiſement that it was a favorable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to alleviate their misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Four of theſe were ſelected for our hero's choice. The firſt being in the third; the ſecond in the fourth; the third in the fifth; and the fourth in the ſixth month of her pregnancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="144" facs="unknown:027335_0142_0FD40BED2B6EE198"/>They were informed that the perſon whoſe happineſs it ſhould be to be choſen by Mr. Montague, would have a genteel ſettlement for life; beſides the child of which ſhe was pregnant becoming by the marriage heir to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eſtate; and that the three whoſe fortune it was to be rejected, would have a preſent of 200 pounds each. Perfectly ſatisfied with this, they were ſent to France, in in order to proceed to Paris, where Mr. Montague was to meet them, that the hymeneal election might be made with all poſſible expedition; but the ladies were all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, as Mr. Montague did not reach Paris, being ſeized at Venice with a malignant fever, which carried him off in a few days. Thus his relations who were ſo obnoxious to him, were much more befriended by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than by his age or impotency.</p>
