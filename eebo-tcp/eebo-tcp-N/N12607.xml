            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is impoſſible to write a book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imagination. This faculty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with all our ideas;—it either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invents or colours them. The philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers may ſay what they pleaſe, but a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent is good for little except the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is concerned in it. It is the fancy which colours our ſentiments, and makes them agreeable. And ſentiments without being tinged a little with the colourings of imagination, will appear very dull and inſipid.</p>
                  <p>Things are not leſs real, becauſe the fancy colours them, and this journey is not leſs true, becauſe the imagination has had a ſhare in it;—and there is not a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental journey extant that would have exiſted, if fancy had not woven a thread in the web of ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>The critics will find ſome defects in theſe travels; but as every man has a right to travel in his own way, ſo every critic has a right to find fault if he has a mind.</p>

                     <p>IT is a diſagreeable conſideration when a perſon is enjoying ſweet repoſe in his bed, to be ſuddenly awakened by the rude bluſtering noiſe of a vociferous hoſtler. There is no help for it, provided a man
<pb facs="unknown:015918_0007_0F9B3DF6E1D3C270"/>
intends to travel in a ſtage-coach; this evil, like many others, muſt be ſuffered with patience. Patience renders all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens three fourths lighter than they would be without it.</p>
                     <p>The morning was very fine when we entered the coach; nature ſmiled around us. It is a pity, thought I, that we are not to ride on horſeback; we ſhould then enjoy the pleaſures of the morning, ſnuff the perfumes of the fields, hear the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of the groves, and the concert of the woods.</p>
                     <p>In croſſing the river Tyne from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> there is one inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: you muſt wait the pleaſure of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle arbitrary Baſhaw, who will not move one foot beyond the rules of his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or mitigate the ſentence paſſed upon thoſe who are condemned to travel in a ſtage-coach within a ferry-boat <note n="*" place="bottom">This was written before the temporary bridge was built.</note>.</p>
                     <p>As I hate every idea of ſlavery and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015918_0008_0F9B3DF7ACC1AC10"/>
I was not a little offended at the expreſſions of authority which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon this occaſion, by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ferry. We were now in the boat, and obliged to ſit till this little ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant gave orders for our departure. The vehicle for carrying paſſengers acroſs the river, is the moſt tireſome and heavy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that ever was invented. Four row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a ſmall boat drag the ponderous fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acroſs the river very ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>From the time we entered the boat, before we landed on the oppoſite ſide, an hour was almoſt ſpent. We had time to reflect upon what might happen to us by the way, and an opportunity to put up a few ejaculations to heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from the danger of ferry-boats and tyrants. This was the beſt uſe we could make of our time, while we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this floating chariot; ſome of the ladies who were in the coach, were ſo hurried in the morning, that they ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had time to ſay their prayers—This was a good opportunity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:015918_0009_0F9B3DF85B7AD9E0"/>As ſoon as we landed on the ſouth ſide of the river <hi>Tyne,</hi> we were ſaluted by a black-bird, which welcomed us to the county of <hi>Durham.</hi> It ſeemed to take pleaſure to ſee us fairly out of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of <hi>Charon,</hi> and whiſtled chearfully upon our arrival. Nature, ſaid I to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is the miſtreſs of real pleaſure; this ſame black-bird cannot ſuffer us to paſs by without contributing to our happineſs. <hi>It is more bleſſed to give than receive.</hi> I wiſh that all men underſtood this maxim as well by reaſon and tutorage, as this whiſtler in a hedge does by inſtinct.— The black-bird is free, and ſings from a ſenſe of liberty—it is under no controul— were it in a cage it might ſing, but not half ſo ſweetly.</p>
                     <p>Liberty appears to be the firſt principle of muſic. Slaves can never ſing from the heart. The <hi>capons</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, by the inſtruments of caſtration, hath formed to ſing for the entertainment of arbitrary maſters, can never give ſuch muſical expreſſions, as a free citizen, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015918_0010_0F9B3DF92D779278"/>
and a ſon of liberty. They may be fit to pleaſe ſlaves or tyrants, but can never give true entertainment to a ſoul that knows and values liberty.</p>
                     <p>After we had paſſed <hi>Gateſhead,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the <hi>Fell,</hi> the pleaſures of the morning increaſed upon us;—the whins and brier ſent forth a fragrance exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly delightful. On every ſide of the coach, peerleſs droops of dew dangling upon the bloſſoms of the thorns, helped to add to the preſume. Aurora began now to ſtreak the weſtern ſky, and the ſpangled heavens announced the approach of the king of day.—The fineſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the moſt curious artiſts, are but mean imitations of thoſe various colours which adorn the heavens at the approach of the ſun. Sol at laſt appeared, and ſpread his healthful beams over hills and valleys. The wild beaſts now were retired to their dens; and thoſe timorous animals which go abroad in the night, to ſeek their food, were alſo withdrawn to the thickets. The hares were ſkipping acroſs the lawn,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015918_0011_0F9B3DF9E1A58A68"/>
taſting the dewy glade for their morning's repaſt. The ſky-lark mounted on high, and ſerenaded his dame with mirthful glee and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>How pure are the feelings of nature? How ſtrong the power of inſtinct! Theſe are not warped by the bias of falſe educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cuſtom, or private intereſt. That ſame lark does all that is in his power to render his mate happy.—He ſings to make her toil eaſy, while ſhe is employed about their mutual concerns. Ah! little do thoſe about the courts of monarchs know, the power of theſe unmixed feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They are ſtrangers to the chaſte pleaſures which fill the ſoul with unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed joy. Inſtead of nouriſhing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing their own fleſh, they imitate the vileſt of animals, in drinking ſtolen wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to gratify their luſts. Say, ye libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous children of licentiouſneſs, did your maker implant theſe deſires in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or have ye not rather by purſuing evil practices acquired another nature than the Almighty endowed you with? For
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015918_0012_0F9B3DFAE6748350"/>
ſhame! do not blame your Maker for thoſe unnatural deſires; he never implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in your conſtitution. The luſt remains in your mind—and you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have created it, by taſting too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of forbidden pleaſures. Blame not your fleſh, but your vile diſpoſitions which you have acquired by the practice of vice, and formed into a habit. Say, if you have not the ſame deſires to licentiouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when nature revolts againſt the practice? Then, yourſelves, and not nature are to be blamed.—Go to the lark, ye ſlaves of pollution, conſider his ways and be wiſe. —He cheriſhes his dame with all the ſoft endearments of affection—He does not ſtroll through the grove or the thicket, to ſearch for ſome new amour, but keeps ſtrictly to the ties of conjugal affection, and cheriſhes the partner of his natural concerns. Who but muſt frown, to ſee a D—ke, L—d, or K—t, purſuing a ſtrange woman, embelliſhed with a few trappings of foreign ſilk and lace, to a houſe of pleaſure, where he receives with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015918_0013_0F9B3DFB57D05BF8"/>
his forbidden enjoyment, a ſtain on his character a ſting for his conſcience, and rottenneſs to his bones—While ſhe to whom he ſwore to be faithful, pines away at home in diſcontent and fretful ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Nature has provided for men all thoſe pleaſures which ſhe has formed diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the enjoyment of;—but the looſe deſires which libidinous mortals attribute to their natures, proceed from other cauſes—from a neglect of purſuing the principles of nature, and from behaving unnaturally.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of theſe contemplations, a grave and ſolemn ſcene opened to our view. <hi>Haſslet</hi> that robbed the mail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ago, hangs on a gibbet at our left hand—Unfortunate and infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Haſslet!</hi> hadſt thou robbed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of millions, inſtead of robbing the mail, and pilfering a few ſhillings from a teſty old maid; thou hadſt not been hanging a ſpectacle to paſſengers, and a prey to crows. Thy caſe was pitiable—
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015918_0014_0F9B3DFC35D83DA0"/>
but there was no mercy—thou waſt poor! and thy ſin unpardonable. Hadſt thou robbed to ſupport the Crown, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for the Miniſtry, thou mightſt have been yet alive. Were all the robbers of the nation hanging in the ſame ſituation, there would be ſome appearance of juſtice and impartiality. But the poor only can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit crimes worthy of death,—and thoſe alſo muſt be enemies to the Court, or lukewarm in its intereſts.</p>
                     <p>The place where <hi>Haſslet</hi> hangs, is the fineſt place in the world for the walk of a ghoſt.—At the foot of a wild romantic mountain, near the ſide of a ſmall lake are his remains; his ſhadow appears in the water, and ſuggeſts the idea of two male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.—The imagination may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure up his ghoſt. Many ſpirits have been ſeen in wilds not ſo fit for the purpoſe. This robber is now perhaps the genius of the <hi>Fell,</hi> and walks in the gloomy ſhades of night by the ſide of this little lake. This is all ſuppoſition,—and is perhaps as good a ſuppoſition as any that has yet
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015918_0015_0F9B3DFCD7962D70"/>
given for ghoſts and goblins becoming viſible.</p>
                     <p>This dreary place is well calculated for raiſing gloomy ideas, which tend to craze the imagination.—It would not be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to hear ſome viſionary mortals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating that they ſaw <hi>Haſslet</hi> walking by the ſide of the water. The imagination is capable of creating things which are not, and can upon ſome occaſions quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the dead. Many travellers have ſeen things that are inviſible, and affirmed what is as improbable, as that <hi>Haſslet</hi> was ſeen walking upon the top of <hi>Gateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Fell.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. II. A deſcription of the city of Durham—The Abbey—The Choir—The Clock—Rural Pleaſures—The female Antipodes—The Arbor—The Caſcade—Inſcriptions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Grave-ſtones.</head>
                     <p>THE city of <hi>Durham</hi> is very pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſituated. The river Ware, almoſt encompaſſes it round, and forms a penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula. The banks of the river from <hi>Old Elvet Bridge</hi> to <hi>Framwell-gate,</hi> form a fine amphitheatre. The cathedral church of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> and the Biſhop's palace, which ſtand upon the oppoſite bank, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a very grand proſpect. The pleaſant banks on the weſt ſide, adorned with ſtately trees, mingled with ſhrubs of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds, bring to one's mind the roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ideas of ancient ſtory, when ſwains and nymphs ſung their loves amongſt trees, near the ſide of ſome inchanting river. The abbey and caſtle call to remembrance thoſe inchanted places where knights errant
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015918_0017_0F9B3DFE560607F0"/>
were confined for many years, till deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome friend, who knew how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the chains and charms of necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Durham</hi> would be a very fine place, were it not for the ſwarms of prieſts that are in it,—who devour very extenſive livings without being of any real ſervice to the public. The common people are here very ignorant, and great profaners of the ſabbath-day. It is cuſtomary for the idle people to play at the long bowl on the Sunday when the weather is fair. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, almoſt over all England, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ignorance and vice is under the noſes of the Biſhops. The reaſon hereof I will not pretend to ſay, but the fact is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                     <p>This city is a very healthy place, the the ſoil is dry, and the air wholeſome.— It is built upon a riſing ground, and the fields around it are pleaſant both in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſummer. The ſagacity of the monks appears conſpicuous in the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015918_0018_0F9B3DFF28B278E8"/>
of <hi>Durham Abbey.</hi> It is placed in the neighbourhood of as fine land as any in England, and the greateſt part thereof now belongs to the dean and chapter. Were I to refer the choice of an eſtate to any perſons whatſover, it would be to the clergy;—they know the ſoil of this world better than any denomination of mankind. Wherever they have taken up their reſidence, there is ſure to be found a fine ſituation, and a good ſoil. The air in and about Durham being very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the inhabitants live to a good old age. It is a place of little trade or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being far from the ſea, having no port nearer than <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> or <hi>Sunderland.</hi> Here are ſome manufactories, but they have not yet been carried to any great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>One thing which travellers admire moſt in <hi>Durham,</hi> is the Cathedral, a grand and ancient building. In this church there is a very fine organ, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent choir of ſingers; but devotion is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed here with great lukewarmneſs and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015918_0019_0F9B3E00157DC520"/>
indifference. The perſons who are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned in the acts of religious worſhip, perform their parts rather as a grievous taſk than a matter of choice.</p>
                     <p>This antient building is ſupported by two rows of Gothic pillars, of which, ſcarcely any two of them are exactly alike. The architecture is very noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delightful to the eye of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who has a taſte for antiquity, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic magnificence. The font for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing children, ſtands at the weſt end of the abbey, as in other churches, for which I know no other reaſon than <hi>ſic voluerunt Romani.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the ſouth ſide of the abbey near the choir, ſtands a very famous <hi>clock,</hi> ſaid to be the workmanſhip of a man who was convicted of counterfeiting the King's coin: he had no other method to ſcreen himſelf from juſtice, than to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the arms of the church, and do ſomething meritorious to work out his own ſalvation. He made this clock to the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015918_0020_0F9B3E0096616A78"/>
holy church, that he might obtain the pardon of his iniquity. He would have been as ſurely hanged as ever <hi>Haſslet</hi> was for robbing the mail, had he not taken ſhelter in this city of refuge. In thoſe days no power could touch an offender who fled for protection to the clergy;— whatever crime he might have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the church once received him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her protection, no other power durſt interfere. Accordingly, this coiner made this clock for the good of the church; and it appears to be of more real ſervice to the abbey, than the biſhop and the whole college of doctors. The clock is not only a mechanical oracle, but a kind of moral machine; for in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it directs the eyes of a traveller to the things which are above; it exhibits a view of the planets and their motions, and ſhews the variations of the moon; it points out the day of the month, and the moon's age, with ſeveral other curious exhibitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015918_0021_0F9B3E05227F2958"/>The maker had certainly been a very ingenious perſon, and any good-natured man would almoſt forgive him the ſin of coining, on account of the merit he has diſplayed in performing this noble piece of machinery. When we entered into the church, the moon had not finiſhed her firſt quarter. I thought to myſelf, that this clock was certainly intended by the artiſt to teach the doctors the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of all created enjoyments, and to put them in mind of laying up their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven, where all fluctuation will ceaſe, and all things continue in a ſtate of permanency.</p>
                     <p>On the oppoſite ſide of the cathedral, over againſt the clock, there is a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment placed in the wall, with an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon one Mr. <hi>Hartwell,</hi> who was once a clergyman in this church. Upon the top of the tomb-ſtone theſe words are inſcribed,
<q>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death.</q>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:015918_0022_0F9B3E075EB004A0"/>
This inſcription, upon the very top of mortality, affords a noble reaſon of hope to thoſe who believe the New Teſtament, of a bleſſed reſurrection to eternal life.</p>
                     <p>The tomb of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> is a curioſity which is ſhewn to ſtrangers. An old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhewed us where the pilgrims were wont to pay their homage to the ſame,— and if there is any truth in the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> they have left the marks of their feet behind them; the flag is worn hollow with the ceremony of obeiſance. I obſerved to the old woman, that when this ſaint roſe, it would make a ſtrange cataſtrophe, and ſpoil the devotion of the doctors; ſhe had no notion of a reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſtared with wild ſurprize; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inſtruct her a little in this important point of religion, but to no manner of purpoſe;—for ſhe neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, nor was willing to underſtand, any thing of the matter.</p>
                     <p>It would be uncharitable to impute the ignorance of this old woman to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015918_0023_0F9B3E08697EF490"/>
of the college of doctors;—for they are all very learned men, and preach many learned ſermons, which this good woman might hear if ſhe had a mind. The reaſon why this female door-keeper of the houſe of God, was ſo ignorant of the doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead, appeared to me to be, that ſhe did not think herſelf obliged to believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church,—which is all that a member of the church of England is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to believe.</p>
                     <p>After we were wearied with ſauntering in this old Gothic abbey, we went down to the river ſide, to view the curioſities in the fields. The large and extenſive banks of the river are all planted with trees, at the foot of which is a fine gravel walk, where the ladies and gentlemen amuſe themſelves in the forenoon before dinner, and in the afternoon before tea. Here a perſon who is fond of rural pleaſures, may riot at large. The river glides plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly by the ſide of the banks, and in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015918_0024_0F9B3E08D6D34300"/>
parts forms delightful water-pieces of a great extent. Stately oak and aſh-trees, intermized with firs and ſhrubs, form a proſpect very agreeable to the eye. In ſummer, birds of various kinds make a rural concert, more entertaining to a ſentimental traveller, than all the muſic of the cathedral which ſtands on the oppoſite ſide of the river. Theſe choriſters of the grove ſing from the heart, and expreſs the feelings of nature in a pure manner; —while the hirelings in the abbey, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with their taſk, perform their parts by the aſſiſtance of art, without feeling the power of the muſic they expreſs. Were it not for the perquiſites of St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> they would never tune an organ, nor chant an hymn. But the ſingers upon the other ſide of the river ſing from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of love, without fee or reward. Say, ye learned men in the college, which of the two are the beſt ſingers? Lay aſide prejudice, and tell the truth. Is not the ſong of a thruſh, or a black-bird, infinitely preferable to human muſic,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015918_0025_0F9B3E09A7C48AC0"/>
where the ſoul hath no part in it? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe ſingers in the wood are as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him who made them, as any <hi>minor canon</hi> or <hi>prebendary</hi> in any cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral in <hi>England.</hi> Preſumptive man! wants to make a monopoly of the divine favour, and to exclude all other creatures from a ſhare thereof.</p>
                     <p>As we were walking on the ſide of the river, we had a conſpicuous view of the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> I had often heard of them in books of geography, but never ſaw them before. It was juſt a little before dinner, that we walked along the foot of the bank towards <hi>Old Elvet</hi> church, when we ſpied three young ladies walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their feet, with their heads downmoſt. They were Antipodes to us, and appeared to be taking a little freſh air before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They had all the appearance of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ladies, but walked in a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent direction from thoſe who travel on our hemiſphere. It ſeemed natural to conclude, that the Antipodes in all parts
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015918_0026_0F9B3E0BFAF33B78"/>
of the globe are like to one another; for the Antipode Ladies at <hi>Durham</hi> are as like thoſe in the city of <hi>London,</hi> as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies poſſibly can be like to each other. Whether there is a chink in the globe in this place, by which the oppoſite people become viſible to one another, or that we ſaw only ſome phantoms, I ſhall leave for a gueſs to my readers,—but one thing I am ſure of, that a worthy ſurgeon, and a captain of a ſhip, were witneſſes of this phenomenon. I was ready at firſt to imagine, that the three ladies were ſome of the remains of the antient fairies, who in days of yore are ſaid to have played many droll pranks,—by friſking ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from one place to another, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently turning themſelves into ſtrange attitudes;—but as none of them were dreſſed in green, I concluded they were the Antipodes, and totally gave up the laſt hypotheſis. I was afraid leſt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, a young man, and unmarried, ſhould have made a precipitate deſcent into the river, and gone down to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015918_0027_0F9B3E0CD707DBD8"/>
of Antipodes; for the captain, who is a judge of fine women, ſpoke ſo much in their praiſe, that he would have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the flames of love in the heart of our fellow traveller, had not a cloud ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily removed them out of our ſight, and delivered the ſurgeon from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temptation. I would adviſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of courants, chronicles, and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, to ſet this down among the rarities of the county of <hi>Durham,</hi> inſtead of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs from <hi>Polidore Virgil, Speed</hi> or <hi>Stow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Near to the place where we were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with this beatific viſion, there is one of the moſt pleaſant natural arbours that the eye can behold. Five ſtately aſh trees formed into a ſort of ſemicircle, twiſted round with ivy, make a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful arbor;—and to add to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this retreat, from the ſcorching beams of the ſun, there is a caſcade at a ſmall diſtance, where the water tumbling down a huge precipice, breaks into foam
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015918_0028_0F9B3E0D5834BF30"/>
at the foot of the bank, and makes a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſound. In ancient times this would have been an excellent place of abode for the water nymphs, or the goddeſſes of the rivers; of which number ſome might have been ready to ſuppoſe were the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Antipodes.</p>
                     <p>We came at laſt to <hi>Old Elvet</hi> church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and walked a ſhort while among the dead. I read over ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions upon the tomb-ſtones; ſeveral of them had the marks of popery upon them, with a common motto in Latin, frequently wrong ſpelled.—<hi>Requieſcat in pace,</hi> or <hi>Requieſcant in pace,</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times written <hi>Requieſe-at in pace</hi>;—and upon one ſtone, there is an improvement made in the Latin orthography by ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a <hi>g</hi> for a <hi>q,</hi> and then it ſtands <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieſe-at in pace.</hi> It would be for the honour of the curate of the pariſh to have theſe blunders corrected, leſt travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhould conclude that this ill ſpelled Latin was engraved upon the tomb-ſtones
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015918_0029_0F9B3E0E252F60F0"/>
by his authority; however this ſhall be left to his own diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Our landlord in the <hi>New Inn</hi> at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is a jolly honeſt man—the houſe is a very fine ſpacious building, and might ſerve the biſhop. All things are clean, cheap, and good, in this inn. If a perſon comes in well pleaſed, he will find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to offend him, provided he does not create ſome offence to himſelf. While I was marking down ſome obſervations which I had made in taking a walk through the town, the orders were given for our departure—ſo I conclude this chapter.</p>

                     <p>WHEN we left <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> the coach was full;—four ladies, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the ſword, and your humble ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015918_0030_0F9B3D5AC058F570"/>
made up the principal contents of this ſtage vehicle. We ſat in ſilence for a ſhort time, till we were jolted into good humour by the motion of the coach,— when the ſeveral ſocial faculties began to open. One of our female companions, who was a <hi>North Briton,</hi> a jolly middle aged matron, and a lady of abundance of good ſenſe and humour, entertained us for a quarter of an hour, with the hiſtory of her travels. She had made the tour of <hi>Europe,</hi> and had viſited the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able places in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in quality of a dutiful wife attending her valetudinary huſband, who was travelling for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health. Her eaſy unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner in telling a ſtory, made her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good company, and none of us had the leaſt inclination to interrupt her, till ſhe pleaſed to ceaſe. She knew how to time her diſcourſe, and never, like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her ſex, degenerated into tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or inſipidity. At every ſtage ſhe was a conformiſt to all the meaſures of the company, and went into every ſocial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015918_0031_0F9B3D627482B408"/>
that was made. As ſhe is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of four fine daughters, in giving us the outlines of their hiſtory, ſhe puzzled us with a ſort of enigma, which ſhe was obliged to explain before we could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her meaning. They were married, ſhe ſaid, in four different kingdoms, all belonging to King <hi>George</hi> the Third, and yet there were none of them either in <hi>Hanover, Wales,</hi> or in any of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. There was one of them, ſhe ſaid, in <hi>England,</hi> whom ſhe was going to ſee; another in <hi>Ireland,</hi> two in <hi>Scotland</hi>— Theſe laſt appeared to us to be in one and the ſame kingdom, and we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a third;—but by holding to an old diſtinction, and diviſion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe made out two kingdoms in that part of the iſland. One of thoſe ladies was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the kingdom of <hi>Fife,</hi>—ſo the enigma was explained.</p>
                     <p>Another of our companions was a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow lady in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> quite as agreeable as the former. She underſtood how to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015918_0032_0F9B3D63D46C7848"/>
make us laugh, and could tell a ſtory as well as moſt of her ſix;—yet far from being troubleſome or tedious, ſhe rather excited our inclination to have her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, than end her diſcourſe. She only went with us for one ſtage, and then we loſt the pleaſure of her company.</p>
                     <p>The third was a <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> lady, well known in the literary world for her uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performances for the benefit of youth. This female triumvirate would have been much upon par, had they been all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, for their gifts of communication were much alike; but the lady who had taken the tour of <hi>Europe,</hi> had made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſeful obſervations upon foreign places, which the others were not acquainted with;—theſe rather gave her an advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which muſt be attributed to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and not to the want of abilities in her companions.</p>
                     <p>The laſt female was the <hi>Scotch</hi> lady's ſervant,—and as ſhe ſaid nothing the whole way, I ſhall ſay nothing of her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:015918_0033_0F9B3D63E7B9C4F0"/>The fifth of our companions was an officer in the army, who in the morning appeared very drowſy, and came forth of his chamber with a ſort of reluctance. His hair was diſhevelled, and quite out of queu, and he ſeemed to be as ready for a ſleep as if he had not been in bed. He was for a time as dumb as a quaker, when not moved by the ſpirit, and by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſilence, at laſt fell aſleep, till we had proceeded near the half of our firſt ſtage. During this time he ſaid no ill.</p>
                     <p>We finiſhed our firſt ſtage, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing many words with this ſon of <hi>Mars,</hi> except ſome of thoſe flimſy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments which the gentlemen of the ſword pay frequently to the ladies, when they mean nothing. After a diſh of warm tea had warmed his bowels, and ſuppled the fibres of his tongue, he began to let us know that he was an officer in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and a man of ſome conſequence. He ſeemed to be fond of war, and ſpoke in high terms upon the uſefulneſs of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015918_0034_0F9B3D64A392EF00"/>
army. When he had exhauſted his whole fund of military arguments, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſlavery and oppreſſion; I obſerved to him, that a ſtanding army had a bad appearance in a free country, and put it in the power of the crown to enſlave the nation;—that inſtead of being under a civil government a nation was under a military one, when ſoldiers were let looſe upon the ſubjects for every ſmall diſcord which happened between oppreſſors and thoſe whom they oppreſſed;—and that I thought the militia was ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the purpoſes of a ſtanding army. I likewiſe obſerved, that inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging a ſtanding army, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all my friends againſt being ſoldiers, becauſe that as ſoon as they commenced ſoldiers they became ſlaves for life.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words, the ſpirit of <hi>Mars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtir in him, and he threatened, that if he was near a juſtice of the peace he would have me fined for hindering him from getting recruits;—adding that he once had a man fined five pounds for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015918_0035_0F9B3D676BC10CC0"/>
others not to enliſt in his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſervice. I told him, he certainly had a right to ſay all the fine things he could to recommend the ſervice of his maſter; and when he had done all that he could to recommend his ſervice, he had no more to do:—but, that any man had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a right to tell his friends whom he ſaw ready to be ſeduced into bondage, that they were born free, and ought to take care how they give up their liberty.— However, if any perſons were diſpoſed to be ſlaves, I ſhould not hinder them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by ſhewing them the rights of human nature, and the evils which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended bondage. I affirmed, that all ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of government where a man was not tried by his peers, were no better than tyranny and oppreſſion, and contrary to the principles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution; that the military government was of that ſort, becauſe a court of officers pretended to have authority to diſpoſe of a private man's life and liberty, when he was not guilty of any crime, that the laws of his country would condemn him for; and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015918_0036_0F9B3D6896ED6A50"/>
which in other perſons was not accounted criminal.—That court martials were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but arbitrary tribunals, oftentimes compoſed of officers, who, if they were private men, would receive the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which they paſſed upon others, and deſerve it better than the poor helpleſs culprits who fall a ſacrifice to their pride and caprice. I further told him, that <hi>Blackſtone</hi> had affirmed in his <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Laws of England,</hi>
                        <q>That the laws and conſtitution of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms know no ſuch ſtate as that of a perpetual ſtanding ſoldier, bred to no other profeſſion than that of war;— and that it was not till the reign of king <hi>Henry</hi> VII. that the kings of <hi>England</hi> had ſo much as a guard about their perſons.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To convince this ſon of <hi>Mars,</hi> that a ſtanding army, as diſtinct from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is inconſiſtent with liberty and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, I told him that <hi>Blackſtone</hi> had obſerved from <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi>
                        <q>
                           <pb n="40" facs="unknown:015918_0037_0F9B3D691AAAB8A0"/>That to prevent the executing power from being able to oppreſs, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the army with which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted ſhould conſiſt of the people, and have the ſame ſpirit with the people; as was the caſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> till <hi>Marius</hi> new modelled the legions by enliſting the rabble of <hi>Italy,</hi> and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the military tyranny which enſued. Nothing then, according to theſe principles, ought to be more guarded againſt in a free ſtate, than making the military, when ſuch a one is neceſſary to be kept on foot, a body diſtinct from the people. It ſhould wholly be compoſed of natural ſubjects; it ought only to be enliſted for a ſhort and limited time; no ſeparate camps, no barrack, no inland fortreſs ſhould be allowed.—And perhaps it might ſtill be better, if by diminiſhing a ſtated number, and enliſting others, at every renewal of their term, a circulation would be kept up between the army and the people, and the citizen and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015918_0038_0F9B3D6A24404218"/>
ſoldier be more intimately connected together.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not eaſy to make a military man underſtand any thing without the limits of his own ſyſtem; all laws, except what belong to a court martial are nothing to him. Our companion underſtood not a ſingle word of either <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> or <hi>Blackſtone</hi>; all his laws were connected with the ſword, and may properly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed club laws.</p>
                     <p>I did not find, however, that our mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary protector was a blood-thirſty man, for by his own confeſſion, he and another brother officer, had a few months before ſurrendered their purſes to an highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Highgate,</hi> for fear of bloodſhed. This ſhews that ſome officers are abundantly peaceable in time of danger, and declare no inclination for taking away mens lives. Our gentleman of the ſword had a great many ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why men ſhould not venture their lives for a little money: he ſaid there was no courage in fighting an highwayman,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015918_0039_0F9B3D6B007026F0"/>
nor any honour to be had in the victory; that ſoldiers ſhould preſerve their lives for the ſervice of their country in caſe of war, and not run the riſk of loſing them by fooliſh adventures.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſons did not altogether ſatisfy the ladies;—for one of them obſerved, that robbers were at war with both laws and government, and that the king's ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were hired to keep the peace, and to defend the ſubjects from violence; and that officers in the army are as much obliged by their office and character to fight robbers, as they are bound to fight the <hi>French,</hi> or any other enemy. That foot pads were invaders of other people's rights and properties, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by men whoſe profeſſion it was to fight, and who were well paid for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that it was for money all the officers in the army ſerved the King, and fought his battles, and why ſhould they not as well fight for money in a ſtage-coach, as in a caſtle or in a field? She inſiſted that only one of them could have been killed by the highwayman, or perhaps but
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015918_0040_0F9B3D6B709C7928"/>
wounded, and there were ſeveral chances that he might have miſſed them both.— But ſuppoſing the worſt, that one had been ſhot, it was only the chance of war, and the other might have ſecured the robber,—which would have been of more ſervice to the community than the life of the officer. In ſhort, ſhe obſerved, that it had more the appearance of cowardice than diſregard for money, for two officers to ſurrender their purſes to a ſingle high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman, who had nothing but one piſtol.</p>
                     <p>The lady's reflections were ſeverely felt by our young ſwordman, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſolemn ſilence in the coach for a quarter of an hour,—during which time ſome of us fell aſleep, and continued in that ſtate till we came to the inn where we were to change horſes. Two or three glaſſes of port reſtored the officer's cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and he was determined, in caſe we were attacked, to defend us from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of all highwaymen whatſoever;— and to ſhew that it was not for want of courage that he ſuffered the highwayman to eſcape, he told us a pretty diffuſive ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015918_0041_0F9B3D6C18A6D250"/>
of his own valour in quelling a mob at <hi>Dumfries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some hungry people in the town of <hi>Dumfries,</hi> who were not diſpoſed to ſtarve, when there was plenty of proviſions in the hands of the farmers and corn-factors, aſſembled in a body to do themſelves juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and to endeavour to have ſomething to eat. The magiſtrates who thought that the people had a right to ſtarve, and were not diſpoſed to aſſiſt them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their neceſſities, ſent for a party of military men to oblige them either to faſt diſcreetly, or to be ſhot, to eaſe them from the cravings of nature and the pains of hunger. Our hero was ſent upon this expedition, and had the command of the party;—where he performed wonders, all which we received upon the authority of his own teſtimony. The poor people were ſhot at like woodcocks, and thoſe who could get away with ſafety, were glad to return home to wreſtle with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the hard demands of their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, till heaven ſhould think fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015918_0042_0F9B3D6CD4C81950"/>
for them. This was a hard caſe, but there was no help for it; authority enforced by powder and ball, is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſted. The mob, to be ſure, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital tranſgreſſors, when they will not live without food, which they have no right to taſte, unleſs they are able to pay for it, according to the price that mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers and ingroſſers ſet upon it.—And it is, to be ſure, the duty of magiſtrates to protect traders in the poſſeſſion of whatſoever they can obtain, but they have no concern with the neceſſities of the poor, who are no benefit to ſociety. The modern meaning of authority, is to protect the rich, and to keep the poor in ſubjection; for every body knows, that thoſe who have no money can have no law; and without an exorbitant expence, no poor man can ſecure his right when oppreſſors are dipoſed to diſpute it.</p>
                     <p>Our young officer was very liberal in abuſing thoſe whom he called the mob, and ſaid they were ignorant, obſtinate, and wicked; and added, that he thought it no crime to deſtroy hundreds of them.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015918_0043_0F9B3D6D9D877A90"/>
The lady who before had given him a lecture, began to put him in mind of the foot-pad whom he and his brother offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had ſuffered to eſcape with their purſes, and aſked him how he would quell a mob of highwaymen? He was off his guard, and the mentioning of the foot-pad made him ſtare with a ſort of wildneſs, as if the robber had been at the coach door. The converſation ended, and I made the following remarks upon it.</p>
                     <p>That all tyrants are either cowards, or under the influence of the ſpirit of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thoſe who are diſpoſed to enſlave or tyrannize over others of their fellow-creatures, will always behave meanly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reverſe of fortune: Such as ſhew any degree of bravery, do it more from the influence of madneſs, than from any true principle. Tyrants who oppreſs others, have more reaſon to dread thoſe whom they oppreſs, than the oppreſſed have to dread them; and they who are in perpetual fear, are perpetual cowards. Such as do not fear them whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, muſt be in a ſtate of lunacy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:015918_0044_0F9B3D6E68D7EEC0"/>Secondly, the condition of the ſubjects is very miſerable, when they are not able to purchaſe the proviſions which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for life, and dare not take them without danger of the gallows. It is a great grievance to hungry people, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a number of large ſtacks of corn, and yet cannot obtain as much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport life. It is a terrible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative to faſt and ſtarve, or eat and be hanged. What are mobs and riots in times of ſcarcity? but hungry people fighting for their meat. The full, the rich, and wealthy, whoſe intereſt it is to have the prices of the neceſſaries of life high, may call them rebels, or by what names they pleaſe; but if they would change circumſtances for a ſmall ſeaſon, they would ſoon alter their opinion.</p>
                     <p>Rebellion, is not a principle which rules in the hearts of the poor, it is to be found chiefly among the rich.—There are not any among the poor tribes of mankind who do not pay the greateſt regard to their ſovereign, and would, if there were occaſion, venture their lives in his ſervice;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015918_0045_0F9B3D6FB3638868"/>
but they are not able to endure hunger, for the belly has no ears. Is there no other way of pacifying hungry people, than to cram powder and ball down their throats? Ah ye who riot in the midſt of plenty, little do ye know how hard it is to endure hunger. There would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mobs nor riots, provided thoſe who have more than they have occaſion for, would diſpoſe of their ſuperfluities to thoſe who are in diſtreſs. They are rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty's government who ſeek to ſtarve his people. The principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels are neareſt the purlieus of the court. His Majeſty has not better ſubjects than the manufacturing and labouring part of the people, and theſe are now obliged to ſuffer hunger—and alſo to endure the reproach of bad names. It is eaſy for a glutton of a miniſter to call his betters the ſcum of the earth, and to hire ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers to abuſe them; but what juſtice or mercy in this practice? Such behaviour to his Majeſty's beſt ſubjects, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly happen without his knowledge!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all nations are near their down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015918_0046_0F9B3D70225F35A8"/>
when their internal peace is to be kept by a ſtanding army. Mutual love is the only thing that can ſupport a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; when the one half diſtreſſes the other, and endeavours to keep them in ſubjection by force and compulſion, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution muſt inevitably follow.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when the army, under the authority of the crown, is compoſed of the worthleſs part of the community, they become a diſtinct ſociety by themſelves, and will be ready to do any ſervice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the nation; being deſtitute of all principles of honour or honeſty, for a ſmall hire, they will perform as many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and oppreſſive acts as they expect to be rewarded for; and will conſider the injuries which they do the nation, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than advantages taken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother community. Wherever ſuch an army is, they will always conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as in an enemy's country, and pay no regard to the inhabitants. They know that they are hated, and for that reaſon act towards all men as if they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Rome</hi> was firſt enſlaved by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015918_0047_0F9B3D760E86A0C0"/>
of Banditti, and ſo will <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> without ſome new regulations. Our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at preſent are compoſed of the dregs of the people, and the greateſt part of the common ſoldiers are made up of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of gaols, and the ſcourings of the kennels of cities; they are fit therefore for any dirty work that their officers may employ them in.—And a great number of the officers are diſſolute and profligate, waiting for perferment; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are ready to do any thing that a prime miniſter may order, without ſo much as paying the ſmalleſt regard to the welfare of their country.</p>
                     <p>When we had ended our altercation, the officer and the reſt of the company came to an eclairciſſement, and inſtead of repeating grievances or finding fault with one another's profeſſion, we agreed for the reſt of the journey to admit of <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,</hi> and ſuffer every one to diſſent when they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw nothing after we left <hi>Durham</hi> that was worthy of notice, till we came
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015918_0048_0F9B3D772130E320"/>
to <hi>Grantham,</hi> except fine fields of graſs and corn, which were exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.—We came into <hi>Grantham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven o'clock at night—but what we ſaw there, ſhall be the ſubject of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. The Doctrine of Steeples—The Weſt Indian —Reflections upon it.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt thing which travellers ſee in approaching to large towns, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, the <hi>church ſteeples.</hi> As they are ordinarily higher than the reſt of the buildings, they are on that account more conſpicuous. There is a pretty high ſteeple at <hi>Grantham,</hi> which ſalutes your eyes at a great diſtance before you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the town. It ſeems to be of the pyramidical kind; when we firſt perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, a queſtion was ſuggeſted to me,— and perhaps as neceſſary to be reſolved as many in the <hi>Athenian</hi> oracle.—But
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015918_0049_0F9B3D7762A01708"/>
as it belongs chiefly to the biſhops and their clergy, I will not undertake to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. It is neither mathematical, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, mechanical, logical, nor moral: it appears to me to be entirely eccleſiaſtical. For the benefit of the clergy I ſhall juſt propoſe it. What is the reaſon that the greateſt part of church ſteeples are for the moſt part built at the weſt end of churches?</p>
                     <p>If I was to build a church, but I hope I never ſhall, I ſhould certainly rear the ſteeple upon the eaſt end hereof.—For as the higheſt winds in this iſland gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally blow from the weſt, in caſe the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be blown down, the church would be ſafe:—while thoſe churches which have their ſteeples upon the weſt end, if they ſhould chance to fall by the violence of the weſt wind, would endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the whole fabric, and perhaps ſpoil the devotion of the congregation, if it ſhould fall upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> or an <hi>holy day.</hi> For this reaſon it would be right, when there is ſome mention of reforming the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015918_0050_0F9B3D78172D74D8"/>
church, to begin with reforming the ſteeples.</p>
                     <p>It muſt undoubtedly have been an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the church in antient times with regard to ſteeples, that they ſhould be all built upon the weſt end of the edifice. If this is really the caſe, it removes all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and affords a ſufficient reaſon for the practice; for as the judgment of the clergy determines the ſenſe of all things eccleſiaſtical, if it was their will to have ſteeples built in that manner, it is reaſon ſufficient. <hi>Sic voluerunt Clerici,</hi> is as good a reaſon as can be given for any article of the church. I ſhall leave the full diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this material part of church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to the biſhops and their clergy.</p>
                     <p>As the ſun was a good way up when we came to <hi>Grantham,</hi> we had ſome time to take a view of it. The captain and I went ſauntering through the town. 'Tis a pleaſant place, but the houſes are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently built.—We ſaw nothing of any conſequence to mention in this journal. After we had wandered through the town,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015918_0051_0F9B3D78E0AF62C8"/>
we came in to ſupper, when the captain took care to ſay ſome civil things to our landladyes ſiſter, who is a very handſome young woman. It was eaſy to perceive that ſhe was acquainted with thoſe civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and could diſtinguiſh between truth and falſhood. She made the captain keep his diſtance in ſuch a manner, as put an end to his civilities. The fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her perſon, and the beauty of her complexion, were joined with a modeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that protected her from the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſults which gentlemen think themſelves entitled to uſe towards a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid, which was the character ſhe acted in.</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, we were informed, that ſome of Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s ſervants were that night to exhibit in an old thatched houſe in a corner of the town. They had come abroad during the ſummer vacation, to ſee if they could find any thing to keep their grinders going till the opening of <hi>Drury-lane Theatre.</hi> They were that night to play the <hi>Weſt-Indian,</hi> with the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015918_0052_0F9B3D79A0789B58"/>
                        <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and we determined to ſee them perform. The actors played their parts very indifferently, but one could perceive as much meaning in their performance, as to be able to diſtinguiſh between an honeſt man and a rogue. I ſhould be very much afraid in perſonating the old raſcal, of a ſolicitor too often, of becoming ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than an imitation. It is not good to try experiments of this ſort often, leſt the habits of roguery ſhould become predominant. But the generality of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have little morality to loſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſcenes were tolerably good, tho' the houſe was extremely bad;—and the actors made a ſhift to go through with the play as well as could be expected. The fineſt ſight that we ſaw in this houſe, which was very crouded that night, was a fine collection of ladies and gentlemen. I queſtion if any town of the ſame ſize in <hi>England</hi> can produce ſuch a number of fine women. They were all in general both ſtately and beautiful;—not tawdry and tarniſhed like ſome fine ladies in the metropolis; nature had given them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:015918_0053_0F9B3D7A6195A418"/>
which needed no aſſiſtance from art, and their native ſimplicity greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their beauty. I was exceedingly well pleaſed to ſee ſuch a number of young men and women in good health and good ſpirits. There was no clapping during the time of the play, though I am perſuaded, had it been performed in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the actors would have been clapped continually;—but the people of <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> follow nature, and only clap when they feel. The whole of this night's work was over by eleven, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſmiſſed; when we returned to our lodging. Our time and that of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, might have been better employed, than in ſeeing a few ſtupid rogues endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imitate what ſome of them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were.</p>
                     <p>After our return I began to reflect up- the characters in the play, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſeveral actors; as I had not a play-bill, I did not know the names of the players.—He who performed the part of old <hi>Varland</hi> the ſolicitor, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act moſt naturally. It is more eaſy to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015918_0054_0F9B3D7B1C244110"/>
imitate vice than virtue, thought I; and one of the company ſuggeſted, that the player who acted old <hi>Varland</hi> muſt have been a rogue himſelf, otherwiſe he could not have entered ſo well into the ſpirit of the character.</p>
                     <p>The play itſelf has ſome good charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in it, which are tolerably well drawn; though I could wiſh for the ſake of <hi>Old England,</hi> that <hi>Fulmer</hi> and his wife had not been in it. Major <hi>O Flarherty</hi> is an excellent character, and was tolerably well ſupported, but thoſe who pretend to know the players ſay, that he who ſuſtained this character, was only an imitator of Mr. <hi>Moody.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The writer of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly drawn his characters with judgment, but it is not ſo eaſy to find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Looſe, abandoned, diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, will never be able to ſupport the characters of <hi>Stockwell</hi> and <hi>O'Flaherty</hi>; and yet the greateſt part of our players are both looſe in their ſentiments, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in their lives. Lady <hi>Ruſport</hi> is ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015918_0055_0F9B3D7BE77CBFD8"/>
a character as is fit to create abhorrence in the mind of every tender hearted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; to act ſuch a character is a taſk fit for the Devil, for no woman who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of a human being, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to act it properly, or make a good imitation. If there are any ſuch old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in <hi>England,</hi> I heartily wiſh for the honour of the nation, that they were all out of it.</p>
                     <p>Nothing pleaſed me more in the whole play, than the diſcovery which Major <hi>O'Flaherty</hi> made concering the will in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Charles Dudley.</hi> The characters of Miſs <hi>Ruſport</hi> and Miſs <hi>Dudley</hi> are well ſupported in the play, but I was not able to ſay ſo much in behalf of the actors.</p>
                     <p>The farce was intolerable, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the travelling to the <hi>Jubilee</hi> by perſons of all ranks, the performance can never afford entertainment to men of underſtanding. But it is now time to conclude this chapter, and proceed on our journey.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. A new theory of ſleep—The cauſe thereof— The anatomy of the brain—The neceſſity of taking breakfaſt—Doctor Law's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</head>
                     <p>WE left <hi>Grantham</hi> at two o'clock in the morning, which was much too ſoon, conſidering how little ſleep we had got the preceding night.—But there was no help for it,—we were under authority, and were obliged to obey. A perſon who has paid three pounds eight ſhillings and ſix pence at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for a ſeat in the ſtage-coach, will be a fool to loſe it if he can help it—But if he cannot riſe early in the morning, no one will wait upon him, or return him his money.</p>
                     <p>We were all in the coach at two,—and the driver went off as faſt as if he would have driven us to <hi>Stamford</hi> in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye. As ſoon as we were fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the town, I fell aſleep.—And perhaps you will ſay, what is that to us? what indeed.—It is nothing but what
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015918_0057_0F9B3D7D6B16F9B0"/>
every perſon does every night,—and ſometimes every day—unleſs when your lordſhips are at a maſquerade, or ſome ſuch like godly employment; and then you are obliged to turn the day into night. So far the argument is in my favour. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument! what have arguments to do with ſleep? More than ſleep has to do with arguments,—for it will hear none, when it comes upon a perſon,—but takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all his ſenſations at once, and renders him an imitation of death.</p>
                     <p>I dare venture to lay an equal wager, that there is not one who ever travelled in a ſtage-coach can tell what I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay next concerning ſleep. For all what <hi>Rohault</hi> and <hi>Boerhaave</hi> have ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, it will be eaſy to prove that they knew no more about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than one of the ſeven ſleepers.—</p>
                     <p>For in the firſt place, they never ſaw it,—in the ſecond place, they never ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it,—and in the next place, they never heard it.—Now without the aſſiſtance of ſome of theſe ſenſes, how could they
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:015918_0058_0F9B3D7E1C0AF868"/>
know what it is? It is impoſſible they could ſee it,—for it cloſes the eyes, and ſhuts the windows of the human frame. It is impoſſible they could hear it, for it makes no noiſe, and comes ſilently upon a perſon unawares.—It is impoſſible they could ſmell it, for it is no body;—and it is a very improper way of ſpeaking to ſay, that they could taſte or feel it,—for it ſeems chiefly to conſiſt of negatives. It is a ſort of want of feeling and ſenſation; for no ſooner does a man ſee, hear, feel, taſte, and ſmell, than he is awake.</p>
                     <p>If an anatomiſt were to try an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to find out the cauſe or reſidence of ſleep, he would as ſurely waken a man as ever he was wakened in his life;—and this would ſpoil the whole experiment. Now Doctors <hi>Monro, Hunter, Hewſon,</hi> and all the lecturers upon anatomy, know no more about ſleep, than a ſleeping man does.—And the reaſon is, they never ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized the brain of a ſleeping man,— till they do this, without awakening or killing him, I will not eſteem them any better judges than other people.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:015918_0059_0F9B3D7ED7EF4220"/>All we have to proceed upon is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, and the moſt probable hypotheſis muſt certainly be beſt.—</p>
                     <p>When a man is ſearching after an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, he is like one who is in ſearch of the philoſophers ſtone.—He tries this experiment, and the other experiment,— forms this propoſition, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and purſues them through all the modes and figures of logic; and when he can find nothing to ſay againſt it himſelf, he concludes that nobody elſe can, and ſo determines it to be right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rohault</hi> ſays,
<q>That ſleep conſiſts in a ſcarity of the animal ſpirits which flow into the nerves, whereby the nerves are ſhut up, and bring on ſleep.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boerhaave</hi> defines ſleep,
<q>to be that ſtate of the medulla of the brain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the nerves do not receive ſo copious, nor ſo forcible an influx of ſpirits upon the brain, as is required to enable the organs of ſenſe and voluntary motion to perform their functions.</q>
Now neither
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:015918_0060_0F9B3D80011081B8"/>
of theſe hypotheſes are certainly true.—It is all gueſs work;—and by conſidering the attributes of ſpirits, we may form ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hypotheſis entirely new.</p>
                     <p>It is the motion of the animal ſpirits which keeps us awake, by playing tricks with our nerves,—whether we conſider them as tubes or ſtrings.—If they are tubes, thoſe little ſpirits muſt blow in them like a trumpet or a pipe, and then we are kept awake by wind muſic;— if they are cords or ſtrings, then we are kept awake by vibration, by the ſpirits playing upon our nerves as upon a fiddle. As long as theſe inviſible beings are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to play upon our nerves, we are kept awake; but when they ceaſe, then we fall aſleep. Is it not then a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inference, that ſleep is no more than the ſpirits taking a reſt.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be conſidered in a <hi>ſtage-coach,</hi> is the cauſe of ſleep; and it is a very natural inference from what has been obſerved, that the cauſe of ſleep is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015918_0061_0F9B3D806CEC55F0"/>
the wearineſs of the animal ſpirits. To play conſtantly upon the fineſt of muſical inſtruments whatſoever, will produce wearineſs at laſt. It is a labour which cannot always be ſuſtained without ſome relaxation;—for which cauſe the ſpirits muſt reſt occaſionally.</p>
                     <p>Whether theſe inviſible beings reſt voluntarily or involuntarily, I will not pretend to ſay. And indeed, as I am only ſpeaking by hypotheſis, I may be ſaid to determine nothing. Nor can any perſon determine certainly how the ſpirits behave in time of ſleep, till ſome of the adepts in anatomy diſſect a ſleeping ſubject, and then we ſhall have an experiment which will afford the beſt and ſtrongeſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the higheſt degree of certainty.</p>
                     <p>It is an uneaſy circumſtance in the way of ſleep, when the foot falls aſleep firſt; for this diſguſts the reſt of the ſpirits which are performing their functions, and makes them fall foul upon the lazy ones, which give over their employment;—and in the struggle between the lazy ones and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015918_0062_0F9B3D8758FE8770"/>
thoſe which are at work, a man's leg is like to be torn to pieces.</p>
                     <p>The ſhorteſt definition of ſleep is, that "it is a God;" this was the <hi>Romans</hi> opinion of ſleep, who generally deified thoſe powers which they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for.—The <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> take the contrary method; for they will not admit of any inviſible power to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, unleſs they can perfectly account for it. Whether the <hi>Romans</hi> were wiſer than the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or not, I ſhall not ſay, but it is manifeſt they were more pious.</p>
                     <p>Be ſleep what it will, it is ſo powerful, that no perſon can reſiſt its energy;— there is a ſort of omnipotence in ſleep. It can bind philoſophers, fools, giants, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, and cowards, ſo faſt with its chains, that they will lie as ſtill as if they were dead.</p>
                     <p>As ſome phyſiologiſts have affirmed, that ſleep lodges principally in the brain, it will be neceſſary to conſider the inſide
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:015918_0063_0F9B3D89B6F97898"/>
of the <hi>human ſcull,</hi> on purpoſe to find where this deity takes up his reſidence.—</p>
                     <p>As Doctor <hi>Wallis</hi> is too tedious, and <hi>Winſlow</hi> and the reſt of anatomiſts, are too prolix to copy, I ſhall take a way of mine own, in developing the contents of the human brain-caſe.—I promiſe to make no uſe of Latin or Greek words, but ſhall endeavour to reduce the brain to pure <hi>Engliſh</hi>; for, with the leave of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I ſee no reaſon in the world why an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s brain ſhould always be rendered into Greek or Latin. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts diſſect the brain of a Roman or a Greek, they may uſe the language which that brain has been accuſtomed to, but when they touch an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s ſcull, they ought to ſpeak and write plain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will be only neceſſary to conſider the brain as far as ſleep is concerned with it.</p>
                     <p>There are in the brain two mothers; a <hi>pious,</hi> and a <hi>hard mother.</hi> Theſe take care of the ſmall veſſels, and ſerve as guardians
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:015918_0064_0F9B3D8AEB7C85C8"/>
to the veins and arteries. The pious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embraces her children in her boſom, and kindly ſupports them.—The hard or ſtrong mother, which is ſo called, becauſe ſhe defends the brain from the ſevere preſſure of the ſcull, and preſerves it from violence, is likewiſe of great ſervice to the brain in ſome other reſpects. This may be called the grand mother of the brain, —the other the true mother.</p>
                     <p>Between theſe two mothers, there is a membrane, which is called the ſpider's web.—This is deſigned for catching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, in the ſame manner that cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs catch flies. When once an idea is entangled in this ſubtil net, unleſs it is as ſtrong as a bee or a waſp, it is impoſſible it can get away again.—It muſt remain there to add to the food of the brain, till it be digeſted into a propoſition.—When two ideas are catched here, they make a a propoſition, but if three happen to be apprehended, then they form a ſyllogiſm in the brain.</p>
                     <p>Were it not for this ſpider's web, ideas
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:015918_0065_0F9B3D8BA70C5298"/>
would fly as faſt out of the brain as they come into it, and then the human ſcull would be as void of underſtanding, as when the brain is taken out.—Anatomiſts tell us, that this ſpider's web is ſituated at the back part of the forehead, upon the hinder part of the head.</p>
                     <p>This intellectual trap is not in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the ſame,—for in ſome brains it catches the ideas, of points, lines, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, triangles, ſquares, circles, cones, and cylinders. In others it lays hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ideas, of ſpirits, and all things which are inviſible.—The firſt collection of ideas conſtitutes a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> the latter a <hi>Metaphyſician.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſome, this brain-trap catches no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ideas of verſes, and articles of poetry:—Gods and Goddeſſes, flames and darts, are ſtowed ſo thick, that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one idea of common ſenſe can get li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enter. A brain filled with this ſort of materials, makes the brain of a <hi>poet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:015918_0066_0F9B3D8C585585D0"/>When the idea of gain is catched in this cob-web, it infallibly makes a man a <hi>Merchant,</hi> and renders him covetous: from hence proceed flattery, diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deceit.</p>
                     <p>In ſome, the ideas of places and penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are crouded thick in this ſpider's web, which make them betray their country, and take ſides with every dirty adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
                     <p>To explain the human brain more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly till we come to the reſidence of ſleep.—Conſider, it is divided into the upper and lower, or the fore and hinder part.—Theſe two are ſeparated by the ſecond protuberance of the <hi>hard mother.</hi> The upper ſide of the fore part of the brain is divided into two hemiſpheres; and its lower ſide into four lobes, two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and two behind—the latter are the largeſt. Where theſe four meet, there is a funnel, which reaches from the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the brain into the ſpitting gland,— which gland is ſeated upon the Turk's chair. Behind the funnel two ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015918_0067_0F9B3D8D1D902D20"/>
appear, called the two white protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances. Between the two hemiſpheres of the fore part of the brain, ſomewhat lower than the <hi>windings about,</hi> there is a white body called the <hi>callous body.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this callous body lie the <hi>ſuperior</hi> and ſide bellies, which are divided into right and left by a thin membrane, called the <hi>bright encloſure,</hi> which reaches between the callous body and the arch. This arch is a marrowy body; it has its riſe from the fore part of theſe little bellies, with two roots which join together, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards the back part, they divide into parts called the legs of the arch. In the baſis of theſe two little bellies, are four heights;—the two foremoſt are called the furrowed bodies, the other two go by the name of the beds of the eye nerves. Beyond theſe, there are two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections called the <hi>buttocks,</hi> and under them, two called the <hi>witneſſes.</hi> Above the buttocks, there is a gland called the <hi>pine-apple,</hi> where ſome have alledged the ſoul reſides.—But this I leave to the learned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:015918_0068_0F9B3D8DF82A72D0"/>Upon the beds of the eye nerves, there are a number of blood veſſels, glands and water ducts, called <hi>the work in form of a chorus.</hi> Under the beginning of the <hi>arch,</hi> is a ſmall hole, called the <hi>bore,</hi> or paſſage to the <hi>feet of the arch,</hi> or <hi>the way to the funnel</hi>; and under the middle of the <hi>arch</hi> there is one called the <hi>back-hole,</hi> which is covered with a valve, called the great val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve. The ſpace under the two foremoſt bellies, between the holes and the hinder part of the brain, is the third belly.—So much for the fore part of the brain.</p>
                     <p>The hinder part, is ſituated under the ſecond proceſs of the <hi>hard mother,</hi> and the fourth little belly is diſcovered by divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this part of the brain lengthways.— The extremity of this, goes by the name of the <hi>writer's quill.</hi> Here are two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bodies, called <hi>little feet,</hi> which are the baſis of the under part of the brain. The marrowy part in this corner of the brain, branches out like a plant.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſtance of the brain is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the outer and inner,—the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015918_0069_0F9B3D8EA0670758"/>
one <hi>barky, aſhy,</hi> or <hi>gland-like</hi>—the other <hi>marrowy, white,</hi> or <hi>nervous.</hi> There is likewiſe in the brain, the marrow which is longer than it is broad, or the <hi>oblong marrow</hi>;—it appears in two bodies, from the former part of the hindermoſt lobes of the brain. Theſe two bodies are called the legs of the oblong marrow. When they are joined, they form an iſthmus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this is an eminence, which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the name of the <hi>ring proceſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſpinal marrow</hi> is another thing contained within the human brain-caſe. It is a production of the oblong marrow, and paſſes through the great bore of the ſcull, and the channel of the ſpine; it enlarges about the laſt joint of the back bone, and the firſt of the neck, where the large nerves branch off to the arms; it enlarges in the loins, where the leg nerves begin.—The lower end thereof, with thoſe and other nerves, is called the <hi>horſe's tail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall not proceed any farther in the deſcription of the brain, but enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015918_0070_0F9B3D8F5F1A14F8"/>
ſleep reſides in any of theſe parts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned,—or whether it may not take up its reſidence in any other part of the body.</p>
                     <p>The moſt probable conjecture that I can think of, is, that as all the ſpirits ſeem to originate in the oblong marrow, and paſs through the great bore of the ſcull into the ſpinal marrow, whereby all the nerves are ſupplied with ſpirits, either <hi>to blow in them like tubes,</hi> or <hi>to beat upon them like fiddle-ſtrings</hi>; ſo ſleep takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this ſally-port, and ſtops theſe little inviſible beings from iſſuing forth; and on this account the body ceaſes to perform its uſual functions.—If any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon knows more concerning this ſubject, they are welcome to the diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>After a perſon in perfect health has travelled two ſtages in a ſtage-coach, even ſuppoſe he ſhould take a nap, he will find himſelf diſpoſed for his breakfaſt at the end of the ſecond ſtage.—This is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the purpoſe of keeping the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſtrong, to beat off ſleep from his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;—if

a traveller deſire to keep awake, he muſt take his breakfaſt to ſtrengthen his ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>There are only two ways to keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon awake, when he ſees no viſible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;—either to make him very hungry, and then the ſpirits will turn frantic and fight ſleep,—or to take all the reaſonable ſupplies which nature requires to ſupport them in a regular manner.</p>
                     <p>As the animal ſpirits are reſtrained from their uſual exerciſe by ſleep,—and as theſe inviſible beings have been diſcovered to act in matter, ſo Dr. <hi>Law</hi> and others have conjectured that the rational ſpirit muſt alſo fall into a ſtate of inactivity, as ſoon as the organs of ſenſation are unfitted for the ſoul to act upon. When therefore the ſyſtem of ſenſation fails, the action of the ſoul (which they conſider to depend as much upon the ſenſes, as waking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the free exerciſe of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits) ceaſes, till a new ſyſtem of ſenſations be reſtored to it.—And there is no certainty from any principles of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015918_0072_0F9B3D90D60A1700"/>
that ever there ſhall be any more cogitation, if the ſoul fall aſleep at death.</p>
                     <p>This is but a dreary idea, and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy cannot help us out of this gloomy difficulty. If the human ſoul falls aſleep at death, and Dr. <hi>Law</hi> has aſſured us that it will; there is no certainty that ever it ſhall wake again.—Be thankful ye children of wickedneſs! there is no pain or puniſhment in the next ſtate. Ye ſhall all ſleep as ſound as a top through all eternity, when all former actions ſhall be quite forgotten. This is Dr. <hi>Law's ſpiritual opium,</hi> of which I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in this chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. A peep at London—A conjecture—The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial interview.</head>
                     <p>IN a fine ſummer afternoon, when you come over <hi>Highgate-Hill,</hi> you may ſee <hi>London.</hi>—In a ſtage-coach you have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:015918_0073_0F9B3D922007A560"/>
a peep at it. There is, ſaid I, a nation of ſteeples in <hi>London.</hi>—It muſt be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful holy place, there are ſo many churches in it.—The ſun ſhone upon the windows, and what we ſaw appeared to advantage.—It is a very fine place to be ſure, otherwiſe there would not ſo many go to it.</p>
                     <p>The fields between <hi>Highgate</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> are naturally pleaſant, but they were now parched for want of rain, not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſhower had fallen around <hi>London</hi> for ſix weeks—the fields were burnt up, and there did not appear to be a morſel of graſs for either horſe or cow. It brought the days of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the prophet to my mind, and the caſe of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The officer ſaid, "the rain came down where it pleaſed."—Nay, ſaid one of the ladies—"where God pleaſes."—The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was right—I expected that there would have been a diſpute about Providence— but the officer yielded.—</p>
                     <p>The lady had the better of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—What
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015918_0074_0F9B3D926D1D4548"/>
place is <hi>London,</hi> thought I to myſelf—It is a large place—a rich place—and a wicked place; it was all conjecture, for I never ſaw it before. "What ſort of a place is St. <hi>James</hi>'s?" It is the King's palace—"Do we ſee it yet" ſaid I to our companions? they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, no.</p>
                     <p>I proceeded in my conjectures.—
<q>Perhaps <hi>London</hi> is four times as large as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>
                        </q>
—it is ten times as large— it is far too large.
<q>Is it a walled town? are the walls high?</q>
There are no walls at all.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of my conjectures we reached <hi>London</hi>—We are in the city now, ſaid I,—not yet replied the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who had a mind to contradict me. This is only the weſt part of the town— you muſt paſs <hi>Temple-bar</hi> before you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the city. I did not mind that diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—it is all city, ſaid I to myſelf— The coach ſtopped—we are in <hi>Holborn</hi> now, ſays the ladies—we muſt get out, ſaid the officer. And ſo we did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:015918_0075_0F9B3D9716E436D8"/>The reſt of the company in the coach, went each their own way to their friends; but I being a ſtranger, continued all night in the inn where we alighted.</p>
                     <p>I had not been two minutes out of the coach, when I was ſurrounded by ſixteen intimate acquaintance. When a perſon is in a ſtrange place, the ſight of a friend has more effect, than on other occaſions. I thought myſelf at home, and ſat down. After enquiring concerning one another's welfare, all my acquaintance went away, except four. Our company now conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a clergyman, two ſons of clergymen, and a doctor of phyſic. We called for ſome London beer, and drank the health of our friends in the north.—People may be happy any where, provided they do not make themſelves miſerable. We part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good time.—My friends went to their lodgings, and I went to bed.</p>

                     <p>THE people in <hi>London</hi> are vaſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet to thoſe who bring money with them, and aſk nothing from them.— They naturally ſuppoſe, that thoſe who come only for a few weeks, have no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to aſk, and are very glad to ſee them. They are ſometimes miſtaken, for thoſe who come from the country have their own ends in viſiting the metropolis; and more come with a view to advantage, than merely for pleaſure. Pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined pleaſures are not to be met with in large cities. They may be enjoyed in greater perfection in the country.</p>
                     <p>When a ſtranger comes into ſuch a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>London,</hi> he will naturally conſider the characters of the inhabitants; but if he was as wiſe as <hi>Solomon,</hi> he could not deſcribe the character of the <hi>Londoners.</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:015918_0077_0F9B3D9A4514C418"/>
They are not of one, but a thouſand cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. Some are civil and kind; ſome are rude and uncivil;—others are haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome are humble.—<hi>London</hi> is an abridgment of the world—whatever is ſaid of the world, may be ſaid of it.— I wiſh there was no reaſon to ſay, that it lies in wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>London</hi> is a place of trade; the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are chiefly engaged in buſineſs; but if it was not ſupplied from the country, in half a century it would be very thin of people. Thoſe that are born in <hi>London,</hi> are generally weak and puny, and thoſe who come to reſide in it, grow every day weaker than they were when they came to it.—It is the ſame in all large towns.</p>
                     <p>Compliments are carried to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this great city; I wiſh honeſty was carried as far; but it is impoſſible for honeſty to ſtay where there is much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—This is no reproach to <hi>London,</hi> for <hi>Babylon, Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and company takes away the edge of reproach.—Mankind ſeldom are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:015918_0078_0F9B3D9AAFCCDCB8"/>
while they have multitudes to keep them in countenance.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coachmen</hi> in <hi>London</hi> are honeſt, and the reaſon is, they dare not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; there is a law which enjoins puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, if they fail in point of honeſty.—Forced honeſty is better than none; for though it does no good to ſuch as are honeſt for fear of puniſhment, yet it does good to the community—The gallows is good for ſome purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>London,</hi> as in all great towns, noble actions are oftner done through oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than from a principle of truth; but as this city is compoſed of a great variety of characters, this motive is ſtronger or weaker, according to the habits which individuals have acquired before they came there, or the influence which cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom has upon the tempers of particular characters.</p>
                     <p>The merchants in <hi>London</hi> have the art of ſetting off all things to the beſt advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; the goods in their ſhops are full as
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:015918_0079_0F9B3D9B621FFA28"/>
good as thoſe in their warehouſes. If they are not better, nobody can blame them.—A trader always makes the beſt of his window; and if it were not for the fine windows, the <hi>Printſellers</hi> might ſhut up their ſhops. It is not ſafe, however, to ſtop to look at their windows; for they are too often crouded with thieves,— and you are in danger of having your pockets picked.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bookſeller</hi>'s ſhop is the bank of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; for none elſe in <hi>London</hi> pay the leaſt regard to genius. They endeavour, however, to ſerve themſelves firſt, by making a good bargain,—and they may be ſaid to live upon the brains of authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cheapſide</hi> is one of the fineſt places in the city, but if there were fewer ſhops in it, there would be more trade; it ſeems to be over-ſtocked, which impoveriſhes the merchants; the buſineſs of the linen draper ſeems to be paſt its meridian.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Barbers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> are all ſabbath breakers; they ſhave and dreſs upon the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:015918_0080_0F9B3D9C2C8523F8"/>
                        <hi>Sunday,</hi> when the people will let them, which is generally as often as they come. The ſhop-keepers have adopted the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caroni</hi> heads, and are at as much pains with their heads, as with their ſhops. If they endeavoured to mend their hearts, they would find the advantage of it; for it would be a means of keeping them from cheating, to which they have many temptations.</p>
                     <p>The weſt end of the town conſiſts chiefly of idle people, who have nothing to do, and on that account are prone to do ill. The principal manufacturers of vices lodge there; and it would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for London if nobody had any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with them.—But then the ſuperfluities would not ſell; they are therefore obliged to encourage ſin for the ſake of trade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. James's Park</hi> is a very fine place, but I have ſeen an hundred as fine places in the country. Remove the King's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and the court twenty miles from it, and it would be no better than many other fields about London.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:015918_0081_0F9B3D9CE1F859A0"/>When I came to <hi>London,</hi> I thought the plague had been in the city, or the King was dead; for all the people had diſtreſs in their countenances. Melancholy had overſpread the town, but raged moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Exchange. The <hi>bulls</hi> and <hi>bears,</hi> like the dogs in <hi>Homer,</hi> were firſt ſeized with this plague, which began in <hi>Change Alley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So ſtrong was the force of this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that it was fit to briſtle the beard of a <hi>Jew.</hi> One would have thought that the whole town had juſt come from the tabernacle, or had been within a few paces of purgatory; the muſcles of their faces were ſo ſeverely diſtorted, that they looked as if they had ſeen an apparition, or had been frightened by the Devil. The poor rogues who were going to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, did not ſeem more concerned than the Gentry upon the Exchange.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this appeared to be, that they had not laid up their treaſure in heaven, but had given it into the hands of the banker; who inſtead of returning
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:015918_0082_0F9B3D9DA5AF6278"/>
them their own with uſury, had hidden their talents in the earth, ſo that none of them could find their money, but loſt both ſtock and intereſt.—</p>
                     <p>This was the cauſe of their melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the banker had run off with their God, and what had they more? In <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the fall of the ſtocks, or the failure of a banking-houſe, is more ſeverely felt than the ſtings of an ill conſcience, or the pangs of remorſe. Where one man hangs or drown himſelf from a religious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ten jump into the <hi>Thames</hi> for fear of poverty, or from grief through the loſs of money.</p>
                     <p>Of all perſons and claſſes whatſoever, there are probably the feweſt bankers that go to heaven; and yet banking is the only way to it.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour commands all his diſciples to "lay up their treaſure in heaven;" this is their true bank; and
<q>where their treaſure is, there will their hearts be alſo.</q>
Therefore the only way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:015918_0083_0F9B3D9E7780CD20"/>
mens minds to the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, is to lay up their treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I was lead to this reflection, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving on the Exchange almoſt all the people in the country, who had intruſted their money in the hands of city bankers, cloſely attending to look after their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.—How hard is it for rich men to be ſaved? It is impoſſible—Impoſſible to every created power—It is a mercy it is not impoſſible to God!—It is a maxim which will hold in general, though there are ſome exceptions againſt it, that <hi>thoſe who have moſt money, have leaſt mercy.</hi>— If it were not ſo, there would be few poor and diſtreſſed people.—Thoſe who give to the poor, lay up their treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and can never looſe their money, if the Scriptures are true.—But what have the Scriptures to do in obſervations upon <hi>London</hi>? what indeed! Scripture will not ſell; it is a ſtale commodity, and does not anſwer to the bookſellers.—We ſhall paſs it over then, and conclude this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHAT a great number of fine win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows is there in <hi>London</hi>?—but they are as well paid for—the tax upon window-light comes high. The poor as well as rich feel this impoſition. We talk of <hi>Liberty,</hi> but when we have not the free uſe of light, it does not look as if we were very free. The wiſdom of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature is not to be queſtioned, but it is hard to lay ſuch a heavy tax upon what nobody can want. It ſmells rank of either diſtreſs in the government, or a deſign to oppreſs. We muſt charitably ſuppoſe the firſt, for to ſuppoſe the latter would be to blame the miniſtry, which muſt not be allowed.—It is, and it pleaſe your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, very hard for poor people not to have liberty to peep at the Sun, the moon, or the ſtars, without a prodigious expence. But how can it be helped? If it pleaſed his Majeſty and his Miniſters, to lay the tax
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:015918_0085_0F9B3D9FE9E03700"/>
upon painted ladies and looſe women— There are perhaps as many in <hi>London</hi> as there are windows,—or if there are fewer, advance the taxation.</p>
                     <p>But this would be ſtill hard upon the town—The ſhop-keepers would not be able to keep miſtreſſes, and the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would have to pay as well as the reſt, which would not be fair. However, there is no fairneſs in taxing light—for it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and no perſon can want it who have eyes to ſee.—Suppoſe a perſon was to chuſe to live in a houſe without windows, there is reaſon to fear they would tax his door, or lay an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition upon his darkneſs, for his candles are taxed already. There is ſomething unjuſt alſo in the mode of taxing win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,—the <hi>quantity of light,</hi> and not the number of windows ſhould be taxed. There are ſome windows as large as ten, why is not the tax in proportion? Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion advances by a gradual motion.— <hi>Ovid</hi> tells us that the world was once a common.—
<q>
                           <pb n="89" facs="unknown:015918_0086_0F9B3DA0A85299F0"/>

                     <p>The ground was as free as the ſun and the air.—But now the world is divided, and the light and the air taxed;—and the diviſions are not very equal, nor the taxes very light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> in a fine ſummer day, is a place of great concourſe;—a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of heads are to be ſeen in the ſtreets, and they are all taxed.—They muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bring a great ſum of money to ſome place or other, and fill ſome peoples purſes.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there are ſeven hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand heads in <hi>London,</hi> which pay two-pence a piece; this will amount to five thouſand eight hundred and twenty three pounds.—A goodly ſum for liberty for men to uſe their heads. This to be ſure is for the good church, which ought not to be grudged.—But then there is alſo two-pence for ſmoke, and fourpence for
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:015918_0087_0F9B3DA15A2C1A90"/>
bread and wine at <hi>Eaſter.</hi>—All this will make near eleven thouſand nine hundred and ſixty-ſix pounds; for which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no ſatisfaction, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no real advantage.</p>
                     <p>Some will be ready to ſmell <hi>Atheiſm</hi> from this reflection, and cry
<q>the church is in danger.</q>
—And ſhe ought to be in danger, when ſhe devours ſo much money which might be better applied. Ah! theſe petitioners will never reſt till they bring in a <hi>root and branch petition</hi>; and where is the harm of that? People in theſe dear times are obliged to take all methods to ſave money. And if it pleaſe your reverences, you would do the ſame thing yourſelves, provided the Lord would turn it to your intereſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Police</hi> in <hi>London</hi> is very good, and the government of the watermen on the river <hi>Thames</hi> is alſo tolerable.—No perſon will impoſe upon you, provided you know the rules, and put them in mind of the laws. The coach-hire is all ſettled, and ſo exactly, that a few yards will bring you
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:015918_0088_0F9B3DA39162D9F8"/>
in for one ſix-pence more.—There is no <hi>free grace</hi> among coachmen—you muſt pay for every inch of your way.</p>
                     <p>The city of <hi>London</hi> is full of lamps at night, and the watch is ſet at eight o'clock, and continues till the morning light. The watch-men in <hi>London</hi> are the moſt inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant creatures I ever ſaw.—Some of them are ſcarcely able to walk—a great number of them are old ſuperannuated perſons, who can only ſit in a box, and look at thoſe who paſs by.—And if there is any truth in reports, there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them kept in pay by the ladies of the town. Thoſe who keep good hours in <hi>London,</hi> are in no danger; as for others they muſt abide the conſequences. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the largeneſs of the place, and the great concourſe of people, <hi>London</hi> is better than could be well expected. Any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may live very happy in <hi>London,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they have money, and are diſpoſed to live peaceably—and if they are inclined to do buſineſs, they may have wherewith to live upon.</p>

                     <p>It is needleſs to ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s church is five hundred feet in length, and from the marble pavement to the croſs on the top of the cupola, three hundred and forty feet high.—It is both high enough, and long enough, in all conſcience.</p>
                     <p>What is very remarkable in this large conſecrated pile of building, there is but a ſmall part of it devoted for public worſhip. The reſt is a lobby for people to divert
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:015918_0090_0F9B3DA45C168188"/>
themſelves in, and for looſe people to make aſſignations. There is a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this church, and a choir of ſingers, who ſing tolerably well, but not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Public worſhip is performed here in ſuch a manner, as any ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would believe that the worſhippers were infidels. The perſons concerned, appear either no way intereſted in their acts of devotion, or divert themſelves during the time in a ſcandalous manner. They would play a <hi>comedy</hi> better than perform religious worſhip—Indeed their whole performance has more the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a farce, than devotion. Public worſhip is alſo but ill attended here;— except thoſe whoſe livings depend upon their religion.—Scarcely any elſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, except ſtrangers who come out of curioſity. If ſtrangers were to judge of the truth of religion, from the behaviour of thoſe who profeſs it in this place, they would certainly conclude, that it was a fiction, and of no real ſervice to mankind.</p>
                     <p>There are a few door-keepers who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>church</hi> to ſale every day in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:015918_0091_0F9B3DA520EA21D8"/>
the year.—You cannot have the privilege of ſeeing the gallery or the ſteeple, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying at every door you approach. What one ſees, is well worth the money; but it appears mean for chriſtians to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute their church for gain. In the very time of divine ſervice, you may have the attendance of a church officer, to ſhew you all the curioſities about the cathedral.</p>
                     <p>Upon the top of the ſteeple, you have a fine view of <hi>London.</hi>—I know no place where it is ſo well ſeen at one view. The houſes appear from hence to be ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant huts, and the people like pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The <hi>whiſpering gallery</hi> is a great curioſity,—you can hear a man who is ſo kind as to give you an abſtract of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of this church in whiſpers, at a great diſtance, when you would think that he was ſpeaking very loud.—But thoſe who have read <hi>Maitland</hi>'s hiſtory of <hi>London</hi> will need no information concerning this building.</p>
                     <p>This cathedral is a grand piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, and <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> deſerved a patent for building churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:015918_0092_0F9B3DA5FADDFDF8"/>It is reckoned a great meanneſs for a perſon to be in <hi>London,</hi> and not to viſit the court, and ſee the King.—I was under a neceſſity to avoid this imputation, to take a trip to the court to ſee their majeſties. The ideas of thoſe who have never ſeen a court, nor have had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing crowned heads, are ready to make them too ſanguine in their expectations.—The ſtories which they read in news-papers concerning his <hi>ſacred Majeſty,</hi> their <hi>Highneſſes the Princes of the blood,</hi>—and the <hi>honourable Secretaries of State,</hi> make them expect to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very extraordinary.—They are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imagine, that kings and queens are not like other men and women, but of an higher rank of beings.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty and the Queen came from <hi>Kew</hi> about half paſt one o'clock, and I watched carefully to have a peep at them in their coming out of the coach. I was in as good a ſituation as could be wiſhed for.—I no ſooner ſaw his Majeſty, than the old maxim in the law of <hi>England</hi> came to my remembrance, <hi>that the King
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:015918_0093_0F9B3DA6A055B1D8"/>
can do no wrong.</hi>—I am ſure, ſaid I to myſelf, if the King cannot, the Queen will not do any wrong. She ſeemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well pleaſed, and appeared to ſmile upon the ſpectators with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of affability.—I wiſhed that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had done the ſame. Whether the little wag the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> had been calling <hi>Wilkes and Liberty</hi> that morning or not, and had diſpleaſed our <hi>gracious Sovereign,</hi> I will not pretend to ſay,— but I thought he ſeemed not to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I wiſhed him his health, and a long proſperous reign—but he did not hear me, for I ſaid it inwardly. <hi>Vive le Roi,</hi> thought I again, and may his Majeſty have cauſe to be better pleaſed the next time I come to ſee him.</p>
                     <p>There were none there, that wiſhed him greater proſperity than I did.—Firſt, I wiſhed, that he might be preſerved from the bad advice of all ſelfiſh miniſters.— Secondly, that he might always live and reign in the eſteem of his people.—Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might always be, and ſeem well pleaſed, when his ſubjects came to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:015918_0094_0F9B3DA79EE38050"/>
ſee him.—And, laſtly, that his Queen and his family might proſper, and that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> might never want a prince of the <hi>Brunſwick</hi> line, who was both able and willing to rule the nation according to the laws of the conſtitution. If theſe are bad wiſhes, I am ready to beg his Majeſty's pardon.</p>
                     <p>Having ſtood a little at the door, we at laſt went up to the lobby, to ſee the great people paſs along to pay their reſpects to their Majeſties, where we ſaw the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>France, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> They were juſt like other men, only they had more ſervants, and aſſumed a great deal of ſtate.</p>
                     <p>There were ſome poor noblemen, and a number of penſioners, who came alſo to make their court to his Majeſty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to have their ſalaries enlarged, or at leaſt continued.—By all means let them have ſome ſmall matters.—I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the thought of ſending away beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars without giving them ſomething.— But if it pleaſe your Majeſty, thought I
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:015918_0095_0F9B3DA814AFAF50"/>
to myſelf, keep them out of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and do not lead them into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to betray the intereſts of their country.—Seeing they are beggars, do not place them upon horſeback, leſt they ride to the —. If beggars have wherewith to live upon—there is no reaſon why they ſhould <hi>rule a nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing which I was fond to obſerve, was the ladies of the court.— What a falling off was here! except her Majeſty, there was not one that was worth the looking at. The famous Miſs <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was there, the ſiſter of the chaſte la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Groſvenor.</hi> I had heard of her being the toaſt of the town, and the ſtar of the court.—But one of the ladies of <hi>Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> would outſhine a regiment of ſuch beauties. People indeed differ in their opinion; courtiers do not follow nature, but plain people do. A painted woman may pleaſe a courtier, which a clown would deſpiſe. A fine woman will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver improve at court, unleſs ſhe imitate the Queen.—There was more of nature
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:015918_0096_0F9B3DAB820ED330"/>
and plain ſimplicity in her Majeſty, than about any woman I ſaw in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was a very droll ſort of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which had come to court among the reſt, I could not learn her name, but ſhe had all the appearance of a <hi>London Doll,</hi> with a death's head upon it: Her eyes were ſunk in her head, her noſe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and inclined at the end like the bill of a kite; her cheeks were ſticking to the bone, her teeth were too large for her lips, her chin was peaked like the ſnout of a pig, and her brow was furrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wrinkles.—She had, however, a very large fardingal, and was dreſſed like a girl of eighteen,—for which cauſe I took her for an old maid. My compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and I thought that we had enough of the court for one day, and ſo we came away.</p>
                     <p>After walking four or five miles in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in a hot ſummer's day, thirſt is ready to ſcorch a man's jaws.—A draught of porter is of great ſervice on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—We left the King, the Queen,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:015918_0097_0F9B3DADF57885B8"/>
and the court, and went into the firſt beer-houſe we could ſee. A draught of beer had a good effect upon us; it refreſhed our ſpirits, and put us in trim for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We were as happy with our porter, as any of the court could poſſibly be with Madeira or Champaigne. It was very good, and we were very thirſty, which made us reliſh it the better.</p>
                     <p>We proceeded in our way together.— My friend would have called a coach, but I was determined to have none.—Two ſhillings in <hi>London</hi> is as well in a man's own pocket, as in that of a coachman. Money is always neceſſary, and
<q>two ſhillings may be of ſervice another time,</q>
ſaid I to my companion.</p>
                     <p>We parted and I went on to <hi>Hackney.</hi> It was by this time three o'clock, and I began to wiſh earneſtly for my dinner. I had no occaſion to wiſh when I came there; it was as ready as I could have wiſhed it. I was engaged to dine with a clergyman there, who entertained me very kindly, and with a great deal of hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="unknown:015918_0098_0F9B3DAE7A9D14C8"/>Mr. <hi>S—ns</hi> is a perſon who loves his friend, and is altogether undiſguiſed in his friendſhip. Without that needleſs ceremony, which is often ſubſtituted in the room of ſincerity, you receive a kind welcome, which you cannot miſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be real. Mrs. <hi>S—ns</hi> at firſt ſight, inſures you of a good welcome, and without uſing a number of needleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, expreſſes the beſt breeding with the beſt of hearts.—Here you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive dignity without pride, hoſpitality without vanity, joy without levity, and ſincerity without diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>I had not been ten minutes in this houſe, before I forgot that I was from home, and behaved with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as if I had been ſeven years acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is ſomething in real friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is irreſiſtible, and gains the heart inſenſibly. Any perſon who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the feelings of friendſhip, will ſoon feel its ſympathy, and perceive its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hackney,</hi> in ſummer, is a ſort of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:015918_0099_0F9B3DAEEC16DD80"/>
and I am very glad of it, for the ſake of this worthy family, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw before. There are pleaſant fields, fine walks, and pure air. May the ſun ſhine with his benign beams, and the rain fall in its proper ſeaſon upon this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant place! And may my hoſpitable cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman be never worſe, but always better, than the laſt time I ſaw him!</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. A meeting of the Clergy at the <hi>King's-head Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Poultry</hi>—The firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a great Entertainment.</head>
                     <p>THERE happened to be an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of miniſters met for prayer at <hi>Founders-hall,</hi> upon a very ſpecial occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The intention of this meeting, was, to aſk the favour of Heaven for a bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a ſeminary for training up young men for the miniſtry. This is a ſort of a monthly ſolemnity, and is ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a good dinner. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:015918_0100_0F9B3DAF9961D550"/>
by a friend to attend this meeting, which I did, both as to the praying and the dining part. We had abundance of both.</p>
                     <p>The prayers were begun before I came, but I was in time to hear three long prayers, and a tedious dull ſermon. There are ſome miniſters in <hi>London,</hi> pretend to have a great intimacy with the ſpirit, but from what I heard, it did not appear that they were more acquainted, than their neighbours. The ſermons which I heard from ſome of them, were indigeſted rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodies, deſtitute of ſentiment, and crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abſurdities. They made exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly free with the Scriptures, in applying them to caſes quite beſide their purpoſes. A myſtic jargon, which might have ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the days of <hi>John Dun Scotus,</hi> made up the greateſt part of their diſcourſes, and their prayers were compoſed of irreverend addreſſes to the Deity, concerning things of very little importance. A ſhameful particularizing of individual perſons, and of things, which appeared to be intended rather as flattery to their hearers, than ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn addreſſes to God Almighty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:015918_0101_0F9B3DB3DFD517F8"/>One thing appeared very ſtrange. The miniſter from the pulpit thought it no ſhame to ſound his own praiſes, and ſpeak to his own commendation, in a manner that no modeſt perſon could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do without ſhame, or hear without bluſhing. A miniſter muſt be far gone in the practice of hypocriſy and ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, before he can have the face to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf before a public audience. It is impoſſible that any man can have a good meaning, when he commends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>After we had been a long time in the meeting houſe, we at laſt retired to the tavern; where the devotion was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a good dinner, and the Sermon waſhed down with a good glaſs. We all were entertained at the expence of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, where the devotion was performed, and made kindly welcome by a few very decent laymen. The maſter of the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy ſat at the head of the table, and our entertainment was opened with a pretty long grace;—all hands ſoon made the beſt uſe of their time, till their appetites
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:015918_0102_0F9B3DB4D99725C0"/>
were fully ſatisfied; when two or three toaſts went round, and every man drank what he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>A little tartar of a parſon, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeemed to be ſcandalized with the dreſſes of ſome of the lay-brethren, though his own was very ſpruce, and his fingers covered with rings, began an oration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſinfulneſs of tye-wigs.
<q>Such ornaments (he ſaid) were inconſiſtent with the profeſſion which they made, and in the days of the <hi>puritans</hi> would not have been allowed.—But now the times were bad, and ſin abounded to a great pitch.</q>
A waggiſh young doctor who was preſent, could ſcarcely keep his gravity, when the diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tails of wigs was begun, which greatly chagrined the little parſon. The lay gentlemen ſaid ſome ſenſible things in defence of their wigs, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the better of the argument. I did not chuſe to interfere in this <hi>religious diſpute,</hi> any farther than by aſking this enemy of tailed wigs,
<q>whether the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality of a wig lay in the tail there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</q>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:015918_0103_0F9B3DB4E7F01348"/>
—The queſtion raiſed a little laughter at the expence of the parſon.</p>
                     <p>As there was nothing to pay, every man had liberty to go when he pleaſed, ſo the gentleman who introduced me, and the waggiſh doctor, bade them adieu, and came away.</p>
                     <p>Upon the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I was invited to an entertainment at the <hi>Nag's-head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet,</hi> where a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of miniſters were met to celebrate the acceſſion of <hi>George</hi> the Firſt, to the throne of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> They had a ſermon before they met here, but I was not preſent to hear it.</p>
                     <p>The complexion of this meeting of clergy, was different from that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer—they ſeemed to be pleaſed with one another, and ſhewed all the marks of true friendſhip.—When dinner was over, and the toaſts gone round two gentlemen enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us with two ſongs; "the glorious firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>" and "the Roaſt Beef of <hi>Old England</hi>;" and I dare ſay that few
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:015918_0104_0F9B3DB5A2977FD0"/>
in <hi>England</hi> could have ſung it better. There was no diſpute concerning wigs in this aſſembly, but every perſon was a friend to another.—The reverend gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who preached the ſermon, was a chearful old man, and with the gravity of the divine, mixed the chearfulneſs of the friend and companion ſo well, that he ſeemed to be an amiable character. This entertainment was carried on with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ended with joy.—So, Reader,</p>
