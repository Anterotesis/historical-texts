            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails to a high degree in all large ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, might be conſiderably leſſened by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them encouragement to enter into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occupations which are ſuitable to them. An appeal ſhould be made to the delicacy and the prudence of ladies of fortune, not to employ any but their own ſex, as milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and as ſtay-makers. A man twirling a cap, or bending a pair of ſtays, ſhould be an object of ridicule, becauſe he is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of miſchief. He does harm by taking the bread from thoſe who cannot get it but by ſuch means, while he can get it by innumerable other means. Women, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think might be employed in many more occupations than are uſually given to them.<note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſome good obſervations on Schools of Induſtry for girls in a valuable little work, by Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, called "The Economy of Charity." See from page 61 to page 80.</note> Some think their modeſty might be hurt in taking meaſure for a ſuit of clothes. They might, however, ſew the clothes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as is the cuſtom in ſome places, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were cut out by the tailor. The
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032001_0003_0FF09DC1F2442A00"/>making ſtuff ſhoes for their own ſex, might not be an improper employment for women. Some of the Dutch and Germans who ſettle in America; make their daughters do ſeveral parts of the work of their farms, even as far as ploughing. The work of a farm might be thought by ſome too laborious an occupation for women; but the advantages ariſing from thus employing women might be very conſiderable. It might be of great uſe to agriculture, as well as to the women themſelves, by giving them health and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Fothergill, in his excellent Treatiſe on Health and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity, recommends the being a conſiderable part of the day in the open air.</note> and by preventing their living in large cities (which are very miſchievous to a country) where, through the want of bread, they might be tempted to proſtitution.</p>
            <p>The beſt preſervative, however, from the proſtitution of women, eſpecially of the lower claſs, may conſiſt in the inſtitution of Firſt-day or Sunday ſchools. If you are ſo fortunate as to give people a ſincere regard for Chriſtianity, you will make them chaſte. There are ſome who talk of the morality of the Deiſts. I can ſafely ſay, however, though I have known many Deiſts, that I ſcarcely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew one moral character among them. It is the conſtant delight of almoſt very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032001_0004_0FF09DC74B758860"/>to ridicule that chaſtity which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Chriſtians. St. Paul, by what he ſays in the 24th verſe of the 1ſt chapter of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Romans, and in what he ſay in the following part of his Firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, ſeems to juſtify theſe notions. <q>For this is the will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ye ſhould abſtain from fornication; That every one ſhould know how to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and honour; Not in the luſt of concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God.</q> I. Epiſtle, chap. iv, ver. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who have never been in large ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it may appear improbable that women of the town ſhould die in any of them through want. This fact, however, may be aſcertained beyond the poſſibility of doubt. A true ſtory is told of the celebrated Dr. Johnſon, which makes him, in this particular, greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the good Samaritan in Scripture. It is ſaid, that once in London, when he was going to his houſe, he ſaw a woman lying proſtrate in the ſtreet. Upon inquiry he found it was a woman of the town, who had become weak and incapable to move through want. He nobly took her upon his back to his houſe, gave her food and lodging until ſhe was perfectly recovered, and then with ſenſible admonitions to reform, diſmiſſed her. This glorious act of humanity, might
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032001_0005_0FF09DC94ABC0430"/>make ſome atonement for the unjuſt ſeverity with which he ſometimes treated others, for which he expreſſed his remorſe and his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a little while before his death. Seneca ſays, that Cato compoſed in bad fortune, was a ſpectacle, which heaven might look down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with pleaſure. Ecce Spectaculum ad quod reſpiciat operi ſuo intentus Deus! Ecce Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonem inter malam fortunam compoſitum! Might not this be ſaid of Jonſon with a poor helpleſs female upon his back, whom he was going to relieve, not for the purpoſes of luſt, but charity?—"Go thou and do likewiſe."</p>
            <p>The cities of London and Philadelphia are both famous for the humane and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inſtitutions which they contain. I think that London may adopt a ſociety for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation of the miſeries of public priſons, in imitation of Philadelphia. (The celebrated Mr. Howard ſaid he would have given five hundred pounds ſterling, upon the ſpot, for the furtherance of ſuch a ſociety in London.) And in return, Philadelphia may in time, imitate London in the erection of a Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Hoſpital.<note n="*" place="bottom">The following is taken from a London paper of February 20th, 1791.
<q>Since the inſtitution of the London Magdalen Hoſpital in the year 1758, more than 2650 women have been admitted; and we can with the greatefſt authority ſay, from a very minute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that near two-thirds of that number have been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reformed, and become uſeful members of ſociety.</q>
