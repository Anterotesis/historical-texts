            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT God permits Sin, is plain Fact, cannot admit of Diſpute, and needs no Proof. Or if any ſhould be ſo weak as to deny the Fact, it may be eaſily proved. For all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Sin is in the World; but if God had interpoſed, and effectually hindered its ever coming into the World, it never would have been. That he did not interpoſe and effectually hinder it, is therefore as certain, as that Sin is now in the World. And God's <hi>not hindering</hi> Sin, is what I call his <hi>permitting it.</hi>—And this Fact, <hi>that God permits Sin,</hi> gives Riſe to this Queſtion, viz. <hi>Is it wiſeſt and beſt, that God ſhould conduct as he does in this Affair?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:008541_0009_102F68278B6DA8C0"/>HAD we a comprehenſive View of God's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Plan, and a perfectly holy Taſte, the whole of the divine Conduct towards the intellectual Syſtem, of Courſe, muſt appear to us now in this World, perfect in Wiſdom, Glory &amp; Beauty; as, it is acknowledged, it will, to all holy Beings at the Day of Judgment. But as the evil and dreadful Conſequences of Sin to us at preſent engroſs our Attention, and the Good to be bro't out of Evil, how great ſoever it may be, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely out of Sight, to be ſure, to the Generality of Men; and not at all ſuited to pleaſe a vicious Taſte, were it in ever ſo clear View; it is no wonder if it be very difficult to bring a guilty apoſtate World to think well of the divine Conduct in this Affair. And yet if we once conclude, that the holy One of Iſrael has not done what is moſt for his own Glory, nor what was wiſeſt and beſt to do; we muſt inevitably give up the abſolute Perfection of the divine Nature,—which will overturn all Religion by the Roots.</p>
               <p>To ſay, <q>that <hi>ſecret Things belong to God,</hi> and we ought not to think of this Part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conduct; nor is it our Duty to believe it to be wiſe, or to acquieſce in it, as ſuch;</q> will not ſatisfy a pious, judicious Mind. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were it a <hi>ſecret Thing,</hi> and had we no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Fact, it might juſtly put an End to all our Enquiries. But God's permitting Sin is in Truth <hi>no ſecret Thing.</hi> It is <hi>revealed,</hi> it is as open and manifeſt as that God made and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World. It is often, very often held
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008541_0010_102F68290DD7A7C8"/>
up to our View in the holy Scriptures, by God himſelf, on Purpoſe that we might think of it. And it is acknowledged on all Hands, that it is our Duty to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Notice of what we find written there, and meditate on every Part of the divine Conduct therein held forth to our View; ſince the whole is calculated and deſigned for our Inſtruction. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> —And as it is an acknowledged Fact, that God has permitted Sin in Millions of Inſtances, from the Beginning of the World to this Day, and will continue to do ſo thrô eternal Ages; ſo there is no avoiding a View of his Conduct, but by the greateſt Stupidity, or ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Eyes in the moſt obſtinate Manner.— Nay, this will not do it; we cannot but think of it ſometimes in this World, and ſhall for ever think of it in the World to come. And we muſt approve or diſapprove; for it is ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting an Affair, that we cannot ſtand Neuter. If we diſapprove now, and for ever; we cannot acquieſce in God's Ways in this World, nor join the heavenly Hoſts at the Day of Judgment, in ſaying, <hi>Amen, Hallelujah!</hi> And God, of Neceſſity, muſt look upon us as Enemies to him, and Male-Contents in his Kingdom, and treat us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. It is therefore of the laſt Importance that we approve.—But if God's Conduct is not wiſe, it is not our Duty to approve of it. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to be ſorry, and lament, that God has done as he has: Which would ſuppoſe him to be to Blame: Which would imply that he is not an abſolutely perfect Being. And if
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008541_0011_102F682AD82D7400"/>
ſo, he is not God. And if there is no God, all Religion is overthrown. Therefore we muſt believe the divine Conduct to be wiſe.—But how ſhall this Belief be obtained?—<hi>Firſtly</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> by an implicit Faith in the abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the divine Nature.—Which—<hi>Secondly,</hi> may be ſtrengthned, by a View of the Wiſdom of ſuch Parts of the divine Conduct as we can more fully comprehend.—Which—<hi>Thirdly,</hi> may be ſtill more confirmed by right Views of the true Nature of God's univerſal Plan.—All theſe I have endeavoured to lead my Readers to attend unto, in my <hi>Sermons</hi> on <hi>the Wiſdom of God in the Permiſſion of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND had the Author of the <hi>Attempt</hi> carefully attended to the Subject, as I had ſtated it, and entered thoroughly into my Reaſonings, I ſhould naturally have been led to review the whole, and to retract or confirm, as Light and Truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.—But this he has not done; but rather, to uſe his own Words, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Deſign, he has exerted himſelf to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſet out the Doctrine, "if poſſible, in all its Horror &amp; Deformity." (p. 8.) So that what I have to do, is to take off this <hi>ill Dreſs,</hi> and array it in its <hi>native Beauty;</hi> that the divine Conduct in the Permiſſion of Sin may not be blaſphemed by ignorant and wicked Men thrô his Means; and the moral Rectitude of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature given up, to the Subverſion of all Religion. Nor ſhall any thing in his Piece that needs an Anſwer, paſs unconſidered.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Several Particulars, wherein the Author of the <hi>SERMONS</hi> on the Wiſdom of God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, and the Author of the <hi>ATTEMPT,</hi> are agreed.</head>
               <p>WE ſhould always exactly ſtate the Point in Controverſy before we begin to diſpute. Wherefore let us ſee how far this Author agrees with us; that the Point of Difference may be made to ſtand out in clear View.—And</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE agree, that Sin is in the World, and that dreadful have been the Conſequences for above 5000 Years: And it is likely to iſſue in the eternal Ruin of great Multitudes of God's Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE agree, that Sin is the very worſt of Evils in its own Nature, and it naturally tends to evil, and only to evil; to diſhonor God, and ruin the Syſtem.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WE agree, that the eternal Ruin of ſuch great Multitudes of God's Creatures, conſider'd in it's ſelf, is an infinitely dreadful Thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE agree, that all the Sin and Miſery, that has, or ever will take Place in the Syſtem thrô eternal Ages (how infinitely dreadful ſoever the whole muſt appear to one who has a perfect comprehenſive View of it all at once) even the whole lay open, full and plain to the divine View, before God created the World. And that he had as full, perfect and lively an Apprehenſion of it, before he began to create, as he ever will have to eternal Ages.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008541_0013_102F68330920E230"/>5. WE agree, that, if God had pleaſed, he could have hindered the Exiſtence of Sin, and cauſed Miſery to have been forever unknown in his Dominions, with as much Eaſe, as to have ſuffered Things to take their preſent Courſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. WE agree, that God knew with infallible Certainty, that Things would take their preſent Courſe, and iſſue as they will iſſue, in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ruin of Millions, unleſs he himſelf ſhould interpoſe, and effectually hinder it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. WE agree, that God did, as it were, ſtand by, and take a perfect View of the whole Chain of Events, in which his Honor &amp; the Good of his Creation was infinitely intereſted: and in a full View, and under a moſt lively Senſe of the whole, did deliberately forbear to interpoſe effectually to hinder the Introduction of Sin into his World, when he could have hindered it, as eaſily as not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. WE agree, that Angels and Men were under the greateſt Obligations to love and obey God, and were left to their own free Choice: and that God was not obliged, in point of Juſtice, to do any more for them than he did: And that the whole Blame lies at the Creatures Door: and that God is righteous in puniſhing his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Creatures, according to the Declarations of his Word.—All theſe Particulars I had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted:—None of them has he denied:—Nor does it appear that we differ in any of theſe Things.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> The grand Point in Controverſy exactly ſtated.</head>
               <p>THE grand Point of Difference is preciſely this—<q>I believe that the infinitely holy and wiſe God, in every Part of his Conduct, relative to the intellectual Syſtem, does that which is really wiſeſt and beſt for him to do; moſt for his Glory and the Good of the Syſtem, in the whole; and therefore, that God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Plan is, of all poſſible Plans, the beſt; moſt for his Glory and the Good of the Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</q>—On the Contrary, the Author of the <hi>Attempt</hi> believes, that <q>God is not obliged to do, and that in fact he does not do, that which is moſt for his own Glory, or moſt for the Good of the Syſtem; and is fully perſwaded that the preſent Plan is ſo far from being the beſt, that it had been infinitely more for the Glory of God, and Good of the Syſtem, if Sin had never happened.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IN the Sermons he objects againſt (p. 104, 105.) it had been ſaid, that <q>from the Perfections of the divine Nature alone, we have ſuch full Evidence, that he muſt always act in the wiſeſt and beſt Manner, as that we ought not in the leaſt to doubt it:—Before the Foundation of the World, this Syſtem now in Exiſtence, and all other poſſible Syſtems, all equally lay open to the divine View, and one as eaſy to Almightineſs as another: He had his Choice; he had none to pleaſe but himſelf: Beſides
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008541_0015_102F6836462F4C38"/>
him there was no Being: he had a perfectly good Taſte, and nothing to bias his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was infinite in Wiſdom: This he choſe: and this, of all poſſible Syſtems, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the beſt, infinite Wiſdom and perfect Rectitude being Judges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the Author of the <hi>Attempt</hi> eſteems this Reaſoning quite inconcluſive, as it proceeds on a falſe Hypotheſis. "A Fallacy," he ſays, to ſuppoſe that God "muſt neceſſarily always will and do that which is moſt for his own Glory." A Point he does not believe, "that in fact he always does" or that "he is obliged to." He thinks it plain in the Works of Creation, that God has not done what would have been moſt for his own Glory, and that he might have done much better. Which emboldens him to argue, that in the Works of Providence, he did not mean to do his beſt. (p. 12, 13.) And he attempts to prove at large by 9 Arguments, that it had been much better, in the whole, more for God's Glory and the general Good of the Syſtem, if Sin and Miſery had been for ever unknown. (p. 20,— 24.)—And if it had been better for God to have hindered Sin, it was not wiſe in God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
               <p>SO that this is the fundamental and moſt eſſential Point of Difference, and that on which the whole Controverſy, between him and me, turns, <hi>viz. Whether the whole, and every Part of the divine Conduct, be agreable to infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>—Or, in other Words, <hi>Whether God means in the whole, and every Part of his Conduct, to do
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008541_0016_102F683CB3E57238"/>
that which he knows to be for the beſt, moſt for his Glory and the Good of the Syſtem, on the whole.</hi>— For we both agree, that God always knows what is for the beſt, and never acts under Miſtake.— So that the only Queſtion really is, <hi>Whether God always means to do, what he knows to be for the beſt, in the whole?</hi>—For if he does, the grand Point is proved. The <hi>Wiſdom of God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin</hi> is demonſtrated.—And it is in vain to raiſe Objections againſt that which infinite Wiſdom knows to be beſt.—It is proud &amp; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, 'tis impious and blaſphemous, for a Worm of the Duſt to take up, and diſpute againſt his Maker. <hi>Iſai.</hi> xlv. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 20.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> God, who is a Being of infinite Wiſdom and perfect Rectitude, always conducts agreably to his own moſt glorious Perfections; that is, in the moſt wiſe, holy and perfect Manner. Particularly in this Caſe.</head>
               <p>WE are agreed, that this Affair of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin was an infinitely important Affair. And, indeed, conſidering it in all its Conſequences; there, perhaps, never was a more important Affair, that God ever had to decide. It involved in it the Welfare of the angelic World, &amp; the Welfare of the whole human Race; the Honor of God was infinitely concerned in the Affair; yea, the very Life of God's own Son, did, as it were, lie at Stake: for if Sin was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008541_0017_102F683E36E26270"/>
the Son of God was to die. That if God ever thoroughly conſidered and weighed any Affair whatever, no doubt, he did this.— And if ever he was concerned to act according to his beſt Judgment (if I may be allowed to uſe ſuch a Phraſe) in any one Caſe, no doubt he was in this. And if God is an abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, it was ſimply impoſſible, that he ſhould conduct, in this infinitely important Affair, contrary to the Light of his own Mind, and the joint Declaration of all his Perfections, infinitely to his own Diſhonor, and infinitely to the Damage of the Syſtem, abſolutely without any Motive ſo to do; yea, againſt infinite Motives to the Contrary. Nay, to ſuppoſe, that God would deliberately and voluntarily, abſolutely without any Motive, ſuffer his Creatures, his <hi>own</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſin; when he knew it would be, in the whole, infinitely better for him to hinder it; is in the moſt bare-faced Manner to give up the moral Rectitude of the divine Nature.</p>
               <p>DID the Inhabitants of Heaven view the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conduct in the Permiſſion of Sin, in this blaſphemous Light, and firmly believe God to be ſuch a Being, in Stead of crying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory,</hi> as they did when God gave up Iſrael of old to Blindneſs of Mind and Hardneſs of Heart (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.) They would rather ſink down into amazing Grief, and fill all Heaven with loud Lamentations.</p>
               <p>AND Saints on Earth, in Stead of ſinging their ancient melodious Song, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008541_0018_102F683FCA4E7550"/>
the Earth rejoyce; let the Multitude of Iſles be glad thereof;</hi> might rather, if theſe Things were ſo, with the captive Jews, hang their Harps on the Willows, put on Sackcloth, ſit down in Sorrow, and refuſe to be comforted.</p>
               <p>A firm Belief of the infinite Wiſdom and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rectitude of the divine Nature and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is eſſential to the very Foundation of all true Religion: For it is the very Reaſon of our Love to God, of our Joy in him, rejoycing in his univerſal Government, acquieſcing in all his Diſpenſations, even thoſe which we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and of our chearful Obedience to all his Commands. If therefore we give up this Belief, we muſt give up all Religion: and ſhall be in as bad or worſe Condition than if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there were really no God at all.</p>
               <p>AND this Doctrine of the Wiſdom and Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the divine Government is alſo the very Foundation of that Doctrine plainly taught in Scripture, and univerſally believed by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>viz.</hi> That at the Day of Judgment the Righteouſneſs of all God's Ways will be made manifeſt to all the World, and the Wiſdom of all his Conduct cleared up before the intellectual Syſtem, to God's everlaſting Honor, to the Joy of all holy Beings, and to the eternal Confuſion of all God's Enemies. (<hi>Jude</hi> 15.) For then will the Lord come <hi>with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them—of all their HARD SPEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES, which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi>—But if God's Ways have not in fact been
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008541_0019_102F68429ECD48D0"/>
wiſe and good, they cannot, at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when all Things will be bro't to Light, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſo.—If God has done wrong (Heaven forbid the Blaſphemy!) all the World will know it then. And if God has deliberately and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily acted contrary to his better Judgment, in this infinitely important Affair of the Permiſſion of Sin, abſolutely for no good End at all, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without any Motive, it will then appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eyes of Angels, Men &amp; Devils, to God's eternal Reproach, to the eternal Grief of all his Friends, and to the eternal Triumph of all his Enemies, who will be glad to ſee the Being, they moſt of all hate, fall under Blame, as well as themſelves.</p>
               <p>IF this were the Caſe, it would be (for aught I can ſee) more for God's Honor, that there never ſhould be a Day of Judgment, and that the Truth of things never ſhould come to Light. Yea, it had been better if God had never made the World.</p>
               <p>AND now does the Author of the <hi>Attempt</hi> in very Deed believe all this horrid Blaſphemy; that he ſhould blame me ſo much, for being ſo confident, that all God's Conduct is wiſe and good; and his preſent Plan, of all poſſible Plans, the beſt! For, why ſhould he blame me ſo much for my Belief, unleſs he is ſtrong in the Belief of his own Scheme!</p>

               <p>No. I abhor all this Blaſphemy with all my Heart. I firmly believe that all the divine Conduct is "good, right, beſt"—"Right in Matter, Manner and Aim"—the Reſult of "ſupreme Wiſdom, which cannot err."—But I affirm, that Sin is "no Part of God's Scheme; but a Device of the Devil."—"God's original Scheme was to have all holy and happy."—The Devil has diſconcerted it by his Rebellion, and God is heartily grieved.—Did I believe <q>the preſent Scheme to be God's, I ſhould think it extremely dangerous oppoſing it; and that it would argue the higheſt Vanity, Arrogance and Impiety.</q> (p. 13, 14, 15, 16, 24, &amp;c.)</p>

               <p>IF by "Sin not being God's Scheme, but the Device of the Devil," you mean, that God did not voluntarily permit Sin; but that the Devil brought it in, in Spite of all that God could do to hinder him; why do you maintain, that God did not mean to do, in this Affair, what he knew was <hi>moſt for his own Glory?</hi> For according to this, God exerted himſelf to the utmoſt, to ſecure his own Glory, and the Good of the Syſtem too; and would have obtained his End, had not his almighty Power been overmatch'd by the Devil. This therefore cannot be your Meaning: unleſs you would be inconſiſtent with your ſelf.</p>

Therefore it muſt be a good one. That is, when God determined to permit Sin, upon a full View of the whole Affair, he knew it wiſeſt and beſt, to permit it—i. e. he knew, that that Plan, in which ſo much Sin and Miſery ſhould take Place, would be better, in the whole, than a Plan in which Sin and Miſery ſhould for ever be effectually prevented by his conſtant Interpoſition. And it he knew this to be the beſt Plan, it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his "original" Plan: for an infinitely wiſe and perfect Being, who "cannot err," would originally chuſe, what, upon the whole, he knew to be the beſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">This is not a Point peculiar to calviniſtic Divines; but as ſtrongly aſſerted by Men of Learning in general. <q>If the Author and Governour of the World be infinitely perfect, then—of all poſſible Syſtems he hath choſen the beſt."—"That is, the Syſtem in which the greateſt Quantity of Happineſs &amp; Perfection obtains, that can in the Nature of things take Place.—This is the joint Doctrine of Reaſon and Revelation.</q> Dr. <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull, Chriſ.

It is a mere "Fallacy" to pretend, "that the preſent Scheme "is moſt for the Glory of God; becauſe he muſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi> always will and do that which is moſt for his own Glory." I think you much to blame for being

ſo "poſitive." For my Part, I do not believe, "that God does in Fact, or that he is obliged to do, what is moſt for his declarative Glory." (p. 12, 13.) And I can prove by a Variety of Arguments, that it had been better, infinitely better, infinitely more for the Honor of God, and Good of the Syſtem, if Sin had never been. (p. 19, 24.)</p>

               <p>PRAY, how then do you think, the whole of the divine Conduct will appear at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If not only his Works of Creation are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; but if, in this infinitely important Affair of the Permiſſion of Sin, God has done what he knew was not for the beſt; permitted Sin, when it had been infinitely better, if he had hindered it.</p>

And humbly "admire and adore" his acting contrary to his own infinite Wiſdom, Holineſs and Goodneſs, as firmly believing this was the Reſult of "ſupreme Wiſdom which cannot err!"—Pray, explain yourſelf on this Point.</p>

               <p>WHAT I ſay, is really true.

               <p>WHY then do you profeſs firmly to believe, that the whole of the divine Conduct "is good, right, beſt"? And that "ſupreme Wiſdom cannot err"?

               <p>HAD you, Sir, juſtified your Maker, fully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the <hi>Wiſdom of God in the Permiſſion of Sin;</hi> and wherein my Solutions of Difficulties appeared to you not ſufficient, had you given better; ſtill endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to juſtify the Ways of God to Men, and to aſſiſt the People of God in their Belief of the Wiſdom of all the divine Conduct; and ſo to animate their Love, and quicken their Obedience; you had merited the Thanks of the Public, and the Love of all pious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and might have been approved of even in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.— But do you think, Almighty GOD will be pleaſed, to have his Conduct in the Permiſſion of Sin diſputed againſt, and ſet in the "moſt horrible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Light poſſible," by one of his own Subjects, who ought to love him, approve of all his Ways, and plead his Cauſe, in this revolted World!

               <p>BUT there is one Argument, on which I lay great Weight. Yea, on which I build my whole Scheme, viz. that as "God does not in Fact, ſo he is not obliged to do, what is moſt for his declarative Glory."—An Argument you have none of you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I have expreſſed it in theſe Words, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>IT is allowed by all, that God is infinite in Power, and that Space is infinite. Now here is evidently Room for endleſs Diſplays of divine Glories. In no definite Period of Time; in no given Quantity of Space, can there be a full Diſcovery of God's Glories; becauſe they are abſolutely infinite. And therefore may we not with the utmoſt Safety affirm, there is not now ſuch a Diſplay? We know there is <hi>now</hi> a greater Diſplay of God's various natural and moral Perfections, than ſeven thouſand Years ago: for there are now Multitudes of rational Beings, which then were not; and an Infinity of other Objects; in which are ſurpriſing Manifeſtations of Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, &amp;c. Had God been obliged to make as great Diſplays, as he could, of his Perfections, he muſt from Eternity have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Exiſtence all poſſible Beings; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of which is evident. And may we not be naturally led from this to doubt, whether God has ſo much Glory from the Things which now exiſt, as he might have had? Eſpecially when we conſider the obvious Defects and Blemiſhes there are; and can eaſily imagine how theſe might be corrected by infinite Wiſdom.</q> (p. 13.)</p>

               <p>TRUE, Sir, we have none of us anſwered this Argument. Nor did we expect it would be uſed by any in this Country, as I believe it never was before. It has often been uſed by profeſſed Atheiſts, in other Countries; who, from the pretended Defects of the natural World, have argued that it could not be the Work of an abſolutely perfect Being; and ſo that we have no Evidence that there is ſuch a Being. And
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008541_0026_102F685827AD5558"/>
it has been abundantly anſwered by ſome of the moſt learned Writers in our Nation, in their Attempts to eſtabliſh the Belief of a God, i. e. of an abſolutely perfect Being.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me, Sir, to give you two or three ſhort Extracts out of Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s <hi>intellectual Syſtem,</hi> where, writing in Confutation of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> he ſays, <q>Their <hi>firſt Objection</hi> is againſt <hi>Providence,</hi> as to the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the World, from the <hi>Faultineſs</hi> of the <hi>Mundane Syſtem,</hi> intellectually conſidered, &amp; in order to Ends; <hi>quia tantâ ſtat praedita Culpâ;</hi> that <hi>becauſe it is ſo ill-made,</hi> therefore it could not be by a <hi>God.</hi> Where the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> takes it for granted, that whoſoever aſſerts a <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>perfect Mind,</hi> to be the Original of <hi>all</hi> Things, does therefore <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>all</hi> Things to be <hi>well made;</hi> and as they <hi>ſhould be.</hi> And this doubtleſs was the Senſe of all the ancient <hi>Theologers.</hi>
                  </q> (p. 875.)—As in ſome modern <hi>Theiſts,</hi> who pretend to ſolve the Difficulty by ſaying, <hi>"quia Deus non tenetur ad optimum, becauſe God is no where bound or obliged to the beſt,"</hi> he ſhews the Abſurdity of their Scheme. p. 873, &amp;c.—In p. 874, he ſays, <q>God is—an <hi>impartial Ballance—weighing</hi> out Heaven &amp; Earth, and all the Things therein, in the moſt juſt and exact Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not a <hi>Grain</hi> too much or too little of any thing. Nor is the Deity therefore <hi>bound</hi> or <hi>obliged</hi> to do the <hi>beſt,</hi> in any Way of <hi>Servility,</hi> much leſs by the Law and Command of any Superior, but only by the <hi>Perfection</hi> of its own <hi>Nature,</hi> which it cannot poſſibly deviate from, no more than <hi>ungod</hi> itſelf. In <hi>Concluſion</hi> therefore, we acknowledge the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> Argument to be thus far good; that if there be a God, then of Neceſſity muſt all Things be <hi>well made;</hi> and as they <hi>ſhould be;</hi> and <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> But no <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will ever be able to prove, that either the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the World could have been <hi>better made,</hi> or that ſo much as one thing therein is made <hi>ineptly.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>AND this doubtleſs is the Belief of Chriſtian Divines in general, of whatever Denomination. To be ſure Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> is full in it. Theſe are his Words, <q>As it would be in us an intolerable Piece of Inſolence to ſay, againſt the plaineſt Declarations of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that God did not in Wiſdom make the World, becauſe we are not able to diſcern the Wiſdom of all things framed in it; ſo muſt it be an equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence in us to ſay, God doth not act in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it, and in the ordering of Affairs in it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Meaſures of true Goodneſs, becauſe we—cannot dive into the Reaſons of his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</q> See Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> IId Edit. p. 495.</p>
               <p>TO which let me add a ſhort Extract out of Dr. <hi>Turnbull</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtian Philoſophy,</hi> p. 35. <q>The Creation of an all-perfect Mind muſt be the Image of it's Creator; and therefore it muſt be perfect, it muſt be choſen by infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs as the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Syſtem, that is, the Syſtem in which the greateſt Quantity of Happineſs and Perfection obtains, that can in the Nature of things take Place; and this being the Caſe, all the ſeeming Imperfections and Evils in it, are ſuch only in a partial View; and with Reſpect to the whole Syſtem they are Goods.</q>

Character, than to think, that God might do better than he does. Theſe are his Words, <q>I ſhall take it for granted, that God is, and that he is neceſſarily an immenſe, eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, a ſelf-ſufficient, and an unchangeable Being. This being allowed, from hence it will follow, that as God is always capable of doing what is moſt <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>valuable,</hi> in it ſelf, and which in the Nature of things, is <hi>right, good, beſt</hi> and <hi>fitteſt</hi> to be done, ſeeing he knows wherein the Goodneſs, Fitneſs, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luableneſs of every Action lies: So he <hi>always will act thus,</hi> becauſe right, good, fit, &amp;c. are ſo very beautiful, and excellent in themſelves; and are ſo preferable, in the Nature of things, to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, that they always will afford a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Motive,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
                  <hi>Tracts,</hi> p. 252.</p>
               <p>BUT to come to a more particular Conſideration of your Argument, the grand Argument on which your whole Scheme is built; yea, the only Argument you uſe, to prove, that God <hi>might</hi> permit Sin, altho' he knew it was not for the beſt; not moſt for his Glory, or the Good of the Syſtem: and that therefore we can have no Certainty that he <hi>would not,</hi> from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Perfection of his Nature.—And this, in a few Words, is the Sum of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOD in the Work of Creation has not done his beſt, but might have done infinitely better.—If this be ſo in one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it may in another.—Therefore we can have no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, from the abſolute Perfection of the divine Nature, that God means to do what is beſt in his Works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but have Reaſon to think he might have done infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WELL, if it be really ſo, that God does not <hi>mean</hi> to order the Affairs of the Univerſe in the beſt Manner, I have had too good an Opinion of God, and have put too much Confidence in him. And I muſt learn for the Time to come to have lower Thoughts of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008541_0029_102F6861D5DCB5D0"/>
God, and higher Thoughts of my ſelf. I muſt begin to think my ſelf a ſuitable Judge, to ſet up and cenſure God's Works and Ways, and point out wherein he might have done better; not in the leaſt ſuſpecting, that God is wiſer and better than I am, and more able and willing to order Things for the beſt; or that it ſavours of Arrogance and Pride, for a Worm of the Duſt, to ſay to the infinitely wiſe God,—<q>In <hi>This,</hi> O Lord, and in <hi>That,</hi> thou mighteſt have done better. Had I been at thy right Hand, chief Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, I could have laid a Plan for a better natural World, and for a better moral Syſtem.</q>—Not once imagining, that God may have wiſe Reaſons for all his Works and all his Ways, which lie beyond my Reach. But rather confident, that he had no good Reaſon; becauſe I ſee none. Wherefore I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſafely to cenſure, as unwiſe, any Steps of divine Providence, the Wiſdom of which I do not ſee. And ſo, the more blind I am to the Wiſdom of the divine Ways, the more Faults I may find, and the more fully point out the divine <hi>Errata.</hi>—And ſo, God muſt no longer be eſteemed as always acting agreable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom; becauſe I cannot ſee it; and, in the Vanity of my Mind, am entered into a Way of thinking and reaſoning, that is the Reſult of the greateſt Folly, and pregnant with the groſſeſt Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>A MORE particular Anſwer to your Argument is, Sir, I humbly conceive, really needleſs. For if I can imagine, to my own Fancy, a better natural World, and a better moral Syſtem; yet, as I do not know that my own Imaginations are right I have not the leaſt Reaſon to call in Queſtion he Wiſdom of the divine Conduct; unleſs I put more Confidence in my Imaginations, than in "ſupreme Wiſdom which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err." But you expreſly own, that you "cannot pretend to prove to a Demonſtration, that the preſent Scheme is not the beſt." (p. 5.)—And merely becauſe I cannot ſee the Reaſon and Wiſdom of God's Works
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008541_0030_102F68639293E7B8"/>
and Ways, at once, to doubt, whether God has acted ſo wiſely as he might have done, juſt as if he might not have good Reaſons in View, which never entered into my Mind, becomes me, neither "as a Man or a Chriſtian." We, who do not ſee the whole of God's univerſal Plan, nay, not the millionth Part of it, are not in a Capacity to pronounce it a bad Plan. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us rather to put an implicit Faith in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom; and to believe it to be good, becauſe it is God's.—I a little wonder, Sir, how you dare ſo freely cenſure the Works and Ways of God, your Maker and final Judge!</p>

               <p>VERY well, Sir, and don't you know that the natural World is wholly the Work of <hi>God?</hi> God, and God alone was the Creator of the Univerſe. The Devil had no Hand in the Work of Creation. And yet, here you <hi>oppoſe,</hi> "dangerous" as it is. Yea, here you <hi>begin</hi> your <hi>Oppoſition.</hi> Here you diſcover ſuch <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi> and can eaſily imagine how things might have been better done; the World might have been created much ſooner and larger; and, it ſeems, you think, infinitely better in the whole; infinitely more to the Glory of God, and containing infinitely more Happineſs.—So that, for aught appears, you have near or quite as low an Opinion of the natural, as of the moral World; and could mend the one, as eaſily as the other.—Yea, from God's not any more conſulting his own Glory in the Works of Creation, you are led to doubt whether he has conſulted it, ſo much as he might have done, in the Works of Providence.</p>
               <p>BUT this arguing, you ſee, is directly and profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt <hi>God's</hi> Works, and that conſidered as ſuch. And yet you ſay, <q>If it could be made appear, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008541_0031_102F686517AD6AA8"/>
the preſent Scheme is <hi>God's,</hi> it would be indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous oppoſing it.</q> But let the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be greater or leſs, you have ventured to <hi>oppoſe,</hi> and cenſure the Works of Creation, which you own to be <hi>God's</hi> Work. Yea, and finding the Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo little to the Glory of God, to what they might have been; you are induced to doubt, whether God means always to do that which he knows would be moſt for his own Glory. And from this grow bold to think, that God might, conſiſtent with his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, permit Sin (a thing he has done not merely once, but perſiſted in every Day, Hour and Moment, near ſix thouſand Years, in almoſt an infinite Number of Inſtances) when he knew, that in the whole, it would have been infinitely more to his Honour and the Good of the Syſtem, if he had hindered it.—And ſo, at laſt, really give up the moral Character of the Deity.— For, it is capable of ſtrict Demonſtration, that infinite Wiſdom cannot err. Find <hi>one Error</hi> therefore in all God's Works, and it will prove to a Demonſtration, that he is not infinitely wiſe. Much more, if you find an <hi>Error infinitely great,</hi> and <hi>perſiſted in for almoſt ſix thouſand Years.</hi>

               <p>YOU often inſiſt, "that we ſhould acquieſce in that Account of things we have in Scripture."

Yea, we ourſelves are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, "whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, to do all to the Glory of God." And can we at the ſame Time imagine, that God allows himſelf, in the moſt important Affairs, to do "what is not moſt for his own Glory"? Would God have us aim at his Glory more than he himſelf does?—Beſides, the Scriptures inform us, that when God had finiſhed the Work of Creation, and ſurveyed the whole, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it all to be "very good;" notwithſtanding all the Objections you have to make againſt it.

               <p>AND how know we, dear Sir, if God thinks beſt to have a larger Number of Intelligences to behold his Glory, and be happy in him, but that he judges it beſt not to bring them into Exiſtence, till the preſent "Grand Drama" ſhall be finiſhed, at the Day of Judgment? That they may, without ſharing the Hazard of the preſent confuſed State of Things, reap the Benefit of the whole, thrô eternal Ages; while Angels and Saints may be appointed their Inſtructors, to lead them into the Knowledge of all God's Ways to his Creatures, and of all their Ways to him, from the Time of Satan's Revolt in Heaven, to the final Conſummation of all Things. And ſo, as the Jewiſh Diſpenſation was introductory and preparatory to the Chriſtian; ſo this preſent Univerſe may be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory and preparatory to one, after the Day of Judgment, almoſt infinitely larger.<note n="*" place="bottom">If the divine Conduct, on the preſent Plan, is perfect in Wiſdom, Glory and Beauty; then the preſent Plan may be a good Introduction to as many future Syſtems, as God pleaſes: till the whole Sum of Good is raiſed to the higheſt poſſible Degree.—Or rather the Knowledge, Humility, Holineſs and Happineſs of finite Intelligences may continually augment, with the greateſt Celerity, thrô eternal Ages; while Syſtem after Syſtem comes into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence under the beſt poſſible Advantages for the ſwifteſt Progreſs in all divine Improvements.—But if God has miſs'd it in the beginning of his Works, there is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid for ill Thoughts of him to be handed down to all ſucceeding Syſtems thrô eternal Ages, if any ſuch ſhould ever be: And the Damage of what is paſt can never be repaired, to Eternity.—If our Author's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis is true, it ſeems as if it would be a Pity any more Worlds ſhould ever be created, to come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Maker's Diſhonour.—Yea, a Pity the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Syſtem ever came into Being.</note> That this will

be the Caſe, I don't pretend ſo much as to conjecture. But I firmly believe, that what is beſt, in the whole, That infinite Wiſdom always has done, and always will do.—And here I reſt.</p>
               <p>I WILL only add, that the Death of Chriſt, and the Work of our Redemption, gives a Diſplay of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections, infinitely fuller; and ſhews <hi>what God is,</hi> in an infinitely clearer and brighter Manner, than the Creation of Syſtems.—It is a ſmall thing with the <hi>Almighty</hi> to create Worlds; a Work ſcarce worth our Notice, or worthy ever to be thought of, compared with the Work of Redemption by the Death of his Son. To be ſure, God himſelf, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the beſt Judge, views Things in this Light.— <hi>For behold!</hi> (ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of this very thing) <hi>I create new Heavens, and a new Earth: And the former ſhall not be remembered, nor come into Mind.</hi> Iſai. lxv. 17.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008541_0036_102F6873A05EF4F0"/>
a different Idea of God's univerſal Plan. Nor could you, if you love what God loves, think ſo meanly of that, which to God appears ſo infinitely glorious.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>BUT I have many Arguments to prove, that it had been infinitely better, infinitely more to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and Good of the Syſtem, if Sin had never been. Yet it is plain Fact God has permitted Sin to be. Therefore it is certain, God does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mean to do that which is beſt. (p. 13. compared with p. 19,—24.)</p>

            <sp>

               <p>HOWEVER, according to your own Conceſſion, all your Arguments do not amount to a Demonſtration. For you ſay, "that you cannot pretend to prove to a Demonſtration, that the preſent Scheme is not the beſt." (p. 5.) But we may be as certain, that infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and perfect Rectitude cannot err, as that <hi>two</hi> and <hi>two</hi> make <hi>four.</hi> Now to attempt to confute, what we are certain to a Demonſtration is true, by Arguments, we are ſenſible, fall ſhort of Demonſtration, is very weak. And to give up the infinite Wiſdom and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rectitude of the divine Nature and Conduct, on ſuch Grounds, how can it be but inexcuſable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety?—To cenſure the Conduct of Civil Rulers, known to be Men of ſuperior Abilities, and of great Integrity, when we are not under Advantages to enter into the Secrets of State, or to know ſcarce any of the Reaſons they act upon, is always deemed arrogant and wicked. Much more muſt it be ſo here: As we have the greateſt Certainty, that the ſupreme Ruler of the Univerſe is a Being of infinite Underſtanding, and of perfect Rectitude; and as we are at an infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from a full Comprehenſion of his grand univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Scheme.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008541_0037_102F687920A3ED30"/>
Permiſſion of Sin, by it. (p. 25.)—But it does not convince me.—For if once I ſhould believe, that it was wiſeſt and beſt in God to permit Sin, moſt for his Glory, and for the Good of the Syſtem; I ſhould feel my ſelf under a Neceſſity to look upon Sin as being <hi>in its own Nature</hi> a good Thing, for the Glory of God, and Good of the Syſtem; and that God delights in it as ſuch. And that therefore in Stead of hating Sin, mourning for it in our ſelves, lamenting it in others; we ought rather to eſteem it as really a good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Thing; and as ſuch to rejoyce in it, and even to keep an everlaſting Jubilee in Remembrance of Satan's Revolt, and Adam's Fall: Events ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious! (p. 16, 17, 18, 19.)—Abſurdities ſo ſhocking, that I never can believe them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>AND, <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> let me tell you, that if you did but underſtand the Scheme you are oppoſing, you would know, are ſo far from following from it, that they are abſolutely inconſiſtent with it.</p>
               <p>FOR the Doctrine of the Wiſdom of God in the Permiſſion of Sin, ſuppoſes Sin, in it ſelf and in all its natural Tendencies, to be infinitely evil, infinitely contrary to the Honour of God, and Good of the Syſtem. For herein conſiſts the Wiſdom of God in the Affair, not in bringing Good out of Good, but in bringing infinite Good out of infinite Evil, and never ſuffering one Sin to happen in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but which, notwithſtanding its infinitely evil Nature and Tendency, infinite Wiſdom can and will over-rule to greater Good, in the whole. So that all theſe Objections are the Reſult of Ignorance or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs.</p>
               <p>FOR Sin, in itſelf, and its natural Tendencies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt as evil as thò God never meant to, and in fact never did, bring any Good out of it; it is as much, to be hated for its evil Nature and Tendency, to be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008541_0038_102F687B01F261F0"/>
repented of in ourſelves, and lamented in others, mourned for, watched and prayed and preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; as if no Good was ever to be brought out of it.</p>
               <p>JUST as it was in the Affair of Joſeph. It was a vile, an impious and barbarous thing, for his Brethren to do as they did: Hateful in itſelf, and in the Eyes of God, and of all good Beings: And to be mourned for, and lamented, and teſtified againſt, as ſuch. It was diſhonorable to God, whoſe Authority they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and whoſe Deſign to advance Joſeph they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fruſtrate: Cruel to their aged pious Father, and barbarous to their Brother.—And in fact <hi>they were verily Guilty;</hi> as their Conſciences teſtified, in the Day of their Diſtreſs. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xlii. 21.) —And if after all this, contrary to their Intentions, great Good comes out of this Affair, no Thanks to them for that. They were ſtill <hi>verily Guilty;</hi> and even every Whit as much to blame, as ever; and had as great Reaſon for godly Sorrow, and true Repentance; as is plain to the weakeſt Capacity.—I appeal to the common Senſe of all Mankind. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In Gen. xlv. 5. Joſeph ſpeaking to his Brethren, ſays, <hi>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your ſelves, that ye ſold me hither: For God did ſend me before you to preſerve Life.</hi>—Which <hi>POOL</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains.— <q>
                           <hi>Be not grieved,</hi> to wit, immoderately, &amp;c. He doth not diſſwade them from godly Sorrow.— <hi>Nor angry with your ſelves.</hi> In the Hebrew it is, <hi>Neither let there be Anger in your Eyes.</hi> i. e. Neither exceſſively torment your ſelves with the Remembrance of the Fact, neither break forth into Contentions and Wrath, and Upbraidings of one another.—<hi>For God did ſend me before you to preſerve Life.</hi> i. e. God by his wiſe, powerful, and gracious Providence over-ruled your evil Intentions to an happy End, &amp;c. which thô it doth not leſſen your Sin, yet ought to qualify your Sorrow.</q> See <hi>POOL</hi> on the Place.</p>
                     <p>N. B. JOSEPH'S Brethren had been for ſome Time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Circumſtances very diſtreſſing; their Minds full of Heavineſs and Grief from that Quarter; and they ready ſometimes in their Anguiſh to be angry at, and upbraid one another, for what was paſt. Which kind of Grief was not of the Nature of godly Sorrow. And this was what Joſeph referred to. He would not have them grieve and afflict themſelves, &amp;c. in that Sort; for that all was brought to a happy Iſſue. He did not mean to diſſwade them from godly Sorrow. He knew, the more they ſaw of the Wiſdom, Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in this Affair, the more would they love him, and loath themſelves; and mourn after a godly Sort, that they had endeavoured to counteract him. The more Beauty they ſaw in God's Scheme, the more would they hate their own, which was deſigned to fruſtrate his.</p>
                     <p>GOD'S Scheme was to advance Joſeph, &amp;c. Their proud Hearts could not endure it. They viewed him as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a native Tincture of Vanity. They envied him, and wanted to keep him down; and laid a Scheme for it; which God over-ruled, directly contrary to their very Hearts.—Now for them to look upon God's Scheme as glorious, muſt imply in its very Nature, that they looked upon their own Scheme with the utmoſt Abhorrence. Which muſt ſuppoſe deep Humiliation, and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence. They could not really and heartily like God's Scheme, without a ſincere Abhorrence of their own. Nor can any one Being in the Syſtem heartily like God's Scheme in permitting Sin in general, without a ſincere Abhorrence of Sin in general: and a hearty Deſire that all ſinful Schemes may be fruſtrated, juſt as this was, which Joſeph's Brethren had laid; for this is God's Deſign.—Had Joſeph's Brethren, before they were ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, been let into God's Scheme, to ſee what he had done to advance their Brother, their Envy would have revived; and they felt an Inclination to lay ſome new Scheme to take him down. They muſt be ſoundly humbled, before they would heartily approve God's Scheme, and be willing to bow to Joſeph. But let their proud Hearts be humbled, and they love their Brother as they ought; and they would be glad to ſee him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and aſhamed to think of what they had done, and chearfully pay him the Honour which was his due.— So a perfectly humble and holy Temper would lead us perfectly to acquieſce in God's univerſal Plan, which is deſigned to exalt God, and make all his happy Subjects feel their comparative Nothingneſs, to the higheſt poſſible Degree—That <hi>God may be all in all.</hi>—See this illuſtrated at large in my <hi>Sermons.</hi>

               <p>SIR, I am of another Opinion. I affirm, that "if Sin is the Occaſion of greater Good, in the whole, there is no Reaſon to repent of it." (p. 18.) "For it ceaſes to be Sin." (p. 19.)</p>

               <p>YOU affirm ſo, it is true: But it is impoſſible, if you will conſider the Caſe, that you ſhould believe ſo.—Pray, tell me, was it not a ſinful thing, for Joſeph's Brethren to ſell their Brother? Or for the Jews to crucify the Lord of Glory? Becauſe God, in both Caſes, contrary to their Deſign, brought great Good out of theſe great Evils.—I appeal to your own Conſcience.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>NAY, but if you appeal to me, I muſt frankly tell you, that if greater Good is brought out of Evil, we are not to be ſorry, but rather to rejoyce that we have ſinned. This Principle I take for granted, as ſelf-evident. And on this Hypotheſis I build my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. (p. 17, 18.)</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>THEN it ſeems, you think, that Joſeph's Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had no Cauſe to repent of their Sin, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fruſtrate God's Deſign to advance their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe in Spite of all their Malice and Envy, God over-ruled all they did to bring about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Advancement, to the beſt Advantage. Their Sin, you ſay, <q>God in infinite Wiſdom over-ruled for the Advancement of Joſeph; the Preſervation
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008541_0041_102F6884AD4A3D00"/>
of Jacob and his Family; and a Train of the moſt happy Events to the Church of God, from that Day to this.</q> (p. 6.) To which you add, <q>It muſt be confeſſed, much of the divine Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, &amp;c. was diſplayed in bringing ſo much Good from ſuch Treachery.</q> Therefore Joſeph's Brethren ought, in Stead of Sorrow, rather to "keep an everlaſting Jubilee" in Remembrance of their Malice, Envy, Cruelty and Impiety exerciſed in that Deed. This is one of the "pernicious Conſequences" not of mine, but of your own Scheme. Nor can it be got rid of, as to thoſe Inſtances of Sin, which you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God has over-ruled to greater Good. And as you own "you cannot prove to a Demonſtration" but that greater Good will finally be brought out of all Sin, in general; ſo upon your Scheme you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certain, that you or any other Sinner has Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent of Sin. You do not know as yet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſorry, or glad. Yea, according to you, "it is above your, or perhaps any human Talents" to decide this Queſtion. (p. 5, 6.) Therefore upon your Scheme, all Sinners muſt put off their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, until by ſome new Revelation from Heaven it is declared, that God never will over-rule all to greater Good. And as ſoon as ever we are aſſured, that God does not intend to over-rule all Things to his Glory and to the Good of the Syſtem; then, and not till then, muſt we begin to be ſorry that we have ſinned: —that is, to be ſorry that we have not ſought the Glory of God and Good of the Syſtem, with all our Might. — But why ſhould we be ſorry now? For, if God does not ſeek his own Glory, why ſhould we? if He does not aim at the general Good, why ſhould we? ought we to be more holy than God himſelf? No: the utmoſt Extent of our Duty is only <hi>to be perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven, is perfect.</hi>— So that finally, your Scheme, in whatever Light conſidered, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude true Repentance out of the World.—However,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008541_0042_102F68866A86A090"/>
there is this Comfort by the way, that your Scheme is ſo plainly inconſiſtent with common Senſe, that it can never be believed by a rational Creature. To ſuppoſe, that my Sin is leſſened, becauſe, contrary to my Deſign, Good is brought of it by another Being, let the Good be ever ſo great, inſtead of being ſelf-evidently true, is really ſelf-evidently falſe.</p>

               <p>The Jews did nothing, but what God's <hi>Counſel determined before to be done;</hi> as the Apoſtles, full of the holy Ghoſt, expreſly declare, and that even in their Prayer to God.

               <p>You will doubtleſs readily own, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Plan was laid by "an infinitely holy Being:" becauſe you have it from his own Mouth. Exod. xiv. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Speak unto the Children of Iſrael; that they turn, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the Sea, over
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008541_0043_102F6887EF391898"/>
againſt Baal-Zephon: before it ſhall ye encamp by the Sea.—</hi> But why? — <hi>For</hi> (ſays the holy One of Iſrael, who knew what the Conſequence would be) <hi>Pharaoh</hi>—when he hears where you are encamped — <hi>will ſay of the Children of Iſrael, They are entangled in the Land, the Wilderneſs hath ſhut them in</hi>— They cannot eſcape: I have them at my Mercy.—<hi>And I will</hi> — by this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance— <hi>harden Pharaoh's Heart, that he ſhall follow after them, and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his Hoſt: that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.</hi> — Here was a Plan laid by an infinitely holy Being, which was infinitely wrong and wicked for Pharaoh to execute." However, he did execute it.— Ver. 5. <hi>And it was told the King of Egypt, that the People fled: and the Heart of Pharaoh and of his Servants was turned againſt the People, and they ſaid, Why have we done this, that we have let Iſrael go from ſerving us? And he made ready his Chariot and took his People with him.</hi>— And what was the iſſue? <hi>They ſank like Lead in the mighty Waters.</hi> And Iſrael ſang, <hi>The Lord hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed gloriouſly.</hi>— And thus God ordered Things as he did, profeſſedly on Deſign, that Pharaoh might do as he did. And when he had done what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he ſhould do, he wrought a Miracle to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him. And Moſes without the leaſt Difficulty, ſaw the Holineſs and Wiſdom of God in laying this Plan, and the Wickedneſs of that bloody Tyrant in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting it, and the Righteouſneſs of his Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>So again, the whole Plan of Chriſt's Crucifixion was laid by the holy ONE of Iſrael, before the World began; and was ſo very particularly deſcribed in the Types and Prophecies of the old Teſtament, ſome Hundreds of Years before it was accompliſhed; and ſo plainly foretold by our Saviour before his Death, and compared with the ancient Types and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies after his Reſurrection, that the Apoſtles plainly ſaw, that Jews and Gentiles had done nothing but what God had <hi>before determined</hi> ſhould be done: and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008541_0044_102F688AB7EA8788"/>
yet they could eaſily ſee, that this did not in the leaſt Meaſure leſſen their Guilt. And ſo can any Body elſe. For it is plain, that the Jews did not mean to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the glorious Scheme, which God had in View, in the Death of his Son; but only to gratify their Pride, Malice, Envy and Revenge, in the Death of One whom they hated, without a Cauſe.</p>

God the "Author of Sin": That which ſuppoſes that he always acts according to his infinite Wiſdom and perfect Rectitude, and does what he infallibly knows is moſt for his Glory and the Good of the Syſtem; Or that, which ſuppoſes juſt the contrary, viz. "that in Fact God does not do what is moſt for his own Glory." (p. 13.)

And this is the Caſe with reſpect to every Sin, that ever was or will be committed, by Men or Devils. So that according to this Writer, God is the greateſt Sinner in the Univerſe. For either he is "the Author of all Sin"; or, which is no better, acts contrary to his beſt Judgment in the Permiſſion of every Sin that is committed: doing what he knows is "not moſt for his own Glory."

               <p>AS God intended before the Foundation of the World to permit Sin, for holy and wiſe Ends, it was of the utmoſt Importance, that he ſhould do it under ſuch Circumſtances, that the whole intellectual Syſtem might ſee and know, that he did not do it, as looking upon Sin, as being Good in it ſelf, or as tending to Good: yea, under ſuch Circumſtances, that his Permiſſion of it might not, in the Eyes of finite Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, leſſen, but rather infinitely increaſe the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of it. Therefore he not only created all holy, at firſt; but alſo "forbid Sin under the ſevereſt Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;" yea actually executed the infinitely dreadful Penalty on the ſinning Angels, who were the firſt Tranſgreſſors, without any Mercy. And while he exerciſed Mercy towards fallen Man, he did it in ſuch a Way, as will finally, and on the whole, ſhew his Hatred of Sin, as much, nay more than it he had treated them as he did the fallen Angels. But while the whole Tenour of his Conduct thus joins to ſet his Hatred of Sin in a moſt ſtriking Light; his actual Permiſſion of it, at the ſame time, equally proves, that he did not think it beſt, to prevent it by his own immediate Interpoſition.

               <p>MANY Propoſitions may "ſound like Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions," which are perfectly conſiſtent.

               <p>THAT Sin, in it ſelf, is infinitely diſagreeable to the divine Nature, is granted. That it was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs beſt, that Sin ſhould be, with a View to the Good to be brought out of it by God; and that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008541_0053_102F68A9415143D8"/>
therefore God acted agreeable to all his Perfections in the Permiſſion of it, is ſtill affirmed. Nor do theſe Words, conſidered with their Context, militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but rather greatly confirm this Truth.</p>
               <p>FOR the true Senſe of thoſe Words is plainly this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſinful State of Mankind before the Flood was in it ſelf infinitely diſagreeable to God, who is an infinitely holy and benevolent Being; and viewed therefore merely in it ſelf, had the greateſt Tendency, in Fact, to <hi>grieve</hi> and diſtreſs the HOLY ONE; and make him ſincerely <hi>repent</hi> that ever he made the World. And therefore, were Things always to be ſo, and no Good ever to come of it, he never would have made the World; nor would he have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it in Being when made, to grieve his Heart, and wear out his Life with continual Sorrow; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vexed and grieved, croſſed and diſappointed, in a continued Series of Wickedneſs, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of the World. Therefore as theſe Words, in the ſtrongeſt Manner, expreſs the infinite Holineſs and Goodneſs of the divine Nature; ſo they are quite favourable to the preſent Truth.—For,</p>
               <p>IF God does really look upon Sin in this Light, why did he ever make the World, as he knew how Things would iſſue? Or, why did not he deſtroy all Mankind at the general Deluge, as he knew what they were, and how they would prove afterwards? (<hi>their Imaginations evil from their Youth. Gen.</hi> viii. 21.) and make a new World, and People it with a better Race? Which he might have done with infinite Eaſe. —The plain and only Anſwer, which we can poſſibly give to theſe Queſtions, is, that altho' Sin was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diſagreeable to the Divine Nature, conſidered in it ſelf; yet, on the whole, he choſe the preſent Plan, with a View to the infinitely greater Good, he knew he could, &amp; he knew he would, bring out of all this Evil. And ſo all this Evil, in the iſſue, be but like the Drops of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008541_0054_102F68AAC3FB4598"/>
Rain, in which the Rainbow is formed, when the Sun breaks forth in his Strength, (an Emblem of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi>) and as the Blackneſs of the Cloud after a Storm, which does but add Beauty and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Rain-bow; which the moſt High appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>a Token of his Covenant,</hi> and which, perhaps as an <hi>Hieroglyphic,</hi> was deſign'd to ſuggeſt the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God's continuing the World in Being.— Therefore, when <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a Type of the great Sacrifice of Chriſt; that <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> which was by Heaven's high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to <hi>bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> and by ſuperiour Wiſdom turn all his Miſchief to greater Good, the only Way to cruſh the Head and for ever perfectly ſubdue that old Serpent, which is the Devil: I ſay, therefore when <hi>Noah,</hi> according to divine Inſtitution, offered Sacrifice, and brought into View the great Meſſiah, and all his glorious Work, God was well pleaſed — Good will come out of Evil — <hi>And the LORD ſmelled a ſweet Savour;</hi> — (in the Hebrew, <hi>a Savour of Reſt.</hi> God's Heart was now well pleaſed) <hi>and the LORD ſaid in his Heart,</hi> (as being perfectly pleaſed with his perfect Plan, upon the whole,) <hi>I will not again curſe the Ground any more for Man's Sake; altho' the Imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth. Gen.</hi> viii. 21. — As if he had ſaid, <q>I know Mankind will be as bad as ever. However, I will deſtroy them no more; but continue <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter, Seed-Time and Harveſt,</hi> for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the human Race; becauſe the <hi>Seed of the Woman will,</hi> in the iſſue, <hi>bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> diſappoint his whole Scheme, and bring greater Good out of all this Evil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT to return to the Senſe you put on the Text. <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at the Heart.</hi>—But, Dear Sir, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be grieved at the Heart, that he made Man;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008541_0055_102F68AC9DD705D8"/>
and yet after all, continue this Race in Being! and ſo, practically prefer the preſent Plan before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when, of all poſſible Plans, he ſtill had his Choice; and the very beſt, by one Word's ſpeaking, you think, might with infinite Eaſe have been, by him, brought into Exiſtence; and ſo, He perfectly pleaſed for ever!—Or, when all Man kind, but eight, were deſtroyed by the Flood, it had been an eaſy thing to have deſtroyed them; and ſo made thorough Work: and to have created another <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and effectually prevented their Fall; and ſo have had all things perfectly to his Mind.—To be <hi>grieved</hi> with, and <hi>repent</hi> of his <hi>old Plan,</hi> conſidered in the whole; and yet to go on with it, at the ſame time; when of all poſſible Plans, he ſtill had his Choice, even at the Flood, is perfectly inconſiſtent.—Your Senſe of the Words therefore, Sir, cannot be right: and unleſs you will make the HOLY ONE of Iſrael inconſiſtent with himſelf, you muſt come into the Senſe which I have given.</p>
               <p>BUT we have had enough, quite enough, of this kind of Objections. I wiſh you would urge ſomething more directly to the Purpoſe.

               <p>WELL, this is to the Purpoſe indeed, were it true.— But it is ſtrange that a Man, with his Bible in his Hands, and his Eyes in his Head, ſhould ever ſay ſo.—<hi>Ye thought Evil againſt me,</hi> ſays Joſeph to his Brethren. "Your Deſign, in what was done, was an evil Deſign. But God's Deſign, in what was done, was a good Deſign. <hi>God meant it unto Good.</hi>" Which, it is plain, refers not to God's <hi>after-Act,</hi> but to his <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Intention. — God meant it,</hi> i. e. God meant I ſhould be ſold. He <hi>meant it</hi> as much as you did. Your Scheme was to prevent my Advancement. But <hi>God meant it unto Good.</hi> i. e. "God intended that Event ſhould come to paſs, to anſwer the good Ends he had in view."—What can be plainer!</p>
               <p>BUT if you want another Inſtance, you may have it in <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Where the Expreſſions uſed are much ſtronger than ſuch as I have been wont to uſe, (as indeed Scripture-Expreſſions relative to this Subject generally are,) and evidently take in ſome Ideas over and above a more <hi>Permiſſion,</hi> as I have explained that Word. For God not only left <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Heart, but ordered external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſo, as conſidering <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Temper, God knew would infallibly ſtrengthen his Obſtinacy. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in ſuffering the <hi>Magicians</hi> to imitate ſeveral of the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from time to time remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plagues, and ſo giving Opportunity for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to regain his Courage, and renew his Oppoſition &amp;c. And God plainly intended by all, that Things ſhould be carried to ſuch an Extremity as they were, that he might the better anſwer his own holy, wiſe and glorious Ends. Yea, God expreſly declares, that this was his Deſign. Exod. xiv. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Speak unto the Children of Iſrael, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahirvoth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Migdol and the Sea, over againſt Baal-Zephon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall ye encamp by the Sea.

               </p>
               <p>WHEN God firſt ſent Moſes into Egypt to Pharaoh, he told him before-hand, <hi>I am ſure that the King of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty Hand.

               <p>AS to the Affair of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which you ſo much inſiſt upon, I grant, it was by infinite Wiſdom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled for Good. But however, it is not at all "to your Purpoſe." (p. 6.)</p>

               <p>BUT, Sir, perhaps others will think it much to the Purpoſe. For, if God has, in only one Inſtance, permitted Sin for wiſe and holy Ends, it is at leaſt poſſible, that he may have done ſo in all Inſtances. And if <hi>he always acts like himſelf,</hi> no doubt, this is, in fact, the very Caſe.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, if God did permit Sin in the Affair of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for wiſe and good Ends, all your <hi>ten Objections</hi> in P. 16, 17, 18, 19. are anſwered all at once; and indeed the Subſtance of your Book.— Unleſs you will adopt the very Abſurdities you pretend to abhor, and maintain for Truth, <q>that God was the Author of that Sin, and loved it; and that <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren acted like the greateſt Saints in that Affair; had no Cauſe to mourn for their Sin, nor their Father to lament his want of Succeſs in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Children, or to be at all grieved for their Wickedneſs. Yea, that their Sin was no Sin, but rather a Virtue. And if <hi>Jacob</hi> or <hi>Joſeph</hi> approved and admired the Wiſdom of God in that Affair, it muſt argue, they had very unworthy Conceptions of God, to think he could not bring about his good Deſigns without ſuffering ſo much Evil; and had they been conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they muſt have turned Infidels; or at leaſt have diſcarded all thoſe Texts of Scripture, which repreſent God as <hi>hating Sin,</hi> being <hi>grieved</hi> with it,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008541_0059_102F68B7E0DA2FD0"/>
and <hi>angry</hi> becauſe of it.</q>— If in fact God did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be ſold, <hi>meaning it unto Good;</hi> if this was <hi>God's Scheme,</hi> in ſuch a Senſe as that <hi>Joſeph</hi> might juſtly ſay, <hi>GOD ſent me hither;</hi> then may you do well to reconſider your own Words, with Application to your ſelf; <q>If the preſent Scheme be <hi>GOD's,</hi> it would be extremely dangerous oppoſing it; and argue the higheſt Vanity, Arrogance and Impiety.</q> It is plain Fact, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> viewed and conſidered that whole Affair as <hi>GOD's Scheme,</hi> as much as I do, and uſes as ſtrong Expreſſions, as I have any where done. Only read <hi>Gen.</hi> xlv. 5—8. and be impartial.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>BUT <q>it is not parallel in one material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. Nay, the Caſe is wholly different, and therefore quite foreign to the Purpoſe: For all concerned in the Conduct and Conſequences of that Affair, were in a State of <hi>Sin;</hi> and therefore deſerved all the Chaſtiſements they received. They had all Blemiſhes in their Characters, which may eaſily account for their Sufferings.</q> (p. 6, 7.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>TRUE. "They <hi>deſerved</hi> their Sufferings." Nor did God ever inflict Pain, no, not the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, in any one Inſtance, in the whole intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Syſtem, but in which it was deſerved, as much as they deſerved their Sufferings.—To be ſure, we in this World "are in a <hi>State of Sin,</hi>" and deſerve our Sufferings, and need our Chaſtiſements, as much as they did. Nor did God begin to chaſtiſe us, until after we had become Sinners.</p>
               <p>IF you ſhould ſay, "that <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren deſerved to be chaſtiſed for their Pride and Envy; and that therefore God left them to themſelves, to fall into that Sin, that he might in the Iſſue humble them, and bring them to a better Mind:" this would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw your whole Scheme. For according to this, God did permit Sin for wiſe and holy Ends; the very Point, that I affirm, and the very Point, that you deny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:008541_0060_102F68B963B23AB8"/>OR, if you ſhould ſay, "However, as they were <hi>Sinners,</hi> God might <hi>juſtly</hi> leave them to Sin; but God could not, conſiſtent with <hi>Juſtice,</hi> leave <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> Beings to Sin;" this would ſuppoſe, that God was <hi>obliged,</hi> in Juſtice, to keep all innocent Beings from falling. And conſequently, that God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Sin was an Act of <hi>Injuſtice;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God is not a juſt Being.</p>
               <p>OR, if you ſhould only ſay, that "they had <hi>provoked</hi> God to leave them; but innocent Beings had not;" it is eaſy to obſerve, that according to Scripture-account, God permitted <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be ſold, not ſo much in anger at <hi>Joſeph</hi> or <hi>Jacob's</hi> Family; as out of love to them, for their Good. As it is written, <hi>God meant it unto Good.</hi> God had his own Glory and the general Good in View, in that Affair, juſt as I ſuppoſe he had in ſuffering our firſt Parents to fall.</p>
               <p>OR, if I ſhould grant, "God ſuffered <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren to fall into that Sin, out of <hi>Anger</hi> at them, as was doubtleſs the Caſe with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when God ſuffered him to purſue Iſrael into the red Sea:" yet it is plain, that in both Caſes, he had his own Glory and the general Good in view. And ſo both Caſes are analogous to his Conduct relative to the whole Syſtem, for Subſtance. And only granting, what none deny, that it was no <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to innocent Beings, for God to permit them to fall; there is no "ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Difference," which at all hurts the "parallel," for the "Purpoſe," for which it is uſed in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. For this is my Argument, as I juſt now ſtated it: "If in ſome Inſtance; God permits Sin for wiſe and holy Ends, it is poſſible he may in all. And if he <hi>always acts like himſelf,</hi> then, no doubt, in fact, he always <hi>does.</hi>" (See my <hi>Serm.</hi> p. 103, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) An Argument you have no way to anſwer, but by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>YES, Sir, a ſhocking Scheme indeed! but it is one of your own Invention. It is none of mine.</p>
               <p>I BELIEVE that "Love is the Sum of God's moral Perfections;" and in one Senſe (an <hi>ill</hi> Senſe) there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Vengeance</hi> in the Divine Nature. I believe, that <hi>Love</hi> is the very eſſence of vindictive Juſtice.—<q>
                     <hi>Love</hi> to God, to Virtue, to the beſt Good of the Syſtem, bearing down in a wiſe and righteous Manner the Enemies of God, of Virtue, and of the Syſtem,</q> is the Definition I gave of it in my <hi>Sermons.</hi> (p. 190.) —"An amiable Perfection in the Deity!" (p. 191.) — And I believe, that the chief Advantages, which will accrue to holy Beings from a View of the Miſery of the Damned, will be, as the Scriptures teach, (<hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 22.) to give them the moſt lively and affecting Senſe of the glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> boundleſs Power, Holineſs, and Goodneſs; or in other Words, God's infinite Hatred of Sin, and Ability to puniſh it, and the infinite Riches of his Grace in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Jeſus Chriſt. (p. 191.) For it is a View, not of Deformity, but of Beauty; not of Miſery, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> but of the glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature, manifeſted in the moral Government of the World, — an abſolutely perfect Plan, which is the Source of the Happineſs of the heavenly State.— And I believe, that it is <hi>Love,</hi> to God, to Virtue, and to the beſt Good of the Syſtem, which is the chief
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008541_0064_102F68C55A4CFC88"/>
Source of the exalted Joys of the heavenly Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; who, on a View of the juſt Puniſhment of God's obſtinate Enemies, cry, <hi>Amen! Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth! — Again they ſaid, Hallelujah. And her Smoke roſe up for ever and ever.— Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give Honour to him: for the Marriage of the Lamb is come. (Rev.</hi> xix. 1—7.) —They do not rejoyce in their Miſery <hi>as ſuch,</hi> nor in their Miſery as giving themſelves a higher Reliſh for their own Happineſs; but they rejoyce to ſee God exalted, his Authority vindicated, his Law honoured, Sin diſcountenanced, Satan and his Cauſe ſubdued, the Meſſiah victorious. And this "tremendous Scene," by Way of Contraſt, tends to give the moſt affecting Senſe of all the Divine Perfections, as ſhining forth in the Work of Redemption, the moſt glorious of all God's Works. So that, upon the whole, the Saved will be under the beſt Advantages for ever to have a freſh Remembrance of what they once were, and to ſee what they deſerved, and where they might have been, and what God has done, and to behold all his glorious Perfections as ſhining through all his Works of Mercy and of Juſtice, in a Light infinitely bright, and under Circumſtances moſt ſuited to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their Attention, and affect their Hearts, and to give them the higheſt Senſe of their Dependence on God, and Obligations to him. So that they will have the beſt Means to make the ſwifteſt Progreſs in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge, Humility, Holineſs and Happineſs for ever.—But you muſt be referred to my <hi>Sermons,</hi> where theſe Points are more fully diſcuſſed, than my intended Brevity will now admit.</p>

As ſometimes a penitent Malefactor on the Gallows, from Benevolence to his fellow-Creatures, may ſincerely wiſh the Spectators might take Warning by him. — But to the impenitent Sinner, who is an Enemy to God, and to the Syſtem, and to all Good; and who ſees not the great Evil of Sin, nor his Deſert of Damnation; and cares only for himſelf; Things muſt appear in a very different Light.— Had Pharaoh, for Inſtance, (whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> views as a Specimen of obſtinate Sinners in general, Rom. ix.) at the Bottom of the Red Sea, heard the Hebrews ſing, "The Lord hath Triumphed gloriouſly;" and upon it remembred the Word once ſent to him, "For this Cauſe have I raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my Power, and that my Name may be declared throughout all the Earth:" it would have been a Comfort to him "infinitely worſe than nothing."—If he muſt be drowned, he had infinitely rather it ſhould anſwer no ſuch End. Yea, nothing could be more croſs to the temper of his Heart, or put him to greater Pain.—To think, that, in the midſt of all his Haughtineſs, he had been in God's Hand, as <hi>Clay in the Hand of the Potter</hi> (Rom. ix. 21) — to ſee, that all his proud Oppoſition to the Almighty had but exactly accompliſhed the Plan which was in God's Mind, in the Days of Abraham, three or four hundred Years before he was born (<hi>Gen.</hi> xv 12 — 16) or had <hi>done Good or Evil</hi> (Rom. ix 11—23.) — to conſider, that God's laſt End was "to ſhew his Power, and that his Name might be declared throughout all the Earth" (Exod. ix. 16.) and that his elected, his choſen People, the Hebrews, whom he hated, "might tell it to their Sons, and to their Sons Sons, what God had done, THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT HE WAS THE LORD." (Exod. x. 1, 2.)— <q>This, O Pharaoh, was the wiſe and glorious End, God had in View, in permitting thee to harden thy Heart, and run ſuch a great Length in Wickedneſs! And in this View the Conduct of the God of Iſrael towards thee will be approved of and adored by all holy Beings in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Syſtem for ever.</q> — "O horrible!" crys Pharaoh. <q>This way of accounting for it, appears to me, infinitely worſe than nothing.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>N. B. If I can heartily approve of the Divine Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Pharaoh, I can juſt as well, towards all obſtinate Sinners.—If I cannot approve of the Divine Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Pharaoh, my Quarrel is not with this or that Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtic Divine; but with the God of Iſrael — And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fault is in God, or in me, will be known by all the World at the Day of Judgment; when the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of all God's Ways will be laid open before the whole intellectual Syſtem. (Rom. ii. 5)—And if ſuch Doctrines tend to make me turn Infidel; I am, at Heart, an Infidel already: Yea, an Enemy to the God that made and governs the World. But to uſe the Words of our Author, — We ought to be diſpoſed to acquieſce in the Account of this Matter which we have from him who cannot err, in the Oracles of Inſpiration" (p 15.) — A Way of accounting for the Divine Conduct, that will afford "Libertines" and all obſtinate Sinners, an "Encouragement" to continue in Sin, which is "infinitely worſe than nothing," as this Author himſelf muſt be ſenſible.</p>

               <p>INDEED, Sir, perhaps it may be the Opinion of all judicious Men, that the <hi>Manichean</hi> Scheme, bad as it is, is ſtill preferable to your's.

Nor can any holy, truly benevolent Being in the Univerſe heartily love him, or cordially acquieſce in his Government: For it is ſtrictly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that <hi>abſolute Evil</hi> ſhould be acquieſced in by a good Being. For it implies a Contradiction. And if all holy Beings ceaſe to love God and acquieſce in his Government, there is an End to all Religion.</p>

               <p>BUT, Sir, I pray you carefully to mind, that I ſay it, and inſiſt upon it, that "Sin is not God's Scheme, but a Device of the Devil." — It is "no Part of God's original Scheme," (p. 13, 14, 15, 16.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>AND I pray, Sir, what do you mean by this Manner of ſpeaking?—Do you mean only, "that it was the Devil that ſinned, and not God? that other wicked Beings ſin, and not God? and that ſinning Creatures act freely, and are ſolely and wholly to blame?"—All this is exactly true; but not at all to your Purpoſe. For the Queſtion is not, Who is it that has ſinned? God, or the Creature? About this there is no Diſpute: The Creature, and none but the Creature, has ſinned. But the Queſtion is, Why did the infinitely wiſe and holy Creator and Governor of the World permit the Creature to Sin, when he could eaſily have hindered it?—To this Queſtion, you ſay nothing; only "that you do not believe that God is obliged to do, or that in Fact he actually does, what is moſt for his own Glory." (p. 13.) Which is really to give up the abſolute Perfection of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
               <p>OR do you mean, "that it was God's original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Deſign, that Sin ſhould never happen? and that God did all he could to prevent it? but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares the Devil laid a Scheme, and over-matched the Almighty; and by Craft or Power brought it in, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all God could do? And ſo God's Scheme was diſconcerted, and he diſappointed, and his World in a great Meaſure ruined, in Spite of the utmoſt Exertion of his infinite Wiſdom and almighty Power!" — Some of your Readers, perhaps, may think this your Meaning. But it cannot be; if you mean to be conſiſtent with your ſelf. For according to this, God did <hi>all he could</hi> to ſecure his own Glory. Which is a Point you do not believe, (p. 13.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:008541_0076_102F68E962DF2790"/>AND yet this muſt be your meaning: or what you ſay, is not at all to the Purpoſe. For if God knew, Sin was likely to happen, and <hi>could</hi> have hindred it, and yet in Fact did not; the whole Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entirely unanſwered; viz. <hi>Why did God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Truth, perhaps, was, you had no diſtinct Meaning at all, in ſaying, that "Sin is not God's Scheme, but a Device of the Devil."</p>

               <p>INDEED, Sir, I was greatly "embarraſſed." (p. 31.) Expreſly to deny, that God permits Sin; I durſt not do. To juſtify his Conduct, I could not. Yea, I eſteemed you guilty of great Vanity and Preſumption in pretending to do it.— It was my Opinion, "that no ſatisfactory Account could be given" of the Divine Conduct in this Affair. (p. 15.) For I imagined, that in very deed God had not in this Affair done that which would have been "moſt for his Glory" to have done. (p. 13.) <note n="*" place="bottom">This Author ſpeaks of "reſting in the natural and eaſy Account we have of this Affair in the ſacred Scriptures. (p. 15.) and of finding Satisfaction and Repoſe therein." Which he ſuppoſes "the Heart of every good Man does." (p. 25.) — But, pray, what Reſt! what Repoſe! what Satisfaction! can he, or any Man of common Senſe, "Good" or "not Good," find in believing, that in this Affair God has done "what was in Fact not moſt for his own Glory?" Which he thinks is the true State of the Caſe.—And when he was ſo "embarraſſed" himſelf, why ſhould he deſire to embarraſs others likewiſe? — And after ſo ſerious and repeated Profeſſions, that he meant to propoſe his Thoughts with the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Humility (p. 5. 13, &amp;c) why did he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſerious Anſwer to the late Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi> his Reaſonings on this Subject, to which I had referred; rather cry out, "boaſted Metaphyſics"?

               <p>HOWEVER, I hope, by this time, you are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, that whether we can find out the Reaſons of the Divine Conduct in this Affair, or no; yet it is of the utmoſt Importance, that we firmly believe, that God has acted wiſely, and in a Manner agreable to all his glorious Perfections.

We may compliment him with the <hi>Name;</hi> but we take away the <hi>Thing.</hi>—"We Chriſtians" (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) <q>ſay, that God can do nothing which is in it ſelf evil, no more than he is able not to be God.

infinitely deſirable, that ſome better Being, ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect Being, might be in his Place and take his Throne.— And ſo your Scheme really juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Spirit of Diſcontent and Rebellion throughout all God's Dominions.—But this ill Idea of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, which is harboured in many a Heart in this apoſtate World, is of the Nature of Blaſphemy, <hi>the abominable Thing which God's Soul hates,</hi> and ought to be entirely rooted out of our Minds.</p>

(p. 15.) I could never ſee how God could do it, conſiſtent with his own Glory or the Good of the Syſtem (p. 12, 13. 19—24.) or conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent even with his own perfect Happineſs: as a Being of infinite Benevolence, I thought, muſt have had "greater Pleaſure," if Sin and Miſery had been for ever unknown in his World. (p. 22.) Therefore, I thought, that "Sin was not God's Scheme, but a Device of the Devil." (p. 13, 14, 15, 16.) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is plain Fact, that God has not hindered the Devil from doing all this Miſchief, as he might eaſily have done, I have been led "to doubt whether God does in Fact, and ſo whether he is obliged," from the abſolute Perfection of his Nature, "to do, what is moſt for his Glory."

               <p>REASON teaches, that God never will, and never can, voluntarily give up the Government of his own World, into the Hands of his greateſt and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Enemy, the Devil. And, if the Devil is one of God's Creatures, as God himſelf has taught us in his Word, he is ſo inferiour to the God that made him, as to be in his Hands as the Clay is in the Hands of the Potter, abſolutely at his Controul; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Power or Policy to bring any thing to paſs, but by the Permiſſion of the great God; who from

Heaven hath declared, ſaying, <hi>My Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my Pleaſure,</hi> (Iſai. xlvi. 10.) And whoſe Schemes cannot poſſibly be diſconcerted, by the united Powers of Earth and Hell. — Nay, the Powers of Darkneſs are ſo entirely at the Controul of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that Satan could not touch holy <hi>Job,</hi> or any Part of his Subſtance, nor ſo much as put a Lie in the Mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s lying Prophets, without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Permiſſion.

How then could the Devil ſeduce our firſt Parents, and break up God's original Plan, and ruin his new-made World; in ſpite of the utmoſt Exertion of infinite Wiſdom and almighty Power!</p>
               <p>THE whole Tenour of Divine Revelation leads us to believe, that the Providence of God extends to all Things which come to paſs. If the Devil or wicked Men were not under the Divine Controul, we ſhould have Reaſon to <hi>fear</hi> them: but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our aſſures us, they cannot hurt an Hair of our Heads, without God's Permiſſion; whoſe Providence extends even to the very <hi>Sparrows,</hi> a Bird ſo inſignificant, that <hi>two of them were ſold for a Farthing:</hi> and much more to the Concerns of Men, who are <hi>of more Value than many Sparrows:</hi> and he enjoins his Diſciples, in the belief of this, not to <hi>fear</hi> the moſt cruel Perſecutors; but to <hi>fear</hi> God only: for, ſays he, <hi>The very Hairs of your Heads are all numbered.

(<hi>Heb.</hi> x. xi. xii.) And in this Light all the People of God, from the very earlieſt Ages, have been wont to view the Injuries they received from wicked Men, as coming from the Hand of God. So <hi>Job,</hi> when the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had robbed him, views them only as Inſtruments uſed by God to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer holy and wiſe Ends. <hi>The Lord hath given; and the Lord hath taken away: bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> (Job i. 21.) So when <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> came againſt Iſrael in the time of the Judges, it was looked upon that <hi>God had ſtrengthened him</hi> to do it, thereby to chaſtiſe them for their Crimes.

And

when <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſeduced by his falſe Prophets to go up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> to Battle, to the loſs of his Life, the whole Plan is repreſented as being laid in Heaven. (1 <hi>King.</hi> xxii.) And when that proud Tyrant, the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Hammer of the whole Earth,</hi> had deſtroyed Jeruſalem, burnt down the holy Temple, and laid all their Country in Ruins, pious People all ſaw the Hand of God in it, and believed, that <hi>at the Commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah,</hi> 2 King. xxiv. 3.—But time would fail, to mention all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Nature recorded in God's holy Word. And ſurely it muſt be needleſs, when, as in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War, we, thro' all <hi>New-England,</hi> have in ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Manner joined univerſally to profeſs and act upon this very Principle; that wicked Men are in the Hands of God, and can do nothing but by his Permiſſion, and are abſolutely at his Controul. For which Reaſon we have had public Faſts, and public Thankſgivings, relative to the War, as thô we firmly believed the univerſal Extent of Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>BUT if the Providence of God extends to the <hi>leſſer,</hi> it much more does to the <hi>greater</hi> Concerns of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Syſtem, as our Saviour reaſons, <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 29, 30, 31. If it extends to the ſinful Actions of Men in this fallen World, which are comparatively but of little Conſequence; much more to the original Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Sin into the moral Syſtem; which was an Affair, ſtrictly ſpeaking, of infinite Conſequence. — If it extends to the Sparrows (one of which was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at but half a Farthing) ſo that they could not any of them <hi>fall on the Ground</hi> without God's all-ſeeing Eye and all-ordering Hand; much more to the <hi>fall of Angels,</hi> and to the <hi>fall of Man,</hi> Beings of <hi>more Value than many Sparrows.</hi>—If the <hi>very Hairs of our Heads are all numbered;</hi> much more is God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about the ſpiritual and eternal Welfare of the whole intellectual Syſtem.— So that we may have the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:008541_0083_102F68FEB9780170"/>
greateſt Aſſurance, that ever ſince the Creation, not one evil Thing has come to paſs, but under the Eye of the OMNISCIENT; determined, permitted, and over-ruled by infinite Wiſdom and perfect Rectitude.— Do you believe this, my Friend? Indeed you muſt believe it with all your Heart,—for this is "the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Account of the Matter." Beſides,</p>
               <p n="2">2. GOD is a Being of abſolute Perfection; infinite in Wiſdom, perfect in Rectitude, boundleſs in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who has an infinite Regard to his own Honour and to the Good of the Syſtem: as Reaſon and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation join to teach. And as, from the abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Nature, it is <hi>impoſſible for God to Lie;</hi> ſo, for the ſame Reaſon, it is impoſſible he ſhould counteract any of his Perfections. Therefore the whole of his Conduct towards the intellectual Syſtem is abſolutely perfect. And is no more capable of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, than God is of becoming holier and wiſer than he is. For he muſt neceſſarily chuſe the beſt Plan from Eternity, and neceſſarily abide by it to Eternity.—For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Scriptures give us the fulleſt Aſſurance, that God <hi>is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever, (Heb.</hi> xiii. 8.) <hi>of one Mind, (Job</hi> xxiii. 13.) <hi>With whom there is no Variableneſs, neither Shadow of Change, (Jam.</hi> 1.17.) and that his <hi>Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure. (Iſai.</hi> xlvi. 10.) So that he never did, and never can, alter his original Plan; or ſuffer himſelf to be diſappointed. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 10, 11.)</p>
               <p>HE laid a Scheme to bring the Iſraelites to the Land of Canaan, and promiſed to do the thing: nor could all their Wickedneſs in the Wilderneſs provoke him to give up the Deſign. Yea, he was diſpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it, juſt as much as if they had not ſinned: as he informed <hi>Balaam,</hi> to the terror of <hi>Balak. God is not a Man, that he ſhould Lie, neither the Son of Man that he ſhould Repent: — he hath not behold Iniquity in Jacob,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:008541_0084_102F69004C250240"/>
neither hath he ſeen Perverſeneſs in Iſrael. (Num.</hi> xxiii. 16—21.)—He had laid a Scheme to continue the Jews his viſible People, until the coming of the Meſſiah, and the ſetting up of the Chriſtian Church: nor could all their Sins before the Babyloniſh Captivity, nor all their Perverſeneſs afterwards, induce him to caſt them off, and give up his Deſign. No. <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> ſays he; <hi>I change not,</hi> I abide by my original Plan: <hi>therefore ye Sons of Jacob,</hi> infinitely provoking as your Conduct is, <hi>are not conſumed. (Mal.</hi> iii. 6.) — <hi>He wrought for his great Name's Sake,</hi> thrô the whole Affair. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> xx.) And his infinite Reſolution to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his glorious Plan, kept him immoveable, and finally carried him through, in Spite of all poſſible Provocations from a moſt ungrateful perverſe People even as he himſelf had declared, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> ix. 7. when ſpeaking of this very thing, he ſays, <hi>The ZEAL of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND, as nothing could ever induce the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble God to alter any of his Plans himſelf; <note n="*" place="bottom">God laid a Scheme to bring the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to Repentance. He ſent <hi>Jonah</hi> to preach, and threaten Deſtruction. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> are brought to Repentance, exactly according to his Deſign. So that he did not alter, but exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his Plan in that Caſe. The ſame may be ſaid of all other Inſtances of the like Kind, recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Which however, are ſometimes, contrary to all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, uſed to prove, that the omniſcient God may, on new Views, alter his Purpoſes; when, in Fact, he would not be <hi>omniſcient,</hi> were he capable of ſo much as <hi>one new Idea.</hi>
                  </note> ſo none of his Creatures were ever able to diſconcert his Schemes. Joſeph's Brethren attempted to do it in one Inſtance, and Pharaoh ſtruggled ſtill much more to do it in another; but in both Caſes all they did was over-ruled to accompliſh the Divine Deſigns, to the beſt Advantage.— God had laid a Scheme to bring the Jews out of the Babyloniſh Captivity back again
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:008541_0085_102F6901CEE1C8B0"/>
to their own Land. The Thing looked, to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible ever to be accompliſhed. They walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Darkneſs, and ſaw no Light: <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and ſtay your ſelves on your God,</hi> ſaid the Almighty, ſpeaking of this very Thing. <hi>For my Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my Pleaſure. (Iſai.</hi> xlvi. 10. &amp; l. 10.)— And if the Almighty would not ſuffer himſelf to be diſappointed in his <hi>leſſer Schemes,</hi> which were of <hi>ſmaller Importance;</hi> much leſs will he ſuffer himſelf to be fruſtrated in his <hi>Grand univerſal Plan,</hi> which is of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater Concern,</hi> and in which his own Honour and the eternal Welfare of the whole Syſtem are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely intereſted.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, if we do but really and firmly believe the abſolute Omniſcience and All-ſufficiency of Him, who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> we cannot but ſee the Reaſon of the Thing; and be ſtill farther aſſured, that he can neither alter any of his Plans himſelf, nor poſſibly be diſappointed by any of his Creatures. For, from Eternity, all poſſible Plans lay open to his View, he had his Choice, he choſe the beſt; and what in all Nature can induce him to alter his Choice, and prefer one not ſo good? Upon after-Conſideration we often have new Thoughts, or view Things in a different Light, and ſo alter our Schemes for the better. But God has not had one new Idea ſince he has been in Exiſtence. From Eternity he exiſted, and from Eternity all Things were perfectly in his View. It is therefore abſolutely impoſſible, he ſhould ever ſee any Reaſon to change his Purpoſes; and equally impoſſible, he ſhould change them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without any Reaſon at all. — And his infinite Wiſdom and almighty Power, whereby he is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely All-ſufficient, and able, with the greateſt Eaſe, to do <hi>according to his Pleaſure, in the Armies of Heaven, and amongſt the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> renders it ſimply impoſſible that any of his Creatures, by Power or
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:008541_0086_102F690639F7EB88"/>
Policy, ſhould be able to diſconcert any of his Schemes. And <hi>this</hi> he knows; — and this lays a ſolid Foundation for his perfect Tranquillity, and compleat Self-Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in the view of <hi>this</hi> he can be perfectly happy, and even without one uneaſy Thought, at the Head of the Univerſe, let the Storms here below riſe ever ſo high. <hi>The Lord on high is mightier than the Noiſe of many Waters, yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea. (Pſal.</hi> xciii. 4.) And <hi>this</hi> renders him a fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Truſt, a ſecure <hi>Refuge</hi> to his People, <hi>tho' the Earth be removed, and the Mountains caſt into the midſt of the Sea. (Pſal.</hi> xlvi. 1—7.) — But this leads me to add,</p>
               <p n="4">4. BE firmly perſwaded of the perfect and unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Happineſs of the holy One of Iſrael. Or in other Words, Believe with all your Heart, that he is, not only in <hi>Name,</hi> but in <hi>deed</hi> and in <hi>truth, over all, God BLESSED FOR EVER.</hi> (Rom. ix. 5.)</p>
               <p>I GRANT, he is of purer Eyes than to behold Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; an infinitely holy and good Being; infinitely engaged to advance his own Honour and the Good of his own World. I grant, that Sin in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infinitely to his Diſhonour, and tends to the utter Ruin of the whole Univerſe. I grant alſo, that to ſet forth God's infinite Abhorrence of Sin, and its Contrariety to his perfect Felicity, &amp; natural Tendency really to put him to Pain and diſtreſs his Heart, God is often ſaid, in the Language of Scripture, to be <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> to be <hi>vexed,</hi> to be <hi>wearied,</hi> to be <hi>tired,</hi> to be <hi>preſſed as a Cart full of Sheaves;</hi> and could Sin finally diſappoint God's glorious Deſigns, and fruſtrate the original Scheme he had in View in the Creation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, break up the Plan on which his Heart was ſo infinitely ſet; could this be, I grant, that he would be not only <hi>leſs happy</hi> (as you inadvertently have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that in Fact he now is, in ſaying, that he would have had "greater Pleaſure," if Things had
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008541_0087_102F690A60CB4380"/>
been otherwiſe, p. 22.) I ſay, not only <hi>leſs happy,</hi> but <hi>really miſerable;</hi> and that to an <hi>infinite Degree:</hi> even equal to his infinite Regard to his own Honour, and to the Good of the Univerſe. — To ſee himſelf diſappointed finally and for ever, in what was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely dear to him; and that in Spite of the utmoſt Exertion of his infinite Wiſdom &amp; almighty Power; and diſappointed by his own Creatures, the Clay in his own Hands; headed by the Devil, his avowed Enemy (were ſuch an Event poſſible) would make him <hi>feel</hi> himſelf not to be Almighty and All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; — not to be God;— not to be King, Supreme and Independent; but to lie at the Mercy of his Creatures; yea, (horrible as the Expreſſion is) to lie at the Mercy of the Devil, the grand Enemy to God and to all Good. Which <hi>Feeling</hi> muſt render the Miſery of ſuch a Being as God is, abſolutely compleat. For if the Devil can break up God's Schemes, juſt when he pleaſes; God is abſolutely at his Mercy, as to the Accompliſhment of any of them.</p>
               <p>So certain, therefore, as we are, that he is, in Fact, <hi>over all God BLESSED FOR EVER;</hi> juſt ſo certain may we be, that <hi>his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure.</hi> And the whole Univerſe ſhall <hi>know that he is the LORD,</hi> and the whole Syſtem <hi>be filled with his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND the Omniſcient Almighty God, perfectly conſcious to all this, perfectly enjoys himſelf, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſuperior to ſo much as one uncomfortable Idea; and without the leaſt Uneaſineſs, in perfect Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, is poſſeſſed of an infinite Degree of Happineſs. Or to expreſs all in one Word, He is <hi>over all God bleſſed for ever.— Of whom, and by whom, and to whom are all things; to whom be Glory for ever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND what if we cannot ſee fully into the Reaſons of the Divine Conduct in the Permiſſion of Sin, ſhall we think he has acted unwiſely? Shall we think he
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008541_0088_102F690BE42AB678"/>
does not mean to do what is beſt? Shall we give up the abſolute Perfection of the Divine Nature? Shall we ungod our Maker? rather than ſuſpect our own Judgment! —Or ſhall we give up our belief of the perfect Happineſs of the infinitely glorious and bleſſed God, and believe him to be a very miſerable Being, rather than to think, that he can be pleaſed with that very Plan, which he has in Fact choſen, before all poſſible Plans? — Or if he is perfectly pleaſed with his own Plan, ſhall we fly in his Face? Charge him with being the Author of Sin? and repreſent the Devil, as the greateſt Saint; and God, as the greateſt Sinner? as you ſeem to have, dear Sir, with dreadful boldneſs, ventured to do. (p. 16, 17.) <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Were it natural to all Mankind, heartily to acquieſce in all the Diſpenſations of Divine Providence, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wiſe, holy, juſt and good, excepting only the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, it would not ſeem ſo likely, at firſt Glance, that the Fault was wholly in us in this Caſe It would be an exempt, ſtrange Caſe. And we might be more at a loſs to account for it. But it is not at all uncommon or ſtrange for Mankind to diſlike the Divine Conduct in other Inſtances, as well as this. — Thus, it is a common Thing for the Croſſes and Troubles of Life to ſit heavy on the Spirits of Mankind. And a general Murmuring goes round the World. And Thouſands think that none meet with ſo much Trouble as themſelves: and that they have good Reaſon to be diſcontented. Yet if they have good Reaſon to be diſcontented, they are not to blame: but the Fault is in God, in whoſe Hand the Rod is, and from whom all our Afflictions come — O how hard is it for many a one under great Afflictions to bring their Hearts ſweetly to approve of the Divine Conduct, and love and bleſs the God that chaſtiſes them! O how difficult to get and maintain that Frame of Spirit, which holy <hi>Job</hi> expreſſed in theſe Words, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away: bleſſed be the Name of the Lord!</hi>—But whence ariſes all this Difficulty? Not from any Fault in God, all whoſe Ways are wiſe, holy, juſt and good. It is really beſt, moſt for the Honour of God and Good of Mankind, that this apoſtate Race, who have rebelled againſt the great King of the Univerſe, turned their Backs upon the God that made them, and are Idolizing the good Things of this World, ſhould be thus chaſtiſed, that they may know, that it is an evil and bitter Thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the Lord, to forſake the Fountain of all Good, and be experimentally convinced that all Ciſterns are broken Ciſterns; and driven to an abſolute Neceſſity to confeſs their Sin, humble themſelves, forſake their Idols, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the only true &amp; living God. But naturally we do not love to have our Hearts humbled, weaned from the World, and to have God for the alone Portion of our Souls. And as we do not like the Ends; ſo we cannot be pleaſed with the Means. Did we like the one, the other might appear full of Wiſdom and Beauty. — If all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence were calculated to render us rich, honourable and happy, in the Fulneſs of all earthly good Things, no Reproach, no Sickneſs, no Loſſes, no Troubles of any Kind, that this World might be our Heaven and our Home, this would ſuit ſuch ungodly, proud, worldly Hearts as ours naturally are: and we could love ſuch a God, and think well of all his Ways. — But alas, beſides all our preſent Troubles, we are ſoon to die, leave this World we are ſo fond of, and to go and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Judge, and receive according to our Deeds. This is ſtill more Shocking. O how glad would many be, if there was no ſuch Thing as Death, and no ſuch Day as the Day of Judgment! — But above all, nothing is ſo dreadful as the eternal Torments of Hell. This ſhocks Thouſands &amp; Millions, and tempts them to call in Queſtion all the Divine Perfections. — Eſpecially, when all this is threatened in God's Law, for the firſt Tranſgreſſion, for the leaſt Sin. (<hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10.)</p>
                     <p>Now, if it is as difficult, to bring our Hearts to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to all this, as to God's permitting Sin; altho' in all theſe Particulars we muſt own God's Conduct is wiſe, holy, juſt and good, or give up the whole of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation at once; have we not great Reaſon to think that there is ſomething amiſs in our own Hearts? Some general Cauſe, which produces all theſe Effects? — And if we are indeed natively Enemies to God in the Temper of our Minds, as the Scriptures teach, it is not ſtrange that we ſhould feel a general Diſlike to all his Ways. If we are blind to his Glory, and regardleſs of his Honour, and unconcerned about the ſpiritual Good of the Syſtem, the beſt Good of God's holy and eternal Kingdom; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached only to our own particular, unholy and merely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſts, it is not ſtrange that we ſhould diſlike the Divine Conduct towards the intellectual Syſtem, as much as the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs did God's Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 5—11.) For althô, in the whole, greater Glory may be brought to God, and greater ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Good to the Syſtem; yet if our Hearts naturally are not ſuited with God's Ends, neither will they be with his Means: And ſo his whole Plan, in Stead of appearing perfect in Wiſdom, Glory and Beauty, may look as dark and gloomy to us, as did the Divine Diſpenſations to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of old. — On the whole, I think we have infinitely more Reaſon to believe, that the Fault is in us, than in God: and that it much better becomes us to ſuſpect our own Hearts, than to "doubt whether God does what is moſt for his own Glory" See theſe Sentiments more enlarged upon in my Sermons (p. 115—121, 192.)</p>

I pray you, lay it down for a Maxim, that Sin is in its own Nature, juſt exactly the ſame abominable odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing, and not one whit the better, becauſe God permits it to be, &amp; becauſe he intended, and becauſe he will overrule it to Good. —And believe it firmly, &amp; act upon it ſteadily, that there is not the leaſt imaginable
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008541_0090_102F2BAAF8BECB60"/>
Reaſon to ſuſpect the Wiſdom of the whole, or of any Part of the Divine Conduct; becauſe we cannot ſee what good Ends he can have in View. — The Truth of both which Obſervations has been at large illuſtrated already.</p>

                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:008541_0091_102F6915ECAE2410"/>Is it not Pride, my Brother, unſufferable Pride, in us, poor contemptible Worms, to get up into the Judgment-Seat, call Almighty God to our Bar, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Conduct, and then boldly pronounce it bad? And publickly tell the World, that he has not done that "which is moſt for his own Glory"? And all, becauſe we cannot ſee the Reaſons of his Conduct; althô we know at the ſame time, that our Views are ſo contracted, that we are no proper Judges; and that is impoſſible we ſhould prove his preſent Plan not to be the beſt?—Yea, to be ſo engaged to ſlur our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Conduct, as to be vexed with a fellow-Worm, who thinks it impoſſible God ſhould act unwiſely, and would therefore ſpeak in behalf of the injured Majeſty of Heaven, and plead his Cauſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to juſtify his Ways to Men? And with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to cry out, "You have no Right to be ſo <hi>violently confident,</hi> that the preſent Scheme is moſt for God's Glory and the Good of the moral Syſtem;" — "I can offer Reaſons ſufficient to balance your's, and make the contrary appear highly probable!" (p. 5, 6.) For I think, I can prove "that in Fact, God does not do what is moſt for his own Glory": And it is "a mere Fallacy" to pretend that he "is obliged to!" (p. 12, 13.)</p>
               <p>I PRAY you, Sir, Give up this impious blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Principle, that "God does not do what is moſt for his Glory." And if you think it Condeſcenſion, pray condeſcend, at leaſt, ſo far as to believe that God knows better than you do; and is infinitely more concerned, than you ever was, to do as well as he knows how. — You would think it an intolerable Reflection, if all your Acquaintance ſhould join to give you this Character, <hi>viz.</hi> that in your daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and even in the moſt important Affairs, you do not make Conſcience of acting according to your beſt Judgment.—O, bluſh, be aſhamed, and be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never open your Mouth to juſtify the impious

Reflection, you have, in the Sight of all the Country, caſt upon the Character of the <hi>holy One of Iſrael.</hi> Leſt, if you allow your ſelf, Pharaoh-like, to oppoſe your Maker, you, in the End, meet the ſame dreadful Fate.</p>
               <p>RATHER, let us ſeek Divine Grace, from the God of all Grace, that our Hearts may be prepared to approve and love the Works and Ways of God, that when they ſhall in the next World more fully open to our View, we may be ready to join the General Aſſembly of Heaven, and cry, "AMEN, HALLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUJAH!" —O, let us get an Heart to love his Law, and to love the Goſpel of his Son, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve the daily Diſpenſations of his Providence; all which, analogous to the whole of his univerſal Plan, are calculated to exalt God, and humble the Creature. And if we can but be heartily reconciled to thoſe Parts of the Divine Government, which are more near to our View; we ſhall be prepared hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to approve of thoſe Parts, which are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; yea, and of the whole.—For it is all of a Piece.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Sinner is at firſt ſavingly converted, he ſees but a very ſmall Part of God's univerſal Plan of Government; but what he ſees, he heartily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and loves.

to his Law, and Goſpel, and common Diſpenſations of his Providence towards Mankind in this World, will, when the whole of God's univerſal Plan is opened to View, feel no Approbation; but rather their Enmity againſt God, and all his Ways, will break out, and rage to Perfection, to eternal Ages.</p>
               <p>Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="6">6. and laſtly, in Stead of indulging a quarelling, cavilling, diſputatious Temper, and ſpending our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time in finding Fault with God's Ways; let us rather ſpend our leiſure-hours, in reading God's holy Word, and in fervent Prayer for Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>IT had been infinitely wiſer for the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs, to have ſpent their Time in Prayer to God, than in murmuring againſt him. Their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions made them ſo blind, that they could not ſee: and then they laid all the Blame upon God. For which, God doom'd them to wander and fall in the Wilderneſs, and never reach the holy Land. — And they were <hi>our Enſamples;</hi> and theſe Things were <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our Inſtruction.</hi>—O, therefore, my Brother, let us in this benighted World, how dark ſoever things appear, not cavil againſt any of the Ways of God; but rather humbly cry to him for divine Grace, to enable us to believe, throughly to believe, that "ſupreme Wiſdom cannot err;" And accordingly, "heartily to acquieſce in the Diſpenſations of ſupreme Wiſdom; and humbly admire and adore, where we cannot fully comprehend;" in a firm Belief that all the Affairs of the Univerſe are by him conducted in ſuch an infinitely perfect Manner, as that when "full Day ſhall be poured on all the Ways and Works of God," they will appear in ſuch a Light as to bring the greateſt Glory to God, and Good to the Syſtem; and

ſo fill all holy Beings with "unſpeakable Joy," and the moſt exalted Thoughts of God. And even be a Source of eternal Inſtruction, and Means of the ſwifteſt Progreſs in Humility, Holineſs and Happineſs, in the intellectual Syſtem for ever and ever.—While all join in eternal Praiſes to the infinitely wiſe God, <hi>of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all Things: To whom be Glory for ever. Amen.</hi>
